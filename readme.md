#prediction folder contains the implementation of stock market volatility prediction using LSTM Neural Network. Keras is used as a wrapper with Tensorflow backend.
#run
cd prediction
python run.python

#detection folder contains the implementation of anomalous time series detection using discrete signal processing. Matlab scripting language is used for the implementation. 
#run
#open the script (deect_anomaly.m) with matlab and click the button run
#from command line
matlab -nodesktop -nosplash -r "detect_anomaly"


#litigation-classifier-and-visualizations folder contains code for huge amount of unstructered data (e.g., litigations) precessing, #classification and visualizations.
