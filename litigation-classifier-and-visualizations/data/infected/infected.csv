in negotiations, entering into exclusive negotiations and confidentiality agreements, and commencing due diligence examination of Regency In a letter dated July 12, 1997, Sun informed Regency management that it proposed to acquire all of Regency\x92s outstanding common stock for $21 per share in cash *Lum is a director of Hawaiian Airlines and serves on that board with John Adams, who is the chairman of both Regency and Hawaiian Airlines, and Richard Matros, who is a director of both companies and the chief executive officer of Regency  Hawaiian\x92s Board of Directors was scheduled

trade in Regency\x92s securities based on anything they had heard the prior evening concerning Regency Adams\x92 warning not to trade was consistent with Hawaiian Airlines\x92 insider trading policy Lum was present when that instruction was given and did not express any objection to assuming such an obligation *Immediately after the board meeting, Lum began buying shares of Regency stock, in

companies in the United States, in connection with a scheme that caused Rent-Way to under-report expenses and substantially inflate reported earnings in 1999 and 2000 In addition, the Complaint charges Rent-Way with corporate reporting and record keeping violations and charges another former employee with record keeping violations  The Commission further announced that, simultaneously with the filing of the Complaint, it settled the charges against three of the defendants and partially settled the charges against the fourth defendant , The Complaint alleges that, during fiscal 1999 and 2000, Rent-Way under-reported a variety of expenses by approximately $60 million Each of Rent-Ways Forms 10-Q and Form 10-K filed in fiscal 1999 and 2000 overstated pre-tax earnings or understated pre-tax loss by between 12%-448% In addition, approximately $35 million in fraudulent entries made to Rent-Ways books and records in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 were discovered prior to any public dissemination of the Companys financial results for that quarter Jeffrey Conway  Conway , Rent-Ways former president, CFO, COO and a director, and Matthew Marini  Marini , Rent-Ways former controller and chief accounting officer, directed the fraudulent scheme Conway directed Marini to meet periodic earnings forecasts that Conway set, and Marini directed lower level employees to make fraudulent entries to Rent-Ways books and records Conway also directed Jeffrey Underwood  Underwood , Rent-Ways former senior vice president in charge of operations, to defer the recording of certain operating expenses at the end of fiscal 1999 and 2000 The effect was to inflate falsely and substantially the Companys financial results  , The defendants are as follows:, <b>Rent-Way<b> is a Pennsylvania corporation with its principal executive offices in Erie, Pennsylvania Its common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange  , <b>Conway<b>, age 45, was the chief financial officer of Rent-Way from February 1992 through September 1999 and president and chief operating officer of Rent-Way from September 1999 until he resigned in December 2000 Conway also served as a director from February 2000 until he resigned in December 2000 Conway is a certified public accountant  , <b>Marini<b>, age 38, was the controller of Rent-Way from October 1995 to December 1999 and the chief accounting officer from December 1999 until he was terminated in October 2000  , <b>Underwood<b>, age 46, was the senior vice president in charge of operations overseeing all of Rent-Ways operations from September 1999 to July 2002  , The Complaint alleges as follows: , Beginning in December 1998, Conway directed Marini to do whatever was necessary to ensure that the Company met its earnings guidance but not to tell Conway how he was meeting the earnings guidance so that Conway could maintain plausible deniability  <i>i e ,<i> the ability to deny direct knowledge of the misconduct  Beginning in December 1999, Marini told Conway the details of his fraudulent conduct and continued to discuss with Conway details of his ongoing efforts to meet the Companys earnings guidance  Conway condoned and encouraged Marinis actions , Marini systematically understated Rent-Ways operating expenses across many corporate-level accounts and also inflated the Companys miscellaneous and other income accounts  Marini accomplished this by directing lower level accounting employees to make unsupported and false entries to the Companys corporate general ledger  , Conway also directed Underwood to defer improperly the recording of certain rental merchandise related losses at the end of fiscal 1999 and 2000 for the sole purpose of meeting the Companys earnings targets  , When the fraudulent scheme began to unravel in October 2000, Conway and Marini took overt steps to conceal the manipulation from the auditors and from other officers of the Company For example, in order to bring a store-level rental merchandise account into balance with the corporate level general ledger that had been manipulated, Marini directed an employee to add back to the store-level point of sale system approximately $16 million in rental merchandise losses that had been written off in an earlier quarter  When the employee refused, Conway directed the employee to follow Marinis instructions Conway also directed another employee to misrepresent to the CFO the true nature of the discrepancy in the accounts, and Conway and Marini later concocted a false explanation of the problem in order to prevent any further investigation by the CFO  , The Complaint further alleges that in May 2000, Conway engaged in illegal insider trading by selling 6,500 shares of Rent-Way stock at a time when he had nonpublic information about the true financial condition of the Company and the fraudulent scheme , The Commission alleges that, as a result of the foregoing, Rent-Way violated Sections 13 a  and 13 b  2  of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934  Exchange Act , and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 promulgated thereunder; Conway and Marini violatedSections 10 b  and 13b-5 of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder, and are also liable as control persons of Rent-Way under Section 20 a  of the Exchange Act for Rent-Ways violations of Sections 13 a  and 13 b  2  of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13; and that Underwood violated Section 13 b  5  of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1  , The Commission seeks a Final Judgment  i  permanently enjoining each defendant from future violations of the securities laws;  ii  ordering Conway to pay disgorgement plus prejudgment interest;  iii  imposing civil penalties against Conway, Marini and Underwood; and  iv  barring Conway and Marini from serving as an officer or director of a public company  , The Company has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins the Company from further violations of the reporting and books and records provisions of the federal securities law In determining to accept Rent-Ways settlement offer, the Commission considered that Rent-Way undertook remedial actions and cooperated with Commission staff  , Defendant Conway has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from further violations of the antifraud, reporting and books and records provisions of the federal securities laws; permanently bars him from serving as an officer or a director of a public company; and orders him to pay $129,350

for the Southern District of New York entered an opinion and order in a civil injunctive action brought by the finding that the following three defendants had violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws: Joseph S  Kemprowski, a purported consultant who performed duties on behalf of Solucorp Industries Ltd  analogous to those of an officer; Peter R  Mantia, the companys president; and Victor Herman, the former chief financial officer of Solucorps principal operating subsidiaries and the preparer of Solucorps consolidated financial statements The Courts opinion and order, which was entered after a full trial on the merits in March 2003, provides for permanent injunctions against Kemprowski and Mantia and a permanent bar on their serving as an officer or director of any publicly traded company The opinion and order also provide that Kemprowski, Mantia and Herman shall disgorge their illicit gains from selling Solucorp shares while in possession of material, non-public information about the fraudulent conduct The final judgment has yet to be entered  , Of the six other defendants named in this action, fiveincluding Solucorp, other former officers andor directors, Arle Pierro, James G  Spartz, and W  Bryan Fair, and the companys former outside auditor, Glenn R  Ohlhauserentered into settlements with the Commission prior to the commencement of the six-day trial pursuant to which they consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws  , The Commissions Complaint, filed on December 13, 1999, as amended, alleged that, over a four year period, from mid-1995 through early 1999, Solucorps senior management, including Kemprowski, who acted as the <i>de facto<i> head of Solucorp, claimed in press releases and other publicly disseminated materials to have contracts that either did not exist or were subject to undisclosed material contingencies, or that provided for revenues materially below those announced by the company The Complaint also alleged that senior management falsified Solucorps financial statements by improperly recognizing as revenue license fees that were subject to material contingencies Solucorps improper recognition of license fees resulted in its filing with the Commission periodic, transition and interim reports, including financial statements, on at least five occasions from December 1997 through April 1999, which materially overstated revenue  <i>See<i> Lit  Rel  No  16388  Dec  13, 1999   , In its July 25, 2003 opinion and order, the Court found that, [o]ver a number of years, Solucorp and its executives engaged in a course of deception through the issuance of false and misleading press releases and financial statements in which, in a number of cases, they reported that the Company had entered into contracts that did not exist, in one case backdated a contract to increase the accrued revenue recognizable thereunder, and in many other cases reported that the minimum revenues to be derived from such contracts far exceeded the actual minimums The Court found that this pattern of deception was so consistent and pervasive that it cannot logically be attributed to mere negligence Accordingly, the executives responsible for the issuance of these press releases and financial statements, specifically Kemprowski, Mantia and Herman, knowingly and deliberately falsified them with the intention of deceiving shareholders and potential investors or, at the very least, were guilty of reckless disregard for the truth or falsity of the disclosures , The Court found that Kemprowski, Mantia and Herman had violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10 b  of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934  Exchange Act  and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 17 a  of the Securities Act of 1933  Securities Act , and that Mantia and Herman had knowingly falsified the companys books, records andor accounts, or were reckless in preparing or certifying them, and circumvented or failed to implement internal controls in violation of Exchange Act Section 13 b  5  and Rule 13b2-1, and Mantia misinformed the companys outside auditors in violation of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-2 The Court also found that Kemprowski and Mantia failed to disclose their equity ownership in Solucorp as of February 20, 1998, the effective date of Solucorps registration of its stock with the Commission, and to timely disclose changes in that ownership, in violation of Exchange Act Section 16 a   , Each of the five defendants who settled the Commissions action prior to the commencement of the trial in March 2003 consented, without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, to the entry of a final judgment providing for the full injunctive relief sought by the Commission On March 12, 2003, the Court signed the final judgments against Solucorp, James G  Spartz, a former vice president and a director of Solucorp, Arle Pierro, a former senior vice president and director of Solucorp, and W  Bryan Fair, a former director of Solucorp The final judgment against Solucorp permanently enjoined the company from violating the antifraud provisions of Exchange Act Section 10 b  and Rule 10b-5 and Securities Act Section 17 a , the reporting requirements of Exchange Act Section 13 a  and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-10 and 13a-13 thereunder, and the books and records and internal controls provisions of Exchange Act Sections 13 b  2  A  and 13 b  2  B  The final judgment against Spartz permanently enjoined him from violating the antifraud provisions of Exchange Act Section 10 b  and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the insider reporting requirements of Exchange Act Section 16 a  and Rules 16a-2 and 16a-3, but did not impose a civil penalty based on Spartzs sworn representations concerning his financial inability to pay The final judgments against Pierro and Fair permanently enjoined them from violating the disclosure rules for insiders, Exchange Act Section 16 a  and Rules 16a-2 and 16a-3 thereunder, and imposed a $10,000 civil penalty on Pierro for allegedly failing to timely disclose her equity ownership in Solucorp and changes in that ownership , On January 16, 2003, the Court entered a final judgment against another settling defendant, the companys former outside auditor, Glenn R  Ohlhauser, that permanently enjoined Ohlhauser from future violations of Exchange Act Section 10A <i>See <i><a hreflitigationlitreleaseslr16785 htm>Lit  Rel  16785<a>  October 31, 2000 ; <a hreflitigationlitreleaseslr17951

DECISION TO CEASE ISSUANCE OF THE 30-YEAR BOND , <i>v  PETER J  DAVIS, JR , JOHN M  YOUNGDAHL and STEVEN E  NOTHERN<i>  United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Civil Action No  03-CV6672 NRB  , The  Commission  today announced three related enforcement actions arising from trading in U S  Treasury 30-year bonds minutes before the Treasury Department announced, on October 31, 2001, that it would no longer issue such bonds  The Treasury Departments announcement had a dramatic market impact, causing the largest one-day price movement in the 30-year bond since October 1987 Goldman Sachs &amp; Company  Goldman Sachs , Massachusetts Financial Services Company  MFS , and Peter J  Davis, Jr , the individual who misappropriated the Treasury Department information that was subject to a news embargo, will pay a total of over $10 3 million to settle the Commissions actions , In a civil suit in federal court in New York, the Commission filed securities fraud charges against:, , , , Davis has entered into a settlement with the Commission Youngdahl and Nothern are contesting the charges , Based on its former employee Youngdahls conduct and on the bond trading that occurred as a result, Goldman Sachs has consented to a Commission administrative order finding that the firm violated the anti-fraud laws applicable to broker-dealers and government securities broker-dealers The Commissions order also finds that Goldman Sachs lacked adequate safeguards to prevent the misuse of material nonpublic information obtained from paid consultants Goldman Sachs will pay over $9 3 million in disgorgement of trading profits, interest, and penalties The order also recognizes that Goldman Sachs promptly notified the Commission staff about the trading that occurred and cooperated with the Commissions investigation , MFS has consented to a Commission administrative order finding that the firm lacked adequate safeguards to prevent the misuse of material nonpublic information obtained from paid consultants MFS will pay a penalty of $200,000 and will reimburse another firm for over $700,000 in trading losses incurred by selling to MFS the bonds that Nothern and the other fund managers purchased The Commissions order also recognizes that MFS promptly notified the Commission staff about the trading that occurred and cooperated with the Commissions investigation , The Commissions complaint against Davis, Youngdahl and Nothern alleges that Davis marketed himself to Wall Street clients by claiming special access that enabled him to get Washington information ahead of the media, and by promising clients the first call on investment issues they care about MFS retained Davis as a consultant sometime between 1995-1997, and Goldman Sachs retained Davis beginning in the spring of 2001 Youngdahl, who advised Treasury Desk traders on economic and political developments, was Davis primary contact at Goldman Sachs Nothern, who managed seven fixed income mutual funds for MFS, was Davis primary contact at MFS , The complaint alleges that, since 1994, Davis had attended the Treasury Departments quarterly refunding press conferences under an explicit agreement that he would honor the news embargo that Treasury imposed until the designated public announcement time At these press conferences, the Treasury Department announced the Federal Governments financing requirements for the coming quarter Notwithstanding his agreement to abide by the news embargo, the complaint alleges that, in July 2001, Davis and Youngdahl agreed in a series of e-mails that Davis would provide Youngdahl with confidential information from the Treasury Departments quarterly refunding press conferences prior to the expiration of the embargo Davis had previously conveyed confidential refunding information to Youngdahl in May 2001, and, pursuant to their July agreement, did so again in August 2001 , The complaint further alleges that, at the October 31, 2001, refunding press conference, Treasury Department officials announced three times that the information being made available was embargoed until 10:00 a m The press conference ended at approximately 9:25 a m Then, Davis, despite the officials warnings, and in violation of his prior explicit agreement to abide by the embargo, placed a series of cell phone calls to his clients, including Youngdahl and Nothern, beginning at 9:28 a m , and told them that the Treasury Department was suspending future long bond issuances The complaint alleges that Youngdahl knew that Davis, pursuant to their July agreement, was tipping him with confidential Treasury Department information before the information was released to the public The complaint also alleges that Nothern knew, from a voice mail which Davis left him and which he listened to, that Davis had learned about the suspension of 30-year bond issuances directly from the Treasury Department, and that the news was embargoed until a scheduled 10:00 a m  press announcement  , The Commissions complaint charges Davis, Youngdahl, and Nothern with violations of Section 10 b  of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934  the Exchange Act  and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks injunctions, disgorgement, and civil money penalties Prior to the filing of the action, Davis consented, without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, to the entry of a permanent injunction from future violations of Section 10 b  of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and a court order that he disgorge $29,598, which represents the amount of consulting fees he received from Goldman Sachs and MFS plus prejudgment interest, and pay a penalty of $120,000 , The Commissions administrative order against Goldman Sachs finds that, because of Youngdahls conduct and the trading that ensued, Goldman Sachs willfully violated Sections 15 c  1  A  and 15 c  1 C  of the Exchange Act and Rule 15c1-2 thereunder, the provisions that prohibit fraud by broker-dealers and government securities dealers The order also finds that Goldman Sachs willfully violated Section 15 f  of the Exchange Act because it did not have written policies and procedures reasonably designed, taking into consideration the nature of the firms business, to prevent the misuse of material nonpublic information During the relevant period, Goldman Sachs, and the Treasury Desk in particular, employed numerous paid consultants who provided a wide range of information and analysis Although Goldman Sachs did have written policies on the proper handling and use of material, confidential information, these policies did not expressly address the use of such consultants or the handling of information obtained from them , Goldman Sachs consented to the Commissions order without admitting or denying the Commissions findings The order censures Goldman Sachs, orders the firm to cease and desist from committing or causing future violations, and orders Goldman Sachs to disgorge $1,742,642 in bond trading profits and prejudgment interest, and to pay a penalty of $5,000,000 In addition Goldman Sachs is undertaking to disgorge $2,562,740 in bond futures trading profits and prejudgment interest The Commissions order also requires Goldman Sachs Legal Department to do a review of the firms policies and procedures and to implement corrective measures to prevent any possible future abuse of material nonpublic information with respect to the use of consultants , The Commissions Order against MFS finds that MFS willfully violated Section 204A of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 because it lacked adequate safeguards to prevent the misuse of material nonpublic information with respect to information obtained from consultants Although MFS retained numerous paid consultants like Peter Davis, the firms written materials on the use of nonpublic information only referenced inside information received from company insiders or their agents, and did not discuss the potential that paid consultants might provide such information Without admitting or denying the Commissions findings, MFS consented to the entry of the Commissions order, which censures MFS, requires MFS to cease and desist from committing or causing future violations, and orders MFS to pay a penalty of $200,000 The order also requires MFS General Counsels office to do a review of the firms policies and procedures and to implement corrective measures to prevent any possible future abuse of material nonpublic information with respect to the use of consultants In addition, MFS is undertaking to reimburse the broker-dealer that sold MFS the 30-year bonds $717,858, representing losses by the broker-dealer from selling 30-year bonds to MFS on October 31, 2001, and prejudgment interest on that amount , The Commission has investigated this matterwhich remains open in coordination with, and acknowledges the cooperation and assistance of, the United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York, which has entered into a plea agreement with Peter Davis and obtained the indictment of John Youngdahl The Commission also acknowledges the cooperation and assistance of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the United States Department of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the United States

Loan Association in Knoxville, Tennessee , Finally, the complaint alleged that Johnson benefited from his fraudulent scheme by avoiding losses or becoming unjustly enriched by selling MERL stock and using material nonpublic information concerning MERLs accounting irregularities and true financial condition , Although he resigned as Chief Executive Officer, Chairman of the Board and President of MERL shortly after this civil enforcement action commenced, Johnson continues with the company as a consultant and an advisor to the board of directors His wife, G  Carol Johnson, is the acting President of MERL , The Court will hold further proceedings concerning remedies The Commission seeks to enjoin Johnson permanently from violating Section 17 a  of the Securities Act, Section 10 b  of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and seeks civil monetary penalties against Johnson The Commission further seeks to bar Johnson permanently from serving as an officer or director of any public company and also seeks under section 603 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 to bar him permanently from any future participation in the offering of any penny stock Finally, the Commission seeks disgorgement, prejudgment interest and penalties from Johnson for his insider trading , <i>http:www sec govlitigationlitreleaseslr18618 htm<i><br><!

Kenneth L  Lay, former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Enron Corp , for violating, and aiding and abetting violations of, the antifraud, periodic reporting, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws  [Section 17 a  of the Securities Act of 1933  Securities Act  and Section 10 b  of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934  Exchange Act , and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, and for aiding and abetting the violation of Sections 13 a , and 13 b  2  A  and  B  of the Exchange Act, and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20 and 13a-11] In this action, the Commission is seeking disgorgement of all ill-gotten gains, civil money penalties, a permanent bar from acting as a director or officer of a publicly held company, and an injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws , The Commission today, subject to the approval of the Honorable Melinda Harman, U S  District Court Judge, filed a Second Amended Complaint seeking to add Lay to its pending action against Jeffrey K  Skilling, Enrons former President, CEO and Chief Operating Officer, and Richard A  Causey, Enrons former Chief Accounting Officer The proposed Second Amended Complaint alleges that Lay and others engaged in a wide-ranging scheme to defraud by falsifying Enrons publicly reported financial results and making false and misleading public representations about Enrons business performance and financial condition In addition, the proposed Second Amended Complaint alleges that Lay profited from the scheme to defraud by selling large amounts of Enron stock at prices that did not reflect its true value The sales also occurred while Lay was in possession of material non-public information concerning Enron and generated unlawful proceeds in excess of $90 million during 2001 Specifically, Lay sold over $70 million in Enron stock back to the company to repay cash advances on an unsecured Enron line of credit In addition, while in possession of material non-public information, Lay amended two program trading plans to enable him to sell an additional $20 million in Enron stock in the open market Lays proceeds from the sales constitute illegal gains resulting from his scheme to defraud , Specifically, the Commissions Proposed Second Amended Complaint alleges as follows:, Lays Early Participation in the Scheme to Defraud Lay, along with others at Enron, engaged in a wide-ranging scheme to defraud in violation of the federal securities laws During 2001, with specific knowledge of rapidly deteriorating performances of Enrons business units, Lay made numerous false and misleading public statements about Enrons financial condition As Enrons Chairman and CEO, Lay had oversight of Enrons business units and supervised the senior executives and managers of these units, reviewed drafts of public filings and draft press releases, and participated in conference calls with investment analysts , In presentations to the investing public, Lay and others heavily emphasized the performance and potential of Enron Broadband Services  EBS  and Enron Energy Services  EES  To support what Enron had already said about EES, Lay and others concealed massive losses in EES business through fraudulently manipulating Enrons business segment reporting They accomplished this at the close of the first quarter of 2001 through a reorganization designed to conceal the magnitude of EES business failure, which was known to Lay as early as January 2001 With Lays approval, Enron hid that failure from the investing public by moving large portions of EES business - which Lay and others knew at the time would have to otherwise report hundreds of millions of dollars in losses - into Enron Wholesale, which was the Enron business segment housing most of the companys wholesale energy trading operations and income As Lay and others knew, Enron Wholesale had ample earnings to absorb the EES losses, while at the same time continuing to meet its own internal budget targets Lay made the false and misleading statements to persuade investors that Enrons profitability would continue to grow, to maintain credit ratings, to influence investment analysts, and to prop up the share price of Enron stock , Lay knew of Enrons use of structured transactions - specifically prepays and the infamous Raptors - to misstate its financial results Enron entered into circular transactions that were characterized as prepay forward contracts in order to disguise borrowings as cash from operations Lay was aware of the importance and magnitude of prepay transactions to create operating cash flow and thereby maintain Enrons investment grade credit rating Lay was aware that the credit rating agencies were not told the magnitude of Enrons prepay obligations and that this information was not disclosed in Enrons public filings  In addition, Enron created the Raptor structures to hedge volatile assets against any potential decline in value The manner in which Enron structured and funded the Raptors meant that any hedging losses in the Raptors would ultimately be borne by Enron  Lay understood that Enron used the Raptors for earnings management and that decreases in the price of Enron stock threatened the viability of the Raptors , Lay Knowledge of Additional Problems Following Skillings Resignation On July 13, 2001, Skilling unexpectedly told Lay he was resigning because he felt there was nothing he could do to stop the decline in Enrons stock price On August 14, Enron issued a press release, with Lays approval, that announced Skilling had resigned for personal reasons In a conference call with investment analysts later that same day, Lay repeatedly asserted that, there are absolutely no problems that had anything to do with Jeffs departure       there are no accounting issues, no trading issues, no reserve issues       unknown, previously unknown problems, issues       I can honestly say that the company is probably in the strongest and best shape       that its probably ever been in Regarding EES, Lay offered that weve been doubling revenue and doubling income quarter on quarter, year on year for now about the last three years We expect that to continue to grow very, very strong       , After Skilling resigned, Lay met repeatedly with Enrons senior management, who described for him Enrons deteriorating financial condition Lay was advised internally of accounting improprieties regarding the Raptors and that various assets and investments were overvalued on Enrons books and records by approximately $7 billion During this period, Lay repeatedly received internal financial reports consistent with these problems In August and September, senior executives informed Lay that Enron was facing an increasing earnings shortfall, hundreds of millions of dollars in losses, a proposed non-recurring charge relating to certain investments, and an accounting error in excess of $1 billion Enrons problems were so severe that a senior executive informed Lay that Enron needed to consider being acquired or selling its prized pipelines , Lay Continued to Mislead the Public - August and September 2001 Despite specific knowledge of Enrons deteriorating financial condition, Lay continued to make false and misleading public statements about Enrons financial performance In meetings with research analysts and in public statements, Lay falsely and misleadingly stated there were no accounting issues, no reserve issues, and no other shoes to fall at Enron Lay made a series of false and misleading statements during an Enron employee online forum, including that: [t]he third quarter is looking great We will hit our numbers We are continuing to have strong growth in our businesses, we have record operating and financial results, and the balance sheet is strong In addition, Lay misled Enron employees regarding his purchases of Enron stock when he informed them that he had purchased additional shares over the last couple of months In making this statement, Lay concealed that he had made net sales of over $20 million in Enron stock in the preceding two months , The October 16, 2001 Third Quarter Earnings Release In a meeting with other senior executives one month prior to Enrons third quarter earnings release, Lay learned that Enron had incorrectly accounted for the Raptor transactions, and as a result, Enron shareholders equity would be reduced by $1 2 billion Lay also knew that the Raptors were being terminated and combined with other pending write-downs that would result in an earnings charge of $1 01 billion Specifically, Lay knew that these two items - the $1 01 billion earnings charge and the $1 2 billion reduction of shareholder equity - were unrelated, and that the reduction to shareholders equity was required whether or not the Raptors were terminated Lay reviewed and approved Enrons earnings release that reported a nonrecurring earnings charge of $1 01 billion, a majority of the charge  $544 million  relating to the early termination of the Raptors Lay knew that the characterization of the termination of the Raptors as nonrecurring losses was erroneous and inconsistent both with advice Enron had received from its auditor and Enrons past treatment of Raptor earnings as recurring operating earnings Lay and others intentionally omitted any reference to the $1 2 billion equity reduction from the press release In a conference call with analysts to discuss the earnings release, Lay falsely stated that in connection with the early termination of the Raptors, Enrons shareholders equity would be reduced by $1 2 billion Lay did not disclose, as he knew, that the reduction was principally due to a significant accounting error, as opposed to the termination of the Raptors , Lays Last Ditch EffortsOctober and November 2001 In an effort to calm deepening public concern regarding the decline in Enrons stock price, Lay participated in conference calls with analysts and others In these calls, Lay made false and misleading statements regarding Enrons financial health For example, Lay stated, [Enron is] not trying to conceal anything Were not hiding anything, and [w]ere really trying to make sure that the analysts and the shareholders and the debt holders really know whats going on here So, we are not trying to hold anything back In a telephone call with a prominent credit rating agency, Lay falsely stated that Enron and its auditors had scrubbed the companys books and that no additional write-downs would be forthcoming In fact, Lay knew that Enron was carrying its international assets at billions in excess of their fair value and that Enron had failed to disclose a $700 million goodwill impairment In an all-employee meeting to reassure Enrons employees, Lay falsely described Enrons liquidity, stating that [o]ur liquidity is fine As a matter of fact, its better than fine, its strong     At the time he made the statement, Lay knew that Enron had been forced to offer its prized pipelines as collateral for a $1 billion bank loan and that the only source of liquidity was a $3 billion line of credit, which was fully utilized on Lays authority In addition, Lay made misleading statements about Enron stock and its prospects Lay misleadingly stated, as sad as the current market price is       [b]ut were going to get it back and that doesnt mean we cant get back up to the $80s or $90s in the not-too-distant future At the time he made the statement, with Enron stock trading at less than $20 per share, Lay did not disclose that he had quietly sold over $65 million of Enron stock back to the company during 2001 , Lays Sales of Enron Stock Back to Enron From January 25, 2001 to November 27, 2001, Lay took advances on a non-collateralized $4 million line of credit with Enron in the total amount of $77,525,000 Thereafter, in twenty separate transactions, Lay repaid the credit line by selling $70,104,762 worth of Enron stock back to the company, at prices he knew did not accurately reflect Enrons true financial condition For example, after learning of Enrons undisclosed plan to hide over $500 million in EES losses in ENA, Lay sold 1,086,571 shares of Enron common stock back to the company, in 11 transactions, for a total of $34,081,558 Following Skillings resignation on August 14, 2001, at a point when Lay was learning more about Enrons deteriorating financial condition, Lay sold 918,104 shares of Enron common stock back to the company, in five transactions, totaling $26,066,474 As Lay tried to prop up Enrons stock price following Enrons third quarter earnings release on October 16, 2001, Lay sold 362,051 shares of Enron stock back to the company, in four transactions, totaling $6,050,232 Enrons shareholders and employees, much less the public, did not learn of Lays sales of Enron stock back to the company until February 2002, over two months after Enron filed for bankruptcy protection , Lay also made withdrawals from his line of credit totaling $7 5 million between October 24 and November 27, 2001, at a point when Enrons financial condition was crumbling , Lays Sales of Enron Stock Pursuant to Amended 10b5-1 Plans On November 1, 2000, Lay established two program sales plans under Commission Rule 10b5-1 Subsequently, Lay amended both plans At the time Lay amended both plans, he was in possession of material nonpublic information concerning Enrons deteriorating financial condition, meaning Lay cannot use the plans as a defense to insider trading charges Under the amended plans, Lay unlawfully sold over 350,000 Enron shares for total proceeds in excess of $20 million , The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Enron Task Force  , The Commissions investigation is continuing , <img alt border0 height9 srcimagesarrowright_dkblue gif width10> <a hreflitigationcomplaintscomp18776 pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter<a>,  ,

former CEO, John Hashman of Danville, Calif ; former President and Chief Operating Officer Yinzi Cai of Palo Alto, Calif ; former Controller, Douglas Wachtel of San Francisco, Calif ; and former Chief Financial Officer, Bruce Rigione of New Canaan, Conn The complaint, which was filed in federal district court in San Francisco, also charges Lent, Hashman, Cai and Wachtel with insider trading, based on their sale of NextCard stock at inflated prices during the course of the fraud Lent sold approximately $7 million worth of NextCard stock, Hashman sold $321,000, Cai sold $423,000 and Wachtel sold $105,000 Lents stock sales were carried out through the Lent Family Trust, which is also named in the complaint as a relief defendant , The complaint alleges that NextCard failed to disclose to investors reclassifications or changes in its accounting methodology for late paying and uncollectible loans in its earnings releases and periodic reports for the fourth quarter of the 2000 fiscal year and the first and second quarters of 2001 In addition, the complaint alleges that for the second quarter of 2001 NextCard changed its methodology for calculating reserves for its uncollectible loans This change reduced the amount of reserves the company had to set aside to cover expected losses on its loans by 15% to 25%, and artificially inflated the companys reported net income for the second quarter of 2001 , According to the complaint, in October 2001 the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency  OCC , which regulated NextCards subsidiary, NextBank, required NextCard to reverse the reclassifications and changes in accounting methodology On October 31, 2001, NextCard issued a press release stating that it was changing its accounting for uncollectible loans and that the OCC considered NextBank to be significantly undercapitalized NextCards stock price fell 84% that day, and the company went into bankruptcy the following year , The Commissions complaint charges the defendants with committing and aiding and abetting fraud in violation of Section 10 b  of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934  Exchange Act , and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as aiding and abetting NextCards violations of the same statue The complaint also charges Lent, Hashman, Rigione and Wachtel with aiding and abetting NextCards violations of the reporting provisions of the Exchanges Act, Section 13 a  and 13 b  2  A  of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder Further, Lent, Hashman, Cai and Wachtel are charged in the complaint for violations of Section 17 a  of the Securities Act of 1933  Securities Act  and for insider trading in violation of Section 10 b  of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder The complaint also charges Lent, Hashman and Cai as control persons for NextCards violations of Section 10 b  of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder andHashman and Lent as control persons for NextCards violations of Section 13 a  and 13 b  2  A  of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder , This is the second action brought by the Commission as a result of the financial fraud at NextCard In September 2003, the Commission charged three former employees of NextCards independent auditors, Ernst and Young  E&amp;Y , for altering and destroying E&amp;Ys working papers for the fiscal year 2000 audit of E&amp;Y client NextCard, Inc , The Commission acknowledges the assistance and cooperation of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency , <img alt border0 height9 srcimagesarrowright_dkblue gif width10> <a hreflitigationcomplaintscomp18905 pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter<a>,  , <i>http:www sec govlitigationlitreleaseslr18905 htm<i><br><!

Stephen C  Jones  Jones  As alleged in the Commissions complaint, during its fiscal years 1998 through 2001, Dollar General engaged in fraudulent or improper accounting practices in violation of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles  GAAP  which ultimately resulted in a restatement of Dollar Generals financial statements in January 2002 The restatement reduced the Companys pre-tax income by approximately $143 million, or about 30 cents per share, over the restated period , The Commissions complaint alleges that Dollar Generals misconduct included: 1  intentionally underreporting at least $10 million in import freight expenses for the Companys fiscal year 1999;  2  engaging in an $11 million sham sale of outdated, essentially worthless, Omron cash registers in the Companys fiscal year 2000 fourth quarter;  3  overstating cash accounts;  4  manipulating the Companys reported earnings through the use of a general reserve or rainy day account;  5  failing to maintain accurate books and records and filing inaccurate financial reports with the Commission; and  6  failing to maintain adequate internal accounting controls The complaint further alleges that some of the fraudulent or improper accounting practices were effected by, or known to, former senior executives and accounting personnel, including Turner, Burr Sanderson and Carpenter and were motivated in part by a desire to report earnings that met or exceeded analysts expectations and to maintain employee bonuses  , The complaint alleges that, with regard to import freight expenses in 1999 and 2000, Dollar Generals accounting staff determined that the Company should have recognized $13 4 million in freight expenses in fiscal 1999 Rather than recognizing all the expense in fiscal year 1999, Sanderson, Burr, and Carpenter discussed possible ways to account for the $13 4 million in freight expenses that did not entail recognizing all such expenses in fiscal year 1999 On February 5, 2000, Sanderson sent a memorandum to Carpenter, Burr and others describing a $10 million variance in relation to freight expenses, and Dollar Generals intention to charge the $10 million 1999 shortfall at a rate of $833,000 per month during Dollar Generals fiscal year 2000 At a meeting in March 2000, attended by Carpenter and Turner among others, Sanderson explained that the freight expenses would be gradually expensed in fiscal year 2000 All three individuals knew that deferring the bulk of the expenses to fiscal year 2000 avoided the negative impact on already announced fiscal year 1999 earnings as well as year-end bonus payments to Dollar General employees, including Sanderson, Burr, and Carpenter Turner was informed that the freight expenses relating to activity in Dollar Generals fiscal year 1999 were being recorded in 2000, but Turner did not override the decision The Commissions complaint alleges that, by deferring the freight expenses, Dollar General met certain targets, including an internal target for employee bonuses and analysts expectations for the Companys earnings per share for fiscal year 1999 If Dollar General had recognized the freight expenses in 1999, it would have fallen short of the bonus target and analysts expectations , The Commissions Order finds that Sanderson directed Jones to record the freight expenses in the following manner: 1  write off $4 million of the freight expenses in fiscal year 1999; and  2  recognize the remaining $9 4 million over the course of fiscal year 2000 on a monthly basis In an attempt to hide part of the improper deferral from the Companys auditors, Sanderson directed Jones to move $1 3 million of the $9 4 million to the miscellaneous accrued liabilities account, widely known at Dollar General as the Rainy Day Fund, and $2 7 million of the $9 4 million to corporate bank clearing accounts Neither of these accounts had any connection to freight expenses Jones knew that this accounting treatment was improper, but he nevertheless followed Sandersons instructions , Separately, the complaint also alleges that, by February 26, 2001, Turner knew of serious allegations concerning Sanderson and was reckless in not knowing that these issues were likely to impact the integrity and accuracy of Dollar Generals financial statements Nevertheless, on February 26, 2001, Dollar General held a conference call announcing its unaudited financial results for fiscal 2000 that Turner knew had been prepared by, among others, Sanderson , Simultaneously with the filing of the Commissions complaint, and without admitting or denying its allegations, Dollar General consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of the antifraud, books and records, internal controls, and periodic reporting provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically, Section 17 a  of the Securities Act of 1933  Securities Act , Sections 10 b , 13 a , 13 b  2  A  and 13 b  2  B  of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934  Exchange Act  and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13 thereunder In addition, Dollar General will pay one dollar in disgorgement and a civil penalty of $10,000,000 , Turner, Sanderson, and Carpenter also have each agreed to settle the case against them without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint Each has agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud, books and records and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws  Sections 10 b  and 13 b  5  of the Exchange Act and Rules

13 b  2  B  of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-11 thereunder  Sanderson and Carpenter also each agreed to be enjoined from violating Section 17 a  of the Securities Act and the provision prohibiting making false or misleading statements to auditors  Rule 13b2-2  and from aiding and abetting certain other reporting violations  Exchange Act Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13  In addition, Turner agreed to be enjoined from directly or indirectly controlling any person who violates the antifraud, books and records, internal control and periodic reporting provisions of the federal securities laws  Sections 10 b , 13 a , 13 b  2  A  and 13 b  2  B  of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13 and 13b2-1 thereunder   , In addition to the injunctive relief, Turner agreed to pay $1 in disgorgement and a civil penalty of $1,000,000, Carpenter agreed to pay $143,455, comprising $33,000 in disgorgement, $10,455 in prejudgment interest and a civil penalty of $100,000, and Sanderson agreed to pay $270,595, comprising $150,000 in disgorgement, $45,595 in prejudgment interest and a civil penalty of $75,000 Carpenter also agreed to be barred permanently from serving as an officer or director of a public company and Sanderson agreed to be barred for a period of five years , The settlements are subject to court approval The Commission expects that the penalties from the settling defendants will be distributed pursuant to the Fair Fund provisions of Section 308 a  of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002  , Separately, Jones consented, without admitting or denying the Commissions findings, to the entry of a Commission Order pursuant to which he is ordered to cease and desist from committing violations of the antifraud, books and records and internal controls provisions of the securities laws  Section 17 a  of the Securities Act, Sections 10 b  and 13 b  5  of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder , and from causing violations of the books and records, internal controls and periodic reporting provisions of the securities laws  Sections 13 a , 13 b  2  A , 13 b  2  B  of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder  The Commissions Order also finds that Jones, a certified public accountant, engaged in improper professional conduct within the meaning of Rule 102 e  1  ii  of the Commissions Rules of Practice and that he willfully violated and aided and abetted the violation of provisions of the federal securities laws within the meaning of Rule 102 e  1  iii  Accordingly, the Order denies Jones the privilege of appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant with a right to apply for reinstatement after three years , Burr, Dollar Generals former CFO, has not reached a settlement with the Commission In its complaint, the Commission charges Burr with insider trading, violating the antifraud, books and records and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws and aiding and abetting the books and records, periodic reporting and internal controls provisions of the securities laws The Commission seeks against Burr a permanent injunction against future violations, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest thereon, and civil penalties In addition, the Commission seeks an officer and director bar against Burr  , <img alt border0 height9

Over $1 2 Million in Penalties, Disgorgement and Prejudgment Interest<h2>]","[On April 11, 2006, the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee entered a settled final judgment against Brian Burr  Burr , former chief financial officer and executive vice president at Dollar General Corporation  Dollar General   Burr was the only litigating defendant in the Commissions action filed on April 7, 2005 against Dollar General and several of its former officers and employees for alleged accounting fraud that overstated Dollar Generals earnings  In settling with the Commission, Burr consented, without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, to the entry of a final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay $1,204,598 17 in civil penalties, disgorgement, and prejudgment interest, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years , In its complaint the Commission alleged that, in 1999 and 2000, Dollar Generals accounting staff determined that Dollar General should have recognized $13 4 million in import freight expenses in fiscal 1999  Rather than restating prior periods, as required by GAAP, or recognizing all the expense in fiscal year 1999, Burr participated in discussions of possible ways to account for the $13 4 million in freight expenses that did not entail recognizing all such expenses in fiscal year 1999  The complaint further alleged that on February 5, 2000, Dollar Generals former controller sent a memorandum to Burr and others describing a $10 million variance in relation to freight expenses, and Dollar Generals intention to charge the $10 million 1999 shortfall at a rate of $833,000 per month during Dollar Generals fiscal year 2000  Ultimately, Dollar General recorded the shortfall in this manner  Burr knew that deferring the bulk of the expenses to fiscal year 2000 avoided the negative impact on already announced fiscal year 1999 earnings as well as year-end bonus payments to Dollar General employees, including Burr  The Commissions complaint alleges that, by deferring the freight expenses, Dollar General met certain targets, including an internal target for employee bonuses and analysts expectations for the Companys earnings per share for fiscal year 1999  If Dollar General had recognized the freight expenses in 1999, it would have fallen short of the bonus target and analysts expectations , The complaint further alleges that Burr engaged in insider trading  After Dollar General terminated Burr in February 2001, Burr and his counsel met with Dollar General senior management  At this meeting, on April 12, 2001, Burrs counsel told Dollar General management that Burr could not sign a separation agreement until he knew that certain accounting issues were addressed by Dollar General  Burr also wanted a release from the Company for any responsibility for certain accounting issues  On April 5, 2001, Burr exercised Dollar General options at $17 5360, and immediately sold 126,597 Dollar General shares at sales prices ranging from $22 50 to $22 84  Burr exercised additional Dollar General options on April 27, 2001, selling 5,000 Dollar General shares at prices from $24 to $24 02  After the Companys April 30, 2001 press release announcing accounting irregularities and the necessity for a restatement, Dollar Generals stock price dropped from its Friday, April 27, 2001 closing price of $23 00 to a Tuesday, May 1, 2001 closing price of $15 76  The complaint alleges that Burr avoided losses by his sale of Dollar General securities , Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, the Court permanently enjoined Burr from violating the antifraud, internal controls, books and records and lying to auditor provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically, Section 17 a  of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10 b  and 13 b  5  of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934  Exchange Act  and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder  The Court also enjoined Burr from aiding and abetting violations of the periodic reporting, internal controls, and books and records provisions of the Exchange Act, specifically, Sections 13 a , 13 b  2  A  and 13 b  2  B  of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder  The Court further ordered Burr to pay $1,204,598 17, comprising $494,824 in disgorgement, $143,950 17 in prejudgment interest, and civil penalties of $565,824  The Court also prohibited Burr from acting as an officer or director of a public company for five years  Dollar General and four other individuals have previously settled the Commissions actions against them

its pending action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging new charges against members of an international insider trading ring that netted at least $6 7 million in illicit gains  The new charges add a fourteenth individual defendant, Jason Smith  Smith , age 29, a resident of Jersey City, New Jersey and a letter carrier with the U S  Postal Service  The new charges allege that, while serving on a federal grand jury investigating Bristol-Myers Squibb Co   Bristol-Myers , Smith leaked information about the proceedings to co-defendants Eugene Plotkin  Plotkin  and David Pajcin  Pajcin , who traded in Bristol-Myers securities based on the information  By leaking the information, Smith violated grand jury secrecy rules and his oath as a grand juror , As alleged in the Complaint, beginning in early 2005, Smith was serving on a federal grand jury in the District of New Jersey convened to investigate potential accounting fraud involving Bristol-Myers and certain officers of that company  Plotkin and Pajcin set up a scheme with Smith in which Smith leaked information about the grand jury proceedings to Pajcin and Plotkin in order to enable them to trade on this non-public information  Among other things, Smith communicated to Plotkin and Pajcin that it appeared as if a high-ranking Bristol-Myers officer would be indicted, and based on that information, Plotkin and Pajcin traded in an attempt to profit on the negative information, initially in an account in Pajcins name and later, in a foreign account in the name of his aunt, defendant Sonja Anticevic  Anticevic   Plotkin and Pajcin also tipped Plotkins father, defendant Mikhail Plotkin, and defendant Henry Siegel  Siegel , in return for a share of their trading profits  Later, a day before the announcement of a deferred prosecution agreement with Bristol-Myers that did not include an indictment of the high-ranking officer, Smith tipped Plotkin and Pajcin that the grand jury had decided not to return an indictment against the high-ranking officer  Based on this tip, Plotkin and Pajcin caused various accounts to liquidate or cover their positions in an attempt to avoid losses , This Complaint follows three prior complaints filed by the Commission which charged insider trading resulting in at least $6 7 million of illicit gains from two other schemes orchestrated by Plotkin and Pajcin  In the first scheme, Stanislav Shpigelman  Shpigelman , a mergers and acquisitions analyst at Merrill Lynch, provided Plotkin and Pajcin with information about pending mergers and acquisitions deals on which Merrill Lynch was working, prior to the time such information became public in exchange for a share of the profits made from trades based on this information  In the second scheme, Plotkin and Pajcin recruited two individuals, first Nickolaus Shuster, and later Juan C  Renteria, Jr , to obtain employment at a printing plant which prints <i>BusinessWeek<i> magazine for the sole purpose of stealing advance copies of the magazine before it was distributed to the public  Plotkin and Pajcin then traded on the basis of a market moving column in the magazine and tipped others to trade in exchange for a percentage of their trading profits  In total, Plotkin and Pajcin traded in at least 26 stocks within one year based on inside information obtained through these schemes  Todays Complaint alleges that Smith provided Pajcin with some funding for Pajcins and Plotkins other insider trading schemes, and Plotkin and Pajcin agreed to provide Smith with a percentage of Pajcins trading profits based upon information derived from this scheme, as well as other insider trading schemes , To date, the Commission has charged 14 individuals located in the United States and Europe for their roles in the scheme  Todays filing adds Smith as a defendant  A description of the other defendants is available in the Commissions litigation release dated April 11, 2006, <a hreflitigationlitreleases2006lr19650 htm>http:www sec govlitigationlitreleases2006lr19650 htm<a> , The Commission alleges that, as a result of trading in various securities on the basis of material, non-public information obtained pursuant to the grand jury and other schemes, the defendants engaged in illegal insider trading in violation of Section 10 b  of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that defendants Smith, Pajcin, Plotkin, Anticevic, Siegel, and Mikhail Plotkin also violated Section 17 a  of the Securities Act of 1933 by virtue of their insider trading in Bristol-Myers  In addition, the Commission alleges that defendants Plotkin, Pajcin, and Shpigelman violated Section 14 e  of the Exchange Act and Rule 14e-3 thereunder by trading in the stock of a company while in possession of material, non-public information related to a cash tender offer for such companys stock  Among other things, the Complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, the disgorgement of all illegal profits plus prejudgment interest, the imposition of civil monetary penalties, and orders requiring the defendants to repatriate to the United States proceeds of the fraud in accounts outside the United States , The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York, the United States Attorneys Office for the District of New Jersey, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation  The Commission also acknowledges the assistance of the Financial Supervisory Authority in Denmark, the Financial Market Authority in Austria, the Croatian Securities Commission, and the Financial Services Authority in the United Kingdom , For information about earlier developments in this

second quarter 2001 Form 10-Q and relevant 2001 Form 4 filings , The Commissions complaint alleges the following: In 1999, Enron sold an interest in a troubled power project in Cuiaba, Brazil to a related party called LJM1, a partnership controlled by Enrons then Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Fastow, to deconsolidate the project  to take the asset off of its balance sheet  and recognize related earnings   Fastow also controlled a second related party, a partnership called LJM2   In conformity with relevant accounting rules, deconsolidation and earnings recognition were not appropriate because the seller  Enron  did not transfer to the buyer  LJM1  the usual risks and rewards of ownership, in that the sale included an oral side agreement that LJM1 would not lose money  The oral side agreement was neither memorialized in the deal documents nor disclosed to Enrons auditor  In 2001, Enron bought back LJM1s Cuiaba interest in satisfaction of the oral side agreement  Under the terms of the buyback, Enron paid LJM1 a profit despite the fact that LJM1s investment had decreased in value  The complaint alleges that Mintz knew, or was reckless in not knowing, of the oral side agreement and knowingly or recklessly directed the documenting and closing of the buyback in fulfillment of the oral side agreement , The complaint further alleges that Mintz knowingly or recklessly failed to disclose Enrons buyback of LJM1s Cuiaba interest as a currently proposed transaction in Enrons 2000 Proxy Statement  filed March 27, 2001 , when he knew of, and was responsible for, the execution of the buyback agreement on March 28, 2001, the day after Enrons 2000 Proxy Statement was filed  The complaint also alleges that Mintz and Rogers knowingly or recklessly failed to

materially false andor misleading representations to Enrons auditor concerning Enrons second quarter 2001 Form 10-Q  The complaint alleges that Mintz reviewed and approved misrepresentations to be made to Enrons auditor so the auditor would sign off on the statement in the Form 10-Q that Fastow sold his interests in the LJM partnerships and those partnerships were no longer related parties to Enron  The specific misrepresentations were that there were no unfulfilled obligations, commitments, contingencies or special arrangements between Enron and the LJM entities related to the sale of Fastows LJM interests, and there were no pending transactions between the LJM entities and Enron for which the terms were negotiated and agreed to prior to the effective date of the sale of Fastows LJM interests  Mintz knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that these representations were materially false andor misleading because, among other reasons, Mintz knew  a  from documenting and closing the Cuiaba buyback, that the Cuiaba buyback had been pending since, and its terms were negotiated and agreed to, in March 2001, and  b  the LJM entities continued to have a commitment or special arrangement with Enron whereby the LJM entities used Enron employees, equipment and facilities to conduct LJM business during the third and fourth quarters of 2001 , According to the complaint, by

in the securities of Tempur-pedic International, Inc  and Acxiom Corporation , The SEC alleges that Chen Tang of Fremont, Calif , learned non-public information as the CFO of a private equity fund and from illegal tips by his brother-in-law, who was the CFO of a venture capital fund  Tang and his trading partners, which included his brother and four friends, traded on the inside information through their personal brokerage and retirement accounts, the accounts of their spouses, children and relatives, and the accounts of several privately-offered investment funds that Tang and three of his friends managed , The complaint alleges that Tang learned confidential information in 2008 about an impending surprise pre-announcement that Tempur would not meet its earnings forecast  Tang illegally tipped the information to three of his friends — Joseph Seto of San Francisco, Ming Siu of Hayward, Calif , and Zisen Yu of Fremont  Tang and his friends began establishing short positions in Tempur securities and purchasing put option contracts that would only be profitable to the traders if Tempurs stock price declined  When Tempur made its pre-announcement, its stock price declined 37 percent and the traders closed all their short positions, garnering illegal profits of approximately $1 2 million , The SEC alleges that Tang also became aware of plans by his firm to make a large, market-moving purchase of Tempur securities in the days following the pre-announcement  Based on this inside information, Tang and his friends purchased Tempur securities just before and during the transaction  On the same day that the firm completed its acquisitions of Tempur stock, Tang and his trading partners began selling their Tempur stock holdings  During the two-day period of the firms stock purchases, Tempurs stock price increased approximately 18 percent  When they closed their positions, Tang and his friends obtained illegal profits of more than $800,000  During all relevant periods and at the time he traded, Tang was under express instructions from his firm not to trade Tempur securities , The SEC also alleges that Tang separately received illegal trading tips in 2007 from his brother-in-law Ronald Yee, who also lives in Fremont  In his role as CFO at a venture capital fund, Yee learned that his firm planned to submit a bid to acquire Acxiom  Months later, after Acxiom and his firm had publicly announced a merger agreement, Yee learned that the deal was in jeopardy  As soon as Yee learned about each of these matters, in breach of his duties to the firm, he passed material, non-public information to Tang  Tang then tipped Seto, Siu and Yu as well as his brother James Tang of San Gabriel, Calif , and Yees brother Eddie Yu of Fremont , According to the SECs complaint, Yee did not make any trades himself  But Tang and each of the others bought Acxiom securities based on Yees initial tip about his firms bid, and some of them took short positions in Acxiom based on the later tip that the deal was in jeopardy  Collectively, they realized profits of more than $6 million from their insider trading in Acxiom securities , The complaint alleges that the Defendants violated Section 10 b  of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder  The complaint also alleges that Defendants Chen Tang, Ronald Yee, Zisen Yu , Ming Siu, and Joseph Seto violated Section 17 a  of the Securities Act of 1933  The complaint requests that the court permanently enjoin the Defendants from future violations of the federal securities laws, and order them to disgorge ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest and pay financial penalties  The complaint also names Venture Associates Fund I, Tang Capital Partners, Acceleration Capital Partners, American Pegasus Long Short Fund Segregated Portfolio, Ping Lee Tang, Ka Ling Lee, Yin Lee Ka, Cheung-Ting Ka, Sylvia Tsui, Doi Ping Siu, Yuen-Lai Ma, Leung-Kee Siu, Rosalie Cho, and two minor children of Chen Tang as relief defendants in order to recover ill-gotten gains in their possession , The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Chicago Board Options Exchanges Options

6323,22140,2011,"[<h3>SEC Files Insider Trading Charges Against Rajat Gupta, Brings New Charges Against Raj Rajaratnam<h3>]","[On October 26, 2011, the charged former McKinsey &amp; Co  global head Rajat K  Gupta with insider trading for illegally tipping convicted hedge fund manager Raj Rajaratnam while serving on the boards of Goldman Sachs and Procter &amp; Gamble  P&amp;G   The SEC also filed new insider trading charges against Rajaratnam after first charging him with insider trading in October 2009 , According to the SECâs complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan, Gupta illegally tipped Rajaratnam with insider information about the quarterly earnings of both Goldman Sachs and P&amp;G as well as an impending $5 billion investment in Goldman by Berkshire Hathaway at the height of the financial crisis  Rajaratnam, the founder of Galleon Management who was recently convicted of multiple counts of insider trading in other securities stemming from unrelated insider trading schemes, allegedly caused various Galleon funds to trade based on Guptaâs inside information, generating illicit profits or loss avoidance of more than $23 million , The SECâs complaint alleges that Gupta provided his friend and business associate Rajaratnam with confidential information learned during board calls and in other communications and meetings relating to his official duties as a director of Goldman and P&amp;G  Rajaratnam used the inside information to trade on behalf of certain Galleon funds, or shared the information with others at his firm who caused other Galleon funds to trade on it ahead of public announcements by the firms  During this period, Gupta had a variety of business dealings with Rajaratnam and stood to benefit from his relationship with him , According to the SECâs complaint, Gupta while serving as a Goldman board member tipped Rajaratnam about Berkshire Hathawayâs $5 billion investment in Goldman and Goldmanâs upcoming public equity offering before that information was publicly announced on Sept  23, 2008  Based on this inside information, Rajaratnam arranged for Galleon funds to purchase more than 215,000 Goldman shares  Rajaratnam later informed another participant in the scheme that he received the tip on which he traded only minutes before market close  Rajaratnam caused the Galleon funds to liquidate their Goldman holdings the following day after the information became public, making illicit profits of more than $800,000 , The SEC also alleges that Gupta tipped Rajaratnam to inside information about Goldmanâs positive financial results for the second quarter of 2008  There was a flurry of calls between Gupta and Rajaratnam on the evening of June 10, 2008, after Gupta learned from Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein of the firmâs quarterly earnings results, which were significantly better than analyst consensus estimates  The following morning, minutes after the markets opened, Rajaratnam caused Galleon funds to start purchasing Goldman securities including 7,350 out-of-the-money Goldman call options and 350,000 Goldman shares  Rajaratnam liquidated these positions on or around June 17 â the date when Goldman announced its quarterly earnings â generating illicit profits of more than $18 5 million for the Galleon funds , The SECâs complaint further alleges that Gupta tipped Rajaratnam with confidential information that Gupta learned during an Oct  23, 2008, board posting call about Goldmanâs impending negative financial results for the fourth quarter of 2008  Mere seconds after the board call ended, Gupta tipped Rajaratnam, who then arranged for certain Galleon funds to begin selling their Goldman holdings shortly after the financial markets opened the following day until the funds finished selling off their holdings, which had consisted of more than 150,000 shares  In discussing trading and market information that day with another participant in the insider trading scheme, Rajaratnam explained that while Wall Street expected Goldman to earn $2 50 per share, he heard the prior day from a Goldman board member that the company was actually going to lose $2 per share  As a result of Rajaratnamâs trades based on inside information provided by Gupta, the Galleon funds avoided losses of more than $3 6 million , The SECâs complaint additionally alleges that Gupta illegally disclosed to Rajaratnam inside information about P&amp;Gâs financial results for the quarter ending December 2008  Gupta participated in a telephonic meeting of P&amp;Gâs Audit Committee at 9 a m  on Jan  29, 2009, to discuss the planned release of P&amp;Gâs quarterly earnings the next day  A draft of the earnings release, which had been mailed to Gupta and the other committee members two days before the meeting, indicated that P&amp;Gâs expected organic sales would be less than previously publicly predicted  Gupta called Rajaratnam in the early afternoon on January 29, and Rajaratnam shortly afterwards informed another participant in the insider trading scheme that he had learned from a contact on P&amp;Gâs board that the companyâs organic sales growth would be lower than expected  Galleon funds then sold short approximately 180,000 P&amp;G shares, making illicit profits of more than $570,000 , The SECâs complaint charges each of the defendants with violations of Section 10 b  of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17 a  of the Securities Act of 1933  The complaint seeks a final judgment permanently enjoining the defendants from future violations of the above provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to disgorge on a joint and several basis their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and ordering them to pay financial penalties  The complaint also seeks to permanently prohibit Gupta from acting as an officer or director of any registered public company, and to permanently enjoin him from associating with any broker, dealer or investment adviser , The SEC previously instituted an <a hrefnewspress20112011-53 htm>administrative proceeding against Gupta<a><a nameP12_6195><a> for the conduct alleged in todayâs enforcement action, but later <a hreflitigationadmin201133-9249 pdf>dismissed those proceedings<a><a nameP12_6290><a> while

trading investigation centering on Galleon, the multi-billion dollar New York hedge fund complex founded and controlled by Rajaratnam , The SEC has now charged 29 defendants in its Galleon-related enforcement actions, which have alleged widespread and repeated insider trading at numerous hedge funds, including Galleon, and by other professional traders and corporate insiders in the securities of more than 15 companies  The insider trading generated illicit profits totaling more than $90 million ,  , <i>http:www sec govlitigationlitreleases2011lr22140 htm<i><br><!

complaint, from 2003 to 2007, Todd Farha, former Chief Executive Officer, Paul Behrens, former Chief Financial Officer, and Thaddeus Bereday, former General Counsel,  collectively, “the Defendants” , devised and carried out a fraudulent scheme that deceived the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration  “AHCA”  and the Florida Healthy Kids Corporation  “Healthy Kids”  by improperly retaining over $40 million in health care premiums the company was statutorily and contractually obligated to spend on certain health care services or reimburse to the state agencies As a result of the scheme, WellCare recorded the retained amount as revenue, which materially inflated its net income and diluted earnings per share  “EPS”  in its public financial statements , As alleged in the complaint, WellCare received premiums from AHCA and Healthy Kids that WellCare was required, by contract and by statute, to spend on certain eligible health care services for low-income plan participants If WellCare spent less than a certain percentage of the premiums on eligible health care services, it was required to refund some or all of the difference to the State of Florida According to the complaint, the Defendants devised a scheme to evade the state’s regulatory framework and fraudulently retain the premiums by, among other methods, funneling the premiums through an internal subsidiary

WellCare reduced the refunds it paid to AHCA by approximately $35 million and to Healthy Kids by approximately $6 million  , The excess premiums retained by the Defendants went straight to WellCare’s bottom line WellCare materially misstated its net income and EPS in filings with the Commission and in quarterly and annual earnings releases from 2004-2006 and the first two quarters of 2007 On January 26, 2009, WellCare filed its Form 10-K for 2007 and restated its financial results for those time periods The Restatement reduced WellCare’s reported net income and EPS by approximately 14%

the Defendants sold approximately 1 6 million WellCare shares into the public market for gross proceeds of approximately $91 million The Commission alleges that the Defendants sold these shares on the basis of the material, nonpublic information that they were conducting a fraudulent scheme that impacted WellCare’s financial results, caused false and misleading statements, and imperiled the

inside information with cash payments made in installments to avoid any scrutiny of large cash withdrawals , The SEC alleges that Cupo’s friend Michael Castelli along with Lawrence Grum, who attended high school with Castelli, were the primary traders in the scheme Among the ways that Castelli and Grum tried to hide their illegal conduct was by compiling binders of research to serve as a false basis for their trading They actively traded in Celgene securities to create a pattern of long-standing positions in the stock Grum reassured Cupo that discovery of the scheme and consequent legal action was unlikely due to limited government resources to police insider trading activity Grum said, “At the end of the day, the SEC’s got to pick their battle because they have a limited number of people and huge numbers of investors to go after ” , The other two traders charged are Lazorchak’s high school friends Michael T  Pendolino and James N  Deprado, who now live in New Hampshire and Virginia respectively The others live in New Jersey In a parallel criminal action, the U S  Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey today announced criminal charges against Lazorchak, Cupo, Foldy, Castelli, Grum, and Pendolino , According to the SEC’s complaint filed in U S  District Court for the District of New Jersey, the scheme began in late 2007 when Lazorchak and Cupo, who were friends and colleagues at Sanofi, discussed Lazorchak’s new position at Celgene where he’d have access to nonpublic information about mergers and acquisitions Lazorchak told Cupo that he was initially working on Celgene’s possible acquisition of another pharmaceutical company, Pharmion Cupo discussed Lazorchak’s position with Castelli, a friend with whom he attends winemaking club meetings Castelli brought in Grum, who he considered a sophisticated trader with knowledge of the securities industry Castelli and Grum devised the scheme in which Lazorchak tipped Cupo with nonpublic Celgene-related information Cupo, as the middleman, tipped Castelli and Grum so they could illegally trade Castelli and Grum paid Cupo for his tips, and gave Cupo money to pass along to Lazorchak for the initial tips Lazorchak never knew the identities of Castelli or Grum, but was aware that Cupo was passing confidential Celgene information to other traders  , The SEC alleges that Lazorchak’s high school friend Foldy entered the scheme in 2007, when Lazorchak tipped him with confidential details about the impending merger between Celgene and Pharmion, and Foldy illegally traded on the information prior to the public announcement of the deal Lazorchak and Foldy devised and used code phrases while conversing to identify instances when Lazorchak was passing inside information or Foldy was seeking more details After the illegal trading occurred and Foldy obtained illicit profits of $14,500, Lazorchak repeatedly demanded that Foldy compensate him for the inside information Foldy ultimately paid Lazorchak at least $500 and later returned the favor with illegal tips of confidential information about a tender offer involving his employer, Stryker Corp Lazorchak acted as a middleman and did not trade, instead tipping Pendolino so he could trade on the nonpublic information Pendolino in turn tipped Deprado, who also traded Lazorchak additionally tipped Cupo, who did not trade but acted as a middleman and tipped Castelli and Grum, who both traded  , The SEC alleges that Cupo began tipping inside information about his employer in late 2009, when he learned that Sanofi was planning to announce a tender offer to acquire another pharmaceutical company, Chattem Inc Cupo learned of the imminent tender offer a few days prior to the public announcement, he tipped Castelli and Grum with the confidential details, and they both traded on the nonpublic information , The SEC alleges that each of the defendants violated Sections 10 b  and 14 e  of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder and that Castelli and Grum violated Section 17 a  of the Securities Act of 1933 The SEC is seeking permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, financial penalties, and officer and director bars for Lazorchak, Cupo, and Foldy ,  ,  , <i>http:www sec govlitigationlitreleases2012lr22535 htm<i><br><!

6874,22807,2013,[<h3>SEC Charges Former Qualcomm Executive and His Financial Advisor with Insider Trading Through Secret Offshore Accounts<h3>],"[The today charged a former executive vice president at Qualcomm Inc  and his former financial advisor with insider trading ahead of major announcements by the San Diego-based wireless technology company for more than a quarter-million dollars in profits , The SEC alleges that Jing Wang, a former executive vice president and president of global business operations at Qualcomm, used a secret offshore brokerage account to make illegal trades based on confidential information that he learned on the job   Gary Yin, a former registered representative at Merrill Lynch, helped Wang set up the account   Yin also created a secret offshore account of his own and traded on the non-public information gleaned from Wang   When Wang eventually realized that insider trading in the offshore accounts still may be discovered by the SEC or other regulators, he concocted a plan to conceal his trading activity by claiming the trades were made by his brother   Wang even convinced Yin to travel to China and go over the account statements with Wang’s brother so he could explain the trades if asked by investigators , In a parallel action, the U S  Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of California today announced criminal charges against Wang and Yin , According to the SEC’s complaint, Wang and Yin became friends in 2005 as members of the same church   When Wang learned that Yin was a financial advisor at Merrill Lynch, he asked Yin to manage his money and opened a number of brokerage accounts at the firm’s San Diego branch office   Each account was disclosed to Qualcomm because, as a company officer, Wang was restricted in his ability to trade Qualcomm stock and required to pre-clear all Qualcomm trades with the company   , The SEC alleges that in early 2006, Wang approached Yin about hiding cash transactions   Yin suggested that Wang create an entity registered in the British Virgin Islands  BVI  and use the name of a non-U S  citizen family member as the beneficial owner   Then he could open a brokerage account in the newly created entity’s name   Yin then helped Wang set up a secret account in the name of a BVI company called Unicorn Global Enterprises, and Wang’s older brother was listed as the owner   Yin similarly created his own BVI-registered entity named Pacific Rim and put it in his mother-in-law’s name   Yin opened a Merrill Lynch brokerage account for Pacific Rim and used it to hide funds that he was using for investments , The SEC alleges that Wang and Yin used their secret offshore accounts to trade on material, non-public information that Wang learned as an executive at Qualcomm   In early 2010, Wang was aware that Qualcomm executives were planning a board proposal to increase Qualcomm’s quarterly dividends and request authority to initiate a stock repurchase program   Qualcomm informed Wang and all executives that they would not be permitted to trade Qualcomm stock   On March 1, Wang attended a Qualcomm board meeting where the quarterly dividend increase and stock repurchase were approved   Wang immediately instructed Yin to use all of the funds in the offshore Unicorn account to purchase Qualcomm stock   Yin knew that Wang did not pre-clear these trades and realized that the purchase was out of character for Wang because he previously never purchased Qualcomm stock on the open market in his Merrill Lynch accounts   Within the hour of executing the trades for Wang, Yin himself bought Qualcomm stock on the basis of the material, non-public information   The stock price increased 6 7 percent after Qualcomm publicly announced the quarterly cash dividend and stock repurchase program   Wang and Yin profited when they sold all of their shares <br>   <br> According to the SEC’s complaint, Wang used the funds from that sale to conduct insider trading again – this time in the shares of San Jose-based Atheros Communications, which was the highly confidential target of a planned acquisition by Qualcomm  Wang was regularly briefed on the transaction internally tabbed as “Project Tango” to protect its confidentiality   Wang instructed Yin to sell all of his Qualcomm stock in the Unicorn account on Dec  2, 2010, and prepare to buy as many shares of Atheros stock as possible with the funds in that account   He told Yin that he was leaving on a trip to China and would contact him to execute the Atheros trade   On December 6, Wang attended a Qualcomm board meeting in Hong Kong and a resolution was passed to pursue the acquisition  Wang learned that Qualcomm planned to acquire Atheros at $45 per share   Wang and Yin immediately communicated several times through phone calls and a text message, and Wang then purchased the maximum number of shares he could purchase with the existing funds in the Unicorn account at prices between $34 and $35 per share   At Wang’s encouragement, Yin also purchased Atheros stock for himself in his offshore account   When the news became public in early January, Atheros stock increased more than 20 percent   Yin sold all of his Atheros shares in the Pacific Rim account on January 12, and Wang sold his Atheros shares in the Unicorn account on January 25 , According to the SEC’s complaint, Wang took his next insider trading step merely four minutes after selling the Atheros stock, using the proceeds to purchase Qualcomm shares in advance of a company announcement that it would raise its revenue and earnings guidance for the 2011 fiscal year   Wang had learned the confidential information prior to the board meeting he attended in Hong Kong, where Qualcomm’s better-than-expected first quarter financial performance was further discussed   Wang learned that Qualcomm planned to announce its earnings results on January 26, and thus purchased his Qualcomm shares the day before the announcement   After Qualcomm issued a press release to announcing its positive first quarter results, Qualcomm’s stock increased 5 9 percent , The SEC alleges that Wang made more than $244,000 in illegal profits through the insider trading scheme, and Yin realized gains of more than $27,000   Wang eventually realized that his illegal trading may be detected by Merrill Lynch or others   Wang first asked Yin to delete records of the trades in the Unicorn account, but because they were permanent records in Merrill Lynch’s systems they could not be erased   Around January 2012, Wang directed Yin to establish a new BVI corporation named Clearview Resources and open a new account at Merrill Lynch to which they transferred the insider trading proceeds in the Unicorn account to further distance Wang from the suspicious trades   A few months later, Wang informed Yin that the trades may have been detected because the SEC had subpoenaed his e-mails   So Wang devised a cover story and convinced Yin if ever questioned to say that the Atheros trades were made by Wang’s brother   Because Yin had never communicated with Wang’s brother, Wang instructed him to travel to China with the Unicorn account statements and review the trades with his brother so he could explain the trading if asked   Yin did so in May 2012   To further hide Wang’s ownership of the Unicorn account and his link to the Atheros trades, Yin removed the Unicorn account from Wang’s “household” in Merrill Lynch’s computer system in July 2012  “Householding” is a function used by Merrill Lynch to link related accounts    , The SECs complaint charges Wang, who lives in Del Mar, Calif , with violating Sections 10 b  and 16 a  of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 16a-3   Yin, who lives in San Diego, is charged with violating Section 10 b  of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5   The SEC’s complaint seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, financial penalties, and permanent injunctions   The SEC also seeks an officer-and-director bar against Wang  , The SEC’s investigation has been conducted by Ann C  Kim, Wendy E  Pearson, Nina Yamamoto, and Finola H  Manvelian of the Los Angeles Regional Office   The SEC’s litigation will be led by Sam Puathasnanon   The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Department of Justice’s Criminal Division, the U S

used vague, complex, and meaningless legal and financial terms designed to deceive the investors into believing that he offered legitimate investments; misrepresented that extraordinary returns of up to 1,000 percent within as little as 60 days were possible with little risk to principal; lied to investors that their principal would be collateralized with cash or semi-precious gemstones; and lied that their money would remain safe in escrow with attorneys pending the completion of certain steps in the transaction , In the second scheme, also purportedly involving investment in prime bank paper, Cooper offered to participate as an investor in the purchase and trade of a $100 million bank guarantee on the condition that all investor funds were pooled in an attorney client trust account Cooper sent a forged escrow agreement, purportedly from an attorney, containing wiring instructions for the attorney client trust account The wire instructions, however, were for an account controlled by Cooper, not an attorney acting as escrow agent The four investors unwittingly deposited a total of $925,000 in the phony escrow account which was, in fact, for Cooper’s company Dream Holdings, after which Cooper misappropriated the funds , In March 2012 Cooper and his company REOP participated in a third scheme involving the sale of a purported Brazilian sovereign bond Cooper claimed that, in exchange for a $50,000 “fee”, he would locate a buyer for the bond and open an account at a registered broker-dealer, which Cooper claimed was necessary to sell the bond Cooper forged a letter that purported to be from the broker-dealer indicating that the bond had been “accepted” by the broker-dealer Based upon this letter, the deceived investor paid Cooper’s $50,000 “fee” , According to the SEC’s complaint, Cooper used the investor money to pay personal expenses, buy cars, pay associates in the scheme, and fund frequent gambling junkets to casinos in Las Vegas and Atlantic City , The SEC’s complaint alleges that, despite his offering and selling of securities, Cooper has never been registered with the SEC to sell securities  , The SEC’s complaint alleges that Cooper and his companies violated the antifraud and broker-dealer registration provisions of the federal securities laws Specifically, the complaint alleges that they each violated Section 17 a  of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10 b  of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; that Cooper aided and abetted violations of Securities Act, Section 17 a  and Exchange Act Section 10 b  and Rule 10b-5; and that Cooper also violated Exchange Act Section 15 a  The SEC seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest thereon, and civil penalties against each defendant  , Also on September 27, 2013, the SEC charged California attorney David H  Frederickson, a sole practitioner, and his law firm The Law Offices of David H  Frederickson, with aiding and abetting Cooper’s prime bank scheme in two transactions in 2010 and 2011 , According to the SEC’s complaint filed separately in the U S  District Court for the District of New Jersey, Frederickson served as escrow agent for two of Cooper’s prime bank transactions, and provided letters to investors stating that their investments were secured by collateral owned by Cooper’s company Global Funding Systems LLC Frederickson did nothing to verify the value, authenticity, or ownership of the collateral, which Cooper claimed to be seven sapphires valued at $376 million The SEC’s complaint also alleges that by the time Frederickson served as escrow agent for the second of these investors, Frederickson had learned facts indicating that Cooper had affixed Frederickson’s electronic signature to a forged escrow agreement that caused investor funds to be diverted to another Cooper company instead of being sent to Frederickson’s escrow account Moreover, Frederickson told this second investor that he had served as escrow agent for Cooper in numerous other successful bank instrument trading transactions In fact, none of the bank instrument trading transactions had been successful , Frederickson earned a total of $6,790 in escrow fees for these transactions and for a transaction involving an escrow agreement Cooper forged, for which Frederickson provided no escrow services These fees were paid from the funds of the defrauded investors  , Without admitting or denying the SEC’s allegations, Frederickson and his firm agreed to settle the case against them The settlement is pending final approval by the court Specifically, Frederickson and his firm consented to the entry of a final judgment that  1  permanently enjoins each of them from violating or aiding and abetting violations of Section 17 a  of the Securities Act and Section 10 b  of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5;  2  permanently enjoins each of them from providing professional legal or escrow services in connection with, or from participating directly or indirectly in, the issuance, offer, or sale of securities involving bank guarantees, medium term notes, standby letters of credit, structured notes, and similar instruments, provided, however, that such injunction shall not prevent Frederickson from purchasing or selling securities listed on a national securities exchange; and<b> <b> 3  orders them to pay, jointly and severally, disgorgement and prejudgment interest totaling $7,257, and a civil penalty in the amount of $25,000, for a total of $32,257 , As part of the settlement, and following the entry of the proposed final judgment, Frederickson, without admitting or denying the Commission’s findings, has consented to the entry of a Commission order pursuant to Rule 102 e  3  of the Commission’s rules of practice permanently suspending him from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an attorney , The SEC’s complaints in these matters allege fictitious investments involving so-called bank guarantees, “stand-by letters of credit,” or foreign “trading platforms,” among other purported investment vehicles Investors who are offered investments similar to those alleged in the Commissions complaint should consult the SECs website concerning Warning to All Investors about Bogus Prime Bank and Other Banking-Related Investment Schemes, at: <a hrefdivisionsenforceprimebank shtml target_top>http:www sec govdivisionsenforceprimebank shtml<a> ;

Thacher acted as legal counsel to Sirius, Eydelman acknowledged to the middleman, Nice trade The middleman told Metro following the announcement that he had set aside approximately $7,000 for Metro as a thank you for the information Instead of taking the money, Metro told the middleman to leave it in his brokerage account and invest it on Metros behalf based on confidential information that he planned to pass him in the future  , According to the SECs complaint, Metro tipped and Eydelman traded on inside information about 12 more companies as they settled into a routine to cloak their illegal activities Metro shared confidential nonpublic information with the middleman by typing on his cell phone screen the names or ticker symbols of the two companies involved in the transaction

research about the target company He eventually e-mailed the research to the middleman along with his purported thoughts about why buying the stock made sense The contrived e-mails were intended to create what Eydelman and the middleman believed to be a sufficient paper trail with plausible justification for engaging in the transaction , The SECs complaint charges Metro and Eydelman with

and incorrect - media speculation about potential acquirers of Lawson Software and possible merger prices  Soon thereafter, Lawson Software publicly confirmed an acquisition offer from Infor for $11 25 per share  Nevertheless, ensuing media and analyst reports still incorrectly suggested that other potential purchasers would likely enter the bidding and submit competing higher offers for Lawson Software  Some reports suggested a merger price of up to $15-16 per share  In reality, the same companies being speculated as potential purchasers already had informed Lawson Software that they weren’t interested in an acquisition  But fueled in part by the reports, Lawson Software’s stock price closed at $12 24 per share on March 14 - nearly $1 higher than Infor’s offer of $11 25  The stock price had increased approximately 23 percent since the March 8 article  , The SEC alleges that Richard Lawson knew that these media and analyst reports were inaccurate and the very entities mentioned as possible acquirers had in fact told the company they were not interested  He knew that Infor was the lone bidder and would not increase its offer  Richard Lawson also knew that Lawson Software’s financial adviser and board of directors viewed Infor’s bid as reasonable  After Richard Lawson tipped his brother and Cerullo with nonpublic information about the planned deal, they proceeded to sell their shares at approximately $1 per share higher than the eventual merger price of $11 25  Following the merger announcement on April 26, Lawson Software’s stock price dipped to $11 06 per share at market close  The merger became effective in July 2011  , Richard Lawson agreed to settle the SEC’s charges by paying a penalty of $1,557,384 57 for tipping his brother and Cerullo  The penalty amount is equivalent to the ill-gotten gains received by William Lawson and Cerullo  Richard Lawson also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company  William Lawson agreed to pay disgorgement of $1,853,671 28, prejudgment interest of $162,442 60, and a penalty of $1,853,671 28 for a total of $3,869,785 16  William Lawson’s disgorgement amount includes the ill-gotten gains of the other trader who he suggested sell shares  Cerullo agreed to pay disgorgement of $178,481 29, prejudgment interest of $15,640 81, and a penalty of $178,481 29 for a total of $372,603 39  Without admitting or denying the SEC’s allegations, the Lawsons and Cerullo agreed to the entry of final judgments enjoining them from future violations of Section 17 a  of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10 b  of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5  The settlement is subject to court approval  , <img alt border0 height9 srcimagesarrowright_dkblue gif width10><a hreflitigationcomplaints2014comp-pr2014-93 pdf>SEC Complaint<a>,  , <i>http:www sec govlitigationlitreleases2014lr22989 htm<i><br>]",1
