The Commission filed related charges against Schuman on June 1, 2015., Schuman is among numerous defendants who have been alleged to have engaged in criminal activity in the midst of an undercover FBI operation.  According to the charges filed in U.S. District Court in various cases since December 2011, the schemes involved secret kickbacks to an investment fund representative in exchange for having the investment fund buy stock in certain companies; the kickbacks were to be concealed through the use of sham consulting agreements. What the insiders and promoters did not know was that the purported investment fund representative was actually an undercover FBI agent., In a judgment entered on December 29, 2015, Schuman was sentenced to one year of probation and was ordered to forfeit $22,500 after pleading guilty on May 20, 2014 to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud., On June 1, 2015, the Commission filed charges of securities fraud against Schuman, alleging that he used kickbacks to engage in fraudulent financing transactions involving the microcap company of which he was President and CEO.  In that matter, Schuman consented to cease and desist from further violations of the antifraud provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, be prohibited from acting as an officer or director of certain public companies for a period of five years, and be barred from participating in any offering of penny stock with the right to reapply after five years., For further information, see Exchange Act Release No. <a href=/litigation/admin/2015/34-75082.pdf>75082</a> (June 1, 2015) (settled order instituting proceedings).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2016/lr23441.htm</i><br/>]"

The sentence is to be served consecutive to any sentence imposed in a related state criminal matter.

In reality, Bliss lost more than $3 million day-trading and failed to use all of the investor funds for his stated purpose of day-trading.  At the SECs request, the court imposed an asset freeze against Bliss., The SEC thereafter learned that Bliss concealed his ownership of a catamaran sailboat and secretly transferred possession to his brother-in-law, Kevin Fortney.  After the SEC moved for civil contempt against Bliss for violating the asset freeze, both Bliss and his brother-in-law, who was not charged in the SECs enforcement action against Bliss, filed sworn declarations that the sailboat was owned by the brother-in-law and not by Bliss.  In an order issued on August 14, the court found Bliss in contempt of the asset freeze order and referred the matter to the U.S. Attorneys Office for the District of Utah for potential criminal charges and, in August 2015, a grand jury indicted Bliss.

The SECs complaint, filed June 8, 2015, alleges that Andrade, a former bank director at Bancorp Rhode Island, Inc. engaged in insider trading when he illegally tipped three friends and business associates about the banks potential acquisition by another bank.  The complaint also alleges that Rampino engaged in insider trading by purchasing stock based on Andrades illegal tip., Defendants Andrade and Rampino challenged the sufficiency of the complaint by claiming that the Commission had not alleged the elements of an insider trading action and in particular, had not alleged that Andrade personally benefitted from providing the tip or that Rampino knew about that benefit.  In denying the motion, the Court noted, [i]t is hard to imagine a case with better alleged circumstantial evidence of insider trading, including allegations that the traders purchased Bancorp RI stock soon after talking with Andrade, and that none of the traders had any legitimate business justification to know about the proposed bank merger.  The Court also concluded that the complaint described the type of meaningful and close personal relationship between Andrade and Rampino in which the benefit to Andrade from tipping his friend could be inferred.  The Court also found that the complaint sufficiently pled that Rampino knew about the benefit Andrade received, especially in light of the history of personal favors described in the complaint., According to the SECs complaint, Andrade, of Rehoboth, Massachusetts, illegally tipped inside information about Bancorp Rhode Islands potential acquisition to his friends and business associates: Robert Kielbasa of Portsmouth, Rhode Island, Fred Goldwyn of Wilmington, Delaware, and Kenneth Rampino of Seekonk, Massachusetts. The complaint alleges that each of the three traded on the inside information Andrade supplied to them, and profited when Bancorp Rhode Islands stock price significantly increased after the acquisition announcement. On the day of the acquisition announcement, Bancorp Rhode Islands stock closed at $44 per share, an increase of $13.29 per share, or forty three percent, from the prior days closing price., The complaint charges that Andrade and Rampino violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks to have them be enjoined, disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains with interest, and pay civil penalties of up to three times their gains.  The complaint further seeks to bar Andrade from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  Kielbasa and Goldwyn previously agreed to settle the SECs charges against them.

Brays trading single-handedly accounted for approximately 56 percent of the total trading volume in Wainwright shares during that period.  At one point, Bray called his broker to ask how many shares he could purchase, which he acknowledged kinda sounds crazy, given how thinly the stock traded.  After the public announcement of the acquisition caused Wainwrights stock price to increase nearly 100 percent, Bray ultimately sold all of his shares for nearly $300,000 in illicit profits., The SECs action, which remains pending, seeks injunctions against each of the defendants from further violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, and civil penalties., The SEC thanks the U.S. Attorneys Office for the District of Massachusetts for its efforts in prosecuting the case., For further information, see <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr23070.htm>Litigation Release No. 23070</a> (August 18, 2014) [Civil Complaint] <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr23131.htm>Litigation Release No. 23131</a> (November 14, 2014) [Bray arrest]; <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr23150.htm>Litigation Release No. 23150</a> (December 5, 2014) [ONeill guilty plea].,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2016/lr23456.htm</i><br/>]"

In that action, the Commission alleged that defendants knew that Amogear was a shell company without any real operations, but schemed from at least August 2012 to February 2014 to boost the price of its securities and profit by selling their own shares.

(Criminal Proceeding)., In its complaint filed on June 3, 2014, the Commission alleged that Valente and ELIV fraudulently raised more than $8 million from approximately 80 clients by falsely claiming they achieved consistent and outsized positive returns, among other misrepresentations. ELIV had in fact earned no positive results at all, instead sustaining consistent investment losses for three years. Meanwhile, Valente made substantial cash withdrawals of client funds and spent their money on his home improvements and mortgage payments as well as jewelry and a vacation condominium. Valentes unsuccessful trading strategies and misappropriations severely diluted the amount of client funds at ELIV., Valente was criminally charged in the Criminal Proceeding and was sentenced to a prison term of twenty years., For further information, please see Litigation Release Nos. <a href=http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr23012.htm>23012</a> (June 3, 2014) and <a href=http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr23023.htm>23023</a> (June 16, 2014).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2016/lr23472.htm</i><br/>]"

The SECs complaint alleges that the scheme involved at least 15 stocks and generated a total of more than $4.4 million in illegal trading profits for the group., The SECs complaint was filed on June 3, 2015 and charges California resident Steven Fishoff, his brother-in-law Steven Costantin of New Jersey, Fishoffs friend and California neighbor Ronald Chernin, and Florida resident Paul Petrello, a friend and former day trading associate of Fishoff, as well as various entities they used to perpetrate the scheme.  According to the Commissions complaint, Fishoff, Chernin and Costantin posed as legitimate portfolio managers in order to induce investment bankers to bring them over the wall and share confidential information about upcoming secondary stock offerings.  After agreeing with the bankers that they would neither disclose the confidential offering information nor trade in the issuers stock before the offerings were announced, they violated those agreements by tipping each other about the upcoming offerings and shorting the stocks before the offerings were announced.  On numerous occasions, Fishoff tipped Petrello about the offerings and Petrello then also shorted those stocks before the offerings were announced.  In one instance, Fishoff also tipped Petrello with confidential information about the pharmaceutical company transaction and Petrello, as well as the other defendants, illegally purchased that companys stock before the transaction was announced., In a prior parallel action, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the District of New Jersey also announced criminal charges against Fishoff, Petrello, Chernin, and Costantin on June 3, 2015.  Petrello pled guilty to the parallel criminal charges on February 19, 2016., The partial judgment, to which Petrello consented, permanently enjoins him and two entities he controls, Brielle Properties, Inc. and Oceanview Property Management, LLC (Petrello Entities), which are also charged in the Commissions complaint, from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Rule 105 of Regulation M.

23488,2016,"[<h3>Massachusetts Investment Adviser Pleads Guilty to Fraud, Obstruction of Justice in $15M Fund Fraud</h3>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that on March 3, 2016, Daniel Thibeault, the President/CEO of a group of Massachusetts-based investment advisory companies, pled guilty to criminal charges in connection with the misappropriation of more than $15 million from an investment fund.  The criminal charges against Thibeault arose out of the same fraudulent conduct alleged by the Commission in a civil securities fraud action filed against Thibeault and others in January 2015.  Thibeault plead guilty to charges of securities fraud for the scheme to use fund money to issue fictitious loans, and obstruction of justice for Thibeaults numerous false statements to Commission staff during the Commissions investigation of this fraud., The Commission previously charged Thibeault, GL Capital Partners, LLC, and other related entities with securities fraud and fraud by an investment adviser.  The SECs complaint alleges that GL Capital Partners, LLC and its principal, Thibeault, were the investment advisers to a fund called the GL Beyond Income Fund, and that they misappropriated at least $15 million of the money that belonged to this fund. The GL Beyond Income Funds assets consisted primarily of individual variable rate consumer loans.  According to the complaint, Thibeault and other defendants solicited investments in the GL Beyond Income Fund by representing that investors money would be pooled and used to make or purchase consumer loans. These consumer loans would then constitute assets of the GL Beyond Income Fund, and would provide a return to the investors when interest and principal payments were made on the loans. The SEC alleges that beginning in 2013 or earlier, Thibeault and the other defendants engaged in a scheme to create fictitious loans to divert investor money from the GL Beyond Income Fund, and to report these fake loans as assets of the GL Beyond Income Fund. This scheme was designed to conceal the fact that Thibeault and the other defendants had misappropriated millions of dollars from the GL Beyond Income Fund., The Commissions action, which remains pending, seeks injunctions against each of the defendants from further violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, and civil penalties., The Commission thanks the U.S. Attorneys Office for the District of Massachusetts for its efforts in prosecuting the case., For further information, see Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2015/lr23207.htm>23207</a> (February 26, 2015) [Criminal Indictment]; Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2015/lr23178.htm>23178</a> [Entry of Asset Freeze]; Litigation Release <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2015/lr23171.htm>23171</a> (January 9, 2015) [Civil Complaint].,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2016/lr23488.htm</i><br/>]"

According to the Commissions Complaint, Han gained access to the e-mails as part of his work developing surveillance software to monitor other employees for potential misconduct, including insider trading, and used this access to generate over $460,000 in illicit gains., The final judgment, which was entered with Yue Hans consent, permanently enjoins Han from violating Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder.

Hardy III, who worked in Microsofts corporate financial planning and analysis group, purchased Microsoft put options after learning from highly confidential internal Microsoft documents, including a draft presentation to Microsofts board of directors, that the companys fiscal-year 2013 financial results would not meet Wall Street analysts expectations. When Microsoft issued a July 18, 2013 earnings release containing those financial results, the companys stock price decreased over 11%. Hardy sold the put options shortly after the announcement, realizing ill-gotten gains of approximately $9,000., The SEC also alleges that, in August 2013, Hardy purchased Nokia call options after learning in the course of his work in the financial planning and analysis group that Microsoft was planning to acquire Nokias mobile phone business. After the public announcement of the acquisition on September 2, 2013 caused the price of Nokia American Depositary Shares trading in the United States to rise more than 30%, Hardy sold the Nokia call options, resulting in illegal profits of approximately $175,000., Hardy, of Redmond, Washington, is charged with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating those provisions of the securities laws.

The final judgment imposes on Strebinger a permanent injunction against future violations of certain antifraud and reporting provisions of the federal securities laws, imposes a penny stock bar and orders that he pay disgorgement in the amount of $1,515,640., In its Complaint, the Commission alleged that Strebinger, along with his co-defendant, Brent Chapman acquired positions of more than 5% of Americas Energy common stock without publicly disclosing their beneficial ownership status as mandated by the federal securities laws.  Having acquired their substantial undisclosed positions, Strebinger and Chapman coordinated an aggressive, multi-million dollar campaign to promote Americas Energy stock to prospective investors through blast e-mails and direct mailings of stock promotion reports that contained false and misleading statements.

The Honorable John McBryde, District Judge of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, entered a final judgment on March 22, 2016 against Southlake, Texas attorney Gregory G. Jones.  The final judgment orders Jones to disgorge $1,125,000, plus prejudgment interest of $51,534, and to pay a civil penalty of $600,000., Jones admitted in 2015 to raising approximately $645,000 by selling securities issued by Aquaphex Total Water Solutions, LLC, a company he controlled that purported to recycle fracking water through a filtration process.  Jones provided investors with fraudulent offering documents stating that Aquaphexs principals had invested $2 million in the company when they had not put any cash into the company.  Joness offering documents also misrepresented that Aquaphex was expected to be acquired by an oil services company within five years at a projected value of $21B, that projected investment returns would exceed 115 percent per year, and that investors were guaranteed to at least double their investment within five years.  None of these claims had a reasonable basis in fact, since Aquaphex had no customers, no contracts to provide water-filtration services, and no revenues.  Separately, in 2009, Jones represented a small group of investors that invested approximately $6 million in an entity called Edwards Exploration. Jones failed to disclose to the investors that Edwards Exploration paid Jones approximately $480,000 from the principal amount invested., In its latest order, the court determined that Joness violations in the Aquaphex scheme involved fraud, deceit, manipulation and that he acted intentionally in duping investors.  The court specifically observed that Joness testimony or presentation was not credible, and that the court was not impressed with Joness demeanor for truthfulness while he was on the stand., The court previously enjoined Jones and Aquaphex from violating anti-fraud provisions of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and from violating registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and (c) of the Securities Act., The SECs investigation was conducted by Jim Etri and supervised by David L.

The fraud involved an attempt to manipulate shares of Boston, Massachusetts-based Amogear Inc. that was caught by an FBI undercover operation., All five defendants were permanently enjoined from violating the securities antifraud statutes and barred from participating in offerings of penny stock., The Commissions complaint alleged that defendants knew that Amogear was a shell company without any real operations, but schemed from at least August 2012 to February 2014 to boost the price of its securities and profit by selling their own shares.  The planned scheme involved artificially inflating the price of Amogear stock by, among other things, a) issuing news releases and/or promotional materials containing false or exaggerated information, b) generating mass emails containing false or exaggerated information, and c) engaging in undisclosed coordinated trading of the stock, all designed to generate the appearance of demand for the stock and to increase the price of the stock.  The next stage of the scheme was planned to be the sale of the stock at artificially high prices to unsuspecting investors.  What the defendants did not know was that the FBI controlled Amogear and used it to obtain evidence of attempted stock manipulation.  On February 10, 2014, the SEC <a href=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/suspensions/2014/34-71514.pdf>temporarily suspended trading in Amogears securities</a> as the attempted stock manipulation was underway., The judgments in the Commissions action permanently enjoin all defendants from violating Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder.

The court also found for the SEC on its claims against Alfredo Gonzalez and AMG Energy, LLC, also of Dallas, and Florida-based Robert Balunas and R. ThomasÂ &amp; Co. LLC, who sold the investments., The SECs charges filed in December 2013, alleged that the defendants raised nearly $22 million from at least 380 investors nationwide through illegal securities sales.  In its 50-page summary judgment order, the court found that Parvizian and his companies committed securities fraud by offering and selling interests in a drilling project in which they had no rights to participate or share profits.  The court also found that all defendants had illegally offered and sold unregistered securities and that Parvizian, Gonzalez, AMG Energy, Balunas, and R. Thomas &amp; Co. acted as unregistered broker-dealers., The court rejected defense arguments that the investments were exempt from the federal securities laws because they were structured as joint ventures.  The court instead found that the investors had little real power and were inexperienced in the oil and gas industry, leaving them dependent on Parvizian and his companies to control the ventures.  This dependency made the joint venture interests investment contracts, which are subject to securities laws., The court found Parvizian and his companies liable for securities fraud under Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, concluding that they acted with severe recklessness in failing to disclose material information about the investments to investors.

Laphen and former chief credit officer Don A. Langford, was criminally charged for orchestrating a scheme to defraud TierOnes shareholders and misleading regulators by concealing more than $100 million in losses on loans and declining real estate.  Laphen and Langford both pled guilty and agreed to cooperate in the criminal case against Lundstrom.  At Lundstroms trial, the government presented evidence that Lundstrom was the architect of an aggressive strategy to expand the banks portfolio beyond traditional lending in Nebraska to riskier areas like commercial real estate in Las Vegas. Once the financial crisis hit, Lundstroms bet on real estate in riskier areas decimated the bank. Lundstrom and his co-conspirators then intentionally concealed the massive losses in TierOnes loan and real estate portfolio from its investors and banking regulators and provided inflated figures in its required reports to the SEC.  Lundstrom was convicted on all but one count of the indictment., In September 2012, Lundstrom agreed to settle parallel SEC charges.  Lundstrom consented to a final judgment enjoining him from violations of Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2, from aiding and abetting violations of Exchange Act Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13, and from controlling any person who violates Exchange Act Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13; barring him from serving as an officer or director of a public company; and imposing civil penalties of $500,921., On March 24, 2016, Laphen and Langford were sentenced to 34 and 21 months imprisonment, respectively.

Schiltz of the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota has entered an order holding defendants James M. Louks and FiberPoP Solutions, Inc. in civil contempt., In September 2015, the SEC <a href=https://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2015-176.html>announced fraud charges</a> and an emergency order to halt Louks and FiberPop from continuing to raise money from investors.  In its complaint, the SEC alleged that Louks and FiberPoP defrauded nearly 100 investors by promising them massive returns, while actually spending the investors funds on various schemes, which the SEC alleged typically bore the hallmarks of prime bank schemes.  On September 2, the Court entered, with the defendants consent, a temporary restraining order barring Louks and FiberPoP from, among other things, soliciting or accepting any monies from actual or prospective investors., In September and October 2015, the defendants entered into two agreements with a FiberPoP investor whereby the investor provided a $10,000 retainer for legal services to be rendered to the defendants and agreed to take on $580,000 in debt that FiberPoP owed to another corporation.  On March 23, 2016, the Court issued an order finding that the defendants violated the temporary restraining order by soliciting and accepting these funds.  Under the courts order, the defendants must return all monies they have accepted from investors since the Court entered its temporary restraining order, and they must submit a sworn affidavit affirming that they have done so., The SECs litigation and investigation are continuing.

Mapp III sold $26 million worth of company stock in private offerings while misleading investors to believe that the Cleantech CTS-1000 server (the companys sole product) was especially energy-efficient. They said it could replace power-hungry servers found in top data centers and compete directly with top server makers like IBM, Dell, and Hewlett Packard. However, neither Mapp nor Servergy informed investors that those companies were manufacturing high-performance servers with 64-bit processors while the CTS-1000 had a less powerful 32-bit processor that was being phased out of the industry and could not in reality compete against those companies., The SEC further alleges that when Servergy was low on operating funds, Mapp enticed prospective investors by falsely claiming well-known companies were ordering the CTS-1000, and he specifically mentioned an order purportedly received from Amazon. In reality, an Amazon employee had merely contacted Servergy because he wanted to test the product in his free time for personal use., Servergy has since cut ties with Mapp, who served as CEO.

The customers included charities, religious organizations and retirement funds.  The complaint alleges that the hidden charges, known as trading profits or TP, were in addition to and often substantially higher than the commissions paid by customers to have their orders executed.  As alleged in the complaint, one customer paid $600,000 in commissions for certain trades placed through GTM, but also unknowingly paid $9.6 million in hidden TP on those same trades., According to the complaint, Bassily engaged in, and directed and encouraged others to engage in, repeated deceptive acts designed to create a false impression regarding the costs paid by the customers.  The deceptive acts included false and misleading statements to customers and scheming with traders who were executing customer orders in order to maximize TP, while minimizing the risk that customers would detect the hidden charge.  The complaint also alleges that Bassily encouraged the use of technological tools to hide TP from a customer, helped to secure false business cards for a trader to use when pitching business to a prospective customer and assisted in drafting false and misleading marketing materials., The complaint alleges that Bassily violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and alternatively, that he violated Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5(b) through or by means of others in violation of Exchange Act Section 20(b), Bassily aided and abetted violations of Exchange Act Sections 15(c)(1) and 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Bassily violated Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933.

Investors were told they were investing in one of several projects connected to Jay Peak Inc., a ski resort operated by Quiros and Stenger, and their money would only be used to finance that specific project.  Instead, in Ponzi-like fashion, money from investors in later projects was misappropriated to fund deficits in earlier projects.  More than $200 million was allegedly used for other-than-stated purposes, including $50 million spent on Quiross personal expenses and in other ways never disclosed to investors., According to the SECs complaint, Quiros improperly tapped investor funds for such things as the purchase of a luxury condominium, payment of his income taxes and other taxes unrelated to the investments, and acquisition of an unrelated ski resort., The SECs complaint charges Quiros, Stenger, Jay Peak, and a company owned by Quiros called Q Resorts Inc. as well as seven limited partnerships and their general partner companies with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.

After a two-week trial in March 2015, a jury found Gault liable for taking part in a securities fraud scheme, knowingly circumventing Heart Tronics internal accounting controls, and making false CEO certifications in a public filing with the Commission., The court ordered Gault to pay $101,000 in disgorgement, $27,570 in prejudgment interest, and $78,000 in civil penalties, for a total of $206,570.  The court also imposed permanent injunctive relief against Gault, including an equitable bar against acting as an officer or director of any public company until Gault affirmatively demonstrates that he has made himself knowledgeable of the requirements of the securities laws imposed on officers and directors and otherwise become competent and fit to serve as an officer or director.  Gault is also enjoined from committing future violations of Section 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 13a-14 of the Exchange Act., The jury had found Gault liable for his knowing or negligent involvement in a fraudulent scheme that misappropriated funds from an investor in Heart Tronics.  While acting as a CEO, Gault transferred $101,000 of investor funds to a private brokerage account that he controlled, after which the funds were lost by Gault in stock trading that the company never authorized.  Additionally, Gault was found liable, as CEO, for knowingly circumventing or failing to implement internal accounting controls at Heart Tronics, and for filing a Form 10-Q with the SEC in 2008 that made false Sarbanes-Oxley certifications., The other defendants charged in this matter had previously settled with the Commission or been found liable as a matter of law by the court by summary judgment., The trial team from the Commission consisted of trial attorneys Kenneth Donnelly, Derek Bentsen, Melissa Armstrong, and investigative attorneys from the Division of Enforcement, Adam Eisner, Rachel Nonaka and Ashley Dolan., For further information, see <a href=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr22204.htm>Litigation Release No. 22204</a> (Dec. 20, 2011); <a href=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22440.htm>Litigation Release No. 22440</a> (Aug. 8, 2012); <a href=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr23081.htm>Litigation Release No. 23081</a> (Sep. 10, 2014); <a href=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2015/lr23205.htm>Litigation Release No. 23205</a> (Feb. 23, 2015)., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2016/comp23522.pdf>SEC Complaint</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2016/lr23522.htm</i><br/>]"

The judgment fully resolves the enforcement action before Judge Crotty as to Wilson., In its complaint filed on July 8, 2009, the SEC alleged that Wilson, along with his co-defendants, used fraudulent boiler room tactics to raise more than $61 million from investors in two related companies - Sky Capital Holdings Ltd. and Sky Capital Enterprises, Inc. (the Sky Entities). The complaint alleged that the defendants orchestrated and participated in the extremely profitable scheme designed to fraudulently induce numerous individuals to invest in the Sky Entities. Additionally, the complaint alleged that the defendants prevented investors from selling their Sky Entities stocks that were otherwise publicly traded on the Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange, which had the effect of artificially inflating the price of the Sky Entities stocks.

23526,2016,[<h3>SEC Charges Israeli Accountant for Conducting a Sham IPO Offering and Five U.S. Residents for Perpetrating a Subsequent Pump-And-Dump Market Manipulation</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced fraud charges against Israeli Asher Z. Zwebner for engaging in a scheme to create a publicly-traded shell company, Crown Dynamics Corp., through a sham registered initial public offering. In a separate case, the SEC announced fraud charges against five U.S. residents - California resident Luke C. Zouvas and Arizona residents Cameron F. Robb, Christopher D. Larson, Jason M. Schiprett, and Robert D. Jorgenson - for engaging in a pump-and-dump scheme to manipulate the market for the stock of Crown. Both actions were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California., According to the SECs complaint against Zwebner, filed today in federal court, Zwebner secretly controlled every aspect of Crowns registration and the IPO. He filed a false Form S-1 registration statement with the SEC on behalf of the company, and after the registration became effective, placed Crowns free-trading shares with nominees residing in Israel, most of whom were unaware of their role as nominees. Zwebner then gained physical control of their stock certificates. He subsequently engaged a U.S. broker-dealer to submit to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) a false Form 15c2-11 under Rule 15c2-11 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, so that Crowns common stock would be quoted on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board (OTCBB) and the OTC Link (an SEC-registered Alternative Trading System). Throughout the registration process, Zwebner did not disclose his control over Crown, made false statements about Crowns business purpose and plans, and used unwitting nominees as the purported IPO purchasers. After Zwebner registered Crowns offering and arranged for its stock to trade on the OTCBB and on OTC Link, he secretly sold the Crown shell to stock promoter Larson., According to the SECs complaint against Zouvas, Robb, Larson, Schiprett and Jorgenson, filed on April 25, 2016 in federal court, Larson obtained controlling shares of Crown from Zwebner and, although Larson controlled Crown and acted as its de facto chief financial officer, his name did not appear in any of Crowns filings with the Commission. With the assistance of Luke C. Zouvas, an attorney based in San Diego who served as Crowns general counsel, Larson transferred free-trading Crown shares from Zwebners nominees - purported shareholders in Crowns IPO - to Larsons nominees, including Jorgenson and Schiprett. Larson then paid $400,000 for a call center to promote Crown and placed manipulative trades in his own brokerage account to create the appearance of market interest in the stock. Robb prepared materially misleading press releases about the companys business success. As Crowns stock price became inflated as a result of Larsons and Robbs efforts to pump the stock, Larsons nominees Jorgenson and Schiprett sold Crown shares and wired most of the sale proceeds - at least $865,000 - to accounts controlled by Larson. Jorgenson and Schiprett retained some of the proceeds as compensation for their assistance in the scheme as nominees., The SECs complaint against Zwebner charges him with violations of Section 17(a)(1), (2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5(a), (b) and (c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar and officer and director bar against Zwebner., The SECs complaint against Zouvas, Robb, Larson, Schiprett and Jorgenson charges each of them with violations of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5(a) and (c) of the Exchange Act. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with interest, civil penalties, and a penny stock bar against all defendants, and an officer and director bar against Larson and Robb., The SECs investigation was conducted by Carolyn Kurr, Keith ODonnell, and Daniel Rubenstein and supervised by C.

The SECs complaint alleged that Ferrone falsely stated in public filings with the SEC and in other presentations that Argyll Biotechnologies, LLC, Immunosyns controlling shareholder, planned to commence the regulatory approval process for human clinical trials for SF-1019 in the U.S. or that the regulatory approval process was underway. The complaint alleged that these statements deceived investors because the statements failed to disclose that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had issued clinical holds on drug applications for SF-1019, which prohibited clinical trials involving SF-1019 from occurring., After a two-week trial, the jury found Ferrone liable for violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Exchange Act Rule 13a-14.

Thompson of the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut granted the SECs motion for an officer and director bar against Joseph F. Apuzzo, former Chief Financial Officer of Terex Corporation.  The ruling follows an evidentiary hearing on the Commissions motion and resolves the case against Apuzzo in its entirety.  Apuzzo had previously consented, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, to be permanently enjoined from violations of Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder, and from aiding and abetting violation of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13a-1 thereunder, and to pay a penalty of $100,000., In its analysis of the factors to be considered in determining whether to impose an officer and director bar, the Court found that the egregiousness of Apuzzos violation, his role or position when he engaged in the fraud, his high degree of scienter, and the likelihood that misconduct will recur merited a permanent bar.  The Court found that Apuzzos inability to recognize the wrongfulness of the egregious conduct in which he engaged... and his lack of candor even when under oath indicated that he is likely to fail to live up to the trust with which officers and directors of public companies are endowed., The Commissions complaint, filed on December 27, 2007, charged Apuzzo with aiding and abetting a fraudulent accounting scheme involving two sale-leaseback transactions, carried out between 2000 and 2002 by United Rentals, Inc. (URI) and Michael J. Nolan (Nolan), a former CFO of URI.  The transactions were structured to improve URIs 2000 and 2001 financial results by allowing URI to recognize revenue prematurely and to inflate the profit generated from the sales.  The complaint alleges that Apuzzo substantially assisted URI and Nolan in implementing the fraudulent scheme by, among other things, signing agreements with URI that he knew or was reckless in not knowing were designed to hide URIs continuing risks and financial obligations relating to the sale-leaseback transactions, and directing or approving the issuance of inflated invoices that he knew or was reckless in not knowing URI, through Nolan and others, would use to inflate URIs gain on the transactions.  As a result of the fraudulent transactions, URI materially overstated its financial results in its Forms 10-K for fiscal years 2000 and 2001, as well as in other filings and public releases., In addition to the relief set out above, Apuzzo had also previously agreed to a Commission order, entered on September 16, 2015, suspending him from appearing as an accountant before the Commission, with a right to apply for reinstatement after five years., For further information, see Litigation Release Nos. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20396.htm>20396</a> (December 12, 2007), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20418.htm>20418</a> (December 31, 2007), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20706.htm>20706</a> (September 8, 2008), and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2015/lr23356.htm>23356</a> (September 21, 2015), and Administrative Proceeding No. <a href=/litigation/admin/2015/34-75933.pdf>34-75933</a> (September 16, 2015).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2016/lr23531.htm</i><br/>]"

In addition, the Commission alleges, in the alternative, that Archer, Cooney, Dunkerley, Hirst and John Galanis violated Section 15(b) of the Securities Act by aiding and abetting violations of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act and Section 20(3) of the Exchange Act by aiding and abetting violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder., The SEC seeks disgorgement plus interest and penalties as well as permanent injunctions.  The SEC also seeks officer-and-director bars against Jason Galanis, Archer, Dunkerley, and Morton., In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the same seven individuals., The SECs continuing investigation is being conducted by Tejal D.

Couch of Irving, Texas and his company, Couch Oil &amp; Gas Inc., enjoining them from offering or selling securities and from violating antifraud and securities registration provisions of the federal securities laws. The final judgment also requires them to pay more than $7 million in monetary relief., The Commission filed its case on May 12, 2014, alleging that Couch and his company falsely claimed that investors would receive working interests in oil and gas wells when Couch and Couch Oil &amp; Gas retained those working interests and never transferred them to investors. The complaint also alleged that offering materials given to investors contained unsubstantiated and inflated projections about anticipated production and that the defendants commingled and misapplied investor proceeds by using funds from one project to pay expenses in another without investors knowledge and contrary to what the defendants promised., The final judgment enjoins Couch and Couch Oil &amp; Gas from issuing, purchasing, offering, or selling any securities in the future, except for their own account. It also enjoins them from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.

Bray was sentenced by U.S. District Judge William G. Young to two years in prison, three years of supervised release, and ordered to pay forfeiture of $299,762.15 and a fine of $1 million in a criminal action for insider trading. The SEC also announced that on May 12, 2016, J. Patrick ONeill of Belmont, Massachusetts was sentenced to one-year probation in a related criminal action., On January 28, 2016, a jury in the federal court in Boston, Massachusetts, returned a guilty verdict against Bray, convicting him of engaging in securities fraud through insider trading. ONeill, a cooperating witness who testified during Brays trial, previously pled guilty to a criminal charge of conspiracy to commit securities fraud., The criminal cases against Bray and ONeill were based on the same conduct underlying the SECs civil action, which was filed on August 18, 2014. The SECs complaint alleged that ONeill, a former senior vice president at Eastern Bank Corporation, learned through his job responsibilities that his employer was planning to acquire Wainwright Bank &amp; Trust Company (Wainwright) and he then tipped Bray, a friend and fellow golfer with whom he socialized at a local country club. In the two weeks preceding a public announcement about the planned acquisition, Bray sold his shares in other stocks to accumulate funds he used to purchase Wainwright securities. Bray had never previously purchased Wainwright stock. After the public announcement of the acquisition caused Wainwrights stock price to increase nearly 100 percent, Bray sold all of his shares during the next few months for nearly $300,000 in illicit profits., The SECs action, which is pending, seeks injunctions against both defendants from further violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks to have them be enjoined, disgorgement of allegedly ill-gotten gains with interest, and civil penalties of up to three times the gain., The SEC thanks the U.S. Attorneys Office for the District of Massachusetts for its efforts in prosecuting the case and recognizes the valuable assistance of the Boston Field Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation., For further information, see Litigation Release Nos. <a href=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr23070.htm>23070</a> (Aug. 18, 2014) [Civil Complaint] <a href=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr23131.htm>23131</a> (Nov. 14, 2014) [Bray arrest]; <a href=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr23150.htm>23150</a> (Dec. 5, 2014) [ONeill guilty plea]; <a href=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2016/lr23456.htm>23456</a> (Jan. 29, 2016) [Bray guilty verdict].,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2016/lr23539.htm</i><br/>]"

The SEC alleges that McLellan defrauded State Street Transition Management customers by charging hidden and unauthorized mark-ups (or amounts added to the cost of the service) on trading in U.S. and European securities., According to the SECs complaint:, The SECs complaint charges McLellan with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also charges McLellan with aiding and abetting violations by others at State Street of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SECs Complaint seeks as relief a permanent injunction prohibiting future violations of these statutes, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil monetary penalties., On April 5, 2016, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the District of Massachusetts announced parallel criminal charges against McLellan and another individual not charged in the SECs complaint.

The jury in the criminal trial convicted Weed of securities fraud, wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit those offenses in connection with a pump-and-dump scheme that defrauded investors in CitySide Tickets Inc., a Massachusetts-based ticket brokering business.  He will be sentenced by the court at a later date., The allegations in the criminal indictment against Weed stem from the same conduct alleged in the SECs complaint against Weed and two other defendants.  According to the SECs complaint, filed in federal court in Boston on November 6, 2014, Weed facilitated a scheme to pump and dump CitySides stock.  The SEC alleges that Weed helped structure CitySide into a publicly traded company through reverse mergers, created backdated promissory notes and authored false legal opinion letters that enabled two other defendants in the SECs action - Thomas Brazil and Coleman Flaherty - to obtain millions of purportedly unrestricted shares of stock in the company.  Investors were then blitzed with a false and misleading promotional campaign touting CitySide as a budding national leader on the verge of acquiring smaller ticket firms across the country and positioning itself as an attractive takeover target for California-based Ticketmaster Entertainment LLC, a large company in the business of selling and reselling tickets to entertainment events.  As the companys stock price increased on the false hype, Brazil and Flaherty sold their shares to unsuspecting investors, realizing illicit proceeds of approximately $3 million, and Weed earned substantial legal fees for his role in the scheme.  Shortly thereafter, the market for CitySides stock collapsed and the company eventually went out of business., The SECs action, which is pending, seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus pre-judgment interest and penalties as well as penny stock bars and permanent injunctions against further violations of the securities laws.  The SEC also seeks to bar Weed from serving as an officer or director of any public company., For further information, see <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr23154.htm>Litigation Release No. 23154</a> (Dec. 9, 2014), <a href=/News/PressRelease/Detail/PressRelease/1370543376662>Press Release No. 2014-250</a> (Nov. 6, 2014) and <a href=/investor/alerts/ia_pumpanddump.htm>Investor Alert:  Pump-and-Dump Stock Promotions</a>.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2016/lr23541.htm</i><br/>]"

In all, more than a dozen victims lost retirement savings as a result of the fraud., Caplitz and his business partner, Rosalind Herman, were indicted in March 2012 and additional charges were added by a superseding indictment returned in March 2013. The indictment alleged that Caplitz fraudulently induced clients to entrust their savings and other funds to him by falsely representing that the funds would be invested and managed for the clients benefit, and that he diverted client funds to benefit himself and Herman. On April 3, 2014, Caplitz pled guilty to conspiracy, investment adviser fraud, making a false filing with the SEC, and wire fraud; on April 5, 2016, a federal jury in Massachusetts convicted Herman of conspiracy, investment adviser fraud, wire fraud and a tax-related charge., In March 2013, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action and obtained an asset freeze against Caplitz and Insight Onsite Strategic Management, Hermans investment advisory firm.

Kipp, Swishers former CFO, exploited Swishers lack of effective internal controls and directed his accounting group to aggressively reevaluate and manipulate various acquisition-related reserves and expenses in order to increase earnings to predetermined targets tied to the expectations of the companys lenders as the basis for future acquisition financing.  The SECs complaint alleges that Joanne K. Viard, Swishers former Director of External Reporting, identified potential acquisition-related entries that could be reclassified to meet earnings targets, and made various adjusting entries in Swishers accounting records without adequate justification or support.  The SECs complaint also alleges that, during the closing process for fourth quarter of 2011, John Pierrard, Swishers former Director of Financial Planning, at Kipps direction, manipulated Swishers allowance for doubtful accounts to increase earnings, knowing or consciously disregarding that the associated entries were not in accordance with GAAP.  The alleged earnings management scheme came to light in early 2012, before Swisher filed its Form 10-K for its 2011 fiscal year., The SEC alleges that Kipp and Viard violated and/or aided and abetted Swishers violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B), of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-11, 13a-13, and 13b2-1 thereunder.

Finally, the complaint alleges that Kipp aided and abetted Swishers uncharged violations of the whistleblower retaliation provisions contained in Section 21F(h) of the Exchange Act.  The SEC alleges that Pierrard violated Sections 17(a)(1) of the Securities Act and Sections 10(b), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5(a) and 13b2-1 thereunder., Pierrard has agreed to settle the SECs claims against him by consenting to the entry of a final judgment providing permanent injunctive relief against violating any of the statutes or rules he is alleged to have violated.  As part of his settlement, Pierrard also consented to an officer and director bar.  The final judgment does not impose a civil penalty based on Pierrards cooperation.

Esposito, of Topsfield, Massachusetts, accomplished the first phase of his fraudulent scheme by raising more than $550,000 from investors between June 2011 and June 2012 in an unregistered offering of securities in his company Lionshare Ventures LLC, spending almost $300,000 of Lionshare investor funds for unauthorized personal expenses, and using $75,000 of Lionshare investor funds to acquire control of a Massachusetts-based publicly-traded company, Cannabiz Mobile, Inc., by purchasing all of its convertible debt.   Cannabiz initially claimed to be in the business of mineral exploration and later claimed to be in the business of servicing businesses in the medical marijuana industry., According to the complaint, in the second phase of his fraudulent scheme, between May 2012 and August 2015, Esposito, with Anthony Jay Pignatello of Manhattan Beach, California, next concealed his de facto control of Cannabiz and a large percentage of Cannabizs securities in order to profit by evading SEC Rule 144, which limits securities sales by affiliates, such as control persons.   Esposito did this by, among other things, installing James Gondolfe of Cambridge, Massachusetts, as the sole officer and director of Cannabiz--even though Esposito secretly controlled the company-to make false statements in Cannabizs public filings and other documents, paying third-party stock promoters to tout Cannabiz stock in order to increase its stock price and trading volume, selling significant amounts of Cannabiz convertible debt to others for almost $304,000, and with Pignatello and Renee Galizio of Loxahatchee, Florida, selling millions of shares of Cannabiz stock directly into the public market., The SECs complaint alleges that Esposito, Pignatello, Gondolfe, Lionshare and Cannabiz violated, or aided and abetted violations of, the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and that all defendants violated the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act., The SECs investigation was conducted by Scott R.

But no deals have ever been anywhere close to materializing, and Connerton has emptied the companys bank account by writing a series of checks to himself and using investor funds for his own expenses., According to court documents filed by the SEC, among Connertons improper spending of investor funds was $20,000 for an engagement ring for his latest online date turned investor.  There are more than 50 investors in Safety Technologies, including six women Connerton met through online dating and 14 others who are family or friends of those women., According to the SECs complaint, Connerton failed to comply with the requirements for private offerings exempt from registration under the federal securities laws, such as providing investors with appropriate financial information and confirming that they have sufficient knowledge and experience to evaluate the merits and risks of the investment.  Connerton also is not registered to sell investments.  Investors can quickly and easily check whether people selling investments are registered by using the <a href=http://www.investor.gov/>SECs investor.gov website</a>., The SEC charged Connerton and Safety Technologies with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC obtained a court order freezing the assets of Connerton and Safety Technologies.

Proctor and Atlas JG, LLC, a company formed by Proctor, have agreed to pay nearly $17.9 million to settle fraud charges., The SECs complaint, filed in federal district court in Wilmington, Delaware, alleges that, from 2007 through 2011, Proctor, of Perris, California, through Atlas, raised more than $22 million from at least 200 overseas investors through a fraudulent offering of purported bonds promising annual returns of eight to nine percent. Proctor told prospective investors that their funds would be used to purchase receivables from homebuilding subcontractors at a discount, and that Atlas would profit from the difference between the discounted price and the amount ultimately collected from homebuilders. However, Atlas used less than ten percent of the funds raised to buy receivables from homebuilding subcontractors as promised, the last purchase occurring in 2008, and continued to fraudulently raise funds from investors for several years thereafter., The SECs complaint further alleges that, contrary to what investors were told, Proctor used at least $11 million of investor funds to make so-called interest and principal payments to investors. He used the balance of the proceeds raised to, among other things, fund offshore investments in Asia, speculate in stock options and other derivatives, and finance his lifestyle. Proctor took almost $3 million of investor funds to pay personal expenses, including his mortgage, his credit card bills, and his childrens tuition., Proctor had previously pled guilty to conspiracy to commit wire and securities fraud in connection with a penny stock pump-and-dump scheme and been <a href=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/34-53158.pdf>barred by the SEC</a> from participating in the penny stock market., Without admitting or denying the SECs allegations, Proctor and Atlas agreed to settle the case against them.

Shearer, and another defendant with violating the antifraud provisions of the securities laws and with illegally selling securities in unregistered transactions. The complaint alleged that StratoComm, acting at Shearers direction and with another defendants assistance, issued and distributed public statements falsely portraying the company as actively engaged in the manufacture and sale of telecommunications systems for use in underdeveloped countries, particularly Africa. In reality, the company had no products and no revenue., The SECs complaint charged StratoComm with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Sorokin of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts sentenced Daniel Thibeault, of Framingham, Massachusetts, to 9 years in prison, three years of supervised release, and restitution of $15.3 million, in connection with his fraudulent misappropriation of more than $15 million from an investment fund he ran. Thibeault was the President/CEO of a group of Massachusetts-based investment advisory companies. In December 2014, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the District of Massachusetts charged Thibeault with securities fraud, wire fraud, aggravated identity theft, and obstruction of justice. The obstruction of justice charge against Thibeault arose from numerous false statements Thibeault made to SEC staff during the SECs investigation. On March 3, 2016, Thibeault pled guilty to charges of securities fraud for the scheme to use fund money to issue fictitious loans, and obstruction of justice for Thibeaults numerous false statements to Commission staff during the Commissions investigation of this fraud., The criminal charges against Thibeault arose out of the same fraudulent conduct alleged by the SEC in a civil securities fraud action filed against Thibeault and others. The SECs complaint alleges that Thibeault, GL Capital Partners, LLC, and other related entities with securities fraud and fraud by an investment adviser. The SECs complaint alleges that GL Capital Partners, LLC and its principal, Thibeault, were the investment advisers to a fund called the GL Beyond Income Fund, and that they misappropriated at least $15 million of the money that belonged to this fund. The GL Beyond Income Funds assets consisted primarily of individual variable rate consumer loans. According to the complaint, Thibeault and other defendants solicited investments in the GL Beyond Income Fund by representing that investors money would be pooled and used to make or purchase consumer loans. These consumer loans would then constitute assets of the GL Beyond Income Fund, and would provide a return to the investors when interest and principal payments were made on the loans. The SEC alleges that beginning in 2013 or earlier, Thibeault and the other defendants engaged in a scheme to create fictitious loans to divert investor money from the GL Beyond Income Fund, and to report these fake loans as assets of the GL Beyond Income Fund. This scheme was designed to conceal the fact that Thibeault and the other defendants had misappropriated millions of dollars from the GL Beyond Income Fund., The SECs action, which remains pending, seeks injunctions against each of the defendants from further violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, and civil penalties., The SEC thanks the U.S. Attorneys Office for the District of Massachusetts for its efforts in prosecuting the case., For further information, see Litigation Release Nos. <a href=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2016/lr23488.htm>23488</a> (Mar. 11, 2016) [Criminal Plea]; <a href=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2015/lr23207.htm>23207</a> (Feb. 26, 2015) [Criminal Indictment]; <a href=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2015/lr23178.htm>23178</a> (Jan. 22, 2015) [Entry of Asset Freeze]; <a href=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2015/lr23171.htm>23171</a> (Jan. 9, 2015) [Civil Complaint].,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2016/lr23573.htm</i><br/>]"

According to the SECs complaint filed in federal court in Boston, the defendants knew that Amogear was a shell company without any real operations but schemed to boost its price and profit by selling their own shares. What the defendants did not know was that the FBI controlled Amogear and used it to obtain evidence of attempted stock manipulation.

Conradt, including a penalty of $980,229, who the agency charged with trading on, and tipping, inside information ahead of a $1.2 billion acquisition of SPSS Inc. in 2009 by IBM Corporation., In its complaint, filed in federal court in the Southern District of New York in 2012, the SEC alleged that Conradt received inside information about the SPSS acquisition from his roommate Trent Martin. Conradt then used that information to trade and tipped four friends, including Daryl Payton and Benjamin Durant, who Conradt worked with in the New York office of a Connecticut-based brokerage firm. The SEC <a href=https://www.sec.gov/News/PressRelease/Detail/PressRelease/1370542161708>separately charged Payton and Durant</a> with trading on inside information ahead of the acquisition of SPSS by IBM., After the SEC filed the complaint, Conradt entered into a consent judgment with the agency whereby he agreed to disgorge his own trading profits of $2,533.60 and cooperate fully and truthfully. Pursuant to the terms of the consent judgment, in exchange for Conradts full cooperation, the SEC agreed to seek a penalty of no more than his trading profits, or $2,533.60. On the SECs unopposed motion, the Court deferred the determination of a penalty for Conradt until after the trial of the SECs suit against Payton and Durant., In February 2016, the SEC went to trial against Payton and Durant, seeking to hold Payton and Durant liable for trading on the SPSS information that Conradt tipped them. During the trial the SEC called Conradt as a witness, in part to testify about his conversations with Payton and Durant about SPSS. But, as the Court found in its Memorandum Order and Final Judgment, Conradts trial testimony materially varied from [his] testimony at his deposition just seven months before in ways that indicate that Conradt was intentionally watering down his prior testimony in contravention of his cooperation agreement and . . . in contravention of the truth., At the conclusion of the Payton/Durant trial, the jury returned a verdict for the SEC and against Payton and Durant finding that, through their conduct, they violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Thereafter, the SEC moved for final judgment, including penalties, as to Conradt. In its motion papers, the SEC argued that Conradt breached his cooperation obligations and asked the Court to impose significant penalties. In imposing judgment against Conradt, the Court agreed with the SECs position that Conradt had failed to cooperate fully and truthfully and ordered Conradt to pay $980,229, an amount equal to the sum of the profits he and his tippees made trading on the SPSS information., The trial team from the SECs Philadelphia Regional Office consisted of attorneys David L.

The SEC also obtained appointment of a receiver over The Ticket Reserve., The SEC alleges that Narayan has transferred over $33 million from clients accounts to The Ticket Reserve, typically without their knowledge or consent and often using forged or unauthorized signatures.  The Ticket Reserve became dependent upon the fraudulent cash infusions from Narayans unsuspecting clients to stay in business.  In exchange, Narayan received nearly $2 million in hidden compensation from the struggling company.  Most of this money is directly traceable to his clients stolen funds., According to the SECs complaint, The Ticket Reserve also made Ponzi-like payments to existing investors using money from new investors.  Since being fired from the investment firm where he worked and losing access to the clients accounts, Narayan has been redirecting to The Ticket Reserves coffers the sham fees he received out of the money misappropriated from client accounts.  The SEC successfully secured the court-ordered asset freeze before Narayan could make a planned financial transaction on May 31., According to the SECs complaint:, The Honorable Barbara M. Lynn for the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas granted the SECs request for a temporary restraining order and asset freeze against Narayan, The Ticket Reserve, Harman, and Kaptrosky, and appointed Michael Napoli, of Dykema Cox Smith, as a temporary receiver over the company., The SECs complaint alleges that Narayan, The Ticket Reserve, Harmon, and Kaptrosky violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  The complaint also alleges that Narayan violated Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  The SEC seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest and penalties as well as preliminary and permanent injunctions., The SECs investigation was conducted by Michael A. Umayam, Keith J. Hunter, and Carol J. Hahn, and the case was supervised by David L. Peavler, Jessica B. Magee, and Eric R. Werner in the SECs Fort Worth office.  The SECs litigation will be led by Christopher A.

In one case, Mustapha allegedly hacked into a brokerage account and rapidly purchased shares at increasing prices and then profited by selling his own shares of the stock in his brokerage account.  According to the complaint, Mustaphas scheme made at least $68,000 profits for himself and caused losses in the victims accounts of at least $289,000., We will swiftly track down hackers who prey on investors as we allege Mustapha did, no matter where they are operating from and no matter how sophisticated their technology, said Robert Cohen, Co-Chief of the SEC Enforcement Divisions Market Abuse Unit., The SEC obtained an emergency court order yesterday that freezes more than $100,000 in Mustaphas assets and prohibits Mustapha from destroying evidence., The SEC alleges that Mustapha violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder, as well as Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933.

Edmunds of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan entered final judgments against Blair Ackman, W. Emery Matthews, and Alicia Diaz, former senior executives and owners of Detroit-based MayfieldGentry Realty Advisors, LLC., According to the SECs complaint, Chauncey C. Mayfield, the founder, president, and CEO of MayfieldGentry, misappropriated $3.1 million from the Police and Fire Retirement System of the City of Detroit to purchase two strip malls in California and title them in the name of a MayfieldGentry affiliate. Other executives at MayfieldGentry, including Ackman, Matthews, and Diaz, gradually became aware that Mayfield had siphoned money away from their biggest client. Rather than come clean about the theft and risk losing the sizeable business the firm received from the pension fund, the other defendants instead devised a plan to secretly repay the pension fund by cutting costs at the firm and selling the strip malls. Their plan ultimately failed when MayfieldGentry could not raise enough capital to put the stolen amount back into the pension fund., Without admitting or denying the SECs allegations, Ackman, Matthews, and Diaz agreed to settle the case against them. The final judgments permanently enjoin each defendant from violating Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, order Ackman and Matthews to pay civil penalties of $50,000 each, and Diaz to pay a civil penalty of $40,000.

In addition, Segal was ordered to pay over $3 million in restitution. In July 2015, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania announced an indictment charging Segal with mail fraud and wire fraud, and, in February 2016, Segal pleaded guilty., The criminal charges against Segal arose out of the same fraudulent conduct alleged by the SEC in a civil securities fraud action filed against him. According to the SECs complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Segal fraudulently sold certificates of deposit (CDs) to his brokerage retail customers falsely claiming that he could provide higher interest rates on these FDIC-insured CDs than otherwise available to the general public. The complaint alleges that, in some instances, Segal purchased CDs on behalf of investors but secretly redeemed them early and took the proceeds. Other times, the complaint alleges that Segal did not purchase CDs at all despite telling customers he had, and then misappropriated the customers money. Besides spending investor money on himself (including to purchase a condominium in Florida and to pay for vacations), Segal allegedly used it in Ponzi scheme fashion to make purported interest payments and principal repayments to earlier investors. Eventually, the complaint alleges that Segal stole directly from his customers brokerage accounts in a last-ditch effort to keep funding the Ponzi payments and keep his scheme from being detected. He allegedly forged letters of authorization to facilitate the transfer of customer funds to accounts he controlled, and in one case forged the signature of one customers wife who had died before the date of the transfer. The complaint alleges that the scheme collapsed in July 2014., Earlier this week, the district court in the SECs case issued a final judgment against Segal, permanently enjoining him from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and ordering him to pay disgorgement of over $3 million, which was deemed satisfied by entry of the criminal restitution order. The courts entry of the final judgment resolves the SECs case against Segal. In April 2016, the SEC barred Segal from the securities industry., For further information, see Litigation Release No. <a href=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2015/lr23295.htm>23295</a> (July 1, 2015) and Exchange Act Release No. <a href=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2016/34-77702.pdf>77702</a> (Apr. 25, 2016).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2016/lr23583.htm</i><br/>]"

Longwei and Toups issued periodic filings, and press releases in January, February, and March 2013, that substantially overstated Longweis storage capacity at those depots., The SEC also alleges that Toups and Longwei misrepresented and omitted key facts about the companys response to public claims by a third-party research firm that Longwei was a massive fraud with little to no observable business activity at its storage depots.  In addition, when the company was short on cash during the second half of 2012, Toups and Longwei misled Longwei warrant holders to induce them to exercise warrants and thereby inject funds into the company.   As part of this scheme, Toups publicly reported his own purchases of Longwei stock in an effort to convince investors that he truly believed in the companys prospects. Unbeknownst to investors, however, Toups made the purchases at the direction of Longweis chairman and used company funds to acquire the stock., The SECs complaint charges Longwei and Toups with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint also charges Longwei with violations of Sections 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder.  The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, and an officer and director bar against Toups.

The complaint further contends Kerr bought 12,740 shares of AuthenTec on margin in his trading account in May and June 2012 using the material nonpublic information he misappropriated from his mother.  As a result of his purchases, Kerr allegedly incurred a deficit of almost $52,000 in his trading account.  According to the complaint, not only did Kerr trade in his own account, but he also opened a brokerage account in the name of his mother-in-law, who had no prior investment experience.

Federal authorities will seek to extradite Martin-Caro Sanchez to the United States. An arraignment date in federal court in Chicago has not yet been scheduled., According to the charges, Australian mining company BHP Billiton decided in August 2010 to make a tender offer for all of Potashs common stock. BHP dealt with several foreign investment banks to secure confidential financing commitments in an effort to underwrite the offer. During a meeting in Chicago on August 12, 2010, BHPs chief executive officer conveyed a $38.6 billion buyout offer to Potashs chief executive. Potash rejected the offer, but it did not publicly announce the matter until August 17, 2010, according to the indictment., During those interim five days, Martin-Caro Sanchez communicated extensively with his banking and investor friends, the indictment states. On August 12 and 13, 2010, Martin-Caro Sanchez purchased approximately 331 out-of-the-money call option contracts for Potash stock via an account at Interactive Brokers LLC, according to the indictment. Martin-Caro Sanchezs contracts were set to expire within weeks of the purchase date, the indictment states.

Telephone records indicate that Martin-Caro Sanchez had called each of them numerous times in the days between the private offer and Potashs public announcement of it, the indictment states. In late 2010 a friend who profited approximately $540,493 from Potash options sales sent 100,000 euros to Martin-Caro Sanchezs bank account in Zurich, Switzerland, the indictment states. Sanchez withheld information about his Swiss account from the SEC during its investigation, according to the indictment., On December 28, 2011, the Court hearing the SECs civil action granted Martin-Caro Sanchezs motion for summary judgment and ruled that the staffs evidence was not sufficient to prove that Martin-Caro Sanchez had access to material, non-public information about the acquisition attempt.

The SECs complaint alleged that Kalucha fraudulently altered an outside audit firms report reviewing the performance of an investment account that Kalucha managed, essentially changing an investment loss into a major investment gain in the account.

The complaint also alleges that Thomas Conrad arranged to increase his compensation from the hedge fund by appointing himself to be a sub-manager, for a fee, and that this additional fee and the related conflict of interest was not disclosed to investors. The complaint further alleges that, in offering literature given to prospective investors, defendants touted Thomas Conrads significant experience in the securities industry, but failed to disclose his disciplinary history, which included an industry bar that the SEC imposed on him in 1971.

The complaint alleged Williams and Parrish told investors that ST Ventures would purchase collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) and then leverage the CMOs to produce a large return for the investor within 30 to 90 days.  The complaint further alleged that Williams and Parrish made material misrepresentations and omissions regarding the investment including, among other things, the risk of the investment and the use of investor funds.  Williams and Parrish allegedly told investors that their investment principal would never be at risk of loss because investing in CMOs is a very safe and liquid investment and that investor funds would be used only to purchase CMOs.  Instead of using investors funds as represented, the complaint alleged that virtually all payments made to investors, which totaled more than $1.5 million, came from new investor money and Williams and Parrish misappropriated over $3.5 million of investors proceeds for their personal use., Both Williams and Parrish consented, without admitting or denying the allegations in the SECs complaint, to the entry of the final judgments that included permanent injunctions from violating Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The final judgment imposes on the Luca Entities a permanent injunction against future violations of certain antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and orders that certain Luca Entities pay $68.3 million in disgorgement., In its complaint filed in July 2015, the SEC alleged that the Luca Entities, their CEO Bingqing Yang and her chief fundraiser Lily Lei orchestrated a fraudulent scheme targeting the Chinese American community as well as investors in Asia to invest in unregistered offerings of securities.  According to the complaint, Yang and Lei represented to investors that their money would be invested in oil and gas drilling operations, that they could expect annual rates of return of 20-30 percent, and that their investments were risk free.  In reality, as the complaint alleges, Yang, the Luca Entities and Lei deceived investors by misrepresenting that their operations as successful and projecting outsized investment returns, all while knowing the operations were losing millions of dollars and the enterprise was sinking under a mountain of debt.  The SEC further alleges that Yang commingled investor funds to prevent the scheme from collapsing and used money from new investors to make sham profit payments to earlier investors.  Besides reaching investors in the Chinese-American community through advertisements on Chinese-language television and radio, and in Chinese-language newspapers, Yang and the Luca Entities allegedly targeted Chinese citizens who sought permanent U.S. residence through the EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program, which provides a way for foreign investors to obtain a green card by meeting certain U.S. investment requirements., In August 2015, the Luca Entities filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy petitions in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division.Â  As stated in the final judgment, the Luca Entities agreed, as part of the settlement, that they shall allow and not contest the Commissions bankruptcy claim for $68.3 million in the In re: Luca International Group, LLC, Case No. 15-34221-H2-11 (Bankr.

White, Rodney A. Zehner, and Daniel J. Merandi fraudulently issued $1 billion in unsecured corporate bonds out of a shell company they own and claimed the money would be used to fund the resort project. But they never came close to raising the funds necessary to start the project, and meantime they pocketed the $5.6 million they did raise and used it for personal purchases at Saks Fifth Avenue, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Prada, and Versace., The SECs complaint filed yesterday alleges that White, Zehner, Merandi, and their companies violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.

Cummings of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas granted summary judgment for the SEC on all claims against the father-and-son duo of Paul R. and Jeffry P. Downey, and John M. Leonard, all promoters of fraudulent oil-and-gas investments, finding them liable on all charges., The SECs action, filed in November 2014, alleges that the defendants raised nearly $5 million from 17 investors in a securities offering in the Permian Advanced Oil Recovery Investment Fund I, LP (PAOR), in which the Downeys company, Quest Energy Management Group, Inc. (Quest), served as PAORs operating general partner.  The SECs complaint alleges that the Downeys violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and alleges that Leonard violated Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act, and seeks permanent injunctions, money penalties, and disgorgement of ill-gotten gains from the illegal offerings., According to the courts order, the Downeys committed fraud by misrepresenting and concealing material facts while offering and selling securities to raise money for their oil-and-gas investment program, and that Leonard violated the law by acting as a broker in these securities transactions even though he was not registered with the SEC.  The court found that the Downeys - acting with scienter - made misrepresentations relating to the usage of funds raised from the investors, and that they failed to inform investors about a receivership involving entities with which the Downeys and Quest were involved, and how [the receivership] could impact the investors by recovering over five million dollars from the operating general partner.  The court also found that Leonard acted as an unregistered broker because he received commissions totaling $405,698 for selling more than $4 million in PAOR limited-partnership units to 13 investors and [t]he indisputable evidence shows that Leonard (1) solicited prospective PAOR investors in person, by phone, and by email; (2) recommended the PAOR investment to investors; (3) negotiated transactions in PAOR LP units and closed the sales; (4) distributed, directly and indirectly, the private placement memorandum and other offering material; and (5) received a 10 percent commission from Quest on each sale.  Rejecting Leonards argument that he was merely a liaison or finder, the court concluded that the evidence clearly shows that Leonard was much more involved with the investment transactions and sales than merely bringing the parties together while acting as a finder., The court directed the SEC to submit briefs by August 15, 2016 on the proper remedies to impose on the defendants as a result of their violations., The SECs investigation was conducted by Jeffrey Cohen and Carol Hahn of the Fort Worth Regional Office.

Place, GTS Chief Executive Officer, John P. Kirk, GTS President, and his brother, Paul G. Kirk, GTS General Counsel and Chief Operating Officer, operated the two GTS firms as a transition management brokerage consulting business. The complaint alleges that GTS assisted its customers - largely public pension funds - in handling large orders to buy and sell securities when transitioning a large portfolio from one investment manager or strategy to another, or liquidating it. The complaint further alleges that Place and the Kirk brothers told many of their customers that GTS would receive only explicitly disclosed commissions charged on customers trades. In reality, GTS also received additional revenue from mark-ups and mark-downs taken by other brokers and shared with GTS. Over the course of the scheme, GTS received at least $13 million in undisclosed payments., The complaint further alleges that Place and the Kirk brothers and GTS worked with ConvergEx Global Markets Limited, a Bermuda-based broker-dealer, and two other brokerage firms to execute the scheme. In December 2013, the SEC announced charges against <a href=http://www.sec.gov/News/PressRelease/Detail/PressRelease/1370540521484>ConvergEx Global Markets and two sister brokerage subsidiaries that agreed to pay more than $107 million</a> and admit wrongdoing to settle the matter.

Inc. (PAC-3), in connection with the fraudulent offering of an investment fund called PAC-3 Film Fund LLC (PAC-3 Film Fund)., The SECs complaint alleges that Ruh established the PAC-3 Film Fund to make investments in a film financing deal between a well-known film studio (Film Studio A) and a film financing firm (Financing Firm A). Pursuant to its deal with Film Studio A, Financing Firm A agreed to provide Film Studio A with 25 percent of Film Studio As motion picture financing for the next five years (the Film Deal). As part of the fund raising effort, Financing Firm A invited PAC-3 Film Fund to assist in raising money for the deal, but subject to a number of specific limitations that Financing Firm A communicated to Ruh. Notwithstanding specific contrary instructions from Financing Firm A, beginning in approximately July 2013, either directly or through intermediaries, Ruh and PAC-3 created and caused to be distributed to potential investors various versions of an offering document titled confidential executive summary (collectively, the Offering Document)., According to the complaint, the Offering Document contained several material false and/or misleading statements regarding the nature of the PAC-3 Film Fund offering and misleadingly displayed Film Studio As logo on its first page, contrary to the express instruction from Financing Firm A that it was not to do so. The Offering Document stated that PAC-3 had formed the PAC-3 Film Fund to raise $550 million to invest exclusively in a fund managed by Financing Firm A (Financing Firm A Film Fund). Certain versions of the Offering Document falsely claimed that: (1) the PAC-3 Film Fund offering was in Co-Operation with . . . [Film Studio A]; (2) PAC-3 has secured a [third-party] Financial guarantee with the capacity to guarantee amounts that exceeds $728,750,000; (3) PAC-3 will supply directly [through a syndicate of insurance companies] to the investor an insurance guarantee that protects both principal and 6.5% [annual return] for five years and a Financial Guarantee provided by a syndication of insurers including but not limited too [sic], Am Trust, Price Waterhouse, XL Re, Excess Re, Munich Re, Lloyds and others (with whom PAC-3 purported to have Key Relationships); and (4) Film Studio A has an implied corporate guarantee for the first line of $300m., The complaint further alleges that Ruh and PAC-3 knew that these statements were false and misleading. Contrary to the claims made in the Offering Document, the offering was not in cooperation with Film Studio A, which had not authorized the use of its name or logo on the Offering Document. Moreover, PAC-3 did not have key relationships with major insurance companies and had not secured a third-party [f]inancial guarantee for the deal. Finally, Film Studio A had made no implied corporate guarantee regarding the Film Deal., The complaint charges Ruh and PAC-3 with violations of Sections 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933, and seeks permanent injunctions, civil money penalties and other relief against both defendants., The SECs investigation was conducted by John Lehmann, Jack Kaufman, and Charles Riely of the New York office.

The Honorable Amos L. Mazzant, U.S. District Judge for the Eastern District of Texas, entered the order after finding that the defendants had created Cambrian Resources, LLC in order to evade the Courts injunction and continue to raise investor funds., The SECs complaint against Sameer Sethi and Sethi Petroleum, filed in May 2015, alleged that they raised approximately $4 million through the fraudulent offer and sale of securities in the Sethi-North Dakota Drilling Fund-LVIII Joint Venture beginning in approximately January 2014. According to the complaint, the offering materials represented that 70 percent of investor funds would be used to acquire working interests in, to drill, and to complete 20 oil and gas wells in the Bakken Shale formation in North Dakota. But the SECs complaint alleges less than 25 percent of the amount raised was used for these purposes. Instead, more than 75 percent of investor funds allegedly were spent on undisclosed and unapproved expenditures such as diverting $1.6 million to Sameer Sethi, his family, and Sethi Petroleums parent company and paying more than $1 million to sales employees. The complaint alleges that less than $1 million of the funds raised went to actual oil and gas operations. The court subsequently enjoined Sameer Sethi and Sethi Petroleum from continuing to raise funds and appointed a receiver over their assets., On June 22, 2016, the SEC filed an emergency motion with the Court after determining that Sameer Sethi was continuing to raise investor funds through his father Praveen Sethi and attorney John Weber under an entity named Cambrian Resources, LLC., In finding the defendants in contempt of its injunction, the Court articulated 22 specific facts - an extraordinary amount of evidence - that demonstrate that the creation and operation of Cambrian by Sameer, Praveen, and Weber was nothing more than an attempt to evade the Courts injunction and continue utilizing Sameers skills in selling securities. The Court rejected the defendants arguments that the Cambrian interests were structured in such a way to be exempt from the federal securities laws, finding that investors had a complete dependency on Cambrian, making the Cambrian interests investment contracts and subject to securities laws. The court ruled that [t]he actions taken by Sameer, Praveen, and Weber clearly violated both the spirit and the letter of the Courts order. This is supported by clear and convincing evidence that the parties deliberately attempted to disguise the nature of their involvement with Cambrian and the illusory nature of the interests that Cambrian was selling., Judge Mazzant ordered that within 14 days, Sameer Sethi, Praveen Sethi and John Weber must provide a sworn accounting for all Cambrian assets, return nearly $80,000 to the Cambrian investors and pay the SECs costs in filing the emergency motion. If they fail to do so, the court will consider jail time or a fine., The SECs investigation was conducted by Samantha S. Martin, Keith Hunter and Jessica B.

The <a href=https://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2015-116.html>SEC charged the other two brokers and the Ardea employee</a> last year., According to the SECs complaint filed in federal court in San Diego against Rampoldi and William Scott Blythe III, they made approximately $90,000 in illicit profits by trading ahead of those announcements based on nonpublic information that flowed to them through one of the fellow brokers who learned it from the other after he was tipped by the IT executive.  It was decided that in order to evade detection by the compliance department at the brokerage firm where Rampoldi and the others worked, Blythe would fund the purchase of Ardea call option contracts in a brokerage account he held at a different brokerage firm, and they would subsequently divide the profits among them., In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of California yesterday brought criminal charges against Rampoldi and Blythe., The SECs complaint charges Rampoldi and Blythe with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.  The SEC seeks permanent injunctions as well as disgorgement, interest, and penalties., The SECs investigation was conducted by Patricia A. Paw, John S. Rymas, Daniel Koster, and Brendan P. McGlynn of the Philadelphia office, and supervised by G. Jeffrey Boujoukos.  The litigation will be led by David L. Axelrod and Michael J. Rinaldi.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U. S.

Stewart in a criminal trial prosecuted by the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York.  The jury convicted Sean Stewart of insider trading and related charges.  He is presently scheduled to be sentenced on February 17, 2017., On May 14, 2015, the SEC charged Sean Stewart with insider trading, and the criminal case is based on similar conduct underlying the SECs action.  The SECs complaint alleges that, in a scheme spanning at least four years, Stewart illegally tipped his father, Robert K. Stewart, about future mergers and acquisitions involving clients of two investment banks where Sean Stewart worked.  The complaint alleges that his father, a certified public accountant, cashed in on the tips by placing and directing highly profitable securities trades ahead of the public announcement of these corporate transactions, generating approximately $1.1 million in illicit proceeds.  On August 12, 2015, Robert Stewart pled guilty to conspiracy to commit securities fraud., The SECs action, which remains pending, seeks an injunction against Sean Stewart and Robert Stewart from further violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, civil penalties, and an officer and director bar against Robert Stewart., The SEC thanks the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation for its efforts in prosecuting the case, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority for its assistance in this matter., For further information, see Press Release No. <a href=https://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2015-90.html>2015-90</a> (May 14, 2015).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2016/lr23620.htm</i><br/>]"

Patrick ONeill, a resident of Belmont, Massachusetts, to settle allegations that he engaged in insider trading in the stock of Wainwright Bank &amp; Trust Company (Wainwright)., On August 18, 2014, the SEC filed a complaint alleging that ONeill, a former senior vice president at Eastern Bank Corporation, learned through his job responsibilities that his employer was planning to acquire Wainwright, and he then tipped Watertown, Massachusetts real-estate developer Robert H. Bray (Bray), his friend and fellow golfer with whom he socialized at a local country club. As a result, Bray purchased 31,000 shares of Wainwright stock. After the public announcement of the acquisition caused Wainwrights stock price to increase nearly 100 percent, Bray ultimately sold all of his shares for nearly $300,000 in illicit profits., ONeill and Bray were both criminally charged by the United States Attorney in Massachusetts for the same conduct.  ONeill pled guilty to a criminal charge of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and he was sentenced to one year of probation and a $5,000 fine.  Bray went to trial and a jury returned a guilty verdict on one count of securities fraud for insider trading.  Bray was thereafter sentenced to two years in prison, ordered to forfeit the proceeds of his illegal trading, and ordered to pay a criminal fine of $1 million.  He is currently appealing the verdict., ONeill consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder., The SECs case continues against Bray., For further information, see <a href=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr23070.htm>Litigation Release No. 23070</a> (August 18, 2014) [Civil Complaint]; <a href=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr23131.htm>Litigation Release No. 23131</a> (November 14, 2014) [Bray arrest]; <a href=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr23150.htm>Litigation Release No. 23150</a> (December 5, 2014) [ONeill guilty plea]; <a href=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2016/lr23456.htm>Litigation Release No. 23456</a> (January 29, 2016) [Bray guilty verdict]; <a href=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2016/lr23539.htm>Litigation Release No. 23539</a> (May 13, 2016) [Bray sentence].           <!-- End text --><!--Complaint  --><!-- <img src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10 height=9 alt= border=0>        <a href=/litigation/complaints/xxxx/compxxxxx.pdf>SEC Complaint</a>--> ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2016/lr23621.htm</i><br/>]"

Ragsdale with aiding and abetting a penny stock fraud involving now-defunct U.S. public company Global Earth Energy, Inc. (Global Earth), formerly based in Wilmington, North Carolina., The SECs complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina, Charleston Division, alleges that from August 2013 through mid-2014, Global Earth made materially false and misleading statements in press releases to the public and in public filings with the SEC. Most of the false and misleading statements involved Global Earths alleged partner, Hawk Manufacturing Corporation (Hawk), a now-defunct private company based in South Carolina. Ragsdale was Hawks Chief Executive Officer and Hawks principal decision-maker. Global Earth falsely and misleadingly claimed, among other things: (1) that Global Earth and Hawk had exchanged 20 percent of their common stock, when they had not; (2) that the value of the Hawk stock exchange was nearly $5,000,000, when there was no reasonable basis for that valuation; (3) that Hawk proposed to acquire businesses with existing credit facilities of $10 million or $25 million, when Hawk had no such funding; (4) that Hawk had completed various material business acquisitions, when Hawk had not; and, (5) that Global Earth and Hawk had merged, when they had not. The SECs complaint further alleges that Ragsdale knew that Global Earths press releases relating to Hawk were false and misleading, that he drafted and/or reviewed the press releases in advance of their release, and that he approved the issuance of the false and misleading press releases knowing that the press releases would be disseminated to the investing public., The SECs complaint alleges that Ragsdale aided and abetted Global Earths violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5. The SECs complaint seeks against Ragsdale a permanent injunction, officer and director bar, penny stock bar, and civil penalties., In addition, the SEC today instituted public administrative proceedings against Global Earth, and against any successor under Exchange Act Rules 12b-2 and 12g-3 or new corporate name, pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Exchange Act, to determine whether the SEC should suspend or revoke the registration of each class of Global Earths securities, for Global Earths failure to comply with Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder. The SEC alleges that Global Earth is delinquent in its periodic filings with the SEC, and that Global Earth made materially false and misleading statements in reports filed with the SEC relating to Hawk. The SEC previously had <a href=/litigation/suspensions/2014/34-71660.pdf>suspended trading in Global Earth stock</a>., The SECs investigation was conducted out of the Atlanta Regional Office by Lucy T.

Restitution to be paid by Weed will be determined at a later date.  Flaherty was sentenced by Chief U.S. District Judge Patti Saris to one year of probation, to be served in home confinement, and ordered to pay a fine of $10,000.  Restitution to be paid by Flaherty will be determined by the court on September 23, 2016.  Flaherty was previously ordered to forfeit $1,350,734.  Brazil was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Richard Stearns to one day in prison, three years of supervised release, and ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $231,140.  Brazil was previously ordered to forfeit $1,519,213.  Brazil and Flaherty each had pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy, one count of securities fraud, and one count of wire fraud in December 2014, and both cooperated with the criminal authorities and subsequently testified in a related criminal trial of Weed prosecuted by the Massachusetts U.S. Attorney.  On May 16, 2016, a jury returned a guilty verdict against Weed for conspiracy to commit securities fraud and wire fraud, securities fraud, and seven counts of wire fraud., The allegations in the criminal cases against Weed, Flaherty, and Brazil stem from the same conduct alleged in the SECs complaint against them.  According to the SECs complaint, filed in federal court in Boston on November 6, 2014, Weed helped structure CitySide into a publicly traded company through reverse mergers, created backdated promissory notes and authored false legal opinion letters that enabled Flaherty and Brazil to obtain millions of purportedly unrestricted shares of stock in the company.  Investors were then blitzed with a false and misleading promotional campaign touting CitySide Tickets as a budding national leader on the verge of acquiring smaller ticket firms across the country and positioning itself as an attractive takeover target for California-based Ticketmaster Entertainment LLC, a large company in the business of selling and reselling tickets to entertainment events.  The complaint further alleges that as the companys stock price increased on the false hype, Flaherty and Brazil sold their shares to unsuspecting investors for illicit proceeds of approximately $3 million.  Shortly thereafter, the market for CitySide Tickets stock collapsed and the company eventually went out of business., The SECs pending action against Weed, Brazil and Flaherty seeks from all defendants disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus pre-judgment interest and penalties as well as penny stock bars and permanent injunctions against further violations of the securities laws.  The SEC also seeks to bar Weed from serving as an officer or director of any public company., For further information, see Litigation Release Nos. <a href=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr23129.htm>23129</a> (Nov. 7, 2014) [Civil Complaint]; <a href=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr23154.htm>23154</a> (Dec. 9, 2014) [Weed indictment]; and <a href=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2016/lr23541.htm>23541</a> (May 16, 2016) [Weed conviction].,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2016/lr23624.htm</i><br/>]"

The SECs complaint alleges that Cañas learned confidentially that the investment bank had been asked by one of the worlds largest mining companies, BHP Billiton (BHP), to advise and help underwrite its proposed acquisition of Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan (Potash), one of the worlds largest producers of fertilizer minerals. The SEC alleges that Cañas coordinated with a close friend to purchase Potash call options in a Switzerland-based brokerage account, of which Cañas was the sole beneficial owner, on August 16, 2010-the day before Potash announced that it had rejected BHPs acquisition bid. Potash stock rose more than 27% after that announcement, and Cañas sold the Potash call options three days after he purchased them for illicit net profits of $278,156.97, a gain of more than 1,400%., The final judgment entered by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on the SECs motion for a default judgment, orders Cañas to disgorge $278,156.97 in ill-gotten gains from the illegal Potash trading plus prejudgment interest of $56,543.99.

Mandelbaum, Zimmerman and Sage each previously consented to judgments in SEC cases charging them with securities laws violations. The complaint alleges that Sage, Secured’s former Secretary, Treasurer and COO, aided and abetted Secured’s and Mandelbaum’s misrepresentations and omissions concerning the officers’ backgrounds by drafting that portion of the PPM. The complaint also alleges that Secured and Mandelbaum engaged in a scheme to defraud investors through the misuse of Secured investor proceeds, including by funneling $131,000 of investor proceeds to Mandelbaum’s daughter, Jennifer Austin of Palm Beach Gardens, FL, towards the purchase of a home. The complaint alleges further that Sage aided and abetted Secured’s and Mandelbaum’s misuse of investor proceeds by approving the diversion of Secured investor funds to HSC Holdings, LLC (HSC), an entity controlled by Mandelbaum, and by using investor proceeds to fund the operations of another entity, Sarben Holdings, Inc. The complaint also alleges that Zimmerman, Secured’s former Vice President of Investor Relations, made misrepresentations and omissions to Secured investors regarding the risks of investing in Secured, engaged in a scheme to defraud investors in connection with the sale of approximately $1 million in shares in another company, Filewarden.com Corp, and that Zimmerman and Tamda Marketing, Inc.

The application alleges that Panos incorporated private companies with little or no operations or assets, orchestrated sham private offerings, and arranged for the companies to go public through the filing of false registration statements with the SEC.  The SEC further alleges that Panos arranged reverse-mergers or other transactions through which he sold the public shells to private companies, and then participated in pump-and-dump schemes targeting those companies.  This allowed him to reap significant profits by selling the shares he had acquired through his control of the public shells.

They allegedly lacked any reasonable basis for such estimates amid persistent manufacturing problems plaguing the company since its inception.  Enviro Board claimed its green materials had already been used in residential and commercial construction projects, yet the company has never developed a commercially viable mill to manufacture its products.  Among other alleged misrepresentations to investors were claims to have secured $161 million in financing from a vendor that turned out to be nothing more than an entity created by Peiffer that lacked the resources to actually make such a loan., Meanwhile, according to the SECs complaint filed in federal court in Los Angeles, Camp and Peiffer and their primary salesman Joshua Mosshart have paid themselves approximately $2.6 million in compensation out of investor funds.

Final judgments were entered against Sergio Henrique Tanaka of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil and Davie, Florida; Carlos Luis da Silveira Barbosa of Lisbon, Portugal; Claudio de Oliveira Pereira Campos of Lisbon, Portugal; Viviane Amaral Rodrigues of Clinton, Massachusetts; and Wesley Brandao Rodrigues of Marlborough, Massachusetts., The judgments enjoin the three company officers, Tanaka, Barbosa, and Campos, from future violations of Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and enjoin the two promoters, Viviane and Wesley Rodrigues, from future violations of Sections 5 of the Securities Act.

According to the complaint, investors were promised that they would receive a return of 15% to 30% per week from their investment and that if the funds were not invested within 15 to 30 days, they would receive a refund of their investment plus a 2% penalty. To the contrary, investors funds were neither invested nor returned as promised.

Investors were allegedly told their money would only be used to acquire financing for Jenkins mining company, Arco Hills Silica Company and were guaranteed a return on their investment ranging from 53% to 120% within 30 to 90 days of purchasing their notes.  Instead, Jenkins, Sweeten and Kreais used approximately $422,536.58 of investor money to pay for their daily expenses, entertainment, house payments, legal expenses and medical bills.  Additionally, old investors received $25,394.68 from new investors., The complaint further alleges that Jenkins, Sweeten and Kreais represented to investors that Jenkins mining company, held mining claims that contained 460 million ounces of gold that would be worth $805 billion.  The mining claim values were purportedly based on a geological and valuation report prepared by Craig Parkinson, an Idaho licensed geologist.  The complaint alleges that Parkinsons report was false and misleading, and that Jenkins, Sweeten and Kreais knew the representations in Parkinsons report were false and misleading but they nevertheless solicited investors using the information contained in the report.  Similarly, Parkinson also allegedly knew investors were being solicited and were relying on his false valuation figures., The Commissions complaint charges Jenkins, Sweeten and Kreais with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) and 15(a) of the Exchange Act of 1934.

Moore, RPMs General Counsel and Chief Compliance Officer, oversaw RPMs response to the DOJ investigation.  According to the SECs complaint, however, Moore did not inform RPMs CEO, CFO, Audit Committee, and independent auditors, of material facts about the investigation.  For example, Moore knew but failed to inform them that:  RPM sent DOJ estimates showing RPMs subsidiary overcharged the government on the contracts under investigation by a material amount; RPM agreed to submit a settlement offer by a specific date to resolve the DOJ investigation; and, prior to submitting the settlement offer to DOJ, RPMs overcharge estimates increased substantially to at least $28 million., As a result of Moores conduct, the SEC alleges that RPM filed multiple false and misleading documents with the SEC.  For example, among other things, RPM failed to disclose in its filings with the SEC any loss contingency related to the DOJ investigation, or to record an accrual on its books, when required to do so by governing accounting principles and the securities laws.  RPM also failed to disclose in its SEC filings a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting and its disclosure controls when in fact such weakness existed.  Consequently, RPM did not provide investors with accurate information about RPMs financial condition.  In August 2014, RPM restated its financial results for three quarters that occurred during the DOJ investigation and filed amended SEC filings for those quarters, disclosing the DOJ investigation and related accruals.  In the restated filings, RPM also disclosed errors relating to the timing of its disclosure and accrual for the DOJ investigation., The SECs complaint charges RPM with violating antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Sections 17(a)(2) and (a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933; the reporting provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder; and the books and records and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws, Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act.

Instead, Bloom misappropriated more than $13.2 million of investor funds to furnish a lavish lifestyle for himself and his wife that included the purchase of luxury homes, cars and boats.

Jesus and his newsletter company Wealthpire Inc. used advertising materials and websites touting him as “the untutored prodigy of stock investing” under the alias Manny Backus.  A self-purported “math whiz” who boasted a “skyscraping” IQ and training as a professional chess player, Backus claimed to be actively trading in the stock market with “real money” by age 19.  The SEC’s complaint also states that Wealthpire materials claimed that Backus made millions of dollars before “deciding to help other investors” by starting an alert service that let traders copy his every trading move., The SEC alleges that from at least January 2012 to September 2014, Backus was not trading in the same stocks recommended by his services as he claimed.  He wasn’t the one making all of the recommendations either.  For instance, the SEC’s complaint alleges that Robert C. Joiner was paid by Wealthpire to make all of the stock picks for one alert service without any guidance from Backus on how to choose them.  Joiner allegedly posed as Backus during chat room sessions by signing in using a password that Backus supplied, and Joiner told investors that he was buying and selling certain recommended stocks when no such transactions were actually taking place.  Joiner also is named in the SEC’s complaint and agreed to settle the case., The SEC’s complaint alleges a series of other misrepresentations to Wealthpire subscribers as well, including false claims about one particular stock alert service that purportedly made historic trading recommendations that yielded huge past returns higher than 1,400 percent., The SEC has warned investors <a href=https://www.investor.gov/additional-resources/news-alerts/alerts-bulletins/investor-alert-investment-newsletters-used-tools>that investment newsletters can be used as tools for fraud</a>, noting in an investor alert for example to beware false performance claims misrepresenting the track record of the newsletter’s investment recommendations and be suspicious if the newsletter does not disclose having received any compensation., Backus and Wealthpire agreed to pay disgorgement of $1,135,145 plus interest of $112,902, and Backus also must pay a $235,000 penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Backus, Wealthpire, and Joiner consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining each of them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  , The SEC’s investigation was conducted by Lucee Kirka and supervised by Robert Conrrad of the Los Angeles office.  , <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2016/comp-pr2016-184.pdf>SEC Complaint</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2016/lr23645.htm</i><br/>]"

The judgments enjoin the six promoters from future violations of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933., The judgments also order the Aguiars to pay a total of $71,894.31 on a joint and several basis, the Bentos to pay a total of $150,816.45 on a joint and several basis, and the Somaios to pay a total of $98,671.45 on a joint and several basis, in disgorgement of ill-gotten gains and prejudgment interest.  However, prejudgment interest and all but $732.83 and $16,534.63 in disgorgement were waived against the Bentos and Somaios, respectively, and civil penalties were not assessed against the Aguiars, Bentos and Somaios based upon their demonstrated inability to pay. Finally, the judgments also permanently restrain and enjoin all the defendants from offering, operating, or participating in any marketing or sales program in which a participant is compensated or promised compensation solely or primarily (1) for inducing another person to become a participant in the program, or (2) if such induced person induces another to become a participant in the program., The SEC previously obtained judgments against Tropikgadget, three company officers (Sergio Henrique Tanaka of San Paulo, Brazil and Davie, Florida, Carlos Luis da Silveira Barbosa of Lisbon, Portugal, and Claudio de Oliveira Pereira Campos of Lisbon, Portugal); four promotors (Julio G.

The final judgment imposes on Thibeault permanent injunctions against future violations of certain antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement of $15.3 million, which will be deemed satisfied by the restitution order in the parallel federal criminal case against him.  Thibeault was also recently sentenced to nine years in prison in the criminal case., In its complaint, filed on January 9, 2015, the SEC alleged that Thibeault, GL Capital Partners, LLC, and other related entities engaged in securities fraud and fraud by an investment adviser.  Specifically, the SEC alleged that GL Capital Partners, LLC and its principal, Thibeault, were the investment advisers to a fund called the GL Beyond Income Fund, and that they misappropriated at least $15 million of the money that belonged to this fund.  The GL Beyond Income Funds assets consisted primarily of individual variable rate consumer loans.  According to the complaint, Thibeault and other defendants solicited investments in the GL Beyond Income Fund by representing that investors money would be pooled and used to make or purchase consumer loans.  These consumer loans would then constitute assets of the GL Beyond Income Fund, and would provide a return to the investors when interest and principal payments were made on the loans.  The SEC alleged that beginning in 2013 or earlier, Thibeault and the other defendants engaged in a scheme to create fictitious loans to divert investor money from the GL Beyond Income Fund, and to report these fake loans as assets of the GL Beyond Income Fund.  This scheme was designed to conceal the fact that Thibeault and the other defendants had misappropriated millions of dollars from the GL Beyond Income Fund., The final judgment permanently enjoins Thibeault from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

From September 2010 through January 2012, Wallace, directly and through the JAW cold callers whom he controlled, allegedly solicited buyers to purchase shares of four penny stock companies: Systems America, Inc., PEI Worldwide Holdings, Inc., Sycamore Ventures, Inc., and Healthient, Inc.  According to the complaint, Wallace and the JAW cold callers whom he controlled fraudulently induced buyers to buy Prices and Alversons shares by, among other things, making fantastic per share price predictions and not disclosing that Price and Alverson paid up to a 40% - 50% commission on each sale that JAW coordinated.  Wallace also allegedly manipulated the per share price of each security by buying shares through his personal brokerage account.  All told, Wallace allegedly induced buyers to purchase a cumulative total of at least 8.3 million shares, generating at least $2.4 million in gross proceeds from which Price and Alverson allegedly paid commissions., In addition to the foregoing, the complaint also alleges that Wallace engaged in unregistered offers and sales of securities.  The complaint further alleges that Wallace acted as an unregistered broker-dealer., Based on the facts alleged, the Commission charged Wallace with violating Sections 5(a) and (c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 9(a)(2), 10(b), and 15(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint further alleges that Wallace is liable as a control person for JAWs violations of Exchange Act Sections 10(b) and 15(a) and Rule 10b-5.  Lastly, the complaint also alleges that Wallace aided and abetted JAWs violations of Securities Act Section 17(a) and Exchange Act Sections 10(b) and 15(a) and Rule 10b-5 and Kingsfields violations of Securities Act Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) and Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rules 10b-5(b) and (c).  The Commission is seeking to have Wallace permanently enjoined, ordered to pay disgorgement with prejudgment interest and a civil money penalty, and barred from participating in any penny stock offering., On November 5, 2012, Wallace pleaded guilty in a parallel criminal matter to one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C.

(now known as Novus Robotics, Inc.), a penny stock company whose securities were quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board., The SECs complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, alleges that Louis T. Buonocore, of Woburn, Massachusetts, Jeremy R. Draper, of Liverpool, New York, Frank J. Morelli, III, currently incarcerated in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Berardino Dino Paolucci, Jr. , of Mississauga, Ontario, Canada, and  Don L. Rose, of Port Jefferson Station, New York, participated in a scheme to obtain an OTCBB company with a large block of unrestricted stock and conduct a fraudulent promotional campaign through which they could sell their shares of stock.  During the summer of 2011, the defendants allegedly acquired over 90% of Ecolands stock and began the process of merging Paoluccis fathers company, D&amp;R Technology, Inc., into it, thereby obtaining total control over Ecolands 22 million shares of unrestricted stock and influence over the majority of its restricted stock., Starting in late September 2011 and continuing through late February 2012, the defendants allegedly manipulated the market and price of Ecolands stock through matched trades and the coordinated issuance of email blasts urging investors to buy the stock.  The complaint alleges that Paolucci often timed the email blasts from stock promotion websites that he controlled to correspond with press releases he authored on Ecolands behalf.  After Buonocore joined the scheme in October 2011, he allegedly took an active role in organizing and implementing the promotional campaign to promote Ecolands stock.  The SEC alleges that none of the email blasts disclosed the schemers control and/or influence over nearly all of Ecolands stock, that they were responsible for authoring and issuing the press releases and email blasts, or that they were selling their shares of Ecoland stock in coordination with the promotions.  Through their fraud, the defendants allegedly generated over $3.2 million in profits., The SECs complaint charges Buonocore, Draper, Morelli, Paolucci and Rose with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and further charges Buonocore, Morelli, Paolucci and Rose with violating Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13d-1 and 13d-2 thereunder.  The SEC seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, civil money penalties, injunctions against future violations and penny stock bars.  Without admitting or denying the SECs allegations, Buonocore, Morelli and Draper each have consented to the entry of permanent injunctions, leaving the amounts of their disgorgement, prejudgment interest and civil penalties to be determined by the Court at a later date.  Draper also consented to a penny stock bar., The SECs investigation was conducted by Richard G. Stoltz and Craig McShane, and was supervised by Anne C. McKinley in the Chicago Regional Office.

Cummings of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas entered final judgments against Defendants Paul R. Downey, Jeffry P. Downey, and John M. Leonard.  The judgments followed summary-judgment rulings in the SECs favor in July 2016, in which the court found that the Downeys raised $4.9 million from investors in a fraudulent oil-and-gas investment program and Leonard made $405,698 in commissions while serving as an unregistered broker., Judge Cummings found the Downeys misconduct to be extremely egregious, describing it as knowingly deceiving investors about virtually every aspect of the investment.  The court ordered them to disgorge $4.9 million plus $1.1 million in interest and to pay a civil penalty of $178,156 apiece.  The court barred them from serving as officers or directors of any SEC-reporting company and enjoined them from violating antifraud laws, specifically Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also enjoined the Downeys from soliciting or participating in securities transactions in the future, allowing them to purchase and sell securities only for their own accounts., Judge Cummings found that Leonards conduct was extremely egregious, recurrent, and carried out with high scienter and that it involved deliberate or reckless disregard of a regulatory requirement.  The court ordered Leonard to disgorge $405,698 in commissions plus $89,063 in interest, and to pay a civil penalty of $178,156.  It also enjoined Leonard from violating the broker-registration provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934., B.

(WMGI) and Winning the Money Game, LLC (WMG), to collectively invest $5 million in securities issued by FutureGen Company, a company that, along with its principal, Lawrence P. Schmidt, was <a href=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr23021.htm>previously charged by the SEC</a> with defrauding investors across the country in an investment scheme involving unregistered debt offerings.  In exchange for persuading clients to invest in FutureGen, Ikokwu received undisclosed kickbacks of over $100,000 from FutureGen.  Ikokwu allegedly told his clients that he did not receive compensation from any third party for providing investment advice but did not disclose the FutureGen kickbacks.  He also allegedly told investors that he had conducted extensive due diligence into FutureGen prior to making his recommendation, when he actually did little or no research on the company.  Finally, the complaint alleges that Ikokwu touted the performance of his own familys investments with Schmidt to clients when the largest of those investments was actually in default., The SECs complaint charges Ikokwu and his companies, WMGI and WMG, with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule l0b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

Gorton of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts entered final judgments by consent against Coleman Flaherty III and Thomas Brazil for their roles in defrauding investors in CitySide Tickets Inc., a Massachusetts-based ticket brokering business., The final judgments impose permanent injunctions against future violations of certain antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws and permanently bar Flaherty and Brazil from participating in penny stock offerings.  The judgments also order disgorgement of more than $1.5 million against Brazil and more than $1.3 million against Flaherty, which amounts will be deemed satisfied by the forfeiture order in the parallel federal criminal cases against them., In its complaint, filed on November 6, 2014, the SEC alleged that Richard Weed, a California attorney against whom the SECs case remains pending, helped structure CitySide into a publicly traded company through reverse mergers, created backdated promissory notes and authored false legal opinion letters that enabled Flaherty and Brazil to obtain millions of purportedly unrestricted shares of stock in the company.  Investors were then blitzed with a false and misleading promotional campaign touting CitySide Tickets as a budding national leader on the verge of acquiring smaller ticket firms across the country and positioning itself as an attractive takeover target for California-based Ticketmaster Entertainment LLC, a large company in the business of selling and reselling tickets to entertainment events.  The complaint further alleges that as the companys stock price increased on the false hype, Flaherty and Brazil sold their shares to unsuspecting investors for illicit proceeds of approximately $3 million.  Shortly thereafter, the market for CitySide Tickets stock collapsed and the company eventually went out of business., The final judgments enjoin Flaherty and Brazil from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder.  In addition, the final judgments order that Brazils and Flahertys obligation to pay disgorgement of $1,519,213 and $1,350,734, respectively, be deemed satisfied by the orders of forfeiture entered in the parallel criminal proceedings against them., In parallel criminal proceedings, Flaherty was sentenced on June 8, 2016 to one year of probation, to be served in home confinement, ordered to pay a fine of $10,000 and ordered to forfeit $1,350,734.  Brazil was sentenced on June 2, 2016 to one day in prison, three years of supervised release, ordered to pay restitution of $231,140, and ordered to forfeit $1,519,213.  Brazil and Flaherty each had pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy, one count of securities fraud, and one count of wire fraud in December 2014, and both cooperated with the criminal authorities and subsequently testified in a related criminal trial of Weed prosecuted by the Massachusetts U.S. Attorney.  On May 16, 2016, a jury returned a guilty verdict against Weed for conspiracy to commit securities fraud and wire fraud, securities fraud, and seven counts of wire fraud.  On August 22, 2016, Weed was sentenced to 4 years in prison and three years of supervised release and ordered to pay a fine of $100,000 and to forfeit $90,000., The SECs pending action against Weed seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus pre-judgment interest and penalties as well as a penny stock bar and a permanent injunction against further violations of the securities laws.  The SEC also seeks to bar Weed from serving as an officer or director of any public company.

Bramlette, for failing to produce documents related to the SECs investigation into possible violations of the federal securities laws by a business known as Private Placement Capital Notes II, LLC (PPCN)., According to the SECs application and supporting papers, over the last five years PPCN sent over $22 million in investor funds to the Pelorus Group, which is based in Salt Lake City, Utah.  However, the SEC alleges that PPCN has not received any return on its investment.  The SEC states that the money was supposed to be invested in a resort on Daufuskie Island in South Carolina.  The SECs application states that PPCN investors have not been paid since 2014., According to the SEC, the staff in the SECs Los Angeles Regional office served the Pelorus Group and Bramlette with subpoenas on July 25, 2016 as part of the SECs investigation.  The subpoenas sought documents regarding the Pelorus Groups books and records, as well as documents regarding the resort on Daufuskie Island.  According to the SEC, the Pelorus Group and Bramlette are in possession of documents relevant to the SECs investigation but they have refused to produce many of these documents to the SEC despite repeated efforts to secure compliance with the SECs subpoenas., Pursuant to its application filed in federal court, the SEC seeks a court order directing the Pelorus Group and Bramlette to show cause why the court should not enter an order requiring them to produce documents responsive to the SEC administrative subpoenas.

23673,2016,[<h3>SEC Charges Energy Services Company and Executives with Accounting Fraud</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged an energy services provider and four executives for their roles in an accounting fraud in which the company recognized revenue earlier than allowed in order to meet internal targets., Lime Energy Co. agreed to pay $1 million to settle the charges, and its four now-former executives also agreed to settlements., The SECs complaint alleges that Lime Energy improperly recognized $20 million in revenue from at least 2010 to 2012.  Two then-executives in the companys utilities division — vice president of operations Joaquin Alberto Dos Santos Almeida and director of operations Karan Raina — developed procedures to enable the company to recognize revenue on newly signed contracts based on documentation received before year-end 2010.  But when documentation did not arrive in time, they allegedly went ahead and booked the revenue anyway., According to the SECs complaint, Almeida and Raina became even more aggressive in 2011 and 2012 as they further recognized revenue earlier than allowed by accounting principles as they faced increasing pressure to produce results.  They eventually went so far as to direct internal accountants to book revenue on jobs that didnt exist.  The SEC further alleges that Lime Energys then-corporate controller Julianne M. Chandler accepted new accounting entries to book millions of dollars in additional 2011 revenue well after the year-end close.  And in February 2012 when Lime Energy still needed $500,000 to meet its 2011 revenue target, the companys then-executive vice president James G. Smith suddenly sent Chandler new entries that provided the company with even more additional revenue to improperly recognize., The SECs complaint was filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, and the settlements are subject to court approval.  Smith agreed to pay a $50,000 penalty and be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Chandler agreed to a $25,000 penalty and a five-year officer-and-director bar.  Almeida agreed to a permanent officer-and-director bar, and Raina agreed to a $50,000 penalty.  They neither admitted nor denied the allegations., Chandler separately agreed to be suspended from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an accountant, which includes not participating in the financial reporting or audits of public companies.  An SEC order would permit Chandler to apply for reinstatement after five years., The SECs investigation found no personal misconduct by Lime Energys then-CEO John E. ORourke and then-CFO Jeffrey R. Mistarz, who reimbursed the company $67,728 and $118,196.01 respectively for cash bonuses and certain stock awards they received during the period when the company committed accounting violations.  Therefore it wasnt necessary for the SEC to pursue a clawback action under Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002., The SECs complaint charges:  Lime with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 13a-1, and 13a-13; Smith, Chandler, and Almeida with each violating Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) and 13b2-1, and with aiding and abetting Limes violations of Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b), 13(a), and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act, and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5(b), 13a-1, and 13a-13; and Raina with violating Section 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act, Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, and Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1, and with aiding and abetting Limes violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act, and Exchange Act Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13., The SECs investigation was conducted by Christopher G.

The SEC alleges that Winters and Southlake provided investors with offering documents that contained untrue and misleading statements about the investments. For example, the documents misrepresented the use of the offering proceeds, contained unsubstantiated projections regarding future oil production and revenue, and overstated expected well costs, according to the complaint. The SEC also alleges that Winters directed Southlake to engage in conduct that operated as a fraud on investors, including taking undisclosed profit and overhead payments from the offering proceeds, using offering proceeds to acquire working interests for itself, and selling joint-venture interests to certain investors at an undisclosed 50% discount., All three defendants have agreed to settle the SECs charges without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.

The criminal charges against Merrill arose out of the same fraudulent conduct alleged by the SEC in a civil securities fraud action filed in April 2014., The SECs complaint alleged that TelexFree, Merrill, Wanzeler, and other defendants claimed to run a multilevel marketing company that sold telephone service based on voice over Internet (VoIP) technology but actually were operating an elaborate pyramid scheme. In addition to charging Merrill and the company, the SEC charged several other TelexFree officers and promoters, and named several entities related to TelexFree as relief defendants based on their receipt of ill-gotten investor funds., The SECs action, which remains pending against all parties, seeks injunctions against each of the defendants from further violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, and civil monetary penalties, among other things., For further information, see Litigation Release Nos. <a href=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr22974.htm>22974</a> (Apr. 17, 2014) (SEC Halts Pyramid Scheme Targeting Dominican and Brazilian Immigrants); <a href=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr22992.htm>22992</a> (May 13, 2014) (Criminal Charges Filed Against Two Principals of Massachusetts-Based Telexfree); <a href=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2016/lr23450.htm>23450</a> (Jan. 20, 2016) (Florida Resident Ordered to Jail Based On Violating Court Orders Obtained by the SEC).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2016/lr23678.htm</i><br/>]"

Three others also are charged in the case., The SEC filed a complaint against Ryan Gilbertson, who allegedly hatched and orchestrated the elaborate scheme to secretly siphon millions of dollars from Dakota Plains Holdings, which operates an oil-shipping rail facility in North Dakota. Gilbertson founded the company with Michael Reger., According to the SECs complaint, Gilbertson and Reger installed their fathers as figurehead executives so they could secretly wield control of the company and issue millions of shares of stock to themselves, family, and friends. They later hired one of their friends as CEO. They allegedly caused the company to enter into an agreement to borrow money from them under generous terms that included extra bonus payments to Gilbertson, Reger, and other lenders based on the price of Dakota Plains stock after 20 days of trading following a reverse merger into a company with publicly-traded shares., According to the SECs complaint, Gilbertson enlisted friends and associates including Douglas Hoskins and Thomas Howells to choreograph extensive sales and purchases of Dakota Plains stock and cause the price to skyrocket from 30 cents to more than $11 per share during that 20-day period. The inflated stock price obligated Dakota Plains to make bonus payments totaling $32 million to Gilbertson, Reger, and others. After meeting his target to receive the bonus payments, Gilbertson ceased his alleged manipulation efforts. The stock price then steadily declined to pennies per share and was delisted a few months ago., Hoskins and Howells are charged in the SECs complaint along with Gilbertson for allegedly participating in his stock manipulation activities., Reger consented to an SEC order finding that he obtained illicit payments and skirted public disclosure requirements by spreading his Dakota Plains stock holdings among 10 accounts in different names to conceal that he owned more than one-fifth of the companys shares and reaped millions of dollars in bonus payments. Without admitting or denying the findings, Reger agreed to pay $6.5 million in disgorgement, $669,365.85 in interest, and a $750,000 penalty as well as a cease-and-desist order as to Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act and Sections 13(d) and 16(a) of the Exchange Act., Minnesota-based stockbroker Nicholas Shermeta also consented to an SEC order finding that he solicited investors for Dakota Plains and recommended the stock to his clients at the registered brokerage firm where he worked, but improperly brokered the sales through his unregistered firm Napa Properties rather than through his employer. Without admitting or denying the findings, Shermeta and Napa Properties agreed to pay $75,000 in disgorgement, $11,075.49 in interest, and a $50,000 penalty and to a cease-and-desist order as to Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act.  Shermeta also agreed to be barred from the securities industry with a right to apply for reinstatement after three years., The complaint filed in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota seeks monetary sanctions including disgorgement and financial penalties as well as injunctive relief as to all the defendants and a bar from serving as an officer and director as to Ryan Gilbertson.  The complaint alleges that Gilbertson violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder, and Sections 13(d) and 16(a) of the Exchange Act; that Howells and Hoskins aided and abetted Gilbertsons violations of Sections 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder; and that Gilbertson, Howells, and Hoskins violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act., The SECs investigation in this matter is continuing.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2016/lr23680.htm</i><br/>]"

The Commissions complaint alleges that Jeffrey D.

Investors were then allegedly told the proceeds from these purported financial instruments would be monetized and traded in a manner that would produce returns as high as 35% per week.  Smith and Carswell allegedly told investors these transactions were risk free and guaranteed.  Michael W. Fullard, of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, is alleged to have acted as a finder, referring a victim investor to Smith and Carswell in exchange for a fee.  The Commissions complaint further alleges that rather than use investor funds to obtain the promised financial instruments, Smith, Carswell and Fullard almost immediately disbursed the investors funds to themselves, in some cases just hours after they were received.

The judgment orders Parigian to pay over $490,000 in monetary sanctions., The SECs complaint against Parigian and five other defendants, filed on July 11, 2014, alleged that Parigian illegally traded on material non-public information about American Superconductor Corp.  Parigian allegedly received the material non-public information from his friend, defendant Eric McPhail.  McPhails alleged source for the inside information was an American Superconductor executive who belonged to the same country club as McPhail and was a close friend of his.  According to the complaint, from July 2009 through April 2011, the executive told McPhail about American Superconductors expected earnings, contracts, and other major pending corporate developments, trusting that McPhail would keep the information confidential.  Instead, McPhail allegedly misappropriated the inside information and tipped his friends, including Parigian, who improperly traded on the information.  Parigian allegedly made profits and avoided losses of $295,235 as a result of his illegal insider trading., Parigian consented to the entry of the judgment against him.

The Court entered judgment by consent against Herbert Sudfeld on August 18, 2016, ordering him to pay $91,747 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest and enjoining him from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Commission voluntarily dismissed the claim against relief defendant Mary Jo Sudfeld on November 9, 2016., The SECs complaint alleged that Herbert Sudfeld illegally traded in advance of the 2011 announcement of a $760 million merger of Harleysville Group, Inc. and Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, which sent the price of Harleysville stock up 87%.  Sudfeld purchased 3,000 shares of Harleysville stock the day before the announcement, using an account in his own name and one in his wifes name.  At the time, Sudfeld was a real estate partner at a Philadelphia-area law firm that advised Harleysville on the merger.  Sudfeld, who was not involved in the merger negotiations, learned that the announcement was imminent from a conversation between an attorney working on the transaction and their shared legal assistant.  On the day the merger was announced, Sudfeld sold all of the shares he had purchased, realizing approximately $79,000 in illegal profits.  The Commission named Mrs. Sudfeld as a relief defendant based on the ill-gotten gains realized in the account in her name., Previously, in a parallel criminal case arising out of the same facts alleged in the SECs complaint, a jury convicted Herbert Sudfeld of insider trading along with three counts of making a false statement.

As Jason Galanis allegedly told two of his associates, the primary objective of the scheme was to provide Jason Galanis and his associates a source of discretionary liquidity.  Jason Galanis then allegedly acquired two investment advisory firms and installed officers to arrange the purchase of $43 million in bonds using clients funds.  The amended complaint further alleges that in exchange for $150,000 from Jason Galanis, Martin served as the Managing Director or Portfolio Manager of a fake entity that was held out to bond investors as an independent investment manager for the bond proceeds.  Through his role with the fake investment manager, Martin facilitated the transfer of proceeds from investors in the tribal bonds to Jason Galanis and his associates., The SEC further alleges that instead of investing bond proceeds as promised in annuities to benefit the tribal corporation and generate sufficient income to repay bondholders, the money wound up in a bank account in Florida belonging to a company controlled by Jason Galanis and his associates.Â  Among their alleged misuses of the misappropriated funds were luxury purchases at such retailers as Valentino, Yves Saint Laurent, Barneys, Prada, and Gucci, and to support an IPO of a technology company in which Jason Galanis and several other defendants had interests.

In addition, the Commission alleges, in the alternative, that Archer, Cooney, Dunkerley, Hirst, John Galanis and Martin violated Section 15(b) of the Securities Act by aiding and abetting violations of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act and Section 20(3) of the Exchange Act by aiding and abetting violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder., The SEC seeks disgorgement plus interest and penalties as well as permanent injunctions against all defendants, and officer-and-director bars against Jason Galanis, Archer, Dunkerley, and Morton., Jason and John Galanis, Archer, Cooney, Dunkerley, Hirst and Morton were also charged criminally by the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York.

The Division of Enforcement alleged that Fortenberry ran an investment company called Premier Investment Fund (Premier), which raised funds from investors for social media projects run by another company with ties to the country music industry.  The Division also alleged that Fortenberry misled investors about the profitability of the company and about the destination of the investors funds.  From October 20 through October 22, 2014, an SEC administrative law judge held a hearing on the Divisions allegations in Dallas, Texas.  During that hearing, Fortenberry was asked about his involvement with Wattenberg Energy Partners (Wattenberg), which raised funds for oil and gas drilling projects in northern Colorado.  In response, Fortenberry testified, under oath, that he did not have any control of, or do any work for, Wattenberg.  In reality, Fortenberry set up Wattenberg in his sons name because of the SECs investigation.  On August 10, 2016, a grand jury sitting in the Northern District of Texas indicted Fortenberry for obstruction of justice in the proceedings and for other related charges., On March 2, 2015, an SEC administrative law judge issued <a href=https://www.sec.gov/alj/aljdec/2015/id748jeg.pdf>an initial decision</a> finding that Fortenberry willfully violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, including Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.  The administrative law judge imposed a cease-and-desist order and ordered Fortenberry to disgorge $146,500 plus prejudgment interest, pay a $900,000 civil money penalty, and be permanently barred from the securities industry.

The SEC further alleges that the Griffins misled investors about Paysons promised participation in the program and about Paysons compensation as the programs sponsor and operator., Specifically, the SEC alleges that the Griffins misrepresented to the investors: i) that Payson would contribute, up-front, 20% of the offering amount, or $5.4 million, and that this capital infusion would cover 20% of the cost of the wells; ii) that Paysons consideration as program sponsor/operator/co-investor would be limited to 20% of any petroleum revenue generated by the wells; and iii) that Payson would cover any cost overages, beyond the estimated $24 million, in drilling and completing the wells. The SEC further alleges that these were misrepresentations because, in fact: i) Payson contributed no money to the offering and paid nothing toward the well costs; ii) Payson appropriated the entirety of the offering proceeds net of offering costs; and iii) Payson lacked the financial means to pay even the smallest cost overage., In its complaint the Commission charges Matthew Carl Griffin and William Daniel Griffin with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Ultimately, the synthetic CDOs failed and the five Wisconsin school districts suffered a complete loss of their cash investment., On December 6, 2016, the Honorable Charles N.

This distribution, along with the prior Fair Fund distribution of $30.4 million in a related case instituted in September 2011 and settlements obtained in the school districts private lawsuit, will fully compensate the five Wisconsin school districts for their losses., In addition, the final judgment also recites Stifels and Noacks admissions to misconduct that harmed the five Wisconsin school districts.  Section VI of the final judgment reflects that Stifel and Noack admitted, among other things, that they made certain material misstatements to the school districts that overstated the safety and downplayed the risks of investing in CDOs, and failed to disclose certain material facts, and did not independently perform any meaningful suitability analysis with respect to the CDO investments., The courts entry of the final judgment resolves this litigation in its entirety., Noack also has consented to the entry of an SEC <a href=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2016/34-79503.pdf>order</a>, based on the courts entry of judgment, which imposes industry and penny stock bars, with the right to reapply after five years., The SECs investigation that led to the charges against Stifel and Noack was conducted by Kevin Guerrero, Keshia W.

Ponn, a defendant in an ongoing SEC litigation, pled guilty to three counts of wire fraud in connection with orchestrating a three-year fraud scheme that involved hundreds of attempts to defraud various securities brokers. The court accepted Ponns plea and scheduled sentencing for March 1, 2017., The SEC previously charged Massachusetts resident Ponn with engaging in a scheme to defraud numerous broker-dealers over more than seven years in an action filed on March 31, 2016.  According to the SEC complaint, beginning as early as 2007, but escalating in 2014 and continuing into at least April 2015, Ponn defrauded numerous brokerage firms through bogus bank transfers to newly opened brokerage accounts. These bogus transfers created the false appearance that the brokerage accounts would have cash available upon the settlement of Ponns purchases of stocks and mutual fund shares. Ponn used temporary credits from the bogus transfers to purchase stock and mutual fund shares, which he repeatedly attempted to cash out or transfer to other financial institutions before the brokerages discovered that Ponn did not have actual money to fund the bank transfers., The SECs litigation against Ponn continues.  The SECs complaint seeks a permanent injunction plus disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and penalties.

According to the complaint, Interinvest clients lost as much as $12 million of their $17 million investment based on the trading in the penny stock companies, some of which were purportedly in the business of exploring for gold or other minerals.  Black served on the board of directors of these companies, which collectively paid approximately $1.9 million to an entity that he controlled.  The SEC alleged that Blacks involvement with these companies and his receipt of payments from them created a conflict of interest that he and Interinvest failed to disclose to their advisory clients., The SECs investigation was conducted by Michael Vito, Peter Moores, John McCann, Chip Harper, and Celia Moore of the Boston Regional Office.  The SECs examination of Interinvest, which identified the violations described in the SECs complaint, was conducted by Raymond Titus, Paul Prata, Daniel Wong, and Melissa Clough of the Boston Regional Office., The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the New Hampshire Bureau of Securities Regulation, the Quebec Authorité des Marchés Financiers, the Ontario Securities Commission, and the British Columbia Securities Commission., For further information, please see Litigation Release Nos. <a href=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2015/lr23288.htm>23288</a> (June 17, 2015) and <a href=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2015/lr23294.htm>23294</a> (June 26, 2015)., ,  , <i>https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2016/lr23713.htm</i><br/>]"
23714,2016,[<h3>Businessman Settles Charges of Fraudulent EB-5 Offering</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that a Florida-based businessman has agreed to settle charges that he misused investor funds intended to create U.S. jobs through the EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program., The SEC alleges that Jason Adam Ogden, the CEO of a pair of smoothie and frozen yogurt franchises called Juiceblendz and Yoblendz, formed AJN Investments LLC to conduct an investment offering in conjunction with the EB-5 program, which provides foreign investors a path to permanent residency when their investments create at least 10 jobs for American workers. Investors were allegedly told that their money would help build and operate Juiceblendz and Yoblendz stores in strip malls and create a sufficient amount of jobs for them to qualify for an EB-5 visa and ultimately a green card., But according to the SECs complaint, Ogden changed his business model midstream without updating the offering materials, focusing on developing kiosks in sports arenas and university campuses rather than following through with the construction of full-size stores. Not only did this result in smaller-than-promised returns for investors, but also jeopardized their EB-5 program status because kiosks dont stimulate the same job creation as full-size stores and construction projects., The SEC further alleges that Ogden improperly siphoned more than $1 million in investor funds for his personal use, making undisclosed cash transfers to his bank account. Ogden allegedly used investor funds to repay a personal loan and pay for meals and entertainment., The SECs complaint, filed in U.S. District Court of the Southern District of Florida, charges Ogden and AJN Investments with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5. They agreed to settle the SECs charges without admitting or denying the allegations. Ogden agreed to pay back the amount of investor funds he misused for his own personal benefit totaling $1,008,681, plus interest of $41,024 and a penalty of $160,000. The settlement is subject to court approval., The SECs investigation was conducted by Kimberly A. Cain, Jennifer R. Turner, Timothy L. Evans, and Ty S. Martinez and supervised by Jonathan P. Scott and David L. Peavler of the Fort Worth Regional Office.
