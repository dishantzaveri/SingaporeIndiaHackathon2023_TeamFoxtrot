RONALD C. BLACK, RUSSELL W.BROWN AND MAY B. OWENS, 95 Civ. 8766 (MP) (S.D.N.Y.)The Commission announced today that, on December 30, 1996, theUnited States District Court for the Southern District of NewYork, entered final judgments by default against defendant RonaldC. Black (Black) and relief defendant May B. Owens (Owens),his wife.  Under the judgments, the court:  (1) permanentlyenjoined Black from committing securities fraud; and (2) orderedBlack and Owens, jointly and severally, to pay disgorgement of$25,000 and to pay prejudgment interest of $7,817.98.  In the complaint, filed on October 16, 1995, the Commissionalleged that in July 1993, Black, in concert with defendantRussell W. Brown (Brown), then a corrections officer at theprison where Black was imprisoned at the time, defrauded NomuraSecurities International, Inc. (Nomura).  Specifically, Black,using a cellular telephone that Brown had provided, calledNomura\s New York City offices, opened a securities account undera fictitious corporate name, and placed orders to purchasesecurities.  In furtherance of this scheme to defraud, Black madematerial misrepresentations to Nomura about his ability to payfor these securities.  In addition, Black, Brown, or someoneworking in concert with them, telephoned Nomura, posed as anofficial of Nomura\s bank and claimed falsely that Black hadtransferred funds to Nomura\s account for the benefit of Black. Black then instructed Nomura to wire a portion of those funds toBrown and Owens.  After Nomura initiated the wire transfers,Nomura learned that its bank had not received any funds fromBlack.  Although Nomura was able to stop the transfer to Brownbefore Brown received the money, Owens received the $25,000 thathad been transferred to her. On May 9, 1996, the Court entered a final judgment by consentagainst Brown, pursuant to which Brown -- who consented to theentry of the judgment without admitting or denying theallegations in the complaint -- was enjoined permanently fromviolating the antifraud provisions, Section 10(b) of theSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, and ordered topay a total of $6,154.80 in disgorgement and prejudgmentinterest.  Payment of the disgorgement and prejudgment interestwas waived, and the court did not impose civil penalties, basedon Brown\s demonstrated inability to pay.On September 24, 1996, Black was indicted by a federal grand juryin Denver, Colorado on nine counts of wire fraud and aiding andabetting in violation of 18 U.S.C. \x15\x15 1343 and 2, based on some\x0c==========================================START OF PAGE 2======of the same conduct alleged in the Commission\s complaint.

Galluzzi received between\rApril 1987 and December 1993 in connection with issuances of\rmunicipal securities by Essex County, New Jersey (Essex\rCounty), the Essex County Improvement Authority (ECIA) and the\rTownship of Irvington, New Jersey (Irvington). \r\rNamed in the Complaint is:\r\r     Joseph P. Galluzzi, age 64, a resident of Springfield, New\r     Jersey.  During the period of the conduct alleged in the\r     Complaint, Joseph P. Galluzzi was either a financial\r     consultant to the Freeholders of Essex County, a financial\r     consultant to Essex County, or the Treasurer of Essex\r     County; and was a financial consultant to the Municipal\r     Council of Irvington.\r\rThe Complaint alleges that:\r\r     In 1986, Joseph P. Galluzzi and George L. Tuttle, Jr.\r     (Tuttle), on behalf of First Fidelity Securities Group\r     (FFSG), entered into a kickback arrangement.  Under this\r     agreement, Joseph P. Galluzzi would obtain underwriting\r     business in Essex County for FFSG and, in return, FFSG would\r     pay Joseph P. Galluzzi a kickback based upon the amount of\r     bonds issued by Essex County that FFSG underwrote.  This\r     kickback agreement was not disclosed.\r\r     Between April 1987 and February 1991, FFSG paid Joseph P.\r     Galluzzi over $145,000 in kickbacks in connection with Essex\r     County\s March 1987, January 1989 and June 1989 Offerings of\r     debt.  Joseph P. Galluzzi concealed the kickbacks by\r     submitting false invoices to FFSG for services allegedly\r     rendered on unrelated bond transactions outside of Essex\r     County, and by denying he had a financial relationship with\r     FFSG.\r\r     In 1991, Tuttle expressed to Joseph P.

Tuttle,\r     on behalf of FFSG, also agreed to pay Joseph P. Galluzzi for\r     his help in having FFSG selected as the lead underwriter on\r     the Irvington Offerings.  Again, this kickback agreement was\r     not disclosed.\r\r     In August 1991, Irvington issued the Irvington BANs, and in\r     February 1992, Irvington issued the Irvington FYABs.  On\r     both of those issues, FFSG was the lead underwriter.  At the\r     time of the Irvington Offerings, Joseph P. Galluzzi was the\r     budget and financial consultant to the Municipal Council of\r     Irvington.  FFSG paid Joseph P. Galluzzi $31,000 in\r     kickbacks in connection with the Irvington Offerings. \r\r     Joseph P. Galluzzi also received from A.G. Edwards & Sons,\r     Inc. (AGE) undisclosed kickbacks relating to the ECIA\s\r     August 1990 $65 million bond issue (the ECIA Offering). \r     Joseph P. Galluzzi was the financial consultant to Essex\r     County, on whose behalf the ECIA Offering was made.  Between\r     March 1991 and December 1993, AGE paid Joseph P. Galluzzi at\r     least $82,085.82 under a sham finder\s agreement contract.\r\r     As a result of the foregoing, the Commission alleges that\rJoseph P.

The Commission also\rannounced  the  prior entry  of  a  Final Judgment  of  Permanent\rInjunction  by  default  separately against  each  of  defendants\rWilliam  Hanke and Dove Investment Group,  Inc., both of Orlando,\rFlorida.\r\r     The Final Judgment  entered against defendant Deyon  enjoins\rDeyon from violating the antifraud and broker-dealer registration\rprovisions of the federal securities laws, i.e., Section 17(a) of\rthe  Securities Act of 1933  and Sections 10(b)  and 15(a) of the\rSecurities Exchange of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

According to the  Complaint,\rthe defendants represented that they could pay such extraordinary\rrates  of return  because  the proceeds  of the  investment sales\rwould  be  deposited  into  a  special  Mexican  bank  account,\rcontrolled  by  them,  which  they  claimed generated  investment\rreturns  or earned interest of approximately 1020% per year.  The\rCommission also  alleged that, in some  instances, the defendants\rtold investors and potential investors that the account would  be\rused  to  engage in  the trading  of  instruments referred  to as\rPrime Bank securities.\r\r     The Complaint  alleged  that, contrary  to  the  defendants\\rrepresentations to  investors and  potential investors,  the bank\raccount  into which the proceeds  of the investment offering were\rdeposited  did   not  earn  the  extraordinary   rate  of  return\rdescribed,  the investments  involved an extraordinary  amount of\rrisk and the Prime  Bank securities which were said  to produce\rthe return do not  exist.  Moreover, the Commission  alleged that\rat no relevant  time had  any of the  defendants been  registered\rwith the  Commission as  securities broker-dealers  or associated\rwith such a broker-dealer as they were required to be.\r\r      The  defendants  allegedly   targeted  persons  active   in\revangelical Christian ministries of which  the defendants purport\rto be devout followers.  According to the  Complaint, many of the\rinvestors and  potential  investors solicited  by the  defendants\rwere  of  modest  economic  means and  were  unsophisticated  and\rinexperienced  in financial  matters.   The  defendants allegedly\rencouraged  potential investors  to take  extraordinary steps  to\robtain money  to invest  including obtaining second  mortgages on\rtheir residences and procuring  large cash advances against their\rcredit cards.\r\r     On July  25,  1995, based  on the  Complaint and  supporting\revidence submitted by the Commission ex parte, the Court  entered\ra   Temporary Restraining Order prohibiting all of the defendants\rfrom continuing  their fraudulent  offer and sale  of securities.\rThe  Court\s  order  also  froze  certain  assets,  required  the\rdefendants to file sworn accountings and ordered the repatriation\rof investor  funds held  abroad.

The complaint alleges that\rbeginning in December 1992, Douenias, with Adoni\s knowledge,\rengaged in the prebilling of invoices for goods which had not\rbeen shipped and used the customer sales invoices for the\rprebilled sales to obtain funds from one of the company\s\rlenders.

District Court for the\rDistrict of Massachusetts (the Court) issued a Final Judgment\rof Permanent Injunction against William P. Dillon (Dillon). \rDillon, who consented to this order without admitting or denying\rthe allegations in the complaint, was enjoined from further\rviolations of the antifraud provisions contained in Section 17(a)\rof the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities\rExchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Dillon also was\rbarred from maintaining any interest in any margin account and\rfrom purchasing or selling securities on margin and ordered to\rdisgorge $235,498.94, plus prejudgment interest thereon.  This\ramount represents losses Dillon avoided by failing to pay margin\rdebits at five broker-dealer firms.\r\r     The complaint, filed on June 19, 1996, alleged that Dillon\rdeceived several broker-dealers by conducting a fraudulent margin\rtrading scheme.  On July 2, 1990, Dillon, as a result of a prior\rCommission enforcement action, was barred by the Court for a\rperiod of five years from maintaining a margin account and from\rtrading on margin.  The complaint alleged that Dillon, in order\rto avoid this restriction, opened margin accounts at five broker-\rdealers in January 1995 using the name and social security number\rof a maintenance man he employed.  Dillon also submitted inflated\rnet worth and income figures to the broker-dealers in order to\rinduce the firms to open margin accounts.  Between January and\rJune 1995, Dillon deposited his own funds into the five accounts\rand, by impersonating the maintenance man, engaged in hundreds of\rsecurities transactions.  The Commission\s complaint alleged that\rDillon made the trades without an intention or the means to pay\rfor the trades if large losses resulted.\r\r     In June 1995, Dillon\s scheme unraveled when he placed two\rorders, each to sell 100 call options contracts, for the common\rstock of Lotus Development Corporation (Lotus) without owning\reither the call options or the underlying Lotus stock.  On June\r5, 1995, International Business Machines announced a tender offer\rfor all of the outstanding stock of Lotus, causing a substantial\rrise in the price of Lotus.  Dillon, who became obligated to\rpurchase 20,000 shares of Lotus stock to cover his option\rposition, sustained a loss of approximately $450,000.  Dillon did\rnot have sufficient funds to purchase the necessary Lotus stock. \rConsequently, the broker-dealer through which Dillon had\rpurchased the call options became obligated to make the purchase\rand suffered a loss of approximately $219,000.\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\r\r                              - 2 -\r\r     On June 18, 1996, Dillon was indicted on charges of mail\rfraud, criminal contempt and deceptive use of a social security\rnumber in connection with the same conduct alleged in the\rCommission\s action.

The Court will set\rthe specific amount of disgorgement and civil penalties in a\rsubsequent hearing.  Berus and Harper consented, without\radmitting or denying the allegations in the Commission\s\rcomplaint, to the entry of the Order.\r\r     The Complaint, filed on September 30, 1996, alleged, among\rother things, that during the period from 1990 through 1994,\rBerus and Harper, along with their sales agents, defrauded a\rtotal of approximately 120 investors through the offer and sale\rof $3 million in securities.  Specifically, Berus and Harper\roffered and sold fictitious certificates of deposit (CDs) issued\rby a purported international bank, Century Security Bank and\rTrust, Ltd. (Century Security).  Furthermore, in two separate\rscams, Berus sold interests in the Profit Masters Group (Profit\rMasters) and Meca International, Inc. (Meca), both were\rinvestment clubs.\r\r     In connection therewith, CD investors were told that they\rwere purchasing variable rate CDs, with their money to be used by\rCentury Security to finance various business ventures. \rInvestment club investors were told that their funds would be\rpooled to purchase common stocks.  Depending on the investment\rscam, investors were promised annual returns ranging from 8% to\r24%.  In return for the investments, Berus and Harper generally\rsent investors confirmations for the funds invested and\rfictitious monthly and/or annual account statements which lulled\rinvestors into believing the legitimacy of the investments.  In\raddition, Berus and Harper sometimes paid investors purported\rmonthly interest on their investments, and, in some instances,\rreturns of portions of their principal.\r\r     Despite the above representations regarding Century\rSecurity, Profit Masters and Meca, however, Berus and Harper did\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\rnot invest the money as represented.  Instead, Berus and Harper,\rin connection with Century Security, and Berus, in connection\rwith Profit Masters and Meca, simply operated separate ponzi\rschemes.  In each of the three schemes, investor money was\rdeposited into brokerage \r\r                              - 2 -\r\raccounts, bank accounts and a credit union account, all of which\rBerus and/or Harper controlled.  Undisclosed to investors, Berus\rand Harper then used investor funds to pay personal and business\rexpenses, to make payments to prior investors and to\runsuccessfully trade in speculative investments, including\rcommodity futures and options.  Consequently, returns to existing\rinvestors were dependent upon the ability of Berus and Harper to\rcontinually raise additional funds from new investors. \rFurthermore, in contravention to Berus\ and Harper\s\rrepresentations, Century Security was not even a legitimate\rbanking operation.  Thus, in connection with the offer, purchase\rand sale of securities, misrepresentations and omissions of\rmaterial fact were made regarding the legitimacy of the\rinvestments, the returns to be expected, the risks involved, the\rcommissions received and the use of investor proceeds.\x0c\x1a"

Stein and Greene also freely used investor\rfunds to support their lavish lifestyles, including payments for\rexpensive cars, homes, jewelry, and other luxury items.\r\r     On December 16, 1996, Neal Stein pleaded guilty to\rsecurities fraud and tax evasion.  He faces a maximum sentence of\r10 years imprisonment and a fine of $1,100,000.  On September 30,\r1996, Embras pleaded guilty to securities fraud and faces\rimprisonment and a fine of up to $1,000,000.  These guilty pleas\rare the product of an ongoing investigation by Postal Inspector\rCatherine Budig of the United States Postal Service and Special\rAgent Darren Slotsve of the Internal Revenue Service.\r\r     The Commissions Complaint alleges, among other things, that\rfrom December 1987 through March 1995, Mustang, Tower, Stein, and\rGreene raised approximately $139 million through the offer and\rsale of units in some 60 oil and gas limited partnerships.  For\reach of the partnerships, the defendants told investors that most\rof their money would be used to purchase interests in oil and gas\rwells and that investors would receive returns based on oil and\rgas revenue.  In contrast to these representations, the\rdefendants conducted an investment scheme that commingled\rinvestor funds and assets from the various partnerships, and, in\rsome partnerships, used virtually none of the investor funds to\rpurchase oil and gas properties.  Instead, Mustang, Tower, Stein,\rand Greene used millions of dollars from investors to finance the\rPonzi scheme, Steins and Greenes extravagant lifestyles, and\rother, unrelated business ventures owned by Stein and Greene.  \r\r     To further deceive investors, Embras, Towers geologist,\rcreated false production reports for the alleged oil and gas\rwells owned by the partnerships.

Jan. 29, 1997)\r\r     The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a Complaint\rtoday charging Jay Marcus, former president of Halsey Drug Co.,\rInc., with (1) violations of the antifraud provisions of the\rfederal securities laws based upon Marcus\ insider trading and\r(2) violations of the antifraud and reporting provisions of the\rfederal securities laws arising from Halsey\s filing of false\rannual reports with the Commission.\r\r     The Complaint alleges that from at least January 1990\rthrough March 1993, Halsey,  whose principal place of business is\rin Brooklyn, New York, manufactured and sold certain adulterated\rgeneric drugs.  Marcus knew of the drug adulteration and that the\radulteration was being concealed from the United States Food and\rDrug Administration (FDA) and the public.  In February 1992,\rwhile in possession of material, non-public information regarding\rHalsey\s manufacture and sale of adulterated drug products,\rMarcus sold 70,000 shares of Halsey common stock.  After Halsey\s\rMarch 30, 1993 public disclosure regarding its manufacture and\rsale of adulterated drug products, the price of Halsey\s stock\rdropped approximately 49%.  Additionally, Halsey filed materially\rfalse and misleading annual reports with the Commission for\rfiscal years ended December 31, 1990 and 1991.  Marcus reviewed\rand signed these annual reports, knowing that they were\rmaterially false and misleading.\r\r     The Complaint seeks the following relief: (1) a permanent\rinjunction against future violation of the federal securities\rlaws; (2) disgorgement of an amount equal to the losses Marcus\ravoided by selling shares of Halsey stock prior to the public\rannouncement regarding Halsey\s adulteration of drug products,\rplus prejudgment interest; (3) civil penalties for insider\rtrading and violations relating to Halsey\s filing of a false and\rmisleading annual report for the fiscal year ended December 31,\r1991; and (4) an order barring Marcus from serving as an officer\ror director of any public company.\r\r     In a related proceeding, on January 29, 1997 the Commission\rsimultaneously instituted and settled an administrative\rproceeding against Halsey.  There, the Commission made findings\rthat Halsey\s annual reports for fiscal years ended December 31,\r1990 and 1991 were materially false and misleading because they\rfailed to disclose that Halsey was not manufacturing drugs in\raccordance with certain standards promulgated by the FDA, but was\rusing unapproved formulas and procedures, and Halsey employees,\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\rat management\s direction, were concealing product adulteration\rfrom the FDA.  These annual reports also failed to disclose that\rsince Halsey was not manufacturing generic drugs in accordance\rwith certain FDA standards, FDA approval for any or all of\rHalsey\s new products could be adversely affected.  Halsey\rneither admitted nor denied these findings, but consented to the\rentry of Commission\s Order requiring Halsey to cease and desist\rfrom committing or causing any violation and any future violation\rof the antifraud and reporting provisions of the federal\rsecurities laws.

HUTTOE, ET AL.,\rCivil Action No. 96-02543 (GK)(D.D.C.)\r\rUNITED STATES v. CHARLES O. HUTTOE, Cr. 96-429-A (JC)(E.D.Va.)\r\r     The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that the\rHonorable James C. Catheris, United States District Judge for the\rEastern District of Virginia, today sentenced Charles O. Huttoe\r(Huttoe), formerly the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of\rSystems of Excellence, Inc. (SOE) to a federal prison term of\r46 months followed by 2 years supervised release and a $10,000\rfine.  Huttoe was sentenced pursuant to a criminal information\rcharging him with one count of securities fraud in violation of\rSection 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and\rone count of money laundering in violation of 18 U.S.C. \x15 1957. \rHuttoe entered into a plea agreement with the government on\rNovember 13, 1996.  Both the criminal information and the plea\ragreement were filed under seal and remained sealed until late\ryesterday.\r\r     On November 7, 1996, the Commission obtained a Temporary\rRestraining Order (TRO) against Huttoe and others based on a\rcomplaint alleging a massive securities fraud at SOE.  The TRO\ramong other things prohibited ongoing violations of the\rsecurities laws, froze Huttoe\s assets and prohibited him from\rtraveling outside the United States.  The criminal case against\rHuttoe was the result of a coordinated investigative effort by\rthe Commission, the U.S. Attorney\s Office for the Eastern\rDistrict of Virginia and the Internal Revenue Service - Criminal\rInvestigation Division from Northern Virginia and Las Vegas,\rNevada.  Huttoe\s plea agreement requires that he cooperate in\rongoing investigations conducted by the U.S. Attorney\s Office\rand the Securities and Exchange Commission.\r\r     The criminal information alleged that, in connection with\rthe securities fraud count, from March 1995 through September\r1996, Huttoe, in his capacity as Chairman and CEO of SOE,\rdirected and controlled a massive distribution of the company\s\rstock.  In particular, the criminal information alleges that\rHuttoe distributed approximately 11 million shares of\runregistered SOE stock to certain nominees, including three of\rhis relatives, under his control.  Although fraudulently created\rdocuments indicated that the shares had been issued to Huttoe\s\rnominees in exchange for services rendered to the company, in\rfact these nominees did not provide such services to SOE.  The\rcriminal information further states that, pursuant to a scheme to\rmanipulate the market price of SOE stock, after the issuance of a\rnumber of false press releases which caused an increase in the\rprice of the stock, Huttoe directed the sale of the shares issued\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\rto his nominees.  According to the information Huttoe realized\rmillions of dollars of trading profits as a result of the sale of\rthe nominee shares.  In connection with the money laundering\rcount, the criminal information further alleged that Huttoe\rsubsequently transferred approximately $7.55 million of the\rtrading profits from brokerage accounts opened in the names of\rthe nominees to at least four different bank accounts opened in\rthe names of the nominees.  Thereafter, Huttoe transferred\rapproximately $7.3 million from these accounts to an account at\rPatriot National Bank in Virginia.  Finally, Huttoe transferred\rapproximately $7.2 million out of this account by wire or check\rto various individuals or entities.       \r\r     The Commission also announced that on January 21, 1997, at a\rhearing in the Commission\s case against Huttoe and others in\rUnited States District Court for the District of Columbia, the\rHonorable Gladys Kessler granted in part the Commission\s motion\rto amend its Complaint.  The amended Complaint names eleven\rindividuals and entities as relief defendants for the purpose of\rsecuring the disgorgement of more than $12 million in illegal\rprofits that the Commission previously alleged were obtained from\rthe sale of SOE securities by Huttoe, members of his family and\rentities he controls (collectively the Huttoe defendants).  The\rCourt also granted the Commission\s motion to amend the Complaint\rto add additional claims against defendants SGA Goldstar\rResearch, Inc., Theodore Melcher, Shannon B. Terry, Alpha\rSecurities Ltd. and Dunbar Holdings, Ltd. (collectively the\rGoldstar defendants).   As amended, the Complaint alleges that\rthe Goldstar defendants engaged in a systematic practice of\rpublishing highly promotional investment recommendations for\rnumerous issuers in exchange for compensation.  The amended\rComplaint alleges that the Goldstar defendants failed to disclose\reither their compensation or whether they were selling their\rshares in the companies they were touting while they were\rrecommending that subscribers to their newsletter purchase shares\rin those companies. \r\r     Previously the Court issued orders freezing the assets of\rthe Huttoe defendants and the Goldstar defendants.  The Court\rcontinued that emergency relief, which includes freezes on the\rfunds transferred by the Huttoe defendants to the relief\rdefendants, until the next hearing in this matter, which is set\rfor March 7, 1997 at 9:30 a.m.  See SEC v.

The Complaint alleged\rthat Pace engaged in a fraudulent scheme that resulted in\rValley\s filing with the Commission three quarterly reports that\rmaterially overstated net income.  According to the Complaint,\rthe overstatements of net income resulted from improperly\rcapitalizing certain costs, understating workers\ compensation\rinsurance expenses, and improperly recording loans from officers\ras revenue.  The Complaint further alleged that Pace falsified\rcertain of Valley\s books and records, provided false\rexplanations to Valley\s auditors for amounts capitalized and\rfalsely claimed that monies loaned to Valley were revenue from\rsales of equipment.  In addition, the Complaint alleged that\rafter Valley\s fourth quarter of fiscal 1992, Pace recorded $1.14\rmillion in fictitious revenue in Valley\s books and records as of\rthe last day of the fourth quarter, then told Valley\s auditors\rthat the fictitious revenue derived from the sale of Valley\s\rcleaning services.

The order permanently enjoins Freitag from\rcommitting future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of\rthe Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b), 15(a)(1) and 15(c)(1)\rof the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 15c1-2\rpromulgated thereunder.\r\rThe Commission\s complaint arose out of a Ponzi scheme Freitag\roperated between 1993 and 1995.  Freitag defrauded at least 240\rinvestors of nearly $7 million.  Freitag told investors that he\rcould obtain immediate returns of up to 10% by pooling their\rfunds and subsequently using the pool to invest in certain\runspecified mutual funds.  Freitag gave an additional incentive\rfor investment by telling prospective investors that the mutual\rfunds offered guaranteed annual returns of up to 25% and had no\rrisk of loss.

Securities Litigation, a securities fraud class\raction case pending before the U.S. District Court for the\rNorthern District of California.  The court dismissed the\rplaintiffs\ original complaint after finding that it did not meet\rthe strict pleading requirements imposed by the Private\rSecurities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  One of the grounds for\rdismissing the complaint was the court\s determination that under\rthe Reform Act it was no longer sufficient for a complaint to\rallege reckless behavior on the part of defendants.  Rather, the\rcourt held, plaintiffs must allege conscious behavior by the\rdefendants and create a strong inference of knowing\rmisrepresentations.  With respect to some of the allegations, the\rCourt gave leave to the plaintiffs to amend the complaint.  The\ramended complaint is now the subject of a new motion to dismiss.\r\r     The Commission\s brief urges the district court to\rreconsider its earlier decision and to hold that recklessness is\rsufficient for liability under Section 10(b) of the Securities\rExchange Act of 1934 and the Commission\s Rule 10b-5.  In the\rCommission\s view, the Reform Act made no change in the\rdefinition of the state of mind required to be shown in a private\rsecurities fraud action (except in the case of certain forward-\rlooking statements entitled to the protection of a safe\rharbor).  In adopting a strict procedural standard for pleading\rstate of mind in private actions, Congress did not intend to\ralter the substantive scope of the securities laws by eliminating\rrecklessness in such cases.\r\r     The Commission has consistently supported a recklessness\rstandard for Section 10(b) liability in both Commission and\rprivate actions under the federal securities laws because such a\rstandard is needed to protect investors and the securities\rmarkets from fraudulent conduct and to protect the integrity of\rthe disclosure process.  The recklessness standard discourages\rdeliberate ignorance and also prevents defendants from escaping\rliability simply because of the difficulty of proving knowledge\ror conscious intent on the basis of the circumstantial evidence\rfrequently used in securities fraud cases.  A retreat from the\rrecklessness standard would greatly erode the deterrent effect of\rSection 10(b) actions.  \r\r     In its brief, the Commission points out that every court of\rappeals that has considered the question of the required degree\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\rof state of mind, has held that recklessness is sufficient to\restablish liability under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5.  A \r\r                              - 2 -\r\rhearing on the defendants\ motion to dismiss the amended\rcomplaint has been scheduled for March 21, 1997.\x0c\x1a"

JWK,\rheadquartered in Farmington Hills, Michigan, is conducting its\rGerman Bond business from its branch office in Miami, Florida. \rJames Wilder Korth (Korth), JWK\s president, age 46 of Coconut\rGrove, Florida, is also named as a defendant in the lawsuit.\r\r     The suit seeks, among other relief (described-below), an\remergency temporary restraining order directing JWK and Korth to\rimmediately turn over to the SEC certain records relating to the\rGerman Bonds.  The SEC\s complaint and supporting papers allege\rthat JWK, under Korth\s direction, has repeatedly refused to give\rthe SEC true and complete copies of records containing the\rcertificate numbers for these German Bonds in violation of\rSections 17(a)(1) and 17(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of\r1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule and 17a-4(j) thereunder.  The SEC\rcharges that Korth violated these provisions as an aider and\rabettor, pursuant to Section 20(f) of the Exchange Act.  The SEC\ralleges that the defendants\ willful defiance of the law has\rinterfered with the SEC\s well-settled powers to examine the\rbooks and records of a registered broker-dealer and has hindered\rthe SEC\s efforts to determine whether their offering of the\rGerman Bonds violates other provisions of the federal securities\rlaws.\r\r     According to its complaint, the SEC has received preliminary\rinformation tending to indicate that the vast majority of the\rGerman Bonds currently in circulation may be invalid and\runredeemable.  The SEC\s supporting papers reflect that the\rGerman Government has established an elaborate procedure for\rredeeming the Bonds, one element of which requires the bondholder\rto prove that the Bond had not been previously stolen.  According\rto the SEC, the German Government takes the position that the\rvast majority of the German Bonds are no longer valid for\rredemption because they were either stolen, previously exchanged\rfor new debt instruments, or were kept in the Russian-occupied\rterritory of Berlin after World War II and subsequently came into\rcirculation.\r\r     Accordingly, the SEC stresses that investors and those who\rmay advise them, particularly broker-dealers and investment\radvisors, should be keenly aware of the German Government\s\rposition regarding the potential invalidity of these Bonds.\x0c\r\r\r\r\r\r     In addition to an emergency Order directing JWK and Korth to\rprovide certain records relating to the German Bonds, the SEC is\rseeking in its lawsuit an Order preventing the destruction of\rrecords, preliminary and permanent injunctions, and a civil\rpenalty.\x0c\x1a"

The jury found that\rWarde violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities\rlaws (Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act and\rRules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder).\r\r     The Commission alleged that, in June and July 1987, Edward\rR. Downe, Jr. (Downe) provided Warde with material, nonpublic\rinformation concerning a possible buyout, restructuring or tender\roffer for Kidde, Inc. (Kidde).  At that time, Downe was a\rmember of Kidde\s Board of Directors and Warde\s friend.  The\rCommission alleged that, after receiving this information from\rDowne, Warde purchased Kidde warrants for various accounts at\rShearson Lehman Brothers, Inc. and Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc.  \r\r     The jury unanimously found that Downe breached his fiduciary\rduty as a Kidde director by providing material nonpublic\rinformation to Warde and that Warde violated the antifraud\rprovisions of the federal securities laws when he and his half-\rbrother bought Kidde warrants on several occasions from June 29,\r1987 through the early morning of July 7, 1987.  Later during the\rmorning of July 7, 1987, Kidde announced publicly that, inter\ralia, it was considering options for a buyout or a restructuring,\rhad retained investment bankers and was talking with prospective\rbidders.  The jury also unaminously found that Downe again\rillegally tipped Warde and Warde violated the antifraud\rprovisions when Warde and his half-brother bought more Kidde\rwarrants on July 20, 1987.  On August 5, 1987, Kidde announced\rthat it had reached an agreement with the Hanson Trust PLC\r(Hanson) for Hanson to acquire Kidde.  The Commission alleged\rthat this trading activity resulted in $950,000 in illicit\rprofits.\r\r     For relief, the Commission seeks:  a) a permanent injunction\ragainst Warde, enjoining him from violating the antifraud\rprovisions set forth above; b) disgorgement of illicit trading\rprofits and prejudgment interest; and c) payment by Warde of\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\rcivil penalties under the Insider Trading Sanctions Act of 1984\rof up to three times those illicit trading profits.  The court\rhas yet to decide the issues of relief.\r\r                              - 2 -\r\r     Warde is the last defendant in this civil action that was\rfiled in 1992 against eight defendants (seven socially prominent\rindividuals and one corporation). Five defendants previously\rsettled the Commission\s allegations; judgments on default were\rentered against two other defendants.

According to the Commission\s amended\rcomplaint filed on March 4, 1993, the defendants engaged in\rinsider trading by purchasing the securities of Motel 6, L.P.\r(Motel 6) while in possession of material, nonpublic\rinformation concerning a planned tender offer for the company. \r\r     On November 27, 1996, January 15, 1997, and January 28,\r1997, the Court entered Final Consent Judgments of Permanent\rInjunction and Other Relief against Chammah, Elbaum, and Schaen,\rrespectively.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of\rthe amended complaint, Chammah, Elbaum, and Schaen each consented\rto a permanent injunction from violating Sections 10(b) and 14(e)\rof the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3\rthereunder.  Chammah agreed to pay $206,542.51 in disgorgement of\rprofits and prejudgment interest thereon and to pay a civil\rpenalty of $127,098.09 pursuant to the Insider Trading and\rSecurities Fraud Enforcement Act of 1988 (ITSFEA).  The\rCommission agreed that Elbaum would not pay a civil penalty\rpursuant to ITSFEA in light of a demonstrated inability to pay\rbased upon his sworn representations in a statement of financial\rcondition.  Schaen agreed to pay $217,332.48 in disgorgement of\rprofits and prejudgment interest thereon, but in light of a\rdemonstrated inability to pay based upon his sworn\rrepresentations in a statement of financial condition, the\rCommission agreed that payment of all but $36,000 would be waived\rand Schaen would not pay a civil penalty pursuant to ITSFEA.\r\r     On December 20, 1996 and January 14, 1997, the Court entered\rJudgments by Default against Gorman and Petrotto, respectively. \rThe default judgments permanently enjoin Gorman and Petrotto from\rfurther violations of Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities\rExchange Act of 1934, and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder. \x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\rGorman was ordered to disgorge trading profits of $717,233 and\rprejudgment interest thereon in the amount of $519,634.76, and to\r\r                              - 2 -\r\rpay a civil penalty of $2,151,699 pursuant to ITSFEA.

Harris,\ralong with Shawzin, tipped Gorman and Michael Newman (Newman). \rHarris\ tippees also went on to tip others.  Newman tipped\rElbaum.

Fla., Civil\rAction No. 97-8064-CIV-HURLEY, Complaint filed January 30, 1997)\r\r         The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on\rJanuary 30, 1997, it filed a complaint in the United States\rDistrict Court for the Southern District of Florida against\rRonald J. Mitchellette (Mitchellette), age 60, formerly of Palm\rBeach, Florida, and Robert Hardy (Hardy), age 63, of Palm\rBeach, Florida.  Mitchellette was the former CEO and chairman of\rthe board of Carlisle-Asher Management Company (CAMC), a now\rdefunct investment advisory firm which operated from Palm Beach,\rFlorida during 1992 and 1993.  Hardy, during 1993, served as CAMC\rs president, chief operating officer and a director.  \r\r     In its complaint the Commission alleges that, in connection\rwith a private offering of debt securities by CAMC, Mitchellette\rand Hardy, by jointly preparing and using a fraudulent offering\rdocument, engaged in securities fraud. The Commission further\ralleges that the defendants  fraud caused approximately $1\rmillion in losses to investors. According to the Commission s\rcomplaint, CAMC\s offering document was false and misleading,\rcontaining material misrepresentations and omissions consisting\rof the following: 1) The inflation of the value of CAMC\s\radvisory portfolio--an exaggeration calculated to attribute to\rCAMC an unrealistic fee-generating capacity. It was represented\rthat CAMC managed more than $140 million when, in fact, the firm\rmanaged approximately $5 million; 2) The false characterization\rof the status of negotiations for the acquisition by CAMC of\ranother advisory company with $45 million under management. It\rwas represented that CAMC had entered into a purchase agreement\rwith a firm closing date when, in fact, the two parties were\rinvolved in only preliminary discussions; 3) The inclusion of\rmisleading financial statements which materially overstated\rCAMC\s net worth by at least $298,000; 4) The misrepresentation\rof the brokerage commission paid in connection with sales of\rCAMC\s securities as 8% when, in fact, the commission was 12%;\rand 5) The fraudulent concealment from CAMC\s investors that two\rof the firm\s officers and/or directors had resigned.\r\r         In its complaint the Commission further alleges that\rMitchellette misappropriated more than $258,000 of CAMC\s\roffering proceeds to purchase, through an elaborate scheme, newly\rissued shares of common stock of a Palm Beach, Florida holding\rcompany, Governors Bank Corp. In the complaint it is alleged that\rMitchellette utilized a nominee company to carry out this portion\rof the scheme.\r\r         The Commission alleges that the defendants  preparation\rand use of the fraudulent offering document, together with\rMitchellette s misappropriation of offering proceeds, was in \rviolation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\rSecurities Act ), as well as Section 10(b) of the Securities\rExchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act ) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.\rThe Commission seeks in its lawsuit permanent injunctions against\rMitchellette and Hardy, disgorgement of their ill-gotten profits\rand monetary penalties.\x0c\x1a"

That beginning before the time of Crazy\r          Eddie\s initial public offering in September \r          1984 and continuing up to 1987, Antar carried\r          out various schemes to falsify the books and \r          records of Crazy Eddie so as to make the\r          company\s financial performance appear\r          stronger that it actually was;\r\r     !     That in 1985 he caused the value of the\r          inventory of Crazy Eddie reported to its\r          auditors to be falsely overstated by\r          approximately $2 million;\r\r     !     That he caused the inventory counts to be\r          artificially inflated by the falsification of\r          count sheets or inventory tickets when Crazy \r          Eddie took a physical inventory at the end of\r          its fiscal year on March 2, 1986, thereby\r          overstating the inventory by approximately\r          $10 million;\r\r     !

That his primary purpose in perpetrating\r          these fraudulent schemes was to increase the\r          price of Crazy Eddie stock to public\r          investors.\r\rEnforcing the Commission\s $73 Million Judgment\r\r     In September 1989 the Securities and Exchange Commission\rcommenced an enforcement action against Antar and others.   In\rFebruary 1990, Antar fled the United States to avoid\rincarceration for defying a court order that he repatriate $53\rmillion that he had spirited overseas.  On July 16, 1990, the SEC\robtained a judgment for $73,496,432, plus interest, against Eddie\rAntar in the United States District Court for the District of New\rJersey.  For more than six years, Antar refused to comply with\rthe Final Judgment.  \r\r     To enforce the Final Judgment, the SEC commenced a world-\rwide effort to locate and return Antar\s ill-gotten assets to the\rUnited States for distribution to the victims of Antar\s crimes. \rUsing information sharing mechanisms with foreign securities\rauthorities and other international evidence gathering\rmechanisms, the SEC and the Trustee began unprecedented actions\rin six foreign countries to secure Antar\s ill-gotten gains;\rthese efforts were critical to the success of this case,\rresulting in Antar\s arrest in Israel and subsequent extradition\rto the United States, as well as the recovery of approximately\r$64 million.\r \r     On two occasions, Antar has consented to the return of\rforeign-based assets.  Near the conclusion of his 1994 sentencing\rhearing,1 Antar signed consents and directives for the return of\rnearly $53 million and thereby ceased his defiance of the\rFebruary 1990 order requiring him to repatriate that amount,\rwhich he had spirited out of the country.  Nevertheless, after\rMarch 1994, he persisted in his resistance to the Final Judgment\rby continuing to litigate against the SEC and the Trustee in \rEngland,  Liechtenstein and Zurich, Switzerland.  This litigation\rended when, on December 13, 1996, he signed consents and\r                    \r\r    1     Antar was tried and convicted on a 17  count indictment\rin  July 1993 and sentenced to twelve years imprisonment in April\r1994.  In April  1995, the Third Circuit reversed  his conviction\ron the  ground that the  trial judge\s remarks  during sentencing\rcreated an appearance of bias.\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 3======\r\rdirectives for the return of approximately $8.5 million that\rremained in Switzerland and Liechtenstein. \r\rSummary of the Foreign Enforcement Litigation\r\r     Switzerland.  In July 1993, the Trustee filed civil actions\rin Geneva and Zurich seeking to enforce the Final Judgment and to\rlevy against approximately $48 million that Antar maintained in\rthose two cantons.  Antar opposed both actions.  In November\r1993, a trial court in Geneva held a full hearing on the merits. \rAt his sentencing hearing in March 1994, Antar consented to the\rreturn of approximately $40 million that he had deposited in\rGeneva.  Shortly thereafter, the Geneva court made public its\rdecision recognizing the Final Judgment.  Antar appealed the\rGeneva court s decision.  But the Court of Appeal in Geneva\rupheld the lower court s determination that the Final Judgment\rwas enforceable throughout Switzerland.\r\r     On July 19, 1996, the Court of Appeal of the Canton of\rZurich held that the SEC s Final Judgment was entitled to\rrecognition there because of the previous decision in favor of\rthe Trustee entered by the Court of Appeal in Geneva.  On\rSeptember 13, Antar filed a constitutional appeal of the Zurich\rdecision to the Supreme Court of Switzerland.  However, his\rappeal was rendered moot on December 13, when he signed consents\rand directives for the return of the money in Zurich.  The total\ramount being returned from Zurich is approximately $8.7 million.\r\r     Israel.  On July 7, 1992, the SEC and the Trustee filed an\raction in Israel to enforce the Final Judgment against Antar. \rThat action pertained to nearly $13 million under Antar s\rcontrol.  He opposed the action, and in May 1993, the Israeli\rcourt held a one-day trial on the merits.  In March 1994, before\rthe Israeli court issued a decision, Antar consented to the\rreturn of the $13 million.\r\r     Liechtenstein.  On July 20, 1992, the Trustee commenced a\rcivil action in Liechtenstein.  The Trustee sought to recover\rapproximately $150,000 held at Bank In Liechtenstein in an\raccount in the name of  Conductive Corporation,  a corporation in\rwhich Antar was sole shareholder.  Efforts to recover these funds\rwere rendered moot when Antar consented to the return to the\rUnited States of money from Liechtenstein.\r\r     Canada.  In 1992, the Trustee brought a civil action in\rMontreal seeking to enforce the Final Judgment against $1 million\rthat Antar had deposited in bank accounts there.  The Trustee won\rthe case when Antar failed to file an answer to the complaint,\rand the $1 million was recovered and has been under the Trustee s\rcontrol since 1993.\r\r     United Kingdom.  On July 8, 1992, the SEC commenced\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 4======\r\rproceedings to enforce the Final Judgment in the United Kingdom. \rAfter four years of litigation, on June 11, 1996, the United\rKingdom court ordered that Antar s defense be struck out, and the\rSEC be at liberty to enter final judgment against Antar. \rJudgment was entered on August 30, 1996.

JOHN T. HALL, JOEL CINIERO\rAND MARK KECKEISEN, 97 Civ. 0985 (WK)  S.D.N.Y. \r  \r\rThe former head of a joint venture once heralded as a source of\rrecovery for the victims of the Towers Financial Corporation was\rcharged today with defrauding the same victims.  John T. Hall was\rthe chairman and general partner of Qualis Care, L.P., a joint\rventure in the healthcare receivables business to which Towers\rcontributed over $37 million in cash and other assets.  According\rto the Commission, Hall and an associate, Joel Ciniero, engaged\rin a complex scheme to obtain Towers assets, by assuming control\rof and looting Qualis, while transferring to Qualis securities at\ran inflated price and documenting phony investments.  The\rCommissions complaint alleges that Halls fraud was aided and\rabetted by the third defendant, Mark Keckeisen.  All three\rdefendants have pleaded guilty to criminal charges arising from\rthe Qualis fraud, and are awaiting sentencing.\r\r     The Commissions complaint describes a complex securities\rfraud that began soon after Towers filed for bankruptcy in March\r1993.  Hall was the successful bidder in a court-ordered\rbankruptcy auction in January 1994 for Towers remaining\rbusiness.  Hall committed to contribute an additional $5 million\rand valuable software to Qualis, which was to continue in the\rhealthcare-receivables finance business and generate income to\rTowers creditors, who became Qualiss limited partners. \rInstead, Hall and Ciniero deprived Qualis of $10 million on the\rsame day that the transaction closed, March 18, 1994, by causing\rQualis to pay $10 million to an individual who had made a one-day\r$5 million loan to Hall and (as a quid pro quo for the loan) to\rpurchase for Qualis certain securities for $5 million, although\rthey were worth substantially less.  Having accomplished this\rovernight looting, Hall continued to loot Qualis, transferring at\rleast $6 million of Qualiss funds to a nominees bank account,\rbeyond Qualiss control.  As part of the scheme to defraud\rprospective limited partners of Qualis, Hall produced a false and\rmisleading stock certificate, which was deposited in a Qualis\rbrokerage account.  With Keckeisens assistance, Hall also\rcreated a phony investment agreement, and bogus securities\raccount statements, which were delivered to Qualis.  Whereas\rQualis was funded with $27 million in cash, and accounts\rreceivable worth at least $13 million, for a total of $40 million\r(plus the value of TIRC), Qualis had total assets of\rapproximately $14,726,154 as of March 31, 1996, according to\rQualiss recent bankruptcy filing, or less than half of Towers\roriginal investment in Qualis.  \x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\r     The Commission charged Hall and Ciniero with violations of\rSection 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of\rthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated\rthereunder.  The complaint seeks an injunction against future\rviolations of these antifraud fraud provisions with respect to\rHall and Ciniero, as well as disgorgement of ill-gotten gains,\rprejudgment interest thereon, civil penalties, and an officer-\rand-director bar.

The complaint was filed in the United States District\rCourt for the District of Massachusetts, and seeks a temporary\rrestraining order, an asset freeze, disgorgement, civil monetary\rpenalties, preliminary and permanent injunctions, and other\requitable relief.\r\r     The complaint alleges violations of the antifraud provisions\rof the federal securities laws -- Section 10(b) of the Securities\rExchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder and\rSection 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.  In a related\rmatter, the U. S.

Saris granted\rthe Commission\s request for an ex parte Temporary Restraining\rOrder, and an order for the freezing of assets, requiring an\raccounting of assets, and other relief.  \r\r     The complaint alleges that, on the afternoon of Friday,\rFebruary 7, 1997, while in possession of material, nonpublic\rinformation regarding Centennial, Defendant Pinez purchased\rapproximately 1955 put option contracts, and sold approximately\r2400 call option contracts on Centennial stock.  The complaint\ralleges that on Monday, February 10, 1997, Pinez purchased an\radditional unknown number of put option contracts.  Through these\rtransactions, Pinez calculated that, prior to the expiration of\rthe options on March 21, 1997, Centennial\s stock would decrease\rsubstantially in price.  \r\r     The complaint further alleges that, while at Centennial,\rPinez caused the company to record fictitious sales by arranging\rfor the purchase of Centennial products and secretly paying for\rthose products with his own funds.  The complaint alleges that,\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\rin some such instances, Pinez funded these transactions through\rmargin loans on his personal holdings of Centennial stock.  The\rcomplaint also alleges that Pinez altered inventory tags which\rresulted in an overstatement of inventory. The complaint further\ralleged that Pinez\s motive for these transactions was to ensure\rthat Centennial\s reported results met analysts\ expectations. \r\r     On February 11, 1997, Centennial announced that it had fired\rPinez and would conduct an inquiry, headed by a special committee\rof its Board of Directors, into the accuracy of its most recently\rannounced earnings (for the quarter ended December 31, 1996) and\rprior financial statements.  This announcement resulted in the\rFebruary 11 trading halt by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).\r\r\r\r     The complaint alleges that Pinez\ approximate profit at a\rminimum will be the $447,500 in premiums he has received from the\rcall option buyers.  The complaint further alleges that Pinez\rstands to gain substantially more from the purchase of put\roptions on February 7 and 10.  As a result of the NYSE trading\rhalt in Centennial stock, it not possible at this time to measure\rPinez\ total potential profit from his options trading.  \r\r  \x0c\x1a"

Lieberman and\r     Monroig trained Sterling Foster representatives to induce\r     customers to purchase these securities by using a series of\r     boiler-room sales practices, including misrepresenting to\r     customers that: (1) Sterling Foster had inside information\r     about the issuers of these securities that was soon to be\r     announced publicly; (2) the prices of these securities would\r     reach certain targets within a few days; (3) registered\r     representatives were not earning any compensation on\r     purchases of these securities by customers; and (4) no\r     prospectuses were available relating to these securities.  \r\r          Sterling Foster, Lieberman and Kellerman charged\r     customers undisclosed excessive markups of at least $75\r     million on the customers\ purchases of these securities. \r     Once these customers were duped into making the purchases,\r     Sterling Foster, Lieberman, Monroig and Rueb prevented the\r     customers from selling the securities.  Furthermore, Rueb\r     misrepresented to his customers, when asked about the status\r     of sell orders, that such orders had been executed when, in\r     fact, they were not.\r\r     In its Complaint, the Commission alleges that Sterling\rFoster, Lieberman, Kellerman, Monroig and Rueb violated Section\r17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), and\rSection 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange\rAct) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In addition, the Commission\ralleges that Sterling Foster violated Section 15(c) of the\rExchange Act and Rules 10b-3, 10b-6, 15c1-2 and 15c1-8; Lieberman\rviolated Exchange Act Rule 10b-6 and is liable, as a controlling\rperson under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, for Sterling\rFoster\s violations of Sections 10(b) and 15(c) of the Exchange\rAct and Rules 10b-3, 15c1-2 and 15c1-8; and Kellerman violated\rExchange Act Rule 10b-6.\r\r     The litigation is pending.\r\r     The Commission thanks the National Association of Securities\rDealers for its assistance in this matter.\x0c\x1a"

On December 11, 1996, Oyler had pled\rguilty to one count of wire fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \x15\r1343, and one count of failure to file a federal income tax\rreturn in violation of 26 U.S.C. \x15 7203.  \r\r     The indictment charged that Oyler, beginning in\rapproximately July 1991 and continuing through approximately\rFebruary of 1993, devised a fraudulent scheme whereby he, through\rInterfirst Equities Corporation, World Income Trust and Delta\rStar Corporation, offered and sold investments in what was termed\ra roll program or letter of credit program, falsely\rrepresenting to investors that, among other things, (1) the\rprogram was highly lucrative for investors; (2) the program was\rhighly leveraged and would offer a high rate of return of up to\r25% per month; (3) the investors\ funds would be combined with\rother funds and deposited into a transaction account held with an\rinternational bank which was handling the transaction; (4) the\rinvestors\ funds would be leveraged four times; and (5) there was\ran ongoing relationship with several prime banks and the\rinstruments purchased and leveraged would be scrutinized by two\rseparate banking entities prior to each transaction.  The\rindictment further charges that investors were told that the\rprogram was generating a return for them when Oyler was in fact\rusing funds to pay off the earlier investors in the manner of a\rpyramid scheme.  The scheme caused approximately 260 investors to\rlose approximately $3 million.\r\r     The above scheme ended on or about March 1, 1993, when the\rCommission filed a civil injunctive action, obtaining a Temporary\rRestraining Order, an asset freeze and other relief against\rOyler.

Keever and Richard L. McAdoo, both former\rsenior officers of Triton Energy\s subsidiary Triton Indonesia,\rInc. (Triton Indonesia).  The Commission\s complaint alleges\rthat during the years 1989 and 1990, McAdoo and Keever authorized\rnumerous improper payments to Roland Siouffi, Triton Indonesia\s\rbusiness agent acting as an intermediary between Triton Indonesia\rand Indonesian government agencies, knowing or recklessly\rdisregarding the high probability that Siouffi either had or\rwould pass such payments along to Indonesian government employees\rfor the purpose of influencing their decisions affecting the\rbusiness of Triton Indonesia.  The complaint alleges that these\rpayments were made in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices\rAct.  According to the complaint, McAdoo and Keever, together\rwith other Triton Indonesia employees, also concealed these\rpayments by falsely documenting and recording the transactions as\rroutine business expenditures.  The complaint states that Triton\rEnergy did not expressly authorize or direct these improper\rpayments and misbookings.\r\r     The complaint also alleges that Triton Indonesia recorded\rother false entries in its books and records, including, for\rexample, falsely documenting and recording cash payments\rtotalling $1,000 per month to clerical employees of the\rIndonesian national oil company made for the purpose of\rexpediting payment of monthly crude oil invoices.  During the\rrelevant time period, the complaint alleges, Triton Energy failed\rto devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting\rcontrols to detect and prevent improper payments by Triton\rIndonesia to government officials and to provide reasonable\rassurance that transactions were recorded as necessary to permit\rpreparation of financial statements in conformity with generally\raccepted accounting principles.    The Commission seeks permanent\rinjunctions and civil monetary penalties from each of the three\rdefendants.\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\r     Simultaneous with the filing of the complaint, defendant\rTriton Energy consented, without admitting or denying the\rallegations, to the entry of a Final Judgment that permanently\renjoins it from violating the books and records and internal\rcontrols provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934\r(Exchange Act), and orders Triton Energy to pay a $300,000\rpenalty.  In accepting the settlement, the Commission has\rconsidered the fact that the violations occurred under former\rmanagement and that certain remedial actions have been\rimplemented by the current board of directors and senior\rmanagement.\r\r     In addition, defendant Keever consented, without admitting\ror denying the allegations, to the entry of a Final Judgment that\rpermanently enjoins him from violating the foreign corrupt\rpractices and books and records provisions of the Exchange Act,\rand orders Keever to pay a $50,000 penalty.\r\r     The Commission also instituted related administrative\rproceedings against former employees David Gore, Robert Puetz,\rWilliam McClure, and Robert P. Murphy for their conduct in\rconnection with the improper payments and misbookings.  The\rCommission\s Order finds that, as a result of the falsely\rdocumented payments and other false entries, Triton Indonesia\rmaintained books and records that did not accurately or fairly\rreflect the underlying disposition of assets.  The Order further\rfinds that Murphy, Triton Indonesia\s Controller, knowingly\rparticipated in creating and recording false entries in Triton\rIndonesia\s books and records.  According to the Order, McClure,\rTriton Indonesia\s Commercial Manager, failed to assure that the\rentries prepared by Murphy accurately reflected the underlying\rtransactions.  The Commission\s Order also finds that Gore,\rformerly Triton Energy\s president and a director, and Puetz,\rformerly Triton Energy\s senior vice president of finance and\rchief financial officer, each received information indicating\rthat Triton Indonesia was engaged in conduct that was potentially\runlawful, but took no action to initiate an investigation of the\rserious issues raised by Triton Energy\s internal auditor.\r\r     Without admitting or denying the Commission\s findings,\rMcClure and Murphy consented to cease and desist from committing\ror causing any violation of, and committing or causing any future\rviolation of the books and records provision of the Exchange Act.\r\rAt the same time, Gore and Puetz consented to cease and desist\rfrom committing or causing any violation of, and committing or\rcausing any future violation of the foreign payments provision of\rthe Exchange Act.

Final Judgments of Permanent Injunction\rwere also issued against defendants Joe L. Hallock (Hallock)\rand Thomas M. Grahovac (Grahovac) on February 5, 1997 and\rFebruary 6, 1997, respectively.  Defendants Bouwkamp and Grahovac\rhad consented, without admitting or denying the allegations in\rthe Complaint, to the entry of the final judgments.  The Final\rJudgment of Permanent Injunction against Hallock was obtained as\ra result of a summary judgment motion filed by the Commission. \rBouwkamp and Hallock are enjoined from violations of the\rsecurities registration and anti-fraud provisions of the federal\rsecurities laws.

The Complaint alleged that defendants Bouwkamp and\rHallock, principals of B.H.

The financing program was to be administered by B.H.\rRothchild and was to involve its subsidiary Ocean Best Seafood &\rTrading, Inc.

The\rSecond Amended Complaint alleges that Andrew S. Pitt (Pitt),\rConectisys Corporation (Conectisys or the Company), and B & M\rCapital Corp. participated with Zaman and Smith Benton in a\rfraudulent and manipulative trading scheme.  The Commission also\ralleges that Pitt, Conectisys, Zaman, Smith Benton and Devon\rInvestment Advisors, Inc. (Devon) engaged in the illegal\rdistribution of unregistered securities.\r\r     The Commission previously had alleged that from February 14,\r1996 through at least May 28, 1996, through prearranged trading\rand other manipulative activities, defendants Zaman and Smith\rBenton, with the cooperation of other broker-dealers, caused the\rprice of Conectisys stock to soar from $6 1/4 per share on\rFebruary 14, 1996 to $22 per share on May 9, 1996; and that\rthereafter, the stock continued trading at high prices, ranging\rfrom approximately $17 to $22 per share, as a result of\rdefendants\ manipulative trading practices.  From February 14\rthrough May 28, 1996, defendants\ manipulative activities\rresulted in deceptively high trading volumes in Conectisys\rsecurities: average weekly trading volumes were approximately\r2,200 percent higher than during the previous three month period.\r\rThese dramatic increases in the price and trading volume of\rConectisys shares were a result of defendants\ illegal conduct\rand not indicative of genuine market interest.  The Second\rAmended Complaint alleges that B & M Capital Corp., under the\rcontrol of Zaman, participated in the above-described scheme by\reffecting trades of Conectisys stock in furtherance of the\rmanipulation.\r\r     Until July 24, 1995, when he was placed on administrative\rleave, Pitt was an Assistant United States Attorney in the\rCentral District of California.  The Second Amended Complaint\ralleges that Pitt purchased a controlling share of Conectisys\r(then named Coastal Financial Corp.) in late November 1994, and\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\roperated it as BDR Industries, Inc. until August 7, 1995, when\rPitt purported to sell his controlling interest in the Company\rfor $10.00.  The Commission alleges that Pitt, in fact, retained\rcontrol of the Company and participated with Conectisys in\rdrafting a business plan containing detailed financial and\rproduct information regarding Conectisys and two development\rstage companies that it recently had acquired, PrimeLink and\rTechnilink.  The Commission alleges that the business plan\rcontains numerous false and misleading statements concerning the\rCompany, and that Zaman and Smith Benton used the business plan\rin selling shares of Conectisys stock to the public.  \r\r     In addition, the Commission alleges that on or about April\r25, 1995, Pitt caused the Company to issue 64,000 shares of\runregistered common stock to Devon, a company under his control\rand that Devon subsequently sold those shares to Zaman and Smith\rBenton, who then sold those shares to the public in furtherance\rof the manipulative scheme.  \r\r     Based on the above allegations, the Second Amended Complaint\rcharges: (i) Pitt, Conectisys, Zaman, and Smith Benton with\rviolations of Sections 5(a) and (c), and 17(a) of the Securities\rAct of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5\rof the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act); (ii) B &\rM Capital Corp. with violations of Section 17(a) of the\rSecurities Act and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange\rAct; and (iii) Devon Investment Advisors, Inc. with violations of\rSection 5(a) and (c) of the Securities Act; seeking an\rinjunction, disgorgement, and other relief.\x0c\x1a"

Named as defendants\rin the Complaint are: \r\r     First Interregional Advisors Corporation (FIAC), a New\rJersey corporation located in Millburn, New Jersey, which is\rengaged in the finance and distribution of equipment lease\rcontracts in which federal and municipal government entities\rtypically are the lessees.\r\r     First Interregional Equity Corporation (FIEC), a\rregistered broker-dealer located in Millburn, New Jersey at the\rsame premises as FIAC. \r\r     Richard Goettlich (Goettlich), 41 years old and a resident\rof Mendham, New Jersey, who is the president of FIAC and FIEC.\r\r     In its Complaint, the Commission seeks a temporary\rrestraining order, a preliminary and permanent injunction,\rdisgorgement and civil penalties against all defendants.  As\radditional equitable relief against all defendants during the\rpendency of this action, the Commission also seeks an asset\rfreeze, the appointment of a temporary receiver for the corporate\rdefendants, and an order prohibiting the destruction of\rdocuments.\r\r     Also on March 6, 1997, the United States District Court for\rthe District of New Jersey issued an order: (1) temporarily\rrestraining FIAC, FIEC, and Goettlich from committing securities\rfraud; (2) freezing the assets of the defendants (except the\rassets of FIAC, which had filed for bankruptcy); (3) appointing\rRichard W. Hill, Esq., as a temporary receiver for FIAC and FIEC;\r(4) prohibiting the defendants from destroying documents; and (5)\rdirecting the defendants to provide an accounting.  \r\r     The Complaint alleges as follows: From 1992 to the present,\rFIAC has been engaged in the financing and servicing of equipment\rlease contracts which it purports to sell to individual\rinvestors.  In exchange for an upfront payment, investors are\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\rtold they have acquired a particular lease, or a group of leases,\rwith a specific government subdivision.  FIAC promises the \r\r                              - 2 -\r\rinvestors a stream of specified monthly payments consisting of\rprincipal and interest over the period of the lease.  FIAC has\rpurported to sell these leases to at least 1700 investor\raccounts.  In fact, most of these investor accounts unknowingly\rpurchased a lease assignment that had already been sold to\ranother investor.  In furtherance of the scheme, FIAC, FIEC,\rthrough which the leases are retailed to investors, and Goettlich\rmade material misrepresentations to investors including 1) that\rinvestors were acquiring all rights, title and interest in bona\rfide equipment lease obligations; 2) that the obligations\racquired by investors were obligations of federal or state\ragencies and subdivisions and thus backed by the creditworthiness\rof a government lessee; and 3) that interest payments on the\rlease assignments were tax exempt.  The defendants also failed to\rdisclose that because FIAC had insufficient receivable streams to\rback its sales to investors, FIAC\s ability to continue making\rongoing payments to investors turned in part on its ability to\rcontinue raising money from investors or from other borrowing.   \r\r\r     In its Complaint the Commission alleges that FIAC, FIEC, and\rGoettlich violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933\rand Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934\r(Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

See SEC\rLit. Rel. No. 14988 (July 23, 1996).  Taylor received a 41-month\rsentence on each count, but will serve them concurrently.\r\r     In his plea, Taylor admitted to having committed hundreds of\rviolations of a court-ordered asset freeze entered on September\r1, 1995, in a civil action filed by the Commission in the U.S.\rDistrict Court for the District of Columbia against him and the\rBetter Life Club of America, Inc., an organization he founded and\rused to perpetrate a $48 million Ponzi scheme that defrauded\rthousands of low- and middle-income investors across the country.\r\rSee SEC Lit. Rel. No. 14624 (Sept. 5, 1995).  The freeze order\rwas designed to preserve the defendants assets for potential\rrecovery by the Commission to compensate defrauded investors.\r\r     Taylors violations of the asset freeze order included\rconcealing over 25 bank accounts that he used to make cash\rwithdrawals and write checks to himself for more than $325,000,\rand to deposit more than 200 investor checks and money orders\rthat Judge Hogan had ordered him turn over to a court-appointed\rreceiver.  In addition, in June 1996, after Judge Hogan had twice\rheld him in civil contempt and after criminal contempt charges\rhad been filed against him, Taylor refinanced a house in Fort\rWashington, Maryland (which he had purchased with Better Life\rClub investor funds), and dissipated more than $62,000 that he\rreceived from the transaction -- another violation of the freeze.\r\r     In his wire fraud plea, Taylor acknowledged that he had\rsubmitted a false application to a mortgage company to obtain the\rrefinancing of his house.  The application overstated his income\rand failed to reveal the existence of the Commissions action\ragainst him.\r\r     Taylors sentence was the maximum under the federal\rsentencing guidelines.  It included an increase for obstruction\rof justice based on Judge Hogans finding that Taylor committed\rperjury when he pled guilty last summer.

Wilson, United States District Judge, sentenced\rMichael R. Warren (Warren) to 33 months in prison and to three\ryears of supervisory release.  The Court also ordered Warren to\rpay restitution to all of his defrauded clients.  During Warren\s\rsupervisory release, he must provide the Probation Office with\raccurate financial statements and is prohibited from offering or\rselling any financial instrument without the Court\s approval. \rIn December 1996, Warren pled guilty to a five count criminal\rinformation, including two felony counts under the Investment\rAdvisers Act, two felony counts of wire fraud, and one felony\rcount of mail fraud.  \r\r     In a related case, on May 13, 1996, the Honorable David V.\rKenyon, United States District Judge for the Central District of\rCalifornia, entered a Final Judgment which provided that Keypoint\rFinancial Corporation (Keypoint) and Warren jointly and\rseverally pay $628,107.23 in disgorgement and $216,681.77 in\rprejudgment interest thereon.  On October 31, 1995, the Court\rentered a Judgment of Permanent Injunction and Other Relief\rAgainst Defendants Keypoint Financial Corporation and Michael R.\rWarren (Judgment of Permanent Injunction), which enjoined\rKeypoint and Warren from violations of the antifraud and the\rbooks and records provisions of the federal securities laws. \rKeypoint and Warren consented to the Judgment of Permanent\rInjunction without admitting or denying the allegations in the\rcomplaint.  In the Commission\s case, the complaint alleges that\rfrom approximately January 1991 through at least December 1992,\rKeypoint and Warren fraudulently offered and sold non-existent\rinsurance annuity contracts and limited partnership units to\rKeypoint\s clients, and misappropriated client funds for the\rbenefit of themselves or their affiliated businesses.  Finally,\rthe Complaint alleges that when Commission representatives\rattempted to examine and inspect Keypoint\s books and records\rrelating to its advisory business, Warren failed to respond or to\rproduce such documents to the Commission, as required by statute.\r\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\r     In a related administrative proceeding, the Commission\rissued an Order on November 6, 1995, whereby Keypoint and Warren,\rwithout admitting or denying the Commission\s findings, consented\rto an Order revoking Keypoint\s registration with the Commission\ras an investment adviser and barring Warren from association with\rany broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer, investment\radviser or investment company.

King (King),\rformerly of Wellesley, Massachusetts and presently residing in\rBoca Raton, Florida, pleaded guilty to 32 counts of mail fraud\rrelating to a Ponzi scheme and one count of bankruptcy fraud for\rconcealing his assets in a bankruptcy proceeding.  The indictment\ralleged that, between late 1986 and 1989, King solicited over $11\rmillion from former clients, many of whom were elderly, to invest\rtheir monies in secured mortgages in return for guaranteed\rinterest payments.  According to the indictment, and contrary to\rhis representations, King pooled the investor funds and loaned\rtheir money to non-creditworthy borrowers on distressed\rproperties.  The indictment also alleged that King kept his\rmortgage investment scheme afloat by using funds provided by new\rinvestors to repay principal and to make interest payments to\rexisting investors.  According to the indictment, King used the\rremaining investor funds to support his lavish lifestyle and to\rpay for gambling debts, family airline tickets, his daughter\s\rwedding expenses, and interior design bills for his residence in\rBoca Raton, Florida and his summer house rental in the Hamptons,\rNew York.\r\r     The indictment further alleged that, in late 1989, as King\s\rscheme began to collapse, King sent lulling letters to investors\rfalsely reassuring them that their investments were safe.  King\ralso pleaded guilty to bankruptcy fraud for concealing from a\rbankruptcy trustee that he received over $100,000 in federal tax\rrefunds and other assets after the filing of his 1991 bankruptcy\rpetition.  King\s sentencing has been scheduled for June 3, 1997.\r\r     On September 28, 1990, the Commission filed an injunctive\raction alleging that King violated various registration and\rantifraud provisions of the Securities Act, Exchange Act and\rAdvisers Act in connection with the scheme set forth in the\rindictment.  King was enjoined in December 1990 from further\rviolations of all provisions alleged in the complaint, ordered to\rcomply with the terms of a 1986 Commission bar order and ordered\rto make restitution to investors.  In addition, investor monies\rand assets were transferred to a special agent appointed by the\rCourt for purposes of liquidation and the return of all available\rfunds to investors.  On March 8, 1991, the court granted the\rCommission\s further application for an Order permanently\rprohibiting King from transferring or disposing of assets in\rexcess of ordinary and necessary living expenses and, upon\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\rapplication of the special agent, ordered Wellesley Mortgage\rCorporation, an entity formerly controlled by Barry King, to file\rfor bankruptcy.\r\r     The Commission staff assisted the New England Bank Fraud\rTask Force of the Department of Justice in its criminal\rinvestigation of King.\r\r     For further information, see Exchange Act Release Nos. 23862\rand 33167, and Litigation Release Nos. 12670, 12738, 12808 and\r14574.  \x0c\x1a"

The Court entered the Order\rafter three hearings were held in January and February 1997 on\rthe Court\s August 6, 1996 and September 19, 1996 Orders to Show\rCause why the defendant Danny Sterk (Sterk) should not be held\rin civil contempt for violating the Court\s previous orders of\rNovember 28, 1995 and May 17, 1996 requiring Sterk to pay a\rcontempt fine of $175,000; to file a sworn accounting of his\rfinances; and to pay disgorgement in the amount of $1,007,783.87.\r\r     The actions arise from the complaint filed on August 23,\r1994 by the Commission alleging that Sterk, as chief executive\rofficer of TransAmerica Wireless Systems and a principal of\rIntercontinental Telecommunications Corp., obtained funds from\rinvestors by misrepresenting or failing to disclose material\rfacts in connection with the sale of general partnership\rinterests in ventures formed to create wireless cable\rtelevision systems.  On November 28, 1995, without admitting or\rdenying the allegations against him, Sterk consented to the entry\rof a judgment of permanent injunction and other relief.  On\rDecember 14, 1995, the Court ordered Sterk and others held in\rcivil contempt for violating previous Court orders freezing the\rassets of Sterk and his wife.  The Court ordered a compensatory\rfine of $175,000 be paid be Sterk and others for violating the\rCourt orders.  On May 17, 1996, Sterk was directed by the Court\rto pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of\r$1,007,783.87 within 45 days of the date of the order. \r     Prior to the January and February 1997 hearings, Sterk\rtransferred his residence and certain items of personal property\rto the Receiver appointed by the Court in partial compliance with\rthe Court\s disgorgement order.  The Court found that the\rtransfer was insufficient to satisy the Disgorgement Order. The\rCourt determined that Sterk had failed to show an inability to\rcomply with the Orders while finding that the Receiver and the\rCommission had presented a prima facie case that Sterk had the\rmeans to pay the moneys owed under the Disgorgement and Contempt\rOrders. The Court found that there was clear and convincing\revidence that Sterk was in civil contempt of the Court\s\rDisgorgement Order and of the Court\s December 1995 Contempt\rOrder.\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\r\r\r\r     Judge Gonzalez ordered Sterk to pay the Receiver the sum of\r$25,000 on or before March 15, 1997, and to begin monthly\rpayments of $2,000 on April 30, 1997, until the disgorgement was\rpaid in full.

(Centennial).  The Amended\rComplaint adds Lehman Brothers, Inc. (Lehman) as a relief\rdefendant.  The Amended Complaint alleges that Lehman is\rcurrently holding the proceeds of Pinez\s ill-gotten gains from\rhis sale and purchase of put and call options contracts on\rFebruary 7, 1997.\r\r     In previous court filings in this matter, Lehman has\rasserted that it is entitled to the proceeds of the options\rtransactions because it acquired a lien in Pinez\s securities\rtransactions.  The Commission has sought to freeze Pinez\s assets\rfor the benefit of defrauded investors, and in previous filings\rhas asserted that Lehman\s claim is superseded by the\rCommission\s claims.  The Commission has asserted that one reason\rLehman\s claim to the funds is superseded is because Lehman had\rknowledge of suspicious circumstances relating to Pinez\s options\rtrading.  The Amended Complaint alleges as some of those\rsuspicious circumstances: Pinez instructed Lehman that he wanted\rall of the trading completed in one day; Pinez trades were\ressentially a large bet on the continued decline in the value of\rCentennial\s stock; and Lehman had notice, prior to Pinez\s\roptions trading, of concerns and allegations regarding both\rCentennial and Pinez, including the fact that on January 31,\r1997, the Commission\s staff sent an investigative document\rrequest to Lehman\s legal department indicating that the staff\rwas conducting an informal inquiry in the matter of Centennial,\rand requesting trading records relating to Pinez\s account.\r\r     The Commission\s original complaint, which sought a\rtemporary restraining order, asset freeze and other relief,\ralleged that Pinez purchased and sold over 4400 option contracts\rat a time when he was aware that Centennial\s true financial\rcondition was substantially worse than had been reported.  The\roriginal complaint was filed in the United States District Court\rfor the District of Massachusetts on February 14, 1997, and Judge\rPatti Sarris granted a temporary restraining order and an asset\rfreeze the same day (See SEC v.

The\rAmended Complaint further alleges all but 268 of the put option\rcontracts have been sold and that Pinez to date has gained\rapproximately $4.2 million from the purchase of put options.

All three offerings were sold to\rthe public on the basis of representations that the notes were\rfully insured and, hence, investors incurred no risk in\rpurchasing them.  According to the Commission\s complaint, these\rrepresentations were false; the purported agreements with various\rinsurance companies, which Namer provided to individuals\rassociated with the offerings, were either misrepresented or, in\rsome cases, outright forgeries.  Moreover, the complaint alleges,\rsale of the three issues to the public was facilitated by a\rdetermination by the Depository Trust Company (DTC) that the\rissues were eligible for DTC clearing and settlement services. \rHowever, the documents provided by Namer to DTC to obtain this\rdetermination are alleged to be fraudulent.  In addition to other\rfunds obtained in connection with these offerings, the\rCommission\s complaint alleges that Meyers Pollock and its prin-\rcipals, Michael and Shelli Ploshnick, received approximately $2\rmillion from the proceeds of these offerings, purportedly\rrepresenting a purchase by Namer of a 50% ownership interest in\rMeyers Pollock. \x0c\r\r\r\r\r\r     The Commission\s complaint alleges that defendants\\rfraudulent misrepresentations and omissions in connection with\rthese three offerings violated Section 17(a) of the Securities\rAct of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the\rSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5\rthereunder, and that their failure to register these securities\rwith the Commission, prior to their sale, constituted violations\rof Section 5 of the Securities Act.  The Commission seeks perma-\rnent injunctions against future violations of the above\rprovisions of the federal securities laws, disgorgement and civil\rpenalties from all defendants except Shelli Ploshnick, from whom\rit seeks only disgorgement.   \r\r     On March 25, 1997, the Honorable Michael B. Mukasey, on ex\rparte application of the Commission, entered a temporary\rrestraining order prohibiting violations of the anti-fraud and\rregistration provisions of the federal securities laws by all\rdefendants except relief defendant Shelli Ploshnick, and freezing\rthe assets of defendants Namer, Network Mortgage and Offshore\rInsurance Services.  The court\s order also requires that\rdefendants Michael and Shelli Ploshnick furnish security for\rpayment by them of $1,975,000, representing funds they received\rdirectly or indirectly from Namer. \r\r     The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the National\rAssociation of Securities Dealers in conducting its\rinvestigation.\x0c\x1a"

For example, the Defendants claimed that Aqua Buoy\rhad acquired certain assets from Lord Jeff Knitting Company, Inc.\r(Lord Jeff), a then-bankrupt sweater manufacturer, for $14\rmillion in securities when, in fact, the Lord Jeff acquisition\rwas worth no more than $4.9 million.

The Complaint also demands that Joseph\rPignatiello, Constance Pignatiello, and Werner disgorge their\rillicit insider trading profits and pay prejudgment interest on\rthose illicit profits.  The Complaint further demands that Joseph\rPignatiello, Constance Pignatiello, and Werner pay civil monetary\rpenalties for their fraudulent conduct.

The Commission\s complaint\rcharges the defendants with violating a prior order of the\rCommission which barred both Suppes and Anthony from associating\rwith, among others, any broker or dealer, and seeks an order\rpreliminarily and permanently enjoining Suppes and Anthony from\rviolating the bar order and commanding them to comply with the\rbar order.  In addition, the Commission\s application for an\rorder temporarily restraining Suppes and Anthony from continuing\rto violate the bar order pending the outcome of a hearing on the\rCommission\s request for a preliminary injunction was granted.\r\r     On January 15, 1997, the Commission instituted and\rsimultaneously settled an administrative proceeding against\rSuppes and Anthony in which both consented to the issuance of an\rOrder Instituting Proceedings Pursuant To Sections 15(b)(6) And\r19(h) Of The Securities Exchange Act Of 1934, Making Findings,\rand Imposing Remedial Sanctions (Commission Order).  The\rCommission Order arose out of permanent injunctions on consent\rentered against them in a prior litigation, SEC v. Sarivola, 95\rCiv. 9270 (RPP).  The Commission Order bars Suppes from\rassociation with any broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer,\rinvestment adviser or investment company, and provides that\rSuppes may reapply for association after two years.  The\rCommission Order permanently bars Anthony from association with\rany broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer, investment\radviser or investment company and from participating in any\roffering of penny stock.\r\r     At the time the Commission Order was issued, Suppes and\rAnthony were associated with Suppes Securities, Inc., a\rregistered broker-dealer.

(Alpha 1) and SciClone\rPharmaceuticals, Inc. (SciClone).  In each case, a group of\rtraders was tipped about negative news concerning how a new drug\rdeveloped by Alpha 1 and licensed to SciClone had performed in a\rcrucial clinical trial.  The traders were tipped about the fact\rthat initial analysis of the test data from the clinical trial\rindicated that the trial had not proven the drug to be effective.\r\rOne group of traders, located in Ohio and Michigan, obtained this\rinformation, directly or indirectly, from Dr. Milton Mutchnick,\rthe lead investigator on the clinical trial, and his wife, Renee\rMutchnick; the second group, located in California, obtained this\rinformation, directly or indirectly, from Dr. Rangarao Panguluri,\rMutchnick\s assistant. \r\r     The Complaints allege that Alpha 1\s primary product-in-\rdevelopment during the relevant period was the experimental,\ranti-hepatitis drug, Thymosin alpha 1 (Thymosin).  The drug\runderwent a well-publicized, double-blinded, Phase III clinical\rtrial at three medical research institutions.  Successful\rperformance by Thymosin in the Phase III clinical trial was a\rnecessary step towards approval by the Food and Drug\rAdministration.  Prior to the unblinding of the Phase III\rclinical study, the share price of the common stock of both Alpha\r1 and SciClone was substantially determined by investor expec-\rtations as to the outcome of the study.  \r\r     The Complaints also allege that, on April 25, 1994,\rMutchnick and his assistant, Panguluri, unblinded the study and\rlearned that patients treated with Thymosin fared no better than\rpatients given a placebo with respect to the study\s most\rsignificant test parameter.  The Complaints further allege that\ron the evening of April 25, 1994, Mutchnick tipped a group of\rfriends and family members, and Panguluri tipped a separate group\rof friends and business associates, about their initial analysis\rof test data from the Phase III clinical trial, which strongly\rindicated that the study had failed to demonstrate Thymosin to be\reffective in the treatment of hepatitis B.  Each of the\rindividuals to whom Mutchnick and Panguluri spoke that evening\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\rimmediately sold all of their Alpha 1 or SciClone securities,\rthereby avoiding losses in the aggregate of approximately\r$300,000.\r\r     Prior to the opening of the market on April 28, 1994, Alpha\r1 announced the negative news about the Thymosin clinical trial. \rThe share price of both stocks declined that day by approximately\rtwo-thirds. \r\r     The Commission filed its Complaint against the Mutchnicks\rand their tippees in the United States District Court for the\rDistrict of Columbia on April 10, 1997.  Simultaneous with the\rfiling of this Complaint, the Mutchnicks, Michael DeWood, Dennis\rM. Gill, Yvonne Graham, Paul H. Holloway, William M. Leuchter and\rRichard Liebich each consented, without admitting or denying the\rallegations in the Complaint, to the entry of a Final Judgment\rpermanently enjoining each of them from future violations of the\rantifraud provisions of the Exchange Act.  In addition, the Final\rJudgment to which the Mutchnicks have consented orders them to\rpay, pursuant to the Insiders Trading Sanctions Act of 1984, a\rcivil penalty of $163,494.75, an amount equal to the total of all\rof their tippees\ avoided losses.  Further, the Final Judgments\rto which Holloway, Leuchter and Liebich have consented order them\rto disgorge losses avoided of $40,265, $9,150 and $4,900,\rrespectively, plus prejudgment interest thereon, and to pay civil\rpenalties of $40,265, $9,150 and $1,100, respectively, pursuant\rto the Insider Trading Sanctions Act of 1984.  The Final\rJudgments to which Gill, DeWood and Graham have consented order\rthem to disgorge their losses avoided of $90,488.50, $5,675 and\r$13,016.25, respectively, plus prejudgment interest thereon, but\rwaive payment of such amounts and of civil penalties in light of\rtheir demonstrated inability to make such payments.  \r\r     The Commission filed its Complaint against Dr. Panguluri and\rhis tippees in the United States District Court for the Central\rDistrict of California on April 9, 1997.  That Complaint alleges\rthat Panguluri tipped, directly or indirectly, his friends, Dr.\rRavindra Alapati and Dr. Syam Gaddam, at a time when he was\rnegotiating with them about joining their medical practice.  The\rComplaint also alleges that Alapati not only avoided losses of\r$52,825 by liquidating his 7,800 shares of SciClone stock and his\r150 shares of Alpha 1 stock, but also made a profit of $8,000\rfrom the bad news by selling short 2000 shares of Alpha 1 stock. \rThe Complaint further alleges that Dr. Gaddam and his wife\ravoided losses of $13,431 by selling 2,595 shares of Alpha 1\rstock and 4,041 Alpha 1 warrants.  The Complaint also alleges\rthat, after being tipped by Panguluri, Alapati, in turn, tipped\rhis professional and social friend, Dr. Ravi Makam, who avoided\rlosses of $59,325 by selling his 9,100 shares of SciClone stock. \rThe Complaint further alleges that the Gaddams tipped Mrs.\rGaddam\s sister, who is not named as a defendant in the case but\rwho avoided losses of $3,500 by selling 1000 shares of Alpha 1\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 3======\r\rstock.

From\r     late 1995 through 1996, Kenton created and managed\r     investment funds designed to invest primarily in office\r     equipment leases to be acquired from, among others, BFG and\r     its affiliates.\r\rAccording to the Complaint, Kasarjian, both as an executive of\rBFG and through Kenton, from about 1991 through about 1996\roffered and sold several hundred million dollars of securities on\rbehalf of BFG and certain of its affiliates through a network of\rbroker-dealers located in, among other places, New York City, New\rJersey, and Philadelphia.\r\r     In SEC v. The Bennett Funding Group, Inc. et al., 96 Civ.\r2237 (JES) (the SEC-Bennett District Court Action), the\rCommission alleges that between 1991 through 1996, BFG and\rcertain others engaged in a massive Ponzi scheme in the offer\rand sale of several hundred million dollars of securities\rincluding purported assignments of equipment leases (Lease\rAssignments) and promissory notes (Notes) issued by BFG,\rBennett Receivables Corporation (BRC), or Bennett Receivables\rCorporation-II (BRC-II).  The Commission alleges that BFG did\rnot have sufficient receivable streams to support the Lease\rAssignments offered and sold to investors.  In some instances,\rsuch as the sale of tens of millions of dollars of purported New\x0c\r\r\r\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\rYork City Transit Authority Lease Assignments, the underlying\rleases simply did not exist.  In other instances, the leases\rpurportedly sold were already pledged to other investors or to\rbanks.  The Commission further alleges that BRC and BRC-II Notes\rwere sold by means of materially false BFG financial statements. \r\r\r     In the Complaint filed today, the Commission alleges that\rKasarjian and Kenton violated the antifraud provisions of the\rfederal securities laws when they sold BFG Lease Assignments and\rNotes on behalf of BFG.  The Commission alleges that Kasarjian\rand Kenton knew or were reckless in not knowing: (a) that BFG did\rnot have sufficient receivable streams to support the sales of\rLease Assignments; and (b) that BFG\s financial statements were\rmaterially false.  \r\r     According to the Complaint, Kasarjian and Kenton\rparticipated in sham transactions that were used to materially\roverstate income on BFG\s audited financial statements.  Those\rfinancial statements were included in memoranda used to offer and\rsell BRC and BRC-II Notes.  Kasarjian\s and Kenton\s sale of the\rLease Assignments allegedly also violated the registration\rprovisions of the Securities Act of 1933.\r\r     Last, Kasarjian and Kenton are charged with fraudulently\roffering and selling, during 1995 and 1996, approximately $27\rmillion in membership interests in certain investment funds\r(Funds) that were designed to invest in municipal leases and\rother debt instruments.  The Complaint alleges that Kasarjian and\rKenton fraudulently advanced the proceeds of these membership\rinterest offerings to BFG and its affiliates without acquiring\rany such debt instruments for the Funds.  \r\r     The Commission seeks permanent injunctions against future\rviolations of the securities laws, disgorgement of all ill-gotten\rgains, prejudgment interest, and other relief. \r\r     BFG and certain of its affiliates are debtors in Chapter 11\rbankruptcy proceedings pending in the United States Bankruptcy\rCourt for the Northern District of New York.  In April 1996, the\rbankruptcy court granted the Commission\s motion for the\rappointment of a Chapter 11 Trustee over BFG and its affiliated\rdebtors, and subsequently appointed Richard C. Breeden to serve\rin that capacity.  In July 1996, Patrick Bennett consented to a\rpreliminary injunction and an asset freeze in the SEC-Bennett\rDistrict Court Action, without admitting the allegations.  Since\rthen, the SEC-Bennett District Court Action against Patrick\rBennett has been stayed pending the resolution of criminal\rproceedings against him.  The Commission\s investigation of the\rfacts surrounding the sale of BFG securities remains ongoing.\r\r     For more information see Litigation Release Nos. 14875 and\r14991; Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release Nos. 772 and\r805.\x0c\x1a"

STRUCTURAL DYNAMICS\rRESEARCH CORPORATION, RONALD J. FRIEDSAM, RONALD H. HOFFMAN,\rROBERT A. FISCHER, TONY TOLANI AND RICHARD J. LAJOIE, JR. (Civ.\rNo. C-1-97-0352) (HW)\r\r     The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission)\rannounced today that it filed and simultaneously settled a\rfinancial fraud action seeking permanent injunctions and monetary\rand other relief in the United States District Court for the\rSouthern District of Ohio, Western Division, against Structural\rDynamics Research Corporation (SDRC or the Company) and five\rformer senior officers of SDRC:  Ronald J. Friedsam (Friedsam),\rformerly SDRC\s Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman\rof the Board of Directors, Ronald H. Hoffman (Hoffman),\rformerly SDRC\s Chief Financial Officer, Robert A. Fischer\r(Fischer), formerly SDRC\s Senior Vice-President in charge of\rSDRC\s Software Product Marketing Division, Tony Tolani\r(Tolani), formerly SDRC\s Vice-President in charge of Far East\rOperations, and Richard J. LaJoie, Jr. (LaJoie), formerly\rSDRC\s Controller.  Besides the entry of injunctions, the\rdefendants have agreed to pay a total of approximately $1.5\rmillion in monetary relief.\r\r     In a related action, the United States Attorney for the\rSouthern District of Ohio announced that Tony Tolani pled guilty\rtoday to causing false statements to be made from 1992 to 1994 to\rthe Commission by causing SDRC to report inflated revenues and\rearnings to the Commission in its quarterly and annual reports. \rTolani faces a maximum of five years in prison, three years of\rsupervised release, a fine of twice the gain or loss, and\rrestitution.\r\r     The Commission\s Complaint alleges that from 1992 through\rSeptember 1994, SDRC artificially inflated revenues and earnings\rby recognizing premature and fictitious revenue based on\rpurported orders from Far East sales representatives and\rdistributors submitted by SDRC\s Vice-President in charge of Far\rEast Operations, Tolani, and approved by his superior, Fischer. \rDuring this period, according to the Complaint, SDRC recorded\rpremature and fictitious revenue based on, among other things,\rpurchase orders obtained from sales representatives which\rcontained conditional language, indicating that the sales had not\rbeen finalized.  According to the Complaint, SDRC shipped the\rproduct sold pursuant to the fictitious and premature orders to\ra warehouse of a freight company, where it was held until further\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\rinstructions, if any, from SDRC\s Far East Operations.  When the\rscheme was disclosed in September 1994, approximately $30 million\rof SDRC product was stored in a warehouse at the Cincinnati\rairport.  The Complaint also alleges that SDRC improperly\rrecognized a substantial amount of revenue relating to three\rlarge customers, including IBM and Sony, based on documentation\rsubmitted by Tolani and Fischer.    \r\r       The Complaint alleges that from at least 1993 through\rAugust 1994, Friedsam, Hoffman and Lajoie knew or were reckless\rin not knowing that SDRC improperly recognized material amounts\rof revenue in its Far East Operations.  The Complaint further\ralleges that during the audit of SDRC\s 1993 financial\rstatements, Tolani made false statements to SDRC\s auditors about\rthe validity of orders from the Far East, and Hoffman and LaJoie,\rdirectly or indirectly, omitted to state certain material\rinformation to the auditors.\r\r     In addition, the Complaint alleges, Tolani, Hoffman and\rFischer each exercised SDRC stock options and sold large\rquantities of SDRC stock while they possessed material, non-\rpublic information about the accuracy of SDRC\s financial\rstatements, thereby avoiding losses of approximately $458,000,\r$150,000 and $116,000, respectively.  Tolani and Fischer also\rreceived bonuses of $221,992 and $16,000, respectively, during\rthe period of the alleged fraud based upon SDRC\s purportedly\rstrong financial performance.\r\r     The Commission alleged that by such conduct SDRC, Friedsam,\rHoffman, Fischer, Tolani and LaJoie violated the antifraud and\rcertain other provisions of the federal securities laws. \rSpecifically, each of the defendants violated Section 10(b) of\rthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule\r10b-5 thereunder; Tolani, Fischer and Hoffman violated Section\r17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933; Tolani, Hoffman and Lajoie\rviolated Exchange Act Rules 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 and Fischer\rviolated Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1; and SDRC violated Sections\r13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-\r20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder.\r\r     Relief\r\r     Simultaneous with the filing of the Commission\s Complaint,\rSDRC, Friedsam, Hoffman, Fischer, Tolani and LaJoie, without\radmitting or denying the allegations of the Complaint, consented\rto the entry of Final Judgments permanently enjoining them from\rviolating the relevant provisions of the federal securities laws,\rordering Tolani, Hoffman and Fischer to disgorge losses avoided,\rplus prejudgment interest thereon, and directing Friedsam,\rHoffman, Tolani and LaJoie to pay civil money penalties of\r$100,000, $50,000, $392,000 and $25,000, respectively.  Friedsam\rand Hoffman also consented to provisions in the Final Judgments\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 3======\r\rbarring each for a period of five years from serving as an\rofficer or director of any public reporting company.  As part of\rthe settlements, Hoffman and LaJoie have agreed to the\rinstitution of administrative proceedings pursuant to Rule 102(e)\rof the Commission\s Rules of Practice, upon entry of the\rinjunctions, which will bar them each for a period of at least\rfive years from appearing or practicing before the Commission as\ran accountant.\r\r     Other Proceedings\r\r     The Commission also today entered a cease and desist order,\rby consent, as to SDRC\s Assistant Controller, Lynn K. Blattman,\rbased upon acts that allegedly contributed to SDRC\s violations\rof the reporting provisions of the federal securities laws. \r[Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Release Number 38493.]     \r\r     The Commission also today instituted and simultaneously\rsettled administrative proceedings pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the\rCommission\s Rules of Practice as to SDRC\s auditors for the\raudit of SDRC\s 1993 financial statements, namely Philip S.\rPresent II and William J. Scanlon, former partners of SDRC\s\rindependent auditors at the time, KPMG Peat Marwick LLP. \r[Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Release Number 38494.]  The\rOrder alleges that Present, the engagement partner on the 1993\raudit, and Scanlon, the concurring review partner on the 1993\raudit, engaged in improper professional conduct in that Present\rfailed to conduct the 1993 audit in accordance with generally\raccepted auditing standards, and both Present and Scanlon failed\rto exercise due professional care and maintain an attitude of\rprofessional skepticism. \r\r     Specifically, the Order alleges that Present was aware that\rcertain revenue was recorded by SDRC based on purchase orders\rcontaining conditional language.  The Order further alleges that\rboth Present and Scanlon were aware that material amounts of\rreceivables were outstanding for long periods of time and then\rultimately written off, and that audit differences, representing\r22% of the net income originally reported by SDRC for 1993, were\rnot reflected in SDRC\s 1993 financial statements.  According to\rthe Order, Present and Scanlon failed to consider adequately\rwhether these factors were an indication that SDRC\s financial\rstatements were materially misstated.  Without admitting or\rdenying the allegations in the Order, Present consented to an\rOrder barring him for a period of two and one-half years from\rappearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant,\rand Scanlon consented to an Order censuring him.\x0c\x1a"

Hall is the former president of Intercapital Funding\rCorporation n/k/a IFC International, Inc. and Intercapital\rFunding Resources, Inc. n/k/a Prime Capital, Inc. (collectively,\rIntercapital).  \r\r     According to the complaint, Intercapital was formed to\rengage in the business of locating accounts receivable,\rpurchasing them from clients at a discount, and then collecting\rpayments from the underlying account debtors.  Intercapital used\rinvestor funds to finance the accounts receivable purchases. \rIntercapital entered into joint venture agreements with\rinvestors, offering up to 30% annual interest on their\rinvestments. \r\r     The complaint alleges that Intercapital, through Hall, made\rmisrepresentations and omissions to investors and potential\rinvestors regarding, among other things, the use of their monies\rto fund purchase orders, the failure to perform the promised due\rdiligence, the aging (and risk) of accounts receivable, insurance\rcoverage, and the risks associated with investing with\rIntercapital.

Committee On Professional\rEthics and Conduct of the Iowa State Bar Association v.

The\rCommission alleged that Nelsen and Tallant signed the\rregistration statement knowing that it contained materially false\rinformation.  The complaint also alleges that Nelsen knowingly\rsigned Evergreens false quarterly report for the period ended\rAugust 31, 1992. \r\r     The Commission alleged that Nelsen used Evergreen to\rdistribute corporate funds to himself and others, and that he\rengaged in other transactions that were not accurately reflected\rin Evergreens books and records.  According to the Complaint,\rNelsen arranged for Evergreen to make illegal political\rcontributions  when the U.S. Department of the Navy refused to\rprovide certain information to Evergreen in a computer-\rintelligent format that was necessary to the timely development\rof Evergreens key product.  In a vain effort to convince the\rNavy to change its mind, Nelsen solicited Evergreen employees to\rcontribute to the campaign committees or organizations of certain\rMembers of Congress.  The Commission alleged that Nelsen\rsolicited Evergreen employees to write a total of $20,000 in\rpersonal checks in amounts of $1,000, which were issued to the\rcampaign committees or organizations of certain Members of\rCongress.  The complaint alleges that Nelsen reimbursed the\remployees by disbursing checks from Evergreen disguised as\rconsulting compensation or bonus payments.\r\r     Nelsen and Tallant have agreed to settle the action without\radmitting or denying the allegations of the Complaint.  Nelsen\rhas  agreed to a permanent injunction from violating Section\r17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act,\rand Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2, and from aiding and abetting\rviolations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20\rand 13a-13.  Additionally, Nelsen has agreed to disgorgement and\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\ra permanent bar from serving as an officer or director of a\rpublic company.  The settlement with Nelsen requires him to\rdisgorge $65,000 and to pay $26,000 in pre-judgment interest\rwhich obligation is waived based upon his demonstrated inability\rto pay. For the same reason Nelsen is not ordered to pay a civil\rpenalty.

To further protect\rinvestor funds, the Court additionally ordered Murphy to provide\ra detailed accounting of his assets and enjoined him from\rdissipating any assets and from destroying any documents related\rto the fraudulent scheme.\r\r     In its Complaint, the Commission alleges that since at least\rJune 1996, Murphy has offered and sold limited partnership\rinterests through a company doing business as ATM Global, Inc.\r(ATM Global).  The limited partnership was to raise $2.8\rmillion from investors and then acquire, own and operate\rautomated teller machines (ATMs) nationwide.  ATMs generate\rrevenue through transaction fees charged to customers who use\rthem.  The written offering materials state that the projected\rreturn to investors would be over 176% in the first year and 203%\rannually in the second through seventh years.  Murphy designed\rthe limited partnership program and led the promotional and sales\refforts.  To date, Murphy himself has raised at least $277,500\rfrom investors.\r\r     The Complaint also alleges that, in offering and selling the\rlimited partnership interests to investors, Murphy misrepresented\rhis identity by using the alias Jack Davis.  Furthermore,\rMurphy failed to disclose the entry of, and the terms of, a 1994\rFinal Judgment entered against him in an earlier Commission\raction enjoining him from future violations of the registration\rand antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.

Murphy further failed to disclose that\ranother company he owned and managed, American Capital\rInvestments, Inc., was placed into receivership.\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\r     The Complaint alleges that Murphy violated Section 17(a) of\rthe Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities\rExchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder seeks preliminary\rand permanent injunctions, and other relief, including\rdisgorgement and civil penalties, against Murphy for his latest\rviolations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities\rlaws.\x0c\x1a"

Between February 25, 1997\rand March 18, 1997, Lum purchased a total of 190,100 shares of\rAPL common stock through this account, representing a total\rinvestment of $4,398,132.

(Greenway), Greenway\s Chairman Alvin A.\rMcCollum (McCollum), Steven F. Broadbent (Broadbent),\rGreenway\s auditor, and securities salesman Rex L. Zimmerman\r(Zimmerman).  Greenway purported to be a holding company for\rmining interests, real estate and operating companies.  The\rCommission\s Complaint alleges that Greenway filed with the\rCommission, between March 1992 and December 1993, fraudulent\rperiodic reports containing financial statements which reflected\rassets not owned by Greenway, or assets held by Greenway whose\rvalues were materially overstated.  This conduct transformed the\rcompany in two years from a shell company with virtually no\rassets to a company with putative assets of nearly $50 million. \rThe Complaint further alleges McCollum signed all but one of\rthese fraudulent reports when he knew or was reckless in not\rknowing that the financial statements were false.  Broadbent is\ralleged to have prepared many of the false financial statements\rand to have held himself out as Greenway\s independent auditor\rwhen he lacked the required independence and failed to perform\raudits that met applicable professional standards.  Finally, for\rseveral months in mid-1992, Zimmerman sold Greenway debentures\rwhile unregistered with the Commission as a broker or dealer. \r\r     With the filing of the Complaint, Greenway consented to the\rentry of a Final Judgment of Permanent Injunction restraining and\renjoining it from violating the antifraud provisions of the\rSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act).  The\rComplaint also alleged that the Company violated the reporting,\rbooks and records, and internal controls provisions of the\rstatute, and Greenway has also consented to be enjoined from\rfuture violations of these provisions.  McCollum and Broadbent\rconsented to the entry of injunctions barring violations of the\rantifraud provisions, and Zimmerman consented to the entry of an\rinjunction against acting as an unregistered broker or dealer. \rEach of the defendants consented to the entry of a Final Judgment\rwithout admitting or denying the Complaint\s allegations.  \r\r     As part of his settlement with the Commission,  Broadbent\ralso has agreed, without admitting or denying the Complaint\s\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\rallegations, upon the entry of the court\s injunction against\rhim, to the institution by the Commission of an administrative\rproceeding and the issuance of a Commission order that denies him\rthe privilege of practicing before the Commission as an\raccountant.\x0c\x1a"

To further protect\rinvestor funds, the Court additionally ordered Murphy to provide\ra detailed accounting of his assets and enjoined him from\rdissipating any assets and from destroying any documents related\rto the fraudulent scheme.\r\r     In its Complaint, the Commission alleges that since at least\rJune 1996, Murphy has offered and sold limited partnership\rinterests through a company doing business as ATM Global, Inc.\r(ATM Global).  The limited partnership was to raise $2.8\rmillion from investors and then acquire, own and operate\rautomated teller machines (ATMs) nationwide.  ATMs generate\rrevenue through transaction fees charged to customers who use\rthem.  The written offering materials state that the projected\rreturn to investors would be over 176% in the first year and 203%\rannually in the second through seventh years.  Murphy designed\rthe limited partnership program and led the promotional and sales\refforts.  To date, Murphy himself has raised at least $327,500\rfrom investors.\r\r     The Commission\s preliminary injunction application alleges\rthat, in offering and selling the limited partnership interests\rto investors, Murphy misrepresented his identity by using the\raliases Jack Davis, Gregg Davis and Mike Fox.  Furthermore,\ras set forth in the Complaint, Murphy failed to disclose the\rentry of, and the terms of, a 1994 Final Judgment entered against\rhim in an earlier Commission action enjoining him from future\rviolations of the registration and antifraud provisions of the\rfederal securities laws.  SEC v. American Capital Investments, et\ral., Civil Case No. CV-93-5280 CBM (JRx)(C.D. Cal.)(Lit Rel. No.\r14185).

Murphy further failed to disclose that another company\rhe owned and managed, American Capital Investments, Inc., was\rplaced into receivership.\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\r\r                              - 2 -\r\r     The Complaint also alleges that Murphy violated Section\r17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the \rSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and\rseeks preliminary and permanent injunctions, and other relief,\rincluding disgorgement and civil penalties, against Murphy for\rhis latest violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal\rsecurities laws.\x0c\x1a"

The complaint\r     alleges  that, beginning in 1992, certain  defendants issued false and\r     misleading  press releases,  prepared false  and misleading  financial\r     statements, and made  undisclosed payments to  salesmen and others  to\r     manipulate the price of Members stock from $2.50 to a high of  $12 per\r     share.\r\r          According to  the complaint, the scheme began when stock promoter\r     Sung  and Arthur  Feher,  Jr., the  now-deceased  former president  of\r     Members, obtained 1.4 million shares of  unregistered Members stock in\r     sham transactions designed  to circumvent the  registration provisions\r     of the federal securities  laws.  In one transaction,  Feher allegedly\r     caused Members to issue  200,000 shares to his nominee,  a 96-year-old\r     retired nursemaid  who lived  with him  in Florida.   In an  effort to\r     invoke Regulation  S, which  provides exemption from  registration for\r     sales made abroad, Feher  allegedly caused Members to issue  the stock\r     to the  woman  as payment  for consulting  services that  she had  not\r     performed,  and moreover  caused  records to  reflect  that she  lived\r     abroad.    The  complaint  alleges  that the  unregistered  stock  was\r     deposited  in  nominee  accounts  at Union  Securities  in  Vancouver,\r     British Columbia, where Gilbert worked as a stockbroker.\r\r          The complaint alleges that Sung, Feher, Moore, Lanza, and Gilbert\r     met in Boca  Raton in May  1992 and  agreed to undertake  a series  of\r     actions  to raise Members share price artificially, to sell more than\r     one million shares of  unregistered Members stock that Sung  and Feher\r     controlled at Union  Securities, and  to share the  proceeds from  the\r     sales.    Members  thereafter   allegedly  issued  various  false  and\r     misleading press  releases about  its involvement with  companies that\r     were  developing synthetic  blood  and producing  oil  and gas.    The\r     complaint  alleges that, in one  press release, Members falsely stated\r\r                            ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\r\r\r\r\r     that  it had acquired a synthetic blood  company when, in fact, it had\r     not.   In  another  press release,  Members  allegedly predicted  that\r     drilling  on its  oil and  gas properties  would generate  substantial\r     revenues,  but  the  release failed  to  disclose  that  there was  no\r     reasonable basis for the prediction.\r\r          As part of the alleged scheme, Moore and Payne caused Wall Street\r     Strategies, a New  York investment adviser, to  recommend the purchase\r     of Members stock to its clients, and Lanza recommended the purchase of\r     Members  stock to  others.   According to  the complaint,  Wall Street\r     Strategies, Payne,  and Moore failed to disclose the compensation that\r     they received for  promoting the  stock.  The  complaint alleges  that\r     Lanza was  paid at least $540,000,  that Moore was  paid $282,000, and\r     that  Payne was  paid nearly  $70,000 for  promoting the  stock.   The\r     complaint also alleges that First New England Securities, a Boca Raton\r     brokerage  firm  that  Silseth   controlled,  sold  Members  stock  to\r     customers at prices that  included excessive, undisclosed compensation\r     to the  brokers.  The complaint  further alleges that, as  part of the\r     scheme, Sung provided Silseth with several hundred thousand dollars to\r     help finance the operations of First New England.  \r\r          The complaint alleges that Sung, Feher, Silseth, Moore, and Lanza\r     obtained  illegal  profits  of more  that  $5  million  from sales  of\r     unregistered  Members stock into the manipulated market.  In addition,\r     according  to the  complaint,  Union Securities  and Gilbert  received\r     approximately  $350,000  in commissions  for  transactions  in Members\r     stock.  \r\r          The  complaint alleges  that  ONeal, who  was  then a  certified\r     public  accountant,  participated  in  deficient  audits  of  Members\r     financial statements for 1991  and 1992.  According to  the complaint,\r     the financial  statements materially  overstated  Members assets  and\r     materially understated Members  liabilities.   The complaint  alleges\r     that ONeal knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that the audits were\r     deficient and that Members financial statements had not been prepared\r     in accordance with professional standards.\r\r          The complaint  alleges that Members, Sung,  Silseth, Moore, Union\r     Securities, Gilbert, and Lanza violated  Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a)\r     of the  Securities Act, Section  10(b) of the  Exchange Act, and  Rule\r     10b-5.   The complaint also alleges that Members made materially false\r     and misleading  filings with  the Commission in  violation of  Section\r     13(a) of  the Exchange Act and  Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1.   In addition,\r     the  complaint  alleges that  ONeal  violated  Section 10(b)  of  the\r     Exchange  Act and  Rule  10b-5,  that  Sung  failed  to  disclose  his\r     beneficial  ownership of 5% of  Members stock in  violation of Section\r     13(d)  of  the  Exchange Act  and  Rule  13d-1, and  that  Wall Street\r     Strategies and  Payne violated  Section 17(b)  of the  Securities Act.\r     The complaint seeks disgorgement  of illegal profits, civil penalties,\r     and  permanent injunctions against further violations.

The Amended Complaint alleges\r     that Steele  Jr. made false  statements to prospective  investors that\r     the stock  of Balance for  Life would  soon publicly trade  on Nasdaq,\r     that Balance for  Life would earn $0.85 per share  and $2.14 per share\r     in 24 and 36  months, and claimed that  the stock of Balance  for Life\r     would  soon trade  at $17  to  $45 per  share, all  without reasonable\r     basis.  In  fact, Balance for Life did not  have sufficient assets for\r     listing on  Nasdaq,  had no  operations  and a  net  loss in  1990  of\r     $177,000.  The Amended Complaint also alleges that Steele Jr. acted as\r     an unregistered  broker-dealer selling  the securities of  Balance for\r     Life  to the  general  public  before  he  became  associated  with  a\r     brokerage firm in 1993.  \r\r          The Final  Judgement ordered  Steele Jr. to  disgorge $29,122.50,\r     the commissions he earned from this sales of the securities of Balance\r     for  Life, Inc.

Graves and Moeller created and controlled\r     co-defendants Broadcast Associates -I, Broadcast Acquisitions, Inc., and\r     Broadcast Holdings, Inc., and utilized these entities as vehicles for\r     perpetuating this fraudulent scheme.  False statements made by the\r     defendants included unsupported predictions in offering materials that\r     investment in the defendants\ venture would return 223% to 900% within one\r     to three years.  The defendants also falsely stated to investors that they\r     had acquired licenses to certain wireless cable television markets when, in\r     fact, they had not.  \r\r          The defendants sold approximately $4.6 million in partnership\r     interests to approximately 300 investors in at least 37 states.

Martin, U.S.D.J. issued an opinion and order granting the\r     Commission s motion for summary judgment against Defendant Ted Harold\r     Westerfield.  The Court determined that Westerfield violated antifraud\r     provisions of the securities laws by engaging in a commission kickback\r     scheme.  Westerfield, a broker with Gruntal & Co., agreed to kick back a\r     portion of commissions he earned on the purchase and sale of high yield\r     bonds ordered by Albert Griggs, Jr., a bond analyst and assistant portfolio\r     manager with Keystone Custodian Funds, Inc.  \r\r          The Commission had charged that the scheme defrauded both Keystone and\r     its mutual fund investors, because its purpose was to enrich Westerfield\r     and Griggs rather than obtain best execution of transactions for the\r     Keystone investors.  Keystone investors also were defrauded in that they\r     were not informed that Keystone, in exercising its investment advisory\r     function, had agreed to execute purchases and sales of high yield bonds for\r     Keystones account through Westerfield, pursuant to his undisclosed\r     kickback arrangement with Griggs.\r\r          The Court held Westerfield liable for disgorgement of $210,931,\r     representing commissions he received as a result of his agreement with\r     Griggs, together with prejudgment interest of $133,896, for a total of\r     $344,827.  The Court also determined that Westerfield should be enjoined\r     from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [15\r     U.S.C. \x1578j(b)] and Rule 10b-5 thereunder [17 C.F.R. \x15240.10b-5]; Section\r     204 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 [15 U.S.C. \x1580b-4] and Rule 204-\r     1 thereunder [17 C.F.R. \x15275.204.1]; and Section 17(e)(1) of the Investment\r     Company Act of 1940 [15 U.S.C. \x1580a-17(e)(1)].\r\r          The Court based its determination on a jury verdict in a related\r     criminal case, US v. Westerfield, 95 Cr. 219 (LMM).  In that case, the\r     Court sentenced Westerfield to 15 months of incarceration.  The Court in\r     the criminal case also directed Westerfield to pay restitution in the\r     amount of up to a total of $105,465.50, according to a schedule.

May 29, 1997)\r\r          The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced the filing of a\r     Complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of\r     Indiana alleging that Judy Hockett, Gayle Raisor and Kevin Raisor violated\r     Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and\r     Rule 10b-5 thereunder by engaging in insider trading in the common stock of\r     Adesa Corp.

In its\r     Complaint, the Commission seeks permanent injunctions against Judy Hockett,\r     Gayle Raisor, and Kevin Raisor, disgorgement of trading profits,\r     prejudgment interest thereon, and civil penalties.\r\r          Specifically, the Complaint alleges that prior to purchasing shares of\r     Adesa, Gayle Raisor received a tip from his sister, Judy Hockett, that\r     Adesa would soon be acquired by Minnesota Power and Light Company.  This\r     confidential information had been obtained by Judy Hockett from her\r     husband, the chief executive officer of Adesa.  In addition to trading in\r     the securities of Adesa with knowledge of its potential acquisition by\r     Minnesota Power, the Commission\s Complaint alleges, Gayle Raisor tipped\r     this information to his son, Kevin Raisor, who also engaged in insider\r     trading.

These defendants prepared false quarterly and annual\r     reports which were filed with the Commission, and promotional materials\r     which were distributed to investors and brokerage firms that fraudulently\r     inflated the value of PanWorld\s mineral properties, misrepresented the\r     status of PanWorld\s business operations, its skill, experience and\r     expertise in mining, and projected huge revenues and earnings per share,\r     among other things.  At the time they were making these false statements,\r     which were designed to give the impression that PanWorld was an active,\r     viable company with profitable business operations, defendants Robert\r     Weeks, Ken Weeks, and Hesterman solicited a network of consultants to\r     fraudulently tout PanWorld stock, and working together they manipulated the\r     market price of PanWorld\s common stock and sold PanWorld stock into the\r     market.  \r\r          Defendants L.K. Management Co., Inc., controlled by Larry Krasny,\r     Puritan Communications, Inc., controlled by Joseph Fabiilli, and Jerome\r     Wenger, participated as consultants to PanWorld in the fraudulent scheme to\r     create market demand for PanWorld stock.

Further, Puritan,\r     and Fabiilli, also engaged in a manipulation of PanWorld \r     stock in the market by various means, including wash trades.  Defendant\r     Randall Gilbert engaged in a manipulation of the price of PanWorld\s stock\r     by buying shares and holding them off the market to reduce the supply of\r     stock and by other means.\r\r          Between 1989 and 1995 as a result of this fraudulent conditioning of\r     the market for PanWorld stock, various defendants engaged in a massive\r     distribution of unregistered stock and collectively sold hundreds of\r     millions of shares of PanWorld stock to public investors.  A portion of the\r     proceeds of these sales were used to secretly fund the business operations\r     of PanWorld.  The number of shares of common stock of PanWorld increased\r     from 2,686,236 shares to 491,283,026 shares between 1989 and 1995.  While\r     some of the shares sold were registered with the Commission pursuant to\r     Form S-8 and Regulation S, many of the stock sales were not properly\r     registered for public sale.\r      \r          While fraudulently touting PanWorld stock and manipulating its market\r     price, Robert Weeks, Ken Weeks, Hesterman and their nominees sold PanWorld\r     stock to unsuspecting public investors, collectively realizing proceeds of\r     at least $6.4 million, and Larry Krasny, L.K.

During the course of the\r     investigation which preceded the filing of the complaint, the Commission\r     received substantial assistance from the British Columbia Securities\r     Commission located in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.\r\r          By engaging in this conduct, defendants Robert Weeks, David Hesterman,\r     Ken Weeks, Larry Krasny, L.K.

PanWorld and Randall Gilbert also violated the anti-fraud\r     provisions.  Additionally, Larry Krasny, L.K.

T2 merged with three other publicly-held health\rcare companies in July 1994 to form Coram Healthcare Corporation.\r\r  \x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\rThe Commission\s complaint alleges, among other things, that\rAllegra, Hersh, Ledbetter and Clyburn inflated T2\s net income\rfor the quarters ended December 31, 1992 (First Quarter) and\rMarch 31, 1993 (Second Quarter) by engaging, and directing\rtheir subordinates to engage, in the following fraudulent\raccounting practices:\r\r     *    Recognizing January 1993 revenues in December 1992 and\r          recognizing April 1993 revenues in March 1993, and\r          artificially accelerating product delivery schedules at\r          the end of both quarters\r\r     *    Deferring bad debt write-offs past the end of the\r          fiscal quarter in which the write-offs were required to\r          be recorded.\r\rThe complaint also alleges that Hersh further inflated T2\s\rreported net income during FY 1993 by engaging in the following\rfraudulent conduct:\r\r     *    Recording in the Second Quarter the gain from an asset\r          sale that occurred in the next quarter\r\r     *    Reclassifying as assets certain period expenses\r          incurred in the First and Second Quarter \r\r     *    Making fictitious entries in connection with T2\s\r          acquisition of certain companies in March 1993 that (i)\r          pushed some of T2\s current bad debt expense back to\r          prior periods; and (ii) reduced the bad debt expense\r          that T2 recorded in the Second Quarter.\r\rThe complaint alleges that as a result of these fraudulent\rpractices, T2\s net income was materially overstated on its books\rand records, in press releases and in financial statements\rincluded in T2\s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the First\rQuarter and the Second Quarter.  As originally reported, T2\s\rFirst Quarter net income was inflated by approximately\r$3,970,241, or 31%, and its Second Quarter net income was\rinflated by approximately $8,769,903, or 86%.  The materially\rfalse and misleading financial statements contained in the First\rQuarter Form 10-Q and Second Quarter Form 10-Q were also\rincorporated in a Registration Statement on Form S-8 dated July\r13, 1993.  In addition, the First Quarter Form 10-Q was provided\rto the stockholders of private companies that T2 acquired on\rMarch 31, 1993 through merger transactions pursuant to which the\rstockholders of the private companies received shares of T2\rstock.\r\rIn addition to the above described financial fraud, the complaint\ralleges that Ledbetter engaged in illegal insider trading. \rSpecifically, the complaint alleges that in June 1993, Ledbetter\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 3======\r\rsold 10,000 shares of T2 common stock knowing that T2\s financial\rcondition was materially overstated, thereby avoiding losses of\r$52,522.  The complaint also alleges that during FY 1993, Hersh\rreceived a $31,500 performance bonus based on T2\s fraudulently\roverstated net income in the first two quarters.  Finally, the\rcomplaint alleges that at Hersh\s direction, certain of T2\s\rfield personnel also made materially misleading statements to\rT2\s outside accountants in connection with an interim review of\rT2\s financial statements for the quarter ended June 30, 1993.\r\rIn the complaint, the Commission seeks:  permanent injunctions\rand civil penalties against all defendants; disgorgement and\rprejudgment interest from Hersh and Ledbetter; and officer and\rdirector bars against Allegra, Hersh, and Ledbetter.\r\rSimultaneous with the filing of the complaint, Allegra, Hersh,\rLedbetter and Clyburn consented, without admitting or denying the\rallegations in the complaint, to the following relief:\r\r     *    Allegra consented to the issuance of a final judgment\r          permanently enjoining him from committing future\r          violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of\r          1933 (Securities Act), Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of\r          the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act)\r          and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1, and from engaging in\r          conduct as a controlling person that would render him\r          liable pursuant to Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act\r          for violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2) of the\r          Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20 and 13a-13. \r          Allegra also agreed to pay a civil money penalty of\r          $150,000.

Simultaneously with\rthe filing of the Commission\s complaint, Leonard and Hartman\rconsented to the entry of orders of permanent injunction from\rfurther violations of the antifraud, corporate reporting, and\rbooks and records provisions of the federal securities laws. \rLeonard also agreed to pay a civil monetary penalty of $50,000,\rwhile a civil monetary penalty against Hartman was not assessed\rbased on his demonstrated inability to pay.  The complaint\ralleged that, between June 1991 and December 1992, Leonard and\rHartman structured a series of nine sales and license\rtransactions for which revenue should not have been recognized,\rand caused CBC to improperly recognize over $6 million in revenue\ron the transactions.  Leonard is a resident of Epping, New\rHampshire, and Hartman is a resident of Suwanee, Georgia.\r\r     The complaint alleged that the transactions included\rshipments of product with no expectation of payment, premature\rrecognition of license fee revenues, and use of corporate funds\rto resolve outstanding receivables by creating the false\rappearance that CBC had purchased unrelated goods and services,\rwhen in fact CBC had simply bought its own product back.  The\rcomplaint also alleged that, during the audit of CBC\s 1991 and\r1992 financial statements, Leonard and Hartman attempted to\rdeceive CBC\s independent auditors by directing the completion of\rthe circular transactions, by obtaining false audit\rconfirmations, and by obtaining false documentation of agreements\rhaving been reached in earlier periods.\r\r     The complaint alleged that Leonard\s and Hartman\s actions\rcaused CBC to overstate revenue by $2.652 million (10.1%) and\rreport a net income before taxes of $497,851, instead of a net\rloss before taxes of $1.836 million for the year ended December\r31, 1991, and to overstate revenue by $3.571 million (10.3%) and\rreport a net loss before taxes of $11.404 million instead of a\rnet loss before taxes of $14.765 million for the year ended\rDecember 31, 1992.

The Default\rJudgment permanently enjoins Wye Resources from violating the\rantifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities\rlaws.   \r\r     Wye is a Canadian corporation headquartered in Toronto,\rOntario and claims to own interests in various gold and diamond\rmining properties.  However, as alleged in the Commission\s\rcomplaint, Wye has recorded no earnings from actual mining\roperations.  The complaint, filed on September 26, 1996 against\rWye and its former President, Rehan Malik, alleges that Wye and\rMalik participated in a fraudulent promotional campaign targeted\rtowards U.S. investors and improperly distributed Wye stock to\rthose investors.  See SEC v. Wye Resources, Inc. and Rehan Malik,\rLit. Release No. 15073 (September 26, 1996). \r  \r     With respect to Wye, the complaint specifically alleges that\rWye issued press releases and placed messages over the Internet\rthrough a New Orleans-based computer bulletin board service\r(BBS) called the Emerging Growth Stock BBS.  Certain of these\rreleases and messages were false and misleading in that, among\rother things, they misrepresented the status of Wye\s ongoing\rattempts to exploit certain diamond mining properties in the\rcountry of Congo (formerly Zaire).  The complaint alleges that\rWye thereby violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act\rof 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.\r\r     The complaint also alleges that Wye violated Section 5 of\rthe Securities Act of 1933 by engaging in a scheme to distribute\rapproximately 5.3 million shares of Wye stock that were not\rproperly issued under Canadian law nor properly registered with\rthe Commission.  According to the complaint, approximately 2.5\rmillion of these improperly issued shares were distributed to\rU.S. investors.  As of February 1, 1994, approximately 4 million\rshares, or 28.9 percent of the Wye stock then outstanding, was\rheld by U.S. investors.  On September 26, 1996, the Commission\rinstituted public administrative proceedings against a New York\rcorporation and its President in connection with their roles in\rthe distribution of Wye stock.

Scheindlin has ordered defendant\r     Thomas Warde (Warde) to pay $3,007,951 in disgorgement, prejudgment\r     interest, and civil penalties based on a jury verdict rendered on January\r     30, 1997 that Warde violated the federal laws against insider trading. \r     During June and July 1987, Warde purchased securities issued by Kidde, Inc.\r     (Kidde) after receiving nonpublic information concerning the possible\r     sale of Kidde from then-Kidde director Edward R. Downe, Jr. (Downe).  In\r     her opinion and order dated June 17, 1997, Judge Scheindlin also issued a\r     permanent injunction prohibiting Warde from engaging in further violations\r     of certain provisions of the federal securities laws.  Finally, Judge\r     Scheindlin denied Warde\s motion to set aside the jury verdict.\r\r          Judge Scheindlin held that Warde should disgorge $871,725 in profits\r     that he received in connection with his illicit trading in Kidde\r     securities, pay pre-judgment interest of $1,264,501 based upon interest\r     rates utilized by the IRS for underpayment of taxes, and pay a civil\r     penalty of $871,725.  Judge Scheindlin issued the permanent injunction\r     because there was a reasonable likelihood of future violations in the\r     absence of a permanent injunction.  \r\r          In denying Warde\s motion to set aside the jury\s verdict, Judge\r     Scheindlin found that the Commission had introduced ample circumstantial\r     evidence at trial demonstrating: (a) Downe received material nonpublic\r     information concerning the possible sale of Kidde from Fred R.

Nicholas F. Coscia, \r     United States District Court, District of Nevada, Civil \r     Action No. CVS-97-0074-PMP (RLH)\r\r          The Commission announced that on June 18, 1997 Nicholas F. Coscia\r     (Coscia) a California attorney, was permanently enjoined by consent from\r     future violations of the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933\r     (Securities Act) and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange\r     Act).  Coscia\s consent was without admitting or denying the allegations\r     in the Commission\s complaint.\r\r          The Commission\s complaint alleged that in May 1988 Carl E. Lovell\r     (Lovell), a Las Vegas Attorney, and Danna Wale (Wale), incorporated\r     Triste Corporation (Triste) in the State of Nevada and then conducted a\r     controlled initial public offering and sale of Triste securities by having\r     all of the shares purchased by a group of investors acting in concert under\r     their instructions creating a box job.  Philip Sindler (Sindler), a\r     southern California stock promoter, learned that Lovell could provide him\r     with public shell corporations whose securities he could control.  In late\r     1988, Sindler and Coscia met with Lovell and Wale.  At that meeting Lovell\r     committed that he could provide one hundred percent of the purportedly\r     publicly owned shares of Triste at a price of five cents per share.\r\r          According to the complaint, Lovell told Sindler and Coscia that he\r     could deliver all of the stock through accounts in the names of his\r     controlled shareholders at the Las Vegas branch office of Fitzgerald-\r     Talman, Inc., a now defunct securities firm formerly based in Denver. \r     Robert Glau (Glau) was the broker on each of those accounts.\r\r          The complaint further alleged that, pursuant to this agreement, in\r     November 1988, all of the purportedly publicly owned shares of Triste were\r     sold from Lovell\s controlled shareholder\s accounts at Fitzgerald Talman\r     to Sindler\s controlled accounts at Adams Securities at the pre-agreed\r     prices, including 83,000 shares to the trading account of Ansantawae, Inc.\r     controlled by Coscia.  Sindler then merged Triste with another corporation. \r     Adams Securities later sold the stocks to the public at prices in the $1 to\r     $3 range.\r\r          On October 27, 1993 Coscia, Lovell and Wale were indicted by a federal\r     grand jury in Las Vegas on charges of conspiracy, securities fraud and\r     money laundering based upon their conduct in the scheme.  Coscia and\r     Lovell, as well as Sindler, Glau, and James \r\r\r                                        - 2 -\r\r     S.

Random, a former publicly-held Colorado-based computer\r     reseller, was acquired by privately-held Entex Information Services, Inc.\r     in 1995.  The complaint arose from Random\s scheme to generate revenue by\r     obtaining from its suppliers reimbursement for undocumented promotional\r     expenses.  \r\r          The Commission\s complaint alleges that from 1991 through\r     approximately January 1993, Bruce A. Milliken, then the chairman of\r     Random\s board of directors, and Richard A. Crawford, then Random\s\r     president, knew of and condoned the company\s practice of submitting false\r     or inflated expense reimbursement claims to certain of the hardware and\r     software manufacturers with which it did business.  The complaint further\r     alleges that, as part of the scheme, Random\s employees created sham\r     invoices and otherwise falsified the books and records of the company, and\r     that Milliken and Crawford knew or should have known of these actions. \r     Further, the complaint alleges that Milliken and Crawford knew or should\r     have known that funds received on these claims had the effect of inflating\r     the income reported in the publicly-distributed financial statements of\r     Random. \r\r          In addition, the complaint alleges that Milliken and Crawford made,\r     and caused others to make, false statements to the company\s independent\r     auditors in an attempt to conceal the scheme.      \r            \r          Simultaneously with the filing of the complaint, Milliken and Crawford\r     agreed, without admitting or denying the allegations, to the entry of an\r     order requiring each of them to pay a $50,000 penalty, and enjoining them\r     from further violations of Section 13(b)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act\r     of 1934, and Rules 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 promulgated thereunder.  The proposed\r     settlement of the action is pending before the court.  \r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c"

Hansen), in two actions arising out of alleged free-riding\r     schemes orchestrated by Sloan and Hansen.  Free-riding is a scheme which\r     involves purchasing stock in an account at one brokerage firm, without\r     having the funds to pay for it, and financing the purchase by selling the\r     same stock through another brokerage firm on the same day.\r\r          In case 89 Civ. 5242 (RO), the Commission\s Amended Complaint alleged\r     that, from approximately January 1985 through July 1989, Hansen and Sloan\r     opened at least 250 accounts at approximately 100 brokerage firms in\r     approximately 76 assumed names to conduct a free-riding scheme.  The\r     scheme reaped over $4 million in profits for Hansen and Sloan and, when\r     they refused to honor certain unprofitable stock transactions, caused\r     hundreds of thousands of dollars in losses to the brokerage firms through\r     which they traded.\r\r          In case 95 Civ. 9143 (RO), the Commission\s Complaint alleged that,\r     beginning in approximately December 1989, Hansen, Sloan, and the other\r     individual defendants opened over 645 cash accounts at more than 62\r     brokerage firms using approximately 40 assumed names to perpetrate a free-\r     riding scheme.  During a four year period, Hansen, Sloan and the other\r     individual defendants traded over $260 million worth of securities in cash\r     accounts, shifting the risk of loss to unwitting brokerage firms.  Hansen\r     and Sloan realized $879,380 and $1,597,550, respectively, in profits.\r\r          Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission\s\r     Complaints, Hansen and Sloan each consented to permanent injunctions\r     against violating (i) Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, (ii)\r     Sections 7(f) and 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule\r     10b-5, and (iii) \r\r                                        - 2 -\r\r     Regulation X promulgated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\r     System.

GATCH AND HENRY BENJAMIN\r     SCHMIDT, Case No. C-1-97-599 (SSB) (S.D. Ohio, W.D.)\r\r          The Securities and Exchange Commission announced the filing of a\r     complaint on June 24, 1997 in United States District Court for the Southern\r     District of Ohio, Western Division, alleging a Ponzi scheme operated by Ben\r     Mar Investments, Inc. (Ben Mar), a defunct unregistered investment\r     adviser based in Florence, Kentucky.  Named as defendants were:\r\r          *    Mark E. Gatch (Gatch), age 39, a resident of Amelia, Ohio and\r               the co-founder, president, and chief financial officer of Ben\r               Mar;\r\r          *    Henry Benjamin Schmidt (Schmidt), age 63, a resident of\r               Crestview Hills, Kentucky, and St. Petersburg, Florida, and the\r               co-founder and owner of Ben Mar.\r\r     The Commission\s Complaint alleges as follows:\r       \r          From February 1992 through March 1995, Gatch and Schmidt, through Ben\r     Mar, raised approximately $19.5 million from at least 365 investors by\r     selling unregistered promissory notes that promised interest based on the\r     performance of an investment pool managed by Ben Mar (the Ben Mar Fund). \r     The investors were located in Kentucky, Ohio, Florida, and other states. \r     In soliciting investors, Gatch and Schmidt told investors that they could\r     expect to earn profits on their investment of 4% to 5% per month, based on\r     past performance.  Gatch also made false representations concerning his\r     trading strategy and the risks of that strategy.  Contrary to these\r     representations, Gatch\s trading consistently resulted in substantial\r     losses.  Gatch concealed these losses, and maintained the illusion of\r     trading profits, by using the funds of existing investors and new investors\r     to repay principal and pay purported profits.  By the time the scheme came\r     to light, investors had lost approximately $12.2 million, including\r     approximately $4 million that Gatch and Schmidt took for themselves. \r\r          Gatch, who handled all of Ben Mar\s trading and accounting and has\r     pleaded guilty to criminal wire fraud based upon his role in the scheme,\r     United States v. Mark E. Gatch, Case No. 96-90 (WOB) (E.D. Ky., Mar. 17,\r     1997), made material misrepresentations and omitted material facts to Ben\r     Mar investors, illegally sold unregistered securities of Ben Mar (the\r     promissory notes), and failed to comply with the registration and custody\r     provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Schmidt solicited Ben\r     Mar investors and repeated Gatch\s false performance claims.  Schmidt,\r     however, failed to investigate the performance claims and failed to take\r     any steps to monitor Gatch\s activities or verify his statements of the\r     holdings or performance of the Fund.  In addition to the fraud on investors\r     in the Ben Mar Fund -- which was an unregistered investment company --\r     Gatch and Schmidt defrauded several other advisory clients of Ben Mar.  \r               The Complaint charges both defendants with violating or aiding\r     and abetting violations of Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of\r     1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5\r     thereunder, and Sections 203(a), 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of the Advisers\r     Act and Rule 206(4)-2 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctive relief, a\r     civil penalty against Gatch, and the fixing of the amount of disgorgement,\r     prejudgment interest thereon, and a civil penalty to be paid by Schmidt. \r\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c\r\r     The Complaint does not charge Ben Mar, which is in liquidation.

Scott Eskind (Eskind), of\r     Atlanta, Georgia.  The order enjoins and restrains Eskind from violating\r     Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the\r     Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 206\r     of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  The Court ordered a freeze of\r     assets held or controlled by Eskind. The Court further ordered Eskind to\r     prepare a sworn accounting of all monies received from the scheme and of\r     the disposition and use of said funds.  The accounting is to be submitted\r     to the Court within 20 days of the date of the Court\s order.\r\r          Eskind consented to the relief without admitting or denying the\r     allegations set forth in a complaint, filed by the Commission on June 20,\r     1997.  In its complaint, the Commission alleged that, between November 1994\r     and May 1996, Eskind was secretary and treasurer of Tower Asset Management\r     (Tower), the general partner and investment adviser of Asset Management\r     Fund, L.P. (Asset Management), a limited partnership formed for the\r     purpose of investing in securities.  In or before April 1996, Eskind\r     misappropriated or converted approximately $246,000 of Asset Management\s\r     assets, and concealed his actions by falsifying the partnership\s books. \r     When the thefts were discovered, Eskind was terminated by Tower.\r       \r          After his dismissal from Tower, Eskind solicited investments from the\r     public using Asset Management\s offering documents.

Doubletree, based in Phoenix, Arizona, is also in the hotel\r     management business.\r\r          According to the complaint, advisors to Renaissance met with\r     representatives of Doubletree in mid-December 1996 and outlined terms for\r     Doubletrees possible acquisition of Renaissance.  The principals of both\r     companies finalized the terms of the proposed acquisition in Hong Kong in\r     late December.  The complaint alleges that by December 30, 1996, Liu\r     obtained material, nonpublic information concerning the proposed\r     acquisition through a breach of a duty of trust and confidence, and that he\r     purchased more than 1.4 million shares of Renaissance common stock at an\r     average price of $15.66 per share on December 30 and 31 while in possession\r     of that information.  The complaint alleges that Liu purchased the shares\r     in a new account that was opened at a Hong Kong brokerage firm in the name\r     of a colleague, who agreed to fund the purchases and to split any profits. \r\r          According to the complaint, the shares that Liu purchased increased in\r     value by $11,270,000, or 44%, immediately after the public announcement of\r     the merger.  The complaint further alleges that on January 2, 1997, after\r     learning that the Commission had authorized an emergency lawsuit charging\r     Liu with illegal insider trading, Liu cancelled the trades and abandoned\r     the trading profits.\r\r          The Commission appreciates the substantial assistance that the Hong\r     Kong Securities and Futures Commission provided to it in this matter.\r\r\r\r\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c"

EMANUEL PINEZ, Civil Action No. 97-10353-PBS (U.S.D.C., D. MA.)\r\r          The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today it has\r     requested permission to file a Second Amended Complaint against Emanuel\r     Pinez (Pinez), the former chairman and chief executive officer of\r     Centennial Technologies, Inc. (Centennial), alleging that Pinez engaged\r     in additional unlawful insider trading through an account in the name of\r     Felix Inc. (Felix), an offshore company administered in Jersey, Channel\r     Islands, U.K.  Felix was also named a relief defendant.  According to the\r     Complaint, Felix holds at least $808,878 in proceeds for the benefit of\r     Pinez from its sale of Centennial stock on February 6 and 7, 1997.\r\r          The Complaint alleges that Pinez is the beneficiary of a trust that\r     owns Felix.  The Complaint alleges that on February 5, 1997, Pinez\r     instructed Felix to sell 40,000 shares of Centennial stock.  This\r     instruction occurred just days ahead of Centennial\s announcement on\r     February 11, 1997, that the company had dismissed Pinez and would launch an\r     inquiry into the accuracy of the company\s most recently announced earnings\r     and prior financial statements.  According to the Complaint, Pinez knew at\r     the time of these trades that Centennial\s financial condition was\r     substantially worse than had been previously reported by the company as a\r     result of financial improprieties engaged in by Pinez.  At approximately\r     the same time that Felix sold Centennial stock, Pinez purchased and sold\r     5,400 option contracts on Centennial stock through another account at\r     Lehman Brothers Inc. (Lehman).  Pinez\s options trades were the subject\r     of the Commission\s initial Complaint.  A First Amended Complaint, which\r     added Lehman as relief defendant, alleged that Pinez received $447,500\r     profit from the sale of call options, and gained more than $4.6 million\r     from his purchase of put options, on February 7, 1997.\r\r          Felix transacted the stock sale through a brokerage account at\r     Lehman\s Boston office.  The Complaint alleges that on February 25, 1997,\r     Felix\s administrator directed Lehman to wire all but $1,000 of the\r     approximately $966,880 in the Felix account to Hill Samuel Bank Limited\r     (Hill Samuel) in Jersey, Channel Islands.  The Complaint alleges that on\r     February 25, 1997, Lehman wired $965,880.72 from the Felix account to Chase\r     Manhattan Bank for the benefit of Hill Samuel.  The Complaint alleges that\r     these funds were wired out of the Felix account notwithstanding an Order\r     from the U.S. District Court on February 14, 1997 prohibiting the release\r     of funds controlled directly or indirectly by Pinez.  The Complaint alleges\r     that since February 25, 1997, Felix has reinvested the $965,880.72 from the\r     Felix account in a fixed weekly deposit account at Hill Samuel.  The\r     Complaint also seeks the return of these funds from the Channel Islands to\r     the United States for the benefit of defrauded investors.\r                     \r     For further information, please see Litigation Release Nos. 15258 and\r     15295.\r\x0c"

Paez, United States District Judge for the Central\r     District of California, issued an order of preliminary injunction against\r     Affordable Prepaid Cellular, Inc., and its part-owner and Vice President,\r     John C. Rockett (Rockett).  APC is based in Lake Forest, California, and\r     its stated business is to provide prepaid cellular telephone service to\r     credit-challenged individuals. The Court s Order also continued the\r     freeze of APC s and Rockett s assets until trial, prohibits APC and Rockett\r     from destroying documents, and requires APC and Rockett to account for\r     investor funds.  So far, neither APC nor Rockett has answered the\r     Commission s complaint, and neither has complied with the Court ordered\r     accountings.\r\r          The Commission\s complaint (filed May 20, 1997), and other papers\r     filed in the case, allege that APC and Rockett fraudulently offered and/or\r     sold units in APC, in the form of $5,000 corporate notes, to at least one\r     hundred individuals since December 1996.  According to APC, in return for\r     their investment, APC promised investors a guaranteed 16 3/4% annual\r     return, plus 1% of half of APC\s profits, and that the investor\s original\r     contribution would be returned at the end of one year.  Further, APC\r     promised that investors\ monies would be used to fund APC\s business\r     operations.  Instead, however, the Commission alleges that Rockett misused\r     and misappropriated substantial amounts of the $750,000 raised from\r     investors by:\r\r     Wire transferring at least $113,020 from APC s bank accounts to accounts in\r          Tortola, British Virgin Islands; \r\r     Withdrawing from APC s bank accounts at least $243,480, by writing checks\r          up to $80,000 each to  cash  or to himself; and\r\r     Paying commissions to sales agents of at least $57,750.\r\r          In granting the preliminary injunction, the Court found that the\r     Commission had demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success in its\r     action as to the fraudulent statements made by APC and Rockett, including\r     that:  (1)  Rockett was Vice President and part-owner of APC; (2) Rockett\r     has been twice convicted for selling fraudulent investments; (3) in 1992 an\r     order was issued by the State of California against Rockett prohibiting him\r     from selling securities in California; (4)  eight other states have\r     obtained orders against Rockett for violating state securities laws; and\r     (5) contrary to APC\s statements to investors that it is located in\r     Seattle, Washington, APC is in fact located in Lake Forest, California. \r     The Commission has alleged that these statements were materially misleading\r     and omitted to state material facts, in violation of Section 17(a) of the\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c\r\r\r\r\r\r\r     Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of\r     1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 2======\r\x0c"

The\r     Receiver, among other things, has been pursuing assets misappropriated from\r     QPI and winding down the business of QPI.\r\r          The Permanent Injunction against Allison was entered by default on\r     motion of the Commission.  QPI, by the Receiver, consented to the entry of\r     a Permanent Injunction against it without admitting or denying the\r     allegations of the Complaint.  The injunctions prohibit both parties from\r     violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b),\r     15(a), and 15(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act),\r     and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, which are the antifraud and broker-dealer\r     registration provisions of the federal securities laws.  The Court reserved\r     its judgment on the Commission\s claims for disgorgement against Allison,\r     QPI, and The Lynx Land and Mining Company, Allison\s alter-ego and a relief\r     defendant in the action, until the Receiver has completed his efforts to\r     recover dissipated assets on behalf of QPI\s customers and has submitted to\r     the Court a final accounting of the losses sustained by QPI\s customers.\r     (For further information, see Litigation Release Nos. 14636, 14642, and\r     14680)\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c"

Russell\r     agreed to settle the action, without admitting or denying the allegations\r     of the Commissions Complaint, by consenting to a permanent injunction\r     enjoining him from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act\r     of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In addition, the final judgment orders\r     Russell to pay a civil penalty of $36,650.\r\r          On March 20, 1996, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed the\r     above-referenced insider trading action concerning trading in the\r     securities of Baltimore Bancorp.  Simultaneous with the filing of the\r     action, defendant Michael P. Angelos agreed to a settlement of the action\r     against him (see Litigation Release No. 14850).  A trial against the\r     remaining defendant, Russell, was scheduled to begin on July 7, 1997.  \r\r          The Complaint alleged that Russell, who was a member of the Banks\r     Board of Directors and also the Director of Finance at the Maryland Port\r     Administration, obtained material nonpublic information about the Banks\r     confidential solicitation and receipt of bids.  The Complaint alleged that\r     Russell tipped his boss, Angelos, who was the Deputy Director of the\r     Maryland Port Administration.  Following Russells tips, according to the\r     Complaint, Angelos purchased a total of 8,600 shares of the common stock of\r     Baltimore Bancorp on two separate occasions before a January 13, 1994\r     announcement.

(Felix).  Felix\r     is an off-shore corporation administered in Jersey, Channel Islands, U.K. \r     On July 4, 1997, the Commission filed its complaint against Felix, seeking\r     to freeze certain assets and insider trading proceeds it holds on behalf of\r     Emanuel Pinez (Pinez), the former chairman and chief executive officer of\r     Centennial Technologies, Inc. (Centennial).  \r\r          The Complaint, filed in the Royal Court of Jersey, alleged that Pinez\r     engaged in unlawful insider trading through an account in the name of Felix\r     as well as in his own account.

KING (United States District Court for the\r     District of Massachusetts C.A. No. 95-10220NMG) \r              \r          The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) announced that,\r     on July 1, 1997, Barry L. King (King), formerly of Wellesley,\r     Massachusetts and presently residing in Boca Raton, Florida, was sentenced\r     by the Hon. Nathaniel M. Gorton, United States District Court for the\r     District of Massachusetts, to serve a term of 46 months in federal prison,\r     followed by a three-year term of supervised release.  In addition, Judge\r     Gorton ordered King to pay restitution of $8,724,656 to defrauded\r     investors, representing their losses as a result of a fraudulent mortgage\r     pooling scheme.  King was prohibited from incurring new credit charges or\r     opening new lines of credit unless he is current in making restitution\r     payments pursuant to a schedule to be determined by the U.S. Probation\r     Office.  King was also barred from seeking employment in a financial\r     position that would incur third-party risk.\r\r          On March 4, 1997, King pleaded guilty to 32 counts of mail fraud\r     relating to a Ponzi scheme and one count of bankruptcy fraud for concealing\r     his assets in a bankruptcy proceeding.  The indictment alleged that,\r     between late 1986 and 1989, King solicited over $11 million from former\r     clients, many of whom were elderly, to invest their monies in secured\r     mortgages in return for guaranteed interest payments.  Contrary to his\r     representations, King pooled the investor funds and loaned their money to\r     non-creditworthy borrowers on distressed properties.  The indictment also\r     alleged that King kept his mortgage investment scheme afloat by using funds\r     provided by new investors to repay principal and to make interest payments\r     to existing investors.  According to the indictment, King used the\r     remaining investor funds to support his lavish lifestyle and to pay for\r     gambling debts, family airline tickets, his daughter\s wedding expenses,\r     and interior design bills for his residence in Boca Raton, Florida and his\r     summer house rental in the Hamptons, New York.  In late 1989, as King\s\r     scheme began to collapse, King sent lulling letters to investors falsely\r     reassuring them that their investments were safe.\r\r          On December 3, 1986, the Commission barred King from the securities\r     industry with a right, after three years, to reapply to become associated\r     with a broker or dealer in a non-supervisory, non-proprietary capacity. \r     The bar stemmed from King\s 1984 conviction on state charges of insurance\r     fraud.\r\r          On September 28, 1990, the Commission filed an injunctive action\r     alleging that King violated various registration and antifraud provisions\r     of the Securities Act, Exchange Act and Advisers Act in connection with the\r     scheme set forth in the indictment.  In December 1990, King was enjoined\r     from further violations of these provisions, ordered to comply with the\r     terms of the 1986 Commission bar order and ordered to make restitution to\r     investors.

The Final Judgment is based upon the Court\s May 28, 1997\r     order granting the Commission\s motion for summary judgment against\r     Borello.  The Final Judgment enjoins Borello from violating the antifraud\r     and reporting provisions of the federal securities laws and from making\r     false and misleading statements concerning any public company to its\r     auditors.  In addition, the Final Judgment orders Borello to disgorge\r     $102,119 in profits and to pay $54,192.04 in prejudgment interest and a\r     civil penalty of $50,000.  The Final Judgment also bars Borello from acting\r     as an officer or director of a public company.\r\r          Between 1989 and at least 1992, Borello and others engaged in a scheme\r     to conceal that Atratech, Inc., a plumbing and heating company, was\r     secretly controlled by Anthony Gurino (Gurino).  Gurino had been barred\r     from bidding on public works contracts because of his failure to disclose\r     that he had been indicted for obstruction of justice.  By concealing\r     Gurino\s association with the company, Atratech bid for and won contracts\r     on public works projects that it was ineligible to participate in.\r\r          Borello, who was president of Atratech, signed public filings that\r     misrepresented and omitted material information concerning Gurino\s control\r     of the company.

(CIMI), a broker-dealer\r     registered with the Commission.  In its complaint, the Commission alleges\r     that, from July 1992 through October 1993, defendants caused twenty-six\r     separate CIMI customer accounts to purchase approximately $7.5 million of\r     privately-placed Water Point Systems, Inc. (Water Point), debt securities\r     and that defendants subsequently exchanged some of these securities for\r     other Water Point securities with less favorable terms.  The Commission\r     further alleges that defendants executed many of these transactions without\r     the knowledge or consent of the CIMI customers and by forging, or causing\r     to be forged, customer signatures.  Water Point, a Fort Worth, Texas\r     company, marketed and distributed home and office water purification\r     equipment.  Defendant Smith served as a Water Point director from November\r     1992 through March 1995 and, together with his wife, beneficially owned\r     12.5 percent of Water Point\s outstanding common stock.  On March 10, 1995,\r     Water Point filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition, which was later\r     converted to a Chapter 7 liquidation.  Water Point investors holding common\r     stock and unsecured notes lost their entire investment, while investors\r     holding secured notes received less than $0.50 per dollar invested.\r\r          The complaint alleges that CIMI violated the anti-fraud and broker-\r     dealer record keeping provisions of the federal securities laws contained\r     in Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and\r     Sections 10(b), 15(c)(1) and 17(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of\r     1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 15c1-2, 15c1-5 and 17a-4 thereunder. \r     The complaint further alleges that Smith violated the anti-fraud provisions\r     and aided and abetted CIMI\s violations of the broker-dealer anti-fraud and\r     record keeping provisions.  \r\r          Simultaneously with the filing of the complaint, a stipulation and\r     consent and proposed final judgment was also filed as to both Smith and\r     CIMI in which they agree, without admitting or denying the allegations in\r     the Commission\s complaint, and pending final approval by the Court, to be\r     permanently enjoined from future violations of Section 17(a) of the\r     Securities and Sections 10(b), 15(c)(1) and 17(a)(1) of the Exchange Act,\r     and Rules 10b-5, 15c1-2, 15c1-5 and 17a-4 thereunder.

RICE,\r     Civil Action No. 97-5125 RAP (AJWx)\r\r          On July 15, 1997, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a\r     complaint in federal district court in Los Angeles against Gray Hawk Fund\r     Company, an oil and gas limited liability company based in Woodland Hills,\r     California, and its principals, Salvatore A. Vecchio, age 51, of Los\r     Angeles, California, and Fredrick J. Rice, age 38, of Simi Valley,\r     California.  The Commission alleges that, from August 1994 through January\r     1996, the defendants perpetrated a fraudulent investment scheme through\r     which they raised approximately $1,055,000 from the sale of Gray Hawk\r     securities to 75 investors nationwide, most of whom were elderly.  Vecchio\r     and Rice misrepresented the use of investor proceeds and misused $474,500\r     of investor funds, $179,350 of which was used for their own personal\r     benefit.  Vecchio and Rice also falsely represented that investors were\r     purchasing interests in wells that were already producing oil when, in\r     fact, at no time during the sale of the Gray Hawk securities did the\r     company have an interest in any producing wells.\r\r          The Complaint alleges that Gray Hawk, Vecchio, and Rice violated the\r     securities registration requirements of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the\r     Securities Act of 1933, and the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of\r     the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act\r     of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that Vecchio and Rice violated the\r     broker-dealer registration requirements of Section 15(a) of the Securities\r     Exchange Act of 1934.  The Complaint seeks permanent injunctions,\r     disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.\r\r          Simultaneously with the filing of the Commissions Complaint, Gray\r     Hawk, Vecchio, and Rice consented, without admitting or denying the\r     allegations in the Complaint, to permanent injunctions enjoining them from\r     future violations of the federal securities laws.  The Commission waived\r     payment of disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and did not assess civil\r     penalties based upon Vecchios and Rices demonstrated inability to pay.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c"

Pa.)\r\r          The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced the filing of a\r     complaint in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of\r     Pennsylvania against twelve individuals for insider trading in the\r     securities of Independence Bancorp, Inc. (INBC) prior to a public\r     announcement on November 19, 1993, that INBC and CoreStates Financial Corp.\r     had entered into a merger agreement.  The defendants allegedly obtained at\r     least $750,000 from their unlawful trading.\r\r          The Complaint names the following insiders as defendants:\r\r          *    Robert Hunter, 66, resides in Huntingdon Valley, Pa. He is\r               presently incarcerated at the Pennsylvania State Correctional\r               Institution at Dallas as a result of an unrelated criminal\r               conviction.  Hunter was a director of INBC and one of its\r               subsidiary banks, Cheltenham Bank.  Hunter is also the owner of\r               Hunter Glass Company and the North Philadelphia Aviation Center,\r               Inc., which leases the facilities at the North Philadelphia\r               Airport.\r\r          *    Thomas Pileggi, 52, resides in Dresher, Pa., and was a director\r               of Cheltenham Bank.  Pileggi owns Thomas Pileggi Associates, a\r               building and real estate development concern\r\r          *    W. Kenneth Greenwood, 65, resides in Meadowbrook, Pa., and was a\r               director of Cheltenham Bank.  He was the owner of a furniture\r               business.\r\r          The Complaint also names as defendants friends, business associates,\r     or relatives of Hunter whom, the complaint alleges, Hunter tipped regarding\r     the proposed acquisition of INBC by CoreStates:\r\r          *    Edward Dudlik, 48, resides in Rydal, Pa.  He is the owner of\r               Dudlik Construction Co.\r\r          *    Thomas Goldman, 55, resides in Newtown, Pa., and is an attorney.\r\r          *    Joseph McKeon, 67, resides in Lafayette Hill, Pa., and is retired\r               from the glass business.\r\r          *    Kathy Naumann, 49, resides in Pottstown, Pa.  She is Hunter\s\r               niece and is a paper broker.\r\x0c\r\r\r\r\r\r\r          *    Benjamin Paul, 67, resides in Philadelphia, Pa., and is an\r               attorney.\r\r          *    John Rose, 51, resides in Southampton, Pa., and is the president\r               of United Discount Auto Parts.\r\r          *    John Rose, Jr., 28, resides in Warminster, Pa.  He is the son of\r               Rose, and is employed at United Discount Auto Parts.\r\r          *    Raymond F. White, 72, resides in Philadelphia, Pa.  He is\r               Hunter\s stockbroker and is employed at the Bryn Mawr Investment\r               Group, Inc.\r\r          Charged as a relief defendant is H. Constance Neff, Hunter\s ex-wife,\r     for trades Hunter allegedly executed and financed on her behalf.  \r\r          The Complaint alleges as follows:\r\r          In late October or early November 1993, Hunter, Pileggi, and Greenwood\r     learned that CoreStates made an acquisition proposal to INBC.  While in\r     possession of this material, nonpublic information, each of them purchased\r     INBC stock.  Specifically, Hunter purchased 40,000 shares for $1,151,750,\r     Pileggi purchased 35,000 shares for $996,200, and Greenwood purchased\r     20,300 shares for $560,087.  Hunter, Pileggi, and Greenwood earned profits\r     of $248,250, $228,000, and $150,412, respectively.\r\r          Hunter executed and financed trades not only for Neff, but also for\r     his now-deceased sister, Carol Cook, and for the daughter of his then-\r     girlfriend, after learning about the CoreStates proposal.  In total these\r     trades yielded profits of $18,877.50.\r\r          The friends and business associates Hunter tipped unlawfully profited\r     from their purchases of INBC shares as follows:  Dudlik purchased 6,000\r     shares for a profit of $22,000; Goldman purchased 2,000 shares for a profit\r     of $9,000; McKeon purchased 900 shares for a profit of $3,035; Paul\r     purchased 1,000 shares for a profit of $6,250; Rose purchased 800 shares\r     for a profit of $3,600; Rose Jr. purchased 260 shares for a profit of\r     $1,170; and White purchased 1,600 shares for a profit of $7,900.  White\r     also solicited trades in INBC from his clients, who profited by a total of\r     $29,512.50, and White profited by the amount of his commissions on his\r     clients\ purchases.\r\r          Naumann, Hunter\s niece, opened a securities account with White on\r     November 17 and purchased 500 shares of INBC stock after Hunter tipped her\r     about the acquisition proposal.  Naumann made a profit of $2,250.  Naumann\r     also opened a securities account on that day with White for her business\r     partner, who earned a $600 profit on purchases of INBC.  Also on November\r     17, Naumann tipped her mother, Dorothy Landis, who is Hunter\s sister,\r     about the acquisition proposal.  Landis then opened a securities account\r     with White, purchased 400 shares of INBC, and profited by $1,800.  That\r     evening Naumann tipped her cousin, Lenore Myers, who is also Hunter\s\r     niece.  The next morning, Myers opened a securities account with White,\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 2======\r\x0c\r\r\r\r\r\r\r     purchased 200 shares of INBC stock, and profited by $400.\r\r          In January 1994, a month after the public announcement of the merger\r     agreement was made, the National Association of Securities Dealers sent a\r     letter to the INBC board enclosing a list of individuals and asking if any\r     of the named individuals had any relationship to INBC or its officers and\r     directors.  In response to the inquiry, Hunter failed to disclose that he\r     knew Dudlik.  He also minimized his relationship to his sister, Cook, by\r     identifying her as his tenant, which she was not.  Further, Hunter\r     suggested to Rose that if contacted by the securities regulators, Rose\r     should state that the reason he bought INBC stock was because of an article\r     Rose had read about the stock and not because Hunter had spoken to Rose\r     about INBC.\r\r          Finally, Greenwood also traded while in possession of material,\r     nonpublic information in January 1993. At that time, Greenwood sold 15,000\r     shares of INBC stock, or approximately 95 per cent of his holdings, after\r     learning that INBC had suffered a quarterly loss in earnings and prior to\r     the public release of that information.  Greenwood avoided a loss of\r     $33,750 in the value of his INBC investment by selling his stock before the\r     negative earnings report caused a drop in the stock price.\r\r          The Commission is seeking permanent injunctions from Hunter, Pileggi,\r     Greenwood, Dudlik, Goldman, McKeon, Naumann, Paul, Rose, Rose Jr., and\r     White from future violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal\r     securities laws; disgorgement of profits and the profits of their tippees\r     obtained from their illegal trades in INBC stock; and, in the case of\r     Greenwood, disgorgement of the amount of money equal to his losses avoided\r     from his January 1993 sales of INBC stock; prejudgment interest on those\r     amounts; and civil penalties of up to three times their profits and losses\r     avoided.  The Commission is also requesting that Hunter be barred from\r     serving as an officer or director of any public company.  The Commission is\r     also seeking that Neff disgorge her profits.\r\r          Simultaneous with the filing of the complaint, Dudlik, McKeon, Paul,\r     Rose, and Rose Jr. each consented, without admitting or denying the\r     allegations in the Complaint, to the entry of a final judgment of permanent\r     injunction against future violations of the antifraud provisions of the\r     federal securities laws.  They agreed to disgorge their profits, totalling\r     approximately $36,000, plus prejudgment interest on those amounts, and to\r     pay civil penalties equal to the amount of their profits.\r\r          During the investigation of this case, Hunter brought suit against the\r     Commission, Chairman Arthur Levitt, and members of the staff, alleging\r     abuse of governmental power and violation of his civil and constitutional\r     rights relating to the staff\s investigation of his trading.  Hunter also\r     sought to enjoin the investigation.  All of Hunter\s claims have been\r     dismissed.  In Hunter v. SEC, et al., 879 F. Supp. 494 (E.D. Pa. 1995), the\r     court dismissed Hunter\s claim against the Commission, the Chairman, and\r     the supervisory staff, by which Hunter sought to enjoin the Commission from\r     pursuing its investigation into insider trading in the stock of INBC.  In\r     Hunter v. Heffernan, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14071 at 11 (E.D. Pa. Sept. 30,\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 3======\r\x0c\r\r\r\r\r\r\r     1996), the court dismissed Hunter\s claim against the remaining defendant\r     by finding that Hunter had not presented any evidence remotely sufficient\r     to sustain his claim.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 4======\r\x0c"

Tobin, who is 57 years old, was the\r     president, founder, and sole shareholder of defunct Tobin Investment\r     Corporation (TIC), which was located in Huntington Beach, California. \r     The Commission alleges that Tobin fraudulently raised $4,952,505 from 90\r     mostly elderly investors nationwide from September 1994 until January 1995\r     through the offer and sale of promissory note investments.  The money\r     raised from investors was to be used to fund a Las Vegas, Nevada\r     residential real estate development project called Rancho Mirage.  The\r     Rancho Mirage project was never developed, and most of the money raised in\r     the offering was used to pay:  (a) construction costs associated with other\r     real estate projects being developed by Tobin and financed by TIC;\r     (b) interest to investors in other real estate projects being developed by\r     Tobin and financed by TIC; (c) interest to investors in the Rancho Mirage\r     project; (d) an undisclosed 3% commission to TIC sales agents; and (e) an\r     undisclosed payment of 5% to TIC for operating costs.\r      \r          The Complaint alleges that Tobin violated the securities registration\r     provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933, the\r     antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and\r     Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5\r     thereunder, and the broker-dealer registration provisions of Section\r     15(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

STARNES, C97-1151R, U.S.D.C.,\r     W.D.Wa.\r\r          The Securities and Exchange Commission announced the filing of a\r     Complaint in the United States District Court for the Western District of\r     Washington alleging numerous violations of the federal securities laws by\r     Beverlee Kamerling (Kamerling) and others in connection with their\r     efforts to sell more than $1 million in stock of United Fire Technology,\r     Inc. (UFT), a company that claimed to possess the patents and marketing\r     rights for fire-extinguishing and fire-retarding products known as Flamex\r     products.  In September 1995, the Commission suspended trading in the\r     common stock of UFT because of questions that had been raised regarding the\r     accuracy of information UFT had disseminated to the public about the\r     company and its Flamex products, and UFT\s common stock has not been\r     publicly traded since that time.  Named as defendants were:\r\r          *    UFT, a publicly traded corporation that was based in Bellevue,\r     Washington          from approximately July 1994 through December 1995.  \r\r          *    Kamerling, a/k/a Beverlee Claydon, approximately 53 years old,\r     and a          resident of the Seattle area, who secretly controlled UFT\s\r                              corporate affairs and operations.  In 1989, the\r     British Columbia Securities             Commission entered an order barring\r     Kamerling from serving as an officer              and director of any\r     public company after she had pled guilty to six counts of \r     unlawfully trading in the securities of Ultra Glow Cosmetics, Ltd.\r\r          *    WWBM Consultants, Inc.

Starnes (Starnes), age 30, a resident of Taylors,\r     South Carolina,          who was a stockbroker.\r\r          The Commission\s Complaint alleges as follows:\r\r          From approximately July 1994 through December 1995, the defendants\r     committed numerous violations of the federal securities law as they\r     illegally raised money for themselves and UFT.  UFT conducted an\r     unregistered distribution of common stock, and Kamerling, WWBM, and Jones\r     illegally sold this stock to investors.  Specifically, Kamerling directed\r     UFT to issue stock to entities and individuals that were her nominees, and\r     Kamerling then had these nominees resell approximately 580,000 shares of\r     this stock to investors at prices ranging from approximately $2.00 to $5.50\r     per share, generating proceeds of approximately $1,350,000.  Kamerling then\r     kept proceeds from these sales for her personal use.  Jones facilitated\r     much of this stock selling effort, and acted as an unregistered broker. \r\r          While these shares of UFT stock were being sold, UFT, Kamerling,\r     Gartland, and Hooper made materially false and misleading statements, and\r     failed to disclose material information to brokers and the investing public\r     concerning UFT and its alleged Flamex products.  For instance, the\r     defendants falsely stated that third parties had tested and certified UFT\s\r     Flamex products, when no such testing had been performed and no such\r     certification existed.  The defendants falsely claimed that UFT owned a\r     manufacturing plant, and had contracts in place to manufacture its Flamex\r     products, when no such manufacturing capabilities existed.  The defendants\r     failed to disclose that Kamerling, who had previously violated British\r     Columbia\s securities laws, controlled UFT\s corporate affairs and its\r     operations.  The defendants also falsely stated that UFT had obtained a\r     legal opinion stating that patents for its Flamex products were defensible,\r     when no such opinion existed. Finally, there were misrepresentations and\r     omissions in UFT\s financial statements including misrepresentations\r     concerning UFT\s stock issuances, and omissions concerning related party\r     transactions.  \r\r          UFT, through Kamerling, also paid undisclosed compensation, or\r     kickbacks, to Starnes, a broker, to sell UFT common stock to his customers. \r     Starnes sold over 56,000 shares of UFT stock to his customers, and he did\r     not reveal to customers the fact that he received kickbacks in the form of\r     free UFT stock as a consequence of his customers\ purchases of UFT stock.\r\r          The Complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief against UFT and\r     Kamerling for violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities\r     Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange\r     Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; WWBM for violations\r     of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act; Gartland, Hooper and\r     Starnes for violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section\r     10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and Jones for\r     violations of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act and Section\r     15(a) of the Exchange Act.  The Complaint also seeks disgorgement from UFT,\r     Kamerling, WWBM, Starnes and Jones, as well as an accounting from UFT, and\r     an officer and director bar against Kamerling.\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 2======\r\x0c"

July\r     22, 1997)\r\r     The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it had sued\r     Policy Management Systems Corporation of Columbia, South Carolina (PMSC)\r     and five of its current and former officers.  PMSC is engaged in the\r     business of developing and licensing software used by insurance companies\r     and its securities are listed and trade on the New York Stock Exchange. \r     The SEC alleged in its complaint that from January 1991 through March 1993\r     PMSC and various of its employees engaged in a number of improper\r     accounting practices which materially misstated PMSC s results of\r     operations.  These practices included the use of side letters to modify the\r     terms of contracts, an undisclosed billing arrangement with one customer,\r     undisclosed prebilling arrangements with other customers, and various\r     practices which had the effect of holding the books open beyond the end of\r     several reporting periods.  The SEC also alleged that at the end of several\r     reporting periods PMSC and certain of its employees recorded revenue from\r     contracts which had not yet been finalized with customers.  According to\r     the SEC complaint, these practices, which did not comply with generally\r     accepted accounting principles or PMSC\s own publicly stated accounting\r     policies, caused the revenues in PMSC\s quarterly and annual financial\r     statements for 1991, 1992 and the first quarter of 1993 to be misstated by\r     amounts ranging up to $3.9 million. \r\r     The individual defendants sued by the SEC are George Larry Wilson, the\r     chief executive officer of PMSC, Robert L. Gresham, PMSC\s former chief\r     financial officer, James P. Brown, the company\s former general counsel,\r     David T. Bailey, an executive vice president of PMSC, and Bernard C. Mazon,\r     formerly an executive vice president of the company.\r\r     The complaint alleged that the chief executive officer and the chief\r     financial officer signed the annual and quarterly reports PMSC filed with\r     the Commission for the periods from January 1, 1991 through March 31, 1993\r     and provided the annual management representation letter to PMSC s auditors\r     for 1992.  According to the complaint, the CEO, CFO and general counsel\r     controlled PMSC s revenue recognition policies and knew or should have\r     known that in certain instances revenue was recognized from contracts which\r     had not been finalized and were not executed until after the end of the\r     period.  In one specific instance, the complaint alleged that in 1993 a\r     customer had notified the general counsel of its intent to cancel a\r     $980,000 contract which had been included as revenue in \r\r                                        - 2 -\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c\r\r\r\r\r\r\r     the period ended September 30, 1992,  pursuant to a cancellation right\r     contained in a side letter given to conclude negotiations for the contract\r     after the close of that period.  The complaint further alleged that the\r     chief financial officer learned of this side letter by February, 1993, but\r     PMSC continued to recognize the revenue from the contract in its 1992\r     financial statements.  The complaint also alleged that another side letter\r     was given to conclude a $1.8 million contract in January, 1993.  According\r     to the complaint, in February, 1993, the general counsel stated to PMSC s\r     auditors that two contracts PMSC had included as revenue in the period\r     ended December 31, 1992, had been completed in December, 1992, despite the\r     fact that the contracts had not been finally negotiated and signed until\r     January, 1993. The complaint further alleged that the defendant executive\r     vice presidents each negotiated contracts with customers where material\r     terms were not agreed until after the close of the period, and each gave\r     customers undisclosed side letters to conclude contracts, although each was\r     aware of PMSC\s revenue recognition policies.\r\r     The SEC s complaint charged that each of the individual defendants violated\r     Section 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act )\r     and Rules 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder.  The complaint also alleged that\r     PMSC, and as controlling persons, the chief executive officer, chief\r     financial officer and general counsel violated Sections 13(a) and\r     13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13\r     thereunder.  \r\r     Simultaneously with the filing of the complaint, PMSC and the five\r     individual defendants consented, without admitting or denying the\r     allegations in the complaint, to the entry of final judgments ordering PMSC\r     to pay a $1 million civil penalty and each individual defendant to pay a\r     $20,000 civil penalty.  The judgments also enjoin PMSC, Wilson, Gresham and\r     Brown from future violations of the periodic reporting, books and records,\r     and internal controls provisions of the Exchange Act and enjoin Bailey and\r     Mazon from future violations of the internal control provisions.            \r                                      \r           \r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 2======\r\x0c"

STEPHEN J. MURPHY\r     Civil Action No. CV 97-2719 JMI (CWx) (C.D. Cal.)\r\r          The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) announced that\r     on July 15, 1997, the Honorable James M. Ideman, United States District\r     Judge, entered a permanent injunction (Injunction) against a repeat\r     securities violator from Playa del Rey, California, Stephen J. Murphy\r     (Murphy), for his role in a scheme involving selling investments in a\r     business that was to own and operate automated teller machines (ATMs).\r\r          In its Complaint, the Commission alleges that since at least June\r     1996, Murphy offered and sold limited partnership interests through a Los\r     Angeles company doing business as ATM Global, Inc. (ATM Global).  The\r     limited partnership was to raise $2.8 million from investors and then\r     acquire, own and operate ATMs nationwide.  ATMs generate revenue through\r     transaction fees charged to customers who use them.  The written offering\r     materials that Murphy approved state that the projected return to investors\r     would be over 176% in the first year and 203% annually in the second\r     through seventh years.  Murphy designed the limited partnership program and\r     led the promotional and sales efforts.  To date, Murphy himself has raised\r     at least $377,500 from investors located in Southern California, South\r     Carolina and Virginia.\r\r          The Commission alleges that, in offering and selling the limited\r     partnership interests to investors, Murphy misrepresented his identity by\r     using the aliases Jack Davis, Gregg Davis and Mike Fox.  Furthermore,\r     as set forth in the Commission\s Complaint, Murphy failed to disclose the\r     entry of, and the terms of, a 1994 Final Judgment entered against him in an\r     earlier Commission action enjoining him from future fraud and registration\r     violations of the federal securities laws.  SEC v. American Capital\r     Investments, et al., Civil Case No. CV-93-5280 CBM (JRx)(C.D. Cal.)(Lit\r     Rel. No. 14185).  In that case, the Commission alleged that Murphy\r     fraudulently offered and sold investments in real estate ventures.  Murphy\r     also failed to disclose that, in 1994, the Commission had revoked his\r     registration as an investment adviser and barred him from the securities\r     industry.  Murphy further failed to disclose that another company he owned\r     and managed, American Capital Investments, Inc., was placed into\r     receivership.\r\r          The Injunction permanently enjoins Murphy from future fraud violations\r     of the federal securities laws.  Specifically, the Injunction enjoins\r     Murphy from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of\r     1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5\r     thereunder.

Murphy consented to\r     the entry of the Injunction without admitting or denying the Commission\s\r     allegations.\r\r          On April 21, 1997, the Commission obtained a temporary restraining\r     order against Murphy to freeze his assets to protect investor funds.

ALEXANDRA ELIZABETH MONTGOMERY,\r     WILLIAM KENNETH NESTOR, FREDERICK BURGESS AND HARRIET GLUCK, Civil Action\r     No. CV 97 4219 (E.D.N.Y.)\r\r          On July 24, 1997, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil\r     complaint in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of\r     New York against Alexandra Elizabeth Montgomery, the former executive vice\r     president, chief financial officer and a director of International Nesmont\r     Industrial Corporation; William Kenneth Nestor, the former president, chief\r     executive officer and chairman of the board of Nesmont; Frederick Burgess,\r     the former head assayer and a director of Nesmont; and Harriet Gluck,\r     Montgomery\s mother.  Nesmont is a Canadian refiner and processor of\r     precious metals whose stock traded on Nasdaq from May 1993 until it was\r     delisted in August 1994.  \r\r          The complaint alleges that from late 1992 until mid-1994, Montgomery,\r     Nestor and Burgess, while officers and/or directors of Nesmont, engaged in\r     a deliberate scheme to overstate the company\s income and inflate its\r     reported assets by including in inventory fake gold materials, including\r     brass bars made up to look like gold bars.  The fraudulent scheme involved\r     fabricating inventory, creating phony documents, falsifying assets and\r     earnings, and making false representations in press releases and materials\r     filed with the Commission.  For example, Nesmont reported net earnings of\r     $219,923 (Cdn) in its audited financial statements for the year ended\r     December 31, 1992, when it should have reported a net loss of $1,656,836\r     (Cdn).  In its unaudited financial report for the year ended December 31,\r     1993, Nesmont reported net earnings of $751,592 (Cdn), when it should have\r     reported a net loss of $4,047,726 (Cdn). \r          The complaint alleges that Montgomery, Nestor and Burgess violated the\r     antifraud and books and records provisions of the federal securities laws. \r     In addition, the complaint alleges that Montgomery, Nestor and Burgess\r     knowingly circumvented Nesmont\s system of internal accounting controls\r     and, in the case of Montgomery and Burgess, knowingly falsified or caused\r     to be falsified Nesmont\s books, records and accounts.  The complaint\r     further alleges that Montgomery and Burgess made materially false and\r     misleading statements to Nesmont\s independent auditors and, in the case of\r     Montgomery, lied to Nesmont\s controller, thereby causing him to generate\r     false financial statements.  The complaint also alleges that Montgomery,\r     Nestor and Burgess aided and abetted Nesmont\s reporting violations by\r     making material misstatements and omissions in annual and periodic reports\r     filed with the Commission.\r\r\r                                        - 2 -\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c\r\r\r\r\r\r\r          The complaint further alleges that Montgomery and her mother, Gluck,\r     violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws by\r     engaging in insider trading in Nesmont stock from June 10, 1994 through\r     June 23, 1994, while the investing public was unaware of the inventory\r     fraud.  During that period, 59,200 shares of Nesmont stock were sold from\r     Gluck\s accounts, netting total proceeds of approximately $297,200 (U.S.). \r     After Nesmont\s new management disclosed the inventory fraud in August\r     1994, and the stock was delisted from Nasdaq, the stock became virtually\r     worthless.  As a result, Gluck and/or Montgomery avoided losses of\r     approximately $282,400 (U.S.) by selling Nesmont stock while in possession\r     of material non-public information.\r\r          The Commission seeks a permanent injunction enjoining Montgomery,\r     Nestor and Burgess from violating Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the\r     Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder;\r     enjoining Montgomery and Burgess from violating Rules 13b2-1 and 13b2-2\r     under the Exchange Act; enjoining Montgomery, Nestor and Burgess from\r     aiding and abetting violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and\r     Rules 13a-1 and 13a-16 thereunder.  Additionally, the Commission seeks an\r     order for payment of civil penalties from Montgomery, Nestor and Burgess\r     and an order barring Montgomery and Nestor from serving as officers and\r     directors of any public company.\r\r          The Commission also seeks a permanent injunction enjoining Montgomery\r     and Gluck from violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5\r     thereunder, payment of insider trading penalties from Montgomery and Gluck\r     and an order requiring disgorgement of losses avoided by Gluck and/or\r     Montgomery from the sale of Nesmont stock.\r\r          The Commission wishes to thank the British Columbia Securities\r     Commission and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police for their assistance in\r     this investigation.  \r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 2======\r\x0c"

STUART GREGORY SMITH AND CAPITAL\r     INVESTMENT MANAGERS, INC.\r     497-CV 545-A, USDC, ND/TX (Fort Worth Division)\r\r          The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) announced that\r     on July 7, 1997, it filed a complaint in United States District Court in\r     Fort Worth, Texas, seeking a permanent injunction against Stuart Gregory\r     Smith and Capital Investment Managers, Inc. (CIMI), a broker-dealer\r     registered with the Commission.  In its complaint, the Commission alleges\r     that, from July 1992 through October 1993, defendants caused twenty-six\r     separate CIMI customer accounts to purchase approximately $7.5 million of\r     privately-placed Water Point Systems, Inc. (Water Point), debt securities\r     and that defendants subsequently exchanged some of these securities for\r     other Water Point securities with less favorable terms.  The Commission\r     further alleges that defendants executed many of these transactions without\r     the knowledge or consent of the CIMI customers and by forging, or causing\r     to be forged, customer signatures.  Water Point, a Fort Worth, Texas\r     company, marketed and distributed home and office water purification\r     equipment.  Defendant Smith served as a Water Point director from November\r     1992 through March 1995 and, together with his wife, beneficially owned\r     12.5 percent of Water Point\s outstanding common stock.  On March 10, 1995,\r     Water Point filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition, which was later\r     converted to a Chapter 7 liquidation.  Water Point investors holding common\r     stock and unsecured notes lost their entire investment, while investors\r     holding secured notes received less than $0.50 per dollar invested.\r\r          The complaint alleges that CIMI violated the anti-fraud and broker-\r     dealer record keeping provisions of the federal securities laws contained\r     in Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and\r     Sections 10(b), 15(c)(1) and 17(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of\r     1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 15c1-2, 15c1-5 and 17a-4 thereunder. \r     The complaint further alleges that Smith violated the anti-fraud provisions\r     and aided and abetted CIMI\s violations of the broker-dealer anti-fraud and\r     record keeping provisions.  \r\r          Simultaneously with the filing of the complaint, a stipulation and\r     consent and proposed final judgment was also filed as to both Smith and\r     CIMI in which they agree, without admitting or denying the allegations in\r     the Commission\s complaint, and pending final approval by the Court, to be\r     permanently enjoined from future violations of Section 17(a) of the\r     Securities and Sections 10(b), 15(c)(1) and 17(a)(1) of the Exchange Act,\r     and Rules 10b-5, 15c1-2, 15c1-5 and 17a-4 thereunder.

The defendants\r     represented to investors that:  investor funds would only be used to\r     purchase and trade Treasury securities; investors would receive 1% per\r     month in profits from trading Treasury securities; if the 1% monthly return\r     from trading profits were not achieved, investors\ funds would be returned;\r     and only after payment of the 1% monthly return, would the trustees of the\r     Trusts, sales agents, and others be paid from excess trading profits.\r\r          The Complaint further alleges that contrary to these representations,\r     the defendants operated a Ponzi-like scheme that paid investors their 1%\r     monthly return from other investors\ funds, failed to return investors\\r     funds after suffering large trading losses, misappropriated investor funds\r     for their personal benefit, and transferred over $3 million of investor\r     funds to Bahamian bank accounts.\r\r          The Judgment against Shoop permanently enjoins him from future fraud\r     and registration violations of the federal securities laws.  Specifically,\r     the Judgment enjoins Shoop from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c)\r     and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Section 10(b)\r     of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5\r     thereunder.

The Judgment additionally orders that Shoop\r     shall pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest and, if appropriate, civil\r     penalties in amounts subsequently to be determined by the Court.

MICHAEL RICHARDSON and DERRICK DUMONT, United States\r     District Court for the Northern District of California, Civil Action No.\r     97-2761-SI (N.D. Cal. 1997).\r\r\r          The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) today sued a\r     securities brokerage and two of its executives for defrauding investors who\r     bought $69 million worth of municipal bonds in five municipal bond\r     offerings in California.  The Commission\s Complaint alleges that\r     Defendants lied to investors and omitted to tell them important information\r     in the offering materials for each bond offering about the risks connected\r     with the bonds.\r\r          The Commission filed its lawsuit against First California Capital\r     Markets Group, Inc. (First California), a broker-dealer formerly\r     headquartered in San Francisco (now located in San Diego), H. Michael\r     Richardson, a principal of the firm who lives in the Bay Area, and Derrick\r     Dumont, the former manager of the firm\s land-based financing department\r     who now lives in Calistoga.  The Complaint was filed in the United States\r     District Court for the Northern District of California.\r\r          The Complaint alleges that the fraud was committed in connection with\r     the Defendants\ underwriting of municipal bonds issued by the County of\r     Nevada (Nevada County), the City of Ione (Ione), the Avenal Public\r     Financing Authority (Avenal), and the Wasco Public Financing Authority\r     (Wasco), all located in Central California.\r\r          The six-count Complaint asks the court to enjoin permanently the\r     Defendants from violating the law, order them to return all ill-gotten\r     gains plus interest, and impose civil penalties.\r\r          Nevada County raised $9 million, and Ione in two offerings raised a\r     total of $14 million, through the sale of Mello-Roos municipal bonds. \r     Such bonds are issued to finance real estate development.  The Complaint\r     alleges that in the Official Statement for the Nevada County offering, the\r     Defendants overstated the value of the property, misrepresented the\r     developer\s ownership interest in the property and overstated the\r     developer\s experience and financial condition.  The Complaint alleges that\r     in the Official Statement for the Ione offerings, the Defendants\r     misrepresented that all of the listed improvements could be built with the\r     offerings proceeds, overstated the value of the property to be developed,\r     and failed to disclose that the developer had insufficient capital to\r     complete the development.  These misrepresentations and omissions were\r     important to investors because they made the projects and the bonds seem\r     less risky than they actually were.\r\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c\r\r\r\r\r\r\r          The Avenal and Wasco offerings, which raised $11 million and $35\r     million respectively, involved the sale of Marks-Roos municipal bonds. \r     Such bonds are issued to form pools of money to finance a number of local\r     projects.  The Complaint alleges that First California and Richardson lied\r     to investors or omitted to tell them important information in the Official\r     Statements for these offerings about the need for the amount of money\r     raised and the certainty of the intended use of the proceeds.  The\r     Complaint alleges that the Defendants failed to disclose that some of the\r     projects listed in the Avenal Official Statement and nearly all of the\r     projects in the Wasco Official Statement were highly contingent, if not\r     speculative.  These misrepresentations were important to investors because\r     they falsely created the impression that the pools were fully subscribed. \r     When a bond issue is not fully subscribed, investors could be exposed to\r     the risk that the bonds would not be able to pay principal and interest.  \r\r          All of this conduct violated the antifraud provisions of the federal\r     securities laws, including Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933,\r     Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act)\r     and Rule 10b-5 issued thereunder.  Defendants also violated Section\r     15B(c)(1) of the Exchange Act and Rule G-17 of the Municipal Securities\r     Rulemaking Board (MSRB), which require a municipal securities broker to\r     deal fairly with its customers. \r\r          The Complaint further alleges that First California and Richardson,\r     when underwriting the Nevada County and Ione offerings, advised Wasco and\r     Avenal to buy large blocks of the Nevada County and Ione bonds, even though\r     they knew that these bonds did not meet certain requirements for Wasco and\r     Avenal which investors had been told would be followed.  In addition, First\r     California and Richardson--aware of a representation to Wasco investors\r     that proceeds not invested within a three-year period would be returned to\r     bondholders--advised Wasco to purchase several low quality securities (for\r     one of which First California acted as the underwriter) after the close of\r     the three-year period.  All this conduct violated Section 15B(c)(1) of the\r     Exchange Act and MSRB Rule G-19, which require municipal securities brokers\r     to recommend only suitable investments to its clients.  \r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 2======\r\x0c\r\r\r\r\r\r\r          Finally, the Complaint alleges that in February 1994, when Nevada\r     County offered to redeem roughly half of its bonds with its remaining\r     proceeds, First California and Richardson recommended to Wasco and Avenal\r     that they not tender their bonds.  This advice allowed First California\s\r     other clients holding Nevada County bonds to redeem at par while leaving\r     Wasco and Avenal holding Nevada County\s troubled bonds.

MITCHELL A. HAMMER AND JOSEPH LETZELTER, JR., Civil Action No. 97-\r     6892-CIV-ZLOCH (S.D. Fla. filed July 25, 1997)\r\r          On July 25, 1997, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action\r     against two former employees of Sheffield Industries, Inc., a bankrupt\r     manufacturing company which had been based in Miami, Florida.  The\r     Commissions complaint alleges that between June 1991 and January 1993\r     Mitchell A. Hammer (Hammer), Sheffields former CEO, and Joseph Letzelter,\r     Jr. (Letzelter), Sheffields former controller, perpetrated a massive fraud\r     on Sheffields investors by maintaining two sets of books and by filing\r     materially false financial reports with the Commission on Sheffields\r     behalf.  The complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief and officer and\r     director bars against both defendants.\r\r          The complaint alleges that six of Sheffields SEC filings, which\r     Hammer signed, overstated accounts receivable and inventory by as much as\r     40%, and falsely stated that Sheffield had complied with a critical loan\r     covenant from a principal lender when, in fact, it was in default\r     thereunder.  Hammer, with Letzelters assistance, orchestrated the scheme\r     by causing Sheffield to keep two sets of books and records: a secret set\r     which accurately reflected the companys deteriorating financial condition,\r     and a public set which fraudulently overstated the companys financial\r     condition.  Thus, the complaint alleges that Sheffield, through Hammer,\r     Letzelter and others, failed to make and keep books and records which\r     accurately reflected Sheffields financial and accounting transactions, and\r     failed to maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to\r     provide assurances that accounting transactions were recorded as necessary\r     to permit the proper preparation of financial statements in conformity with\r     generally accepted accounting principles.\r\r          The complaint also alleges that Hammer announced in a newswire report\r     that he anticipated revenues for Sheffield for the fiscal year ended 1992\r     to be approximately $36 million, with anticipated net profits of\r     approximately $.75 per share on 2.6 million average shares outstanding (or\r     approximately $1.95 million in net profits.)  However, on December 17,\r     1992, Sheffield reported losses of $1,800,000.  The complaint alleges that\r     Hammer had no reasonable basis for Sheffields July 1992 profit projection.\r\r            Sheffield was not named in the complaint because it had recently\r     liquidated under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.\r\r          The staff seeks to obtain officer and director bars and permanent\r     injunctions against both defendants, based on: Hammers alleged individual\r     violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act),\r     and Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c\r\r\r\r\r\r\r     (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder, and as a control\r     person, of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-\r     20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13 thereunder; and based on Letzelters alleged\r     violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, and Sections 10(b) and\r     13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 2======\r\x0c"

Gray was barred from the securities industry by\r          the National Association of Securities Dealers in 1977, convicted in\r          New York in 1989, and convicted in New Jersey in 1993, for\r          misappropriation of funds. \r\r          The Complaint alleges that, from in or about January 1993 through in\r     or about June 1996, Gray, while acting as an unregistered investment\r     adviser:  (a) misappropriated over $139,000 from his advisory clients; (b)\r     made material misrepresentations to clients concerning their investments to\r     conceal his misappropriation; (c) engaged in free-riding at the expense of\r     a registered broker-dealer through which Gray effected client trades; (d)\r     failed to maintain required investment advisory records; (e) failed to\r     furnish clients with required written disclosure statements; (f) entered\r     into advisory contracts that unlawfully provided for performance-based\r     compensation and did not prohibit assignment of the contracts without\r     client consent; (g) failed to adhere to the rules governing treatment of\r     client funds in an adviser\s custody; and (h) failed to disclose his\r     disciplinary and criminal history to his clients.\r\r          As a result of the foregoing, the Commission alleges that Gray\r     violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-\r     5, and Sections 203(a), 204, 205(a)(1) and (2), and 206(1), (2) and (4) of\r     the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and Rules 204-2, 204-3, 206(4)-2 and\r     206(4)-4.  \r\r          The Commission seeks a final judgment permanently enjoining Gray from\r     future violations of these provisions, ordering him to disgorge his ill-\r     gotten gains, plus prejudgment interest, and ordering him to pay civil\r     penalties.\r\r          The litigation is pending. \r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c"

On September 27,\r     1996, the Commission filed a Complaint in U.S. District Court for the\r     Middle District of Florida alleging that a group of stock promoters engaged\r     in an 18-month fraudulent scheme in which they paid $477,580 in bribes to\r     seven stockbrokers to induce them to retail securities to the public.  The\r     Complaint alleges that the promoters netted approximately $2.6 million from\r     the scheme.\r\r          The settling stock brokers are:\r\r          Robert Thomas Beatty (Robert Beatty), age 55, of Hollywood, Florida,\r          who was employed by First New England Securities Corp. in Deerfield\r          Beach, Florida during the relevant period;\r\r          Vincent St. Clair Beatty (Vincent Beatty), age 34, of Parkland,\r          Florida, who was employed by First New England during the relevant\r          period;\r\r          David Scott Rossman (Rossman), age 38, of Castlerock, Colorado, who\r          was employed by Kemper Securities in Denver, Colorado during the\r          relevant period;\r\r          Robert Beatty consented, without admitting or denying the allegations\r     in the Complaint, to the issuance of a Final Judgment by Judge Patricia C.\r     Fawsett of the United States District Court for the Middle District of\r     Florida enjoining him from future violations of Section 17(a) of the\r     Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of\r     1934 and Rule 10b-5 -- the antifraud provisions of the federal securities\r     laws.

SAMIR TRABOULSI, ET AL., 97 Civ. 5759\r     (RLP) (S.D.N.Y.)\r\r          The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) filed today an\r     insider trading complaint against seven foreign nationals and two foreign\r     entities.  The complaint charges Samir Traboulsi, Charbel Ghanem,\r     Socofinance SA, International Discount Bank & Trust (West Indies) Ltd,\r     Alain Boublil, Max Theret, Robert Reiplinger, Patrick Gruman and Jean-\r     Pierre Emden with tipping and/or insider trading in the securities of\r     Triangle Industries, Inc. shortly before a November 21, 1988 tender offer\r     by Pechiney Corporation, an entity owned by the French state.  The\r     complaint seeks disgorgement of approximately $6.5 million in illegal\r     trading profits plus prejudgment interest and permanent injunctions against\r     future violations of Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange\r     Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder.  The Commission also\r     announced settlements pursuant to which approximately $1.35 million of\r     illegal profits and interest will be disgorged.\r\r           The Complaint alleges the following facts concerning insider trading\r     and tipping by the defendants:\r\r          *    Traboulsi, a Lebanese national who resided in Paris, France and\r     served as an advisor to Triangle during the tender offer negotiations,\r     tipped his friends Ghanem and Boublil about the tender offer.  \r\r          *    Ghanem, a Swiss national born in Lebanon, who was a founder and\r     director of Socofinance, a Swiss currency brokerage firm, then directed the\r     purchase of 91,000 shares of Triangle stock in the account of International\r     Discount Bank at Socofinance, both entities that he controlled.  After the\r     tender offer those securities were sold for profits of approximately $3.65\r     million.  Those profits are being retained pursuant to an order of the\r     government of Switzerland.\r\r          *    Boublil, a French national who was then the Chief of Staff to the\r     French Minister of Budget, Economics and Finance, obtained material\r     nonpublic information concerning the transaction through his employment as\r     well as from Traboulsi.  He disclosed material nonpublic information\r     concerning the impending tender offer to the late Roger-Patrice Pelat, a\r     close friend and business acquaintance.  \r\r          *    Pelat, a French financier, purchased a total of 30,000 shares of\r     Triangle stock, which he sold after the tender offer announcement for\r     profits of approximately $1.1 million.  Pelat also tipped Theret and\r     Reiplinger.  Pelat, who is now deceased, is not named as a defendant in the\r     Complaint.  However, Pelat placed most of his trades through an institution\r     in Switzerland, and those profits are being retained pursuant to an order\r     of the Swiss government.  By agreement with, among others, the institution\r     through which Pelat placed his trades, those funds will be disgorged and\r     paid into the Court in this action.\r\x0c\r\r\r\r\r\r\r          *    Theret and Reiplinger, French financiers and then partners in the\r     investment firm of Compagnie Parisienne de Placements (CPP), directed their\r     employee Gruman to purchase 6 million French francs (approximately $1.25\r     million) of Triangle stock for CPP.  Gruman ordered 100,000 shares of\r     Triangle for CPP, but only 32,200 shares could be purchased due to the thin\r     market for Triangle\s shares.  In addition, Reiplinger bought 2,000 shares\r     of Triangle for himself through a Swiss bank.  Reiplinger sold his shares\r     for profits of approximately $82,000, and CPP tendered its shares to\r     Pechiney for profits of approximately $1.4 million.  Reiplinger\s personal\r     profits are being retained pursuant to an order of the Swiss government.\r\r          *    Gruman told Emden, with whom he had a business and personal\r     relationship, that CPP had placed a large order for Triangle stock.  Emden,\r     while in possession of material nonpublic information concerning that\r     order, and using a pseudonym, placed an order for 40,000 shares of Triangle\r     stock through a Swiss bank.  He was only able to obtain 6,000 shares due to\r     the thin market.  After the tender offer he sold his shares for profits of\r     approximately $244,000.  Emden\s profits are frozen by the Swiss government\r     pending the resolution of the SEC\s claims.\r\r          According to the Complaint, each of the individual defendants was\r     convicted of criminal offenses in France arising out of the events alleged\r     in the Complaint.  In particular, Traboulsi, Boublil and Gruman were\r     convicted of improperly communicating material nonpublic information to\r     others, and Ghanem, Theret, Reiplinger and Emden were convicted of\r     receiving stolen information.  Those convictions were affirmed by the\r     French Supreme Court of Appeals on October 26, 1995.  The Complaint alleges\r     that because the issues of fact in the French criminal proceedings are\r     identical to the issues alleged in the Complaint, each of the defendants\r     are collaterally estopped from contesting the factual findings underlying\r     the decisions of the French courts.\r      \r          The Complaint seeks permanent injunctions against all of the\r     defendants for violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule\r     10b-5, and against Traboulsi, Ghanem, Socofinance, IDB, Boublil, Theret,\r     and Reiplinger for violations of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and Rule\r     14e-3, and disgorgement of the illegal trading profits, together with\r     prejudgment interest.  Simultaneously with the filing of the Complaint,\r     defendants Traboulsi and Gruman, without admitting or denying the\r     allegations made in the Complaint, consented to the entry of permanent\r     injunctions enjoining them from violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange\r     Act and Rule 10b-5, and in addition, in the case of Traboulsi, from\r     violations of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14e-3.  Traboulsi\r     also agreed to pay $250,000 in disgorgement representing a portion of the\r     proceeds of the Triangle transactions of his direct and indirect tippees. \r     In light of Gruman\s demonstrated inability to pay based on his sworn\r     representations in his statement of financial condition, the Commission\r     agreed that disgorgement of $244,417 realized by his tippee Emden would be\r     waived as to him.  The Commission also moved the Court to direct the clerk\r     to accept payment of additional disgorgement in the amount of $1,098,760\r     representing profits and prejudgment interest realized on certain trades by\r     the late Roger-Patrice Pelat.  \r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 2======\r\x0c\r\r\r\r\r\r\r          The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Swiss Federal Office\r     of Police Matters in this investigation.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 3======\r\x0c"

Emmanuel A. Lagpacan, John A. Moreno\r     and Kubasaki Associates, Inc., Civil Action No. C97-2849-CW (N.D. Cal.)\r\r          The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it has\r     obtained a preliminary injunction freezing the business assets of an East\r     Bay investment adviser sued by the Commission in federal court for\r     defrauding his clients out of $4.4 million.\r\r          The Commission alleges in a lawsuit filed Friday that Defendant\r     Emmanuel Lagpacan, of Lafayette, California, fraudulently offered and sold\r     approximately $4.4 million in phony securities to 73 of his clients between\r     January 1990 and at least February 1997.  The victims included Lagpacan\s\r     advisory clients as well as his clients from an earlier job as a\r     stockbroker.  Lagpacan operates his investment advisory business under the\r     name Money Matters, Financial Consultants & Accountants (Money Matters),\r     in Walnut Creek, California.  He previously was a registered representative\r     at a local office of Waddell & Reed, Inc. (Waddell), a registered broker-\r     dealer. \r\r          Also named as Defendants are a real estate company owned by Lagpacan\r     called Kubasaki Associates, Inc. (Kubasaki), Lagpacan\s assistant, John\r     R. Moreno of Walnut Creek, and a real estate partnership run by Moreno\r     called Diablo Asset Development LP (DAD).  \r\r          The complaint alleges that Lagpacan convinced clients to redeem their\r     investments in mutual funds, annuities and other financial products and to\r     invest the proceeds in purportedly low-risk, government-insured investments\r     supposedly issued by Diablo Advisory Services (Diablo).  In reality,\r     Diablo was nothing more than a fictitious business name for Kubasaki. \r     Instead of placing the Diablo investors\ money in safe investments,\r     Lagpacan deposited it into Kubasaki\s checking accounts and used it to\r     purchase real property in Kubasaki\s name.  Lagpacan defrauded other\r     clients while at Waddell by falsifying brokerage account documents in order\r     to transfer clients\ money, without their knowledge, from reputable mutual\r     funds into his real estate company\s bank accounts.  Lagpacan and Kubasaki\r     were aided and abetted by Moreno.\r\r          Lagpacan still owes at least $3.2 million to approximately 50\r     investors located in California, Hawaii and four other states, according to\r     the complaint.  In recent months, according to the complaint, Lagpacan has\r     begun selling the properties purchased with investor funds and distributing\r     the proceeds unfairly to a small number of favored clients.  More than 40\r     other clients have received no payments, according to the complaint. \r     Lagpacan has also been lying to clients to cover up his earlier fraudulent \r\r                                        - 2 -\r\r     acts, the complaint alleges.\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c\r\r\r\r\r\r\r          The preliminary injunction, which was issued Friday by Judge Claudia\r     Wilken, of the United States District Court for the Northern District of\r     California, freezes Lagpacan\s business assets and Kubasaki\s assets,\r     appoints a temporary receiver to oversee Kubasaki, orders all Defendants to\r     cease violating the law, and other relief.  All of the defendants consented\r     to the entry of the preliminary injunction without admitting or denying the\r     allegations of the complaint.\r\r          Defendants Lagpacan and Kubasaki are charged with violating Section\r     17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Section 10(b) of\r     the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Rule 10b-5\r     thereunder, and Moreno is charged with aiding and abetting the violations\r     of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5.  Lagpacan is also accused of violating\r     Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940,\r     and Rules 206(4)-2 and 206(4)-4(a)(1) thereunder.

The defendants represented to investors\r     that:  investor funds would only be used to purchase and trade Treasury\r     securities; investors would receive 1% per month in profits from trading\r     Treasury securities; if the 1% monthly return from trading profits were not\r     achieved, investors\ funds would be returned; and only after payment of the\r     1% monthly return, would the trustees of the Trusts, sales agents, and\r     others be paid from excess trading profits.\r\r     The Complaint further alleges that contrary to these representations, the\r     defendants operated a Ponzi-like scheme that paid investors their 1%\r     monthly return from other investors\ funds, failed to return investors\\r     funds after suffering large trading losses, misappropriated investor funds\r     for their personal benefit, and transferred over $3 million of investor\r     funds to Bahamian bank accounts.\r\r     The Judgment permanently enjoins Brown from future fraud and registration\r     violations of the federal securities laws.  Specifically, the Judgment\r     enjoins Brown from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of\r     the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Section 10(b) of the\r     Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. \r     The Judgment additionally orders that Brown shall pay disgorgement,\r     prejudgment interest and, if appropriate, civil penalties in amounts\r     subsequently to be determined by the Court.  Brown consented to the entry\r     of the Judgment without admitting or denying the Commission\s allegations.\r\r     On May 5, 1997, the Commission obtained a temporary restraining order\r     against defendants Steven Robert Shoop (Shoop) and Anthony Ghirardello\r     Marriott to freeze their assets to protect investor funds.\r\r     The other defendants to the Commission\s action are:  Southwest Income\r     Trust; Advantage Income Trust; and Investors Trading Trust; Palo Verde 136,\r     Inc.; Advantage Marketing Group, Inc.; FLC Corporation; and Donn K.\r     Phillips.

INSNET WORLD COMMUNICATIONS, INC.\r     H-97-2525 (USDC/ND TX Houston Division)\r\r          The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) announced today\r     the filing of a complaint on July 28, 1997 against Insnet World\r     Communications, Inc., Frank Bravo, Jr. (Bravo), Jose Manuel Diaz-Salin,\r     Scofield C. Berthelot, Jr. and SCB Resources, Inc., seeking emergency\r     relief in the form of a temporary restraining order, asset freeze,\r     preliminary and permanent injunctions, and other relief.  In its complaint,\r     the Commission alleges that the defendants are engaged in ongoing\r     violations of the antifraud and securities registration provisions of the\r     federal securities laws.  Honorable Kenneth M. Hoyt granted the full ex\r     parte relief sought by the Commission and set a hearing on the Commission\s\r     motion for preliminary injunction for August 7, 1997.\r\r          The Commission\s complaint alleges that the defendants are engaged in\r     an ongoing fraudulent offer and sale of unregistered securities in the form\r     of promissory notes issued by Insnet, the proceeds of which are purportedly\r     used to purchase bulk long distance telephone time from major satellite\r     suppliers and directly distribute prepaid telephone calling cards to the\r     public.  It is further alleged that, since October 1995 to the present, the\r     defendants have fraudulently raised at least $4.8 million from the sale of\r     such securities to at least 216 investors residing in approximately 38\r     states.  Moreover, instead of using the funds to purchase long distance\r     telephone time and distribute telephone calling cards as represented, the\r     complaint alleges that at least $2.8 million of investor funds have been\r     paid to the individual defendants or companies that they control.  The\r     complaint also indicates that investors have received Ponzi payments when\r     investment funds from later investors were used to make quarterly interest\r     payments and to repay investors when their notes matured.  The complaint\r     also alleges that the defendants have refused to comply with Commission\r     investigative subpoenas for testimony and documents concerning their\r     business activities.\r\r          The Commission charges the defendants with violations of Sections\r     5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of\r     the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and also\r     requests an accounting, disgorgement of all illgotten gains, including\r     prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  The complaint also\r     includes Eduardo Eddie Grijalva, Bravo\s nephew, as a defendant solely\r     for purposes of relief.  The Commission seeks an asset freeze and\r     disgorgement of the more than $694,000 Grijalva allegedly received from\r     Insnet.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c"

SHAHRYAR SOROOSH, United States\r     District Court for the Northern District of California, Civil Action No. C\r     96-3933 VRW.\r\r\r          The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that on August\r     5, 1997, the Honorable Vaughn R. Walker of the United States District Court\r     of the Northern District of California, issued a Judgment and Findings of\r     Fact and Conclusions of Law holding that Shahryar Soroosh, a resident of\r     Saratoga, California violated the federal securities laws by engaging in\r     insider trading.  The Court ordered Soroosh to disgorge $505,819.00 plus\r     prejudgment interest.  The Court\s opinion follows a four-day bench trial\r     earlier this year.\r\r          The Court found that Soroosh, a forty year old, former senior software\r     engineer at Octel Communications Corporation (Octel), amassed a\r     substantial short position in the stock and options of Octel while in\r     possession of material, nonpublic information concerning an Octel software\r     delay.  The delay was publicly announced on October 24, 1996.  Upon the\r     announcement, the price of Octel\s common stock fell by over 35%, from\r     $24.50 to $15.70 per share.  As a result, Soroosh realized profits of over\r     $500,000, based on his 35,000 share short position and his 80 put\r     contracts, all of which he had accumulated in the weeks before the\r     announcement.  The Commission instituted its suit within days of the\r     trading, on October 29, 1996.\r\r          The Court rejected Soroosh\s defense that his trading was part of a\r     pattern of trading, finding that the trading at issue was out of the\r     ordinary, and rejected his assertion that he did not possess material,\r     nonpublic information.  The Court concluded that Soroosh\s trading\r     activity and the circumstances surrounding it were consistent with the\r     possession of insider knowledge and he has offered no plausible explanation\r     otherwise.\r\r          The Commission acknowledges the assistance of NASD Regulation, Inc. in\r     this matter.\r\r          For further information see Litigation Releases 15141 (October 30,\r     1996) and 15143 (November 1, 1996).\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c"

Ultimately, Telefund received a total of $1,180,000 from\r     investors, most of which was used to pay sales commissions and other\r     initial start up costs, according to the Complaint.  In the Complaint, the\r     Commission seeks a permanent injunction against defendants Snowhite, BLS,\r     Boratgis, Land, Olander, Wasserman, 900 Financial, Kane, and Sarcinelli for\r     violations of the foregoing provisions of the federal securities laws in\r     connection with the offer and sale to the public of unregistered securities\r     of Telefund.  Named as a relief defendant in the Commission\s suit is\r     Jeffrey Stern, BLS partner.  The Complaint also seeks disgorgement of\r     investor funds.  \r          According to the Complaint, beginning in or about November 1994, the\r     defendants began to offer and sell to the public securities designated as\r     general partnership units in Telefund, a partnership formed by defendant\r     Snowhite and his partner, Gregory L.

Litigation Release No. 15435 / August 7, 1997     SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION v. STEVEN H. SCHIFFER, JOANN R. SCHULZ,     GARY S. KRAMER, JONATHAN SOLOW, FRANK J. CANNATA, and PETER G. MINTZ, 97     Civ. 5853 (RO) (S.D.N.Y. August 7, 1997)          Today, the Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) filed a     Complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of     New York, alleging market manipulation, insider trading, the making of     false and misleading statements in Commission filings, and the sale of     unregistered securities, all in violation of the federal securities laws.      All of these activities related to Phoenix Laser Systems, Inc. (Phoenix),     a now-defunct company that was in the business of developing a laser     workstation to perform eye surgery.            The defendants are:  Steven H. Schiffer (former chairman and chief     executive officer of Phoenix), Joann R. Schulz (Phoenix\s former president     and chief operating officer), Gary S. Kramer (former investment relations     representative of Phoenix), Jonathan Solow (formerly Phoenix\s vice     president, secretary, and director), Frank J. Cannata (a stockbroker and     consultant to Phoenix), and Peter G. Mintz (a stockbroker and analyst, who     covered Phoenix for his firm).           According to the Complaint, between May 1992 and August 1992,     Schiffer, Kramer, Solow, Cannata, and Mintz, manipulated Phoenix\s common     stock to increase and/or stabilize its price in order to maximize the price     of future stock sales.  Based on this activity, the Complaint alleges that     these defendants violated the antifraud and antimanipulation provisions of     the Exchange Act, Sections 9(a)(2) and 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.           The Complaint also alleges that from May 1990 to April 1992, Schiffer     and Schulz caused Phoenix to make materially false and misleading     statements in Commission filings concerning the status of its Food and Drug     Administration (FDA) applications, the number of orders for Phoenix\s     product, and anticipated revenue from the sale of its product.  Based on     this activity, the Complaint alleges that Schiffer and Schulz violated the     antifraud and reporting provisions of the federal securities laws:  Section     17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b) and 13(a) of the Exchange Act,     and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5 and 13a-1.          The Complaint further alleges that from January 1991 through July     1993, while in possession of material, nonpublic information concerning the     true status of the company\s FDA applications, the number of orders that it     had received, and realistic anticipated revenues, the same matters they     caused the company to misrepresent in its filings, Schiffer sold     approximately 1.5                                         - 2 -                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\x0c     million shares of Phoenix stock directly for approximately $4.2 million,     and he sold approximately 2 million shares through the purported Regulation     S transactions described below, for approximately $11 million, thereby     avoiding losses of $15.2 million.  Similarly, between December 1991 and     September 1993, while in possession of such material, nonpublic     information, Schulz sold a total of 251,050 shares of Phoenix stock for     approximately $626,000, thereby avoiding losses of $626,000.  Based on this     activity, the Complaint alleges that Schiffer and Schulz violated the     antifraud provisions, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of     the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.          Finally, the Complaint alleges that, between September 1992 and July     1993, Schiffer and Kramer violated the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities     Act) by selling approximately 2 million shares of unregistered Phoenix     stock for approximately $11 million.  They disguised these sales as     transactions that appeared to, but did not, comply with Regulation S, an     exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act.  Based     on this activity, the Complaint alleges that Schiffer and Kramer   violated     the registration provisions, Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act.           In its Complaint, the Commission is seeking injunctive relief against     each of the defendants.  The Complaint also requests that the Court order     Schiffer, Schulz, Kramer, and Cannata to disgorge all profits that they     made and/or losses that they avoided as the result of their violations of     the federal securities laws, and that they pay prejudgment interest on     those profits and losses avoided.  The Complaint further requests that all     of the defendants pay civil monetary penalties.  Finally, the Complaint     requests that the Court issue an order barring Schiffer from serving as an     officer or director of a public company.          The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the American Stock     Exchange in this matter.\x0c"

The Courts order\r     and the Special Agents interim distribution plan call for the Special\r     Agent to distribute a total of approximately $5 million to Matrix and SFI\r     investors at this time.  With this interim distribution, and taking into\r     account any prior withdrawals, each investor will have received at least\r     fifty percent of the money he deposited with Matrix or SFI.

Ernest Tidwell, United States District Judge for\r     the Northern District of Georgia, entered an order of permanent injunction\r     against defendant Gregg Michael Brenner (Brenner), enjoining him from\r     violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of\r     the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Brenner was\r     ordered to pay disgorgement in the amount of $62,029 plus $9,511 in\r     prejudgment interest within thirty days of the date of the judgment. \r     Brenner was further ordered to pay a civil penalty under the Insider\r     Trading Sanctions Act of 1984 in the amount of $9,715 within thirty days of\r     the date of the judgment.\r\r          Brenner consented to the relief without admitting or denying the\r     allegations set forth in a complaint filed by the Commission on March 10,\r     1997.  The complaint alleged that on June 13, 1995, the General Counsel of\r     Medaphis Corporation (Medaphis), an Atlanta-based medical services\r     company, was in possession of material non-public information regarding\r     search warrants that were executed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation\r     (FBI) on two Medaphis offices in California.  In violation of her\r     fiduciary duty to Medaphis, the general counsel disclosed the information\r     about the FBI investigation to her mother and co-defendant Brenner.  Both\r     individuals then sold shares of Medaphis stock.  The complaint further\r     alleged that Brenner also disclosed the FBI action against Medaphis to his\r     father and brother, who promptly sold their shares of Medaphis stock.\r\r          On June 15, 1995 at the close of trading, Medaphis issued a public\r     announcement about the FBI investigation of Medaphis.  The price of\r     Medaphis stock dropped sharply the next day.  By selling their shares of\r     Medaphis stock prior to the announcement, Brenner, along with his father\r     and brother, improperly avoided losses.

According to the Complaint, American Growth Capital\r     and American Growth Fund were both managed by Defendants Donna L. Snyder\r     and Charles E. Duquette (both of Las Vegas).  The Complaint alleges that\r     American Growth Capital, Snyder, and Duquette misused and misappropriated\r     at least $1.6 million of investor funds to pay for:  (1) $945,000 in sham\r     investments in shell companies (companies with no assets and that conducted\r     no business) controlled by Snyder and Duquette; (2) $185,600 in undisclosed\r     and excessive commissions on sales of investments in American Growth Fund;\r     and (3) $468,000 in undisclosed payments to American Growth Capital,\r     Snyder, and Duquette.

And the\r     Complaint charges American Growth Fund with unlawfully operating as an\r     investment company without registering with the Commission, in violation of\r     Section 7(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940.\r\r          The Commissions Complaint also alleges that Growth Capital Resources,\r     an investment adviser in Las Vegas, fraudulently managed Capital Growth\r     Fund, an investment company with almost $500,000 under management and over\r     25 investors from several states.

Holcomb was also charged with acting as\r     an unregistered broker-dealer in connection with this public offering of\r     IMT stock.\r\r          IMT is a corporation with its principal offices in Santa Monica,\r     California.  During the relevant time period, IMT was engaged in the\r     development of, among other things, dietary supplements.  Shell, age 53, is\r     a founder of IMT and a medical doctor with a cardiology practice in Beverly\r     Hills, California.  During the relevant time period, Shell served as IMT\s\r     president, chief executive officer and chairman of the board.  Holcomb, age\r     47, is a licensed real-estate agent who resides in Westlake Village,\r     California.\r\r          The Complaint alleges that from approximately April 1992 through at\r     least June 1993, IMT, Shell and Holcomb raised approximately $5 million\r     from the sale of IMT stock to approximately 300 investors.  No registration\r     statement was in effect with respect to these shares of IMT stock.  Both\r     IMT and Shell were previously enjoined from violating the registration\r     provisions, based upon IMT\s prior offering of unregistered IMT securities. \r     See SEC v. Interactive Medical Technologies, Ltd., 92 Civ. 6409 (S.D.N.Y.\r     1992), Lit. Rel. No. 13354.  The Complaint also alleges that during the\r     course of selling shares of IMT stock to the public, Holcomb acted as a\r     broker-dealer without registering as one, in violation of the broker-dealer\r     registration provisions.  \r\r          The Complaint seeks the following relief: (1) permanent injunctions\r     from future violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 (i.e., the\r     registration provisions) against IMT, Shell and Holcomb; (2) a permanent\r     injunction from future violation of Section 15(a) of the Securities\r     Exchange Act of 1934 (i.e., the broker-dealer registration provisions)\r     against Holcomb and (3) civil penalties against Shell and Holcomb.  \r\r          Simultaneous with the filing of the Complaint, and without admitting\r     or denying the allegations therein, IMT and Holcomb consented to the entry\r     of Final Judgments of Permanent Injunction.

(JSM)\r\r          The Securities and Commission announced today that it has voluntarily\r     dismissed its civil insider trading claim against Abdul Ismail, a London\r     businessman.  Ismail is one of three defendants in a civil insider trading\r     action involving purchases of the securities of APL Limited in advance of\r     the public announcement, on April 13, 1997, that the company would be\r     acquired in a merger with Neptune Orient Lines Ltd.  Using a numbered Swiss\r     bank account, Ismail bought approximately $228,000 of APL stock options on\r     April 11, 1997, which nearly doubled in value after the merger was\r     announced two days later.  The Commission filed suit against Ismail as an\r      unknown purchaser  and obtained a court order freezing his trading\r     proceeds on April 15, 1997.  The Commission also sued a second, known\r     defendant (Ong Congqin Bobby) in its April 15 complaint, and added a third,\r     known defendant (Lum Kwan Sung) on April 25.\r\r          Because the Swiss bank through which Ismail traded refused to divulge\r     his identity, the Commission s staff was unable to interview him before the\r     action was filed.  Since then, the staff has conducted a thorough\r     investigation of his trading, including questioning him in a deposition. \r     Based on all of the evidence gathered since the case was filed, the\r     Commission has determined that it lacks sufficient evidence to continue\r     prosecuting its claim against Ismail at this time.  Under the terms of the\r     dismissal, the freeze on Ismail s trading proceeds will be lifted\r     immediately.  The dismissal is  without prejudice,  which means that the\r     Commission would be permitted to refile its claim should it uncover\r     additional evidence.\r\r          The Commission s dismissal of its claim against Ismail does not affect\r     its pending claims against defendants Ong and Lum or the court s orders\r     freezing the proceeds of their APL securities purchases.  Those defendants\r     have consented to extend the freezes on their accounts through dates in\r     September 1997.  No hearing or trial dates on the SEC s claims against them\r     have yet been scheduled.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c"

Kane (Kane) is not dischargeable in bankruptcy\r     because it arose out of fraud.  On April 5, 1994, the Commission filed a\r     civil enforcement action in federal district court.  On June 6, 1996, the\r     Commission obtained a final judgment finding that Kane had violated the\r     general antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and ordering\r     Kane to pay $122,670 in disgorgement plus prejudgment interest.  Kane then\r     filed for bankruptcy, seeking to have his debt for disgorgement and\r     prejudgment interest discharged.\r\r          The U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Massachusetts, agreed\r     with the Commission\s arguments that Kane was precluded from relitigating\r     the district court\s findings and that Kane also was bound by certain\r     admissions he made in a subsequent criminal proceeding against him.  The\r     bankruptcy court further held that those findings and admissions, taken\r     together, were sufficient to establish all the elements of fraud within\r     the meaning of Section 523(a)(2)(A) of the Bankruptcy Code, which excepts\r     such debts from bankruptcy discharge.  Because it ruled that Kane\s debt\r     was not dischargeable due to the fact that it arose from fraud, the\r     bankruptcy court determined that it was not necessary to decide the\r     Commission\s second basis for claiming that Kane\s debt was not\r     dischargeable -- i.e., Section 523(a)(4) of the Bankruptcy Code, which\r     excepts from discharge certain debts which arise from misuse of property by\r     fiduciaries.\r\r          For more information, see prior Litigation Release Nos. 14048, 14055,\r     14076, 14142, 14235, 14324, 14410, 14703 and 14697.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c"

No.15446/ August 18, 1997\r\r          The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) announced that\r     on August 12, 1997, the United States District Court for the Central\r     District of California issued an order finding that Andrew S. Pitt\r     (Pitt), Conectisys Corporation (Conectisys), Mike Zaman (Zaman), B&M\r     Capital Corp. (B&M), and Smith Benton & Hughes, Inc. (Smith Benton)\r     committed fraud.  The Court also found that Pitt, Conectisys, and Devon\r     Investment Advisors, Inc. (Devon) had sold securities that should have\r     been registered.  The Court directed the Commission to file proposed\r     findings of fact and conclusions of law by September 8, gave defendants\r     until September 29 to file objections thereto, and stated that it would\r     address remedies to be granted after it had settled the findings and\r     conclusions.    \r\r          The Commission had alleged that in late November 1994, while Pitt was\r     an Assistant United States Attorney, he purchased a controlling share of\r     Conectisys (then named Coastal Financial Corp.) and operated it as BDR\r     Industries, Inc.  On August 7, 1995, Pitt purported to sell his controlling\r     interest in the Company for $10.00.  The Commission also had alleged that\r     Pitt, in fact, retained control of the Company and participated with\r     Conectisys in drafting a business plan containing detailed financial and\r     product information regarding Conectisys which contained numerous false and\r     misleading statements concerning the Company, and that Zaman and Smith\r     Benton used the business plan in selling shares of Conectisys stock to the\r     public.  In addition, the Commission alleged that on or about April 25,\r     1995, Pitt caused the Company to issue 64,000 shares of unregistered common\r     stock to Devon, a company under his control and that Devon subsequently\r     sold those shares to Zaman and Smith Benton, who then sold those shares to\r     the public in furtherance of a manipulative scheme.  \r\r          The Commission further alleged that from February 14, 1996 through at\r     least May 28, 1996, through prearranged trading and other manipulative\r     activities, defendants Zaman, B&M, and Smith Benton, with the cooperation\r     of other broker-dealers, caused the price of Conectisys stock to soar from\r     $6 1/4 per share on February 14, 1996 to $22 per share on May 9, 1996; and\r     that thereafter, the stock continued trading at high prices, ranging from\r     approximately $17 to $22 per share, as a result of defendants\ manipulative\r     trading practices.  From February 14 through May 28, 1996, defendants\\r     manipulative activities resulted in deceptively high trading volumes in\r     Conectisys securities: average weekly trading volumes were approximately\r     2,200 percent higher than during the previous three month period.  The\r     Commission alleged that these dramatic increases in the price and trading\r     volume of Conectisys shares were a result of defendants\ illegal conduct\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c\r\r\r\r\r\r\r     and not indicative of genuine market interest.  \r\r     See also Litigation Release Nos. 14947 and 15272.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 2======\r\x0c"

From November 1991 until\r     approximately mid-1993, Alsop was Vice President of Tandem Management Inc.\r     (Tandem), a registered investment adviser.

CARMELO BLACCONERI AND WILLIAM J.     BURNS, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Civil     Action No. 97 C 5844  (N.D. Ill. August 19, 1997)          The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on August 19,     1997, it filed a Complaint for Permanent Injunction, Civil Penalties and     Other Equitable Relief (Complaint) in the United States District Court for     the Northern District of Illinois against Carmelo Blacconeri (Blacconeri),     a resident of Park Ridge, Illinois, and William J. Burns (Burns), a     resident of Carbondale, Illinois.  The Complaint alleges that Burns and     Blacconeri violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934     (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder in connection with Blacconeris     purchases of the securities of InterDigital Communications, Inc. (IDC)     while he was in possession of material, non-public information he received     from Burns regarding IDC.          According to the Complaint, from 1994 to May 1996, Burns was the Chief     Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of IDC, a publicly-held company     based in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania.  The Complaint alleges that, on or     about December 13, 1994, while Burns was traveling overseas to negotiate a     possible strategic alliance between IDC and a multinational corporation,     Burns telephoned Blacconeri and informed him about the negotiations.      According to the Complaint, on or about the very same day, after his     conversation with Burns, Blacconeri purchased approximately 50,000 shares     of IDC securities.  The Complaint further alleges that Blacconeri then told     a personal friend that he intended to purchase IDC securities.  Shortly     thereafter, Blacconeris personal friend purchased approximately 10,000     shares of IDC securities.  Blacconeri and his personal friend had a ten-     year history in which his personal friend frequently made investments: (i)     as a result of the advice and recommendation by Blacconeri with respect to     investments; and (ii) as a result of discussions with Blacconeri regarding     investments made by Blacconeri.           Blacconceri and Burns each have consented, without admitting or     denying the allegations in the Complaint, to the entry of Final Judgment     and Order of Permanent Injunction, Civil Penalties and Other Equitable     Relief (Final Judgment) which will enjoin them from future violations of     Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Final     Judgment will also require Blacconeri to disgorge $120,220.35, representing     the gains by him of $101,191.85 and by his personal friend of $19,037.50,     plus prejudgment interest of $26,653.76.  In addition, the Final Judgment     will require Blacconeri to pay a civil penalty of $120,220.35 and Burns to     pay a civil penalty of $101,191.85 pursuant to Section 21A of the Exchange     Act.                                 ======END OF PAGE 1======\x0c"

Van Stratum was also ordered to pay\r     disgorgement in the amount of $36,789.67, representing losses avoided and\r     prejudgment interest.  Van Stratum was further ordered to pay a civil\r     penalty under the Insider Trading Sanctions Act of 1984 in the amount of\r     $28,000, within 45 days of the date of the judgment.\r\r          The Commission\s complaint, filed on August 9, 1995, alleged that van\r     Stratum, a former officer and director of Crown Anderson, Inc. (Crown),\r     sold Crown stock while in possession of material non-public information\r     concerning the performance of Crown.  Van Stratum was the managing director\r     of Montair Anderson, b.v. (Montair), a wholly owned subsidiary of Crown. \r     The Commission contends that at least by June 15, 1993, van Stratum was\r     aware that the revenues of the Montair subsidiary had decreased materially. \r     Between June 28, 1993 and July 2, 1993, prior to the public disclosure of\r     this information, van Stratum sold 25,000 shares of Crown stock.  On July\r     22, 1993, when Crown announced that the company anticipated a loss for the\r     quarter ending June 30, 1993 attributable to losses suffered by the Montair\r     subsidiary during the quarter, the price of Crown stock fell by 16 percent. \r     By selling his stock prior to the announcement, van Stratum avoided a loss\r     of $28,000.

The scheme involved the purchase of prime\r     bank notes with a face value of $200 million which were purchased at a\r     discount and then resold for a profit.  Wills and ProFinancial obtained\r     funds from investors by misrepresenting or failing to disclose material\r     facts in connection with the sale of prime bank notes.  Among other\r     misrepresentations made to investors, Wills falsely represented that the\r     investments were virtually risk-free and he made unrealistic predictions to\r     investors about the exorbitant profits to be made from the scheme.

McMichael consented to the entry of the\r          injunction without admitting or denying the allegations made against\r          him in the Commissions Complaint, which was filed on May 2, 1996. \r          The Injunction Order left open the issue of the amount of disgorgement\r          of ill-gotten gains owed by McMichael as a result of the illegal\r          conduct alleged in the Complaint.\r\r          On April 3, 1997, the District Court entered an Agreed Order Waiving\r          Disgorgement against McMichael (Order).

The complaint alleges that Airship, a\r     company that operates blimps used for advertising, failed to make available\r     to the investing public current and accurate information about its\r     financial condition and results of operation through the filing of periodic\r     reports with the Commission as required by the Securities Exchange Act of\r     1934 (Exchange Act).  Specifically, the complaint alleges that Airship\r     has not filed its Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal years December\r     31, 1994, 1995 and 1996, and seven Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the\r     fiscal quarters ended March 31, June 30 and September 30, 1995 and 1996 and\r     March 31, 1997 and nine Notifications of Late Filing with respect to its\r     delinquent reports.  The Commission seeks to compel Airship to file its\r     delinquent Annual Reports on Form 10-K and its delinquent Quarterly Report\r     on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 1997 and enjoin Airship from\r     further violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules\r     12b-25, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.  Simultaneously with the filing of the\r     Commission\s complaint, Airship consented to the entry of a Final Judgment\r     granting the relief sought by the Commission and admitted that it had not\r     filed the periodic reports as described above.  \r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c"

Richard Warren & Associates, Inc.,\r     et. al., Civil Action No. C-97-3050MMC (USDC ND CA/San Francisco Div.)\r\r          The Commission announced today that on August 19, 1997, Judge William\r     A. Ingram granted a temporary restraining order against Richard Warren &\r     Associates, Inc. (RWA) and Richard E. Warren (Warren), formerly located in\r     Fremont, California and now located in London, United Kingdom.  The Order\r     also granted a freeze of their assets, appointment of a receiver, an\r     accounting and repatriation of assets.  The Commission\s complaint alleged\r     that between February and October 1996, RWA and Warren raised a total of\r     approximately $8 million from at least 48 investors nationwide through two\r     fraudulent offerings of securities.  In the first offering, RWA and Warren\r     represented that investor proceeds would be used to trade Prime Bank\r     Debenture instruments and would generate a return of 15 percent within 30\r     days or 180 percent annually.  In the second offering, RWA and Warren\r     represented that investor proceeds would be deposited in an escrow account\r     for trading debentures, would generate a return of approximately 1,600\r     percent within 66 days, and would not be released from the escrow account\r     unless RWA provided a Major World Bank Guarantee for the funds.  The\r     statements made to investors were false.  RWA and Warren misrepresented,\r     among other things, the existence of prime bank securities, the use of the\r     escrow account, rates of return investors were to receive, the use of\r     investor proceeds and the risks associated with the investment.  Warren\r     used in excess of $2 million for payments to salesman and for personal use\r     and used approximately $1.2 million to make false profit payments to\r     investors.  The remaining funds were diverted to other entities and were\r     apparently not used to buy or sell debentures, as represented.\r\r          In the temporary restraining order, Judge Ingram also ordered the\r     named relief defendant, Citadel Enterprises, Ltd. (Citadel), to freeze and\r     repatriate assets derived from Warren\s fraud.  Citadel, an Isle of Man\r     entity headquartered in London, United Kingdom, received more than $2\r     million of investor proceeds from Warren. The Commission was informed that\r     Citadel planned to transfer $700,000 to Warren on or after August 19, 1997. \r     The Commission requested the emergency action to prevent Warren, RWA and\r     Citadel from transferring or liquidating any funds.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c"

Lozis agreed to pay\r     a total of $11,807.26 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest; however,\r     payment of such amount was waived, and no civil penalty imposed, based upon\r     his demonstrated inability to pay.

Paez, U.S. District Judge in the Central\r     District of California, issued an Order appointing a permanent receiver\r     over American Growth Capital Corp. and American Growth Fund I, LP. \r     American Growth Capital is an investment adviser based in Las Vegas,\r     Nevada.  American Growth Fund is an investment fund, managed by American\r     Growth Capital, that purports to invest in emerging growth companies.  The\r     Fund has approximately $7.3 million under management, with over 300\r     investors.\r\r          Judge Paez issued this Order after holding a hearing regarding\r     appointment of a permanent receiver.  The Court found, over the Defendants\r     Opposition, that the Commission had demonstrated that it was likely to\r     prevail on the merits, and thus that a permanent receiver was both\r     necessary and appropriate.  The Commission showed that Defendants Snyder\r     and Duquette fraudulently managed American Growth Capital and American\r     Growth Fund, including misuse and misappropriation of at least $1,778,000\r     in investor funds by investing in shell companies, and by paying\r     undisclosed commissions and other selling expenses, undisclosed\r     compensation to themselves, and undisclosed management fees to American\r     Growth Capital.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c"

WEDGEWOOD FINANCIAL GROUP, INC., ET.\r     AL., Case No. 97-6350-CIV-RYSKAMP (S.D. Fla.)        \r\r          The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on April 10,\r     1997, the Honorable Kenneth L. Ryskamp, United States District Judge for\r     the Southern District of Florida, preliminarily enjoined defendants\r     Wedgewood Financial Group, Inc. (Wedgewood), its president, William\r     Scrak, Paul Iwankowski, JPI Site Management, Inc. (JPI), and Colorado\r     Paging Group Partners (Colorado Paging), from offering or selling\r     interests in what the SEC alleges are fraudulent paging license\r     partnerships, and also freezing defendants\ assets.  The preliminary\r     injunction enjoins the defendants from violating Section 17(a) of the\r     Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of\r     1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and, additionally,\r     Wedgewood from violating Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act.  Iwankowski\r     consented to the Court\s actions, and Scrak did not dispute the SEC\s\r     allegations.\r\r          In an earlier coordinated effort, on April 4, 1997, the SEC sought and\r     obtained a temporary restraining order and asset freeze and the Federal\r     Bureau of Investigation executed a search warrant for Wedgewood\s offices. \r     The SEC and a court-appointed receiver secured the premises and the\r     receiver is now in possession of the office and all company records have\r     been seized.\r\r          According to the SEC\s complaint, Wedgewood, a Florida-based company,\r     is run by Scrak, who is a repeat securities violator previously found by\r     state securities agencies to have committed fraud in connection with the\r     sale of unregistered securities.  The complaint also alleges that\r     Iwankowski, of Coral Springs, Florida, through JPI, a company controlled by\r     his wife Joanna Iwankowski, is the mastermind behind the fraudulent\r     securities offerings.  According to the complaint, Iwankowski is also a\r     recidivist securities violator currently subject to an SEC permanent\r     injunction arising out of his prior involvement in a similar scheme. \r\r          The SEC\s complaint alleges that the defendants\ current offering,\r     Colorado Paging, is the third in a series of fraudulent offerings in which\r     unsophisticated investors are lured into investing in bogus paging\r     partnerships.  Investors allegedly are told that the paging industry is\r     poised for explosive growth, promised extravagant returns, assured that\r     substantial additional financing is already in place, and promised that the\r     paging business will be run by an experienced team which has already been\r     retained.  According to the Complaint, none of this is true.  Among other\r     things alleged in the Complaint, the prior partnerships are not operational\r     -- much less successful -- and substantial investor sums appear to have\r     been and continue to be stolen by Defendants.\r\x0c\r\r\r\r\r\r\r          In addition to a permanent injunction, the SEC\s action also seeks\r     disgorgement of ill-gotten profits and money penalties.\r\r          Named as relief defendants in the Commission\s lawsuit were Stonepine\r     Holding, Ltd., Robert Fabregas, Prime Tel Paging Group Partners, Randy\r     Gilbert, Darrell Bauguess and Joanna Iwankowski.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 2======\r\x0c"

(C-1-97-770)\r\r          The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) today filed and\r     simultaneously settled a financial fraud action in the United States\r     District Court for the Southern District of Ohio against three former\r     senior officers of Future Healthcare, Inc., a Cincinnati company previously\r     in the business of conducting clinical trials for new drugs used by\r     pharmaceutical companies in the drug approval process.\r\r          The complaint alleges that from 1992 through 1994 Timothy Ross, Future\r     Healthcare\s former president and chief financial officer, fraudulently\r     overstated the company\s revenues and earnings and concealed the fraud by\r     creating counterfeit documents, making false entries to Future Healthcare\s\r     books and records and lying to the company\s auditors.  The complaint\r     further alleges that John D. Peckskamp, Jr., the company\s former chief\r     executive officer and chairman of the board of directors, knowingly failed\r     to devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls and aided\r     and abetted the company\s reporting and books and records violations.  The\r     complaint also alleges that Douglas Coates, the company\s former\r     controller, made false accounting entries designed to conceal the fraud. \r     In addition, it alleges that Ross and Coates each sold large blocks of\r     Future Healthcare stock at artificially high prices, shortly before the\r     fraud was discovered, thereby avoiding losses of $838,661 and $155,000,\r     respectively.\r\r          Simultaneous with the filing of the Commission\s complaint, Ross,\r     Coates and Peckskamp, without admitting or denying the allegations of the\r     complaint, consented to the entry of Final Judgments permanently enjoining\r     them from violating the relevant provisions of the federal securities laws,\r     ordering Ross and Coates to disgorge $200,000 and $25,000 in losses avoided\r     plus prejudgment interest, respectively, contingent on their inability to\r     pay more, and ordering Peckskamp to pay civil money penalties of $25,000. \r     Ross also consented to a provision in the Final Judgment permanently\r     barring him from serving as an officer or director of any public reporting\r     company.  In addition, Ross and Coates have agreed to the institution of\r     administrative proceedings pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the Commission\s\r     Rules of Practice, upon entry of the injunctions, that will bar Ross\r     permanently and Coates for a period of at least five years from appearing\r     or practicing before the Commission as an accountant. \r\r\r\r          In a related action, the United States Attorney for the Southern\r     District of Ohio announced that Ross pleaded guilty today before U.S.\r     District Judge Herman J. Weber to one count of making a false statement in\r     filings with the Commission.  Ross faces a maximum of five years in prison,\r     a fine of the greater of $250,000 or twice the loss or gain and up to three\r     years of supervised release.  \r\r          According to the complaint, Peckskamp took Future Healthcare public in\r     1992 despite Ross\s warnings that the company\s internal controls were\r     inadequate and also failed to respond adequately to warnings from the\r     company\s independent auditors that the internal accounting controls were\r     deficient and could result in, among other things, financial statements\r     that were unreliable.  The complaint further alleges that Peckskamp adopted\r     unrealistic and excessively optimistic revenue projections and budgets and\r     pressured Ross to meet those projections.  Ross met Peckskamp\s\r     expectations by fraudulently recognizing non-existent revenue in Future\r     Healthcare\s financial statements.  \r\r          The complaint alleges that Ross and Coates violated the antifraud and\r     certain other provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically,\r     Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Section\r     10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-\r     5 thereunder.  The complaint further alleges that Ross violated Rule 13b2-2\r     under the Exchange Act by making false statements to the company\s\r     independent auditors and that he and Coates violated Rule 13b2-1 by\r     falsifying the company\s books and records.  The complaint alleges that\r     Peckskamp violated Section 13(b)(5) by knowingly circumventing or knowingly\r     failing to implement a system of internal accounting controls and aided and\r     abetted Future Healthcare\s violations of the reporting and books and\r     records provisions, specifically, Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the\r     Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.  \r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 2======\x0c\r"

Luca, age 53, of Scottsdale,\r     Arizona, for fraud, and sued Luca and two of his sales agents, Rudy\r     Crosswell, age 49, of Scottsdale, Arizona, and Paula G. Den Boer, age 47,\r     of Paradise Valley, Arizona, for offering and selling unregistered\r     securities and for failing to register with the Commission as securities\r     broker-dealers.  Luca, Crosswell and Den Boer offered and sold limited\r     partnership units and promissory notes from 1990 to 1995.  From at least\r     January of 1990, Luca raised over $10 million from over 400 mostly elderly\r     and unsophisticated investors nationwide.  Many of the investors attended\r     the same church as Luca in Scottsdale, Arizona.  \r\r          Luca told investors that they were investing in residential and\r     commercial real estate developments in Henderson, Nevada, a community near\r     Las Vegas.  Although some investor funds were used to purchase and develop\r     land, most were used: (1) to pay principal and returns to earlier\r     investors, (2) to build and furnish Luca\s lavish 10,000 square foot home\r     in Scottsdale, Arizona, and (3) to pay personal expenses, commissions and\r     business expenses.  Luca also made large gifts and loans to charities.  The\r     Commission alleges that Luca misappropriated over $3.2 million from\r     investors.  Although Luca had no business activities that generated any\r     profit to him or his investors, he continually paid investors returns of\r     20 to 25 percent.  Luca used new investor funds to pay existing investors\r     their returns.\r\r          Crosswell and Den Boer were two of Luca\s top independent sales\r     agents, receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars in commissions.  The\r     Complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement and an accounting\r     against Luca for violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities\r     Act of 1933, and Sections 10(b), and 15(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange\r     Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Commission seeks a permanent\r     injunction and civil penalties against Crosswell and Den Boer for violating\r     Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 15(a)(1)\r     of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\r       \r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c"

Benson\r     (Benson) and Geoffrey J. O\Connor (O\Connor).  The action also seeks a\r     freeze of assets against all of the defendants.  The Honorable Anita B.\r     Brody granted the TRO and the freeze of assets, and scheduled a preliminary\r     injunction hearing for September 3, 1997.\r\r          The Commission\s complaint alleges that, from at least August 1994\r     through the present, TIGC, Benson and O\Connor have engaged in a fraudulent\r     scheme through which they have raised at least $5 million, and possibly as\r     much as $9.7 million, from at least 4,200 public investors, including at\r     least 58 investors residing in Philadelphia and the surrounding area.  The\r     Complaint alleges that the defendants induced investors to purchase\r     interests in TIGC\s Asset Enhancement Plan by promising them rates of\r     return ranging from 138 to 181 percent.  These returns were portrayed as\r     guaranteed.  Through various offering materials, TIGC, Benson and\r     O\Connor claimed that they could generate these returns by pooling investor\r     funds in TIGC bank accounts and investing it in so-called Prime Bank\r     instruments or other unspecified investments.  According to the complaint,\r     in reality, the instruments and investments described in the offering\r     materials did not exist, and none of the money raised from investors was\r     invested in such instruments.\r\r          The complaint further alleges that, rather than investing the proceeds\r     as represented, TIGC, Benson and O\Connor diverted the money to various\r     bank accounts, where some or all of it was misappropriated.  They diverted\r     substantial sums to accounts in the name of SLB Charitable Trust (SLB),\r     JGS Trust (JGS) and Futures Holding Company (Futures Holding), which\r     were controlled by Benson and/or Benson\s wife, Susan L. Benson (Susan\r     Benson).  The complaint claims that Benson and his wife paid personal\r     expenses from those accounts, such as college tuition, trips, clothing and\r     dental examinations.  The Commission also alleges that substantial funds\r     raised in the TIGC offering were used to pay existing investors or were\r     diverted to off-shore bank accounts in St. Kitts, West Indies and Agencia,\r     Spain.  \r\r\r\r\r                                        - 2 -\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c\r\r\r\r\r\r\r     According to the complaint, a large sum of money was also diverted from\r     TIGC to Lindsey Springer (Springer) and Bondage Breaker Ministries\r     (Bondage Breaker), an organization Springer controls.\r\r          In the action, the Commission charges Benson, O\Connor and TIGC\r     violated Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933\r     (Securities Act), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934\r     (Exchange Act), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The Commission also requested other various\r     emergency relief.\r\r          The action also names Susan Benson, SLB, JGS, Futures Holding,\r     Springer and Bondage Breaker as a relief defendants for purposes of seeking\r     an asset freeze and disgorgement of funds paid to them by TIGC.  The action\r     does not charge them with violations of the antifraud provisions of the\r     securities laws.  \r\r          TIGC, headquartered in Chardon, Ohio, describes itself as a private\r     trust, unincorporated business organization.

MASKALY,  Civil Action No. 97-1977\r     (D.D.C.)(JHG)     \r\r          The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) today announced\r     the filing of a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court\r     for the District of Columbia against Irving M. Mangel (Irv Mangel),\r     Samuel J. Mangel (Sam Mangel), Thomas J. Ciocco (Ciocco) and Edward W.\r     Maskaly (Maskaly), all of whom were former executives of Jasmine, Ltd., a\r     Delaware corporation headquartered in Pennsauken, N.J.  The Commission\s\r     complaint alleges that the defendants engaged in a fraudulent scheme to\r     falsify and inflate Jasmine\s financial statements, which were included in\r     a registration statement for Jasmine\s $10.5 million initial public\r     offering (IPO) in December 1993 and in three subsequent quarterly reports\r     filed with the Commission.  According to the complaint, Jasmine\s\r     materially false and misleading financial statements and disclosures\r     enabled Jasmine to portray itself as a financially robust entity when, in\r     fact, the company was insolvent.  Jasmine currently is in liquidation\r     proceedings pursuant to Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.\r\r          The complaint alleges that the fraudulent scheme at Jasmine was\r     carried out under the direction of Irv Mangel, Jasmine\s former chief\r     executive officer and chairman of the board.  Sam Mangel, Jasmine\s former\r     vice president, a director and Irv Mangel\s son, was responsible for\r     implementing and organizing the fraudulent scheme, and Ciocco, Jasmine\s\r     former controller, participated in booking and recording false entries in\r     Jasmine\s books and records.  Maskaly, Jasmine\s former chief financial\r     officer and a director, signed Jasmine\s registration statement for its IPO\r     and a quarterly report on Form 10-Q even though he knew or was reckless in\r     not knowing that a material liability was excluded from the financial\r     statements included in these filings.   \r          In order to effectuate the fraudulent scheme, the complaint alleges\r     that the defendants, variously, excluded $11.3 million and $13.3 million in\r     accounts payable from Jasmine\s books and records for fiscal years ended\r     September 30, 1992 and 1993, respectively; recorded $553,000 in phony sales\r     for fiscal year 1993; improperly recorded a $1,160,000 gain on a purported\r     sale of an investment for fiscal year 1993; and failed to record $502,000\r     in commission expense for fiscal year 1993.  The fraudulent scheme caused\r     Jasmine to report a $1.3 million net worth for fiscal year 1993 when, in\r     fact, the company should have reported a $13.3 million deficit and to\r     report a $1.6 million pre-tax profit, when, in fact, the company should\r     have reported a $600,000 pre-tax loss.  \r\r          The complaint further alleges that Sam Mangel directed Jasmine\s\r     independent buying agent in Hong Kong to submit a false audit confirmation\r\x0c\r\r\r\r\r\r\r     to Jasmine\s independent auditors which failed to disclose Jasmine\s total\r     debt to the buying agent.  The complaint further alleges that Sam Mangel\r     solicited a false audit confirmation from a Jasmine customer located in New\r     Jersey.  According to the complaint, Irv Mangel and Maskaly provided a\r     general representation letter to Jasmine\s independent auditors which\r     contained numerous false representations.  The complaint also alleges that\r     Ciocco avoided losses by selling Jasmine stock while in possession of\r     material nonpublic information concerning Jasmine\s true financial\r     condition.\r\r          The Commission\s complaint seeks permanent injunctions against Irv and\r     Sam Mangel for violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933\r     (Securities Act), Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange\r     Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder;\r     against Ciocco for violations of Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the\r     Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1; and against Maskaly\r     for violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the\r     Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-2.  \r\r          Simultaneously with the filing of the Commission\s complaint, all of\r     the defendants have consented, without admitting or denying the allegations\r     of the complaint, to the entry of a permanent injunction that enjoins them\r     from violating the respective provisions of the federal securities laws\r     that each is alleged to have violated.  In addition, Irv Mangel has\r     consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently bars him from serving\r     as an officer or a director of any public company and orders him to pay a\r     $100,000 civil penalty.  Sam Mangel has consented to the entry of a\r     judgment that bars him from serving as an officer and director of any\r     public company for a period of ten years and orders him to pay an $80,000\r     civil penalty.  Maskaly has consented to pay a civil penalty of $50,000. \r     Ciocco has consented to the entry of a judgment which orders him to pay the\r     sum of $7,293.00, representing the disgorgement of $3,155.00 of losses he\r     avoided from his sale of Jasmine stock, prejudgment interest of $983.00 and\r     a civil monetary penalty of $3,155.00.  The Commission determined not to\r     seek additional civil monetary penalties against Ciocco in light of his\r     demonstrated inability to pay.   \r\r          The Commission also announced that it instituted related\r     administrative proceedings pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act and\r     Section 21C of the Exchange Act against Ngai King Tak (Ngai), Evelyn A.\r     Wong (Wong), both residents of Hong Kong, and Haroutioun K.

The securities involved were interests in investment pools to\r     be managed by Haussecker, who was to invest in stocks, currencies and other\r     financial instruments with projected returns of from 17% to 60% per month. \r     It is alleged that instead of investing the funds, the vast majority of\r     such funds were spent by Haussecker to support his lavish lifestyle,\r     including at least nine expensive sports cars, a boat, and large homes in\r     Missouri and California.

Judge Chesney and Judge William Ingram previously\r     issued temporary restraining orders granting similar relief. \r\r          The Commission also announced today that on August 26, the Chancery\r     Division of the High Court of Justice of England and Wales granted the\r     Commission\s petition for a mareva injunction against RWA and Warren. \r     The injunction freezes the assets held world-wide by RWA and Warren and\r     requires RWA and Warren to disclose all such assets to the High Court.      \r       \r\r          The Commission\s complaints, filed on August 19 in the Northern\r     District of California, San Francisco division, and on August 26 in the\r     United Kingdom, alleged that in 1996, RWA and Warren raised approximately\r     $8 million from at least 48 investors nationwide through two fraudulent\r     offerings of securities.  The complaint further alleged that RWA and Warren\r     misrepresented, among other things, the existence of the prime bank\r     debenture instruments and other securities offered, the use of an escrow\r     account, rates of return, the use of investor proceeds and the risks\r     associated with the investment.

CRAIG (United States District Court\r     for the District of Maine, Civ. Action No. 95-0164-B).\r              \r          The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on August 27,\r     1997, the Honorable Morton A. Brody, U.S. District Judge for the District\r     of Maine, entered Judgment following a five-day trial against BRADLEY T.\r     GULLETT of Maitland, Florida and SHERWOOD H. CRAIG of Orono, Maine.  The\r     Court found Gullett and Craig liable for securities fraud and acting as\r     unlicensed brokers in an investment scheme involving deposits into a\r     Mexican bank.  The Court permanently enjoined Gullett and Craig from\r     violating the antifraud and broker-dealer registration provisions of the\r     federal securities laws and ordered Gullett to disgorge $41,646 of ill-\r     gotten gains.  The court also imposed a civil penalty of $75,000 against\r     Gullett and $25,000 against Craig.  The Court ordered a third defendant,\r     WILLIAM W. HANKE of Orlando, Florida, to pay a civil penalty of $75,000. \r     The Court imposed a separate $75,000 penalty against Hanke\s Florida\r     corporation, Dove Investment Group, Inc.  A final judgment granting a\r     permanent injunction had entered previously against Hanke and Dove.  A\r     final judgment granting a permanent injunction and disgorgement of over\r     $407,000 was entered by consent against the remaining defendant, Ellis L.\r     Deyon, on January 14, 1997.\r\r          The Court issued detailed findings in support of the Judgment. \r     According to the Findings, in May and June, 1995, the defendants obtained\r     money from investors by promising to pay them virtually risk-free returns\r     of 15% to 25% per month.  Defendants misrepresented to investors that these\r     extraordinary rates of return would come from placing their investments in\r     a special Mexican bank account not available to the general public that\r     paid 85% per month.  To explain how the bank could generate such a return,\r     the defendants misrepresented that it was supported by 25 top Prime\r     Banks.  Defendants also misrepresented that other investors already had or\r     were about to place $500 million or $1 billion in the account.\r\r          The Court found, in fact, that the Mexican bank account earned only\r     standard rates of interest and there were no investors depositing $500\r     million or $1 billion; and that the Prime Bank programs promoted by the\r     defendants are nothing more than fraudulent schemes.\r       \r\r\r\r\r                                        - 2 -\r\r          According to the Court, Gullett\s and Craig\s fraud was particularly\r     egregious because both defendants exploited investors\ sincere religious\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c\r\r\r\r\r\r\r     beliefs.  Defendants told investors that the Mexican program had been\r     started by Christian men and would help church-related programs.  The Court\r     stated that Craig exploited his position as president and minister of the\r     Door of Faith Church to convince unsuspecting people to give their money to\r     a program that he recklessly endorsed.  \r\r          David Marder, Senior Trial Counsel, who tried the case with Celia\r     Moore, Senior Enforcement Counsel, in the Commission\s Boston office, said\r     the uncontradicted evidence at trial showed that defendants obtained over\r     $400,000 from ten investors in Maine, Pennsylvania, California and Florida. \r     The bank account in which their funds were placed was controlled by\r     defendant Deyon, who used investors\ funds to pay personal expenses and to\r     make distributions to his partners in the scheme, including defendant\r     Gullett. \r\r          The Commission will submit for Court approval a plan for distribution\r     of recovered funds to injured investors.\r\r     See also prior Litigation Release Nos. 14586, 14610 and 15222.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 2======\r\x0c"

MARK K. CURRY AND JOSEPH H. CURRY,\r     (Civil Action No. 97-74524) (E.D. Mich.)\r\r          The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) filed today a\r     complaint against Mark K. Curry (M. Curry) and Joseph H. Curry (J.\r     Curry) alleging violations of the antifraud and recordkeeping provisions\r     of the federal securities laws arising from their undisclosed theft of\r     corporate assets belonging to Caraco Pharmaceutical Laboratories, Ltd.\r     (Caraco).  The complaint alleges that during 1993 and 1994 M. Curry, then\r     Caraco\s controller, and his brother, J. Curry, stole at least $889,000 of\r     Caraco\s corporate funds.  As part of an elaborate effort to conceal their\r     thefts, they falsified Caraco\s books and records and M. Curry made\r     materially false and misleading statements to Caraco\s auditors.  M. Curry\r     also prepared false and misleading financial statements that materially\r     understated Caraco\s revenues and overstated its inventory and/or cost of\r     sales in order to conceal the missing Caraco funds.  Caraco included those\r     materially false and misleading financial statements in Caraco\s\r     registration statement for its initial public offering of securities, it\r     its annual report for 1993, and in quarterly reports for 1994.\r\r          The complaint alleges that M. Curry and J. Curry stole Caraco\s assets\r     in two ways.  First, that they each forged checks drawn on Caraco bank\r     accounts and against Caraco credit accounts that were made payable to them,\r     to a retail clothing business known as The Curry Collection that the two\r     brothers co-owned and operated, or to pay personal credit card bills. \r     Second, that they stole checks issued to Caraco by its customers, which\r     they improperly endorsed and deposited into their personal bank accounts. \r     The complaint alleges that as part of the effort to conceal the thefts, the\r     disbursements via the forged checks were falsely recorded in Caraco\s books\r     and records as purchases of inventory, equipment, or other for other\r     operating expenses, and that false credits for product returns or sales\r     discounts were recorded to offset the amounts of the stolen checks. \r\r          The complaint alleges that as a result of that conduct M. Curry\r     violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, and Sections 10(b) and\r     13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder. \r     The complaint alleges that J. Curry aided and abetted violations of Section\r     17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule\r     10b-5 thereunder, and violated Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and\r     Rule 13b2-1 thereunder.  The complaint seeks as to both M. Curry and J.\r     Curry (1) permanent injunctions against future violations of the above-\r     mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws; (2) disgorgement of\r     the stolen funds; (3) civil penalties; and (4) a permanent bar from acting\r     as officers or directors of a publicly traded company.\r\x0c"

JASON S. WALL, 97 Civ. 6526 (JSR)\r     (S.D.N.Y.)\r\r     The Commission announced that it filed a Complaint today in federal court\r     in Manhattan charging a individual with having defrauded investors of an\r     estimated $200,000 by inducing them to give him money to invest in  private\r     placements  supposedly being offered by companies with familiar sounding\r     names.  In this action, the court granted the Commission s request for\r     emergency relief, including a temporary restraining order and an asset\r     freeze.\r\r     Named in the Complaint is:\r\r          Jason S. Wall, 26 years old, who is last known to have resided in New\r          York, New York.  In the past Jason S. Wall has worked as a registered\r          representative for two broker-dealers:  Investors Associates, Inc.,\r          where Jason S. Wall worked from February 1994 through July 1994, and\r          A.T. Brod & Co., where he worked for approximately one month until the\r          firm closed in August 1994.  Jason S. Wall has not been a registered\r          representative of any registered broker-dealer since August 1994.\r\r     Specifically, the Complaint alleges that Jason S. Wall, since at least\r     1996, has been promising investors who gave him money for investments in\r      private placements  with a particular identified company a 25 to 35\r     percent return in eight weeks.  Those companies were identified as: \r     Hitachi Inc., Walgreens, Inc., Hasbro Inc., Texas Instruments Inc., Toshiba\r     Inc., Frito-Lay Inc. or Mattel Toys.\r\r     According to the Complaint, Jason S. Wall claimed that he worked as a\r     securities broker for Rothschild Global Investments, Inc. (Rothschild\r     Global) and that he had access to these offerings through Rothschild\r     Global.  The Commission alleges that, in fact, Jason S. Wall does not work\r     for Rothschild Global, a broker-dealer that formerly was registered with\r     the Commission, but which has been closed since 1995.  Moreover, Jason S.\r     Wall allegedly has never been a registered representative of Rothschild\r     Global or any other firm containing the name  Rothschild.   According to\r     the Complaint, Jason S. Wall never invested the money in the private\r     placements as he represented he would do. \r\r     The Commission also announced that the United States District Court for the\r     Southern District of New York issued an order today that, among other\r     things, temporarily restrains Jason S. Wall from committing securities\r     fraud in violation of Section 17(a) \r\r\r\r\r                                        - 2 -\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c\r\r\r\r\r\r\r     of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange\r     Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, and freezes his assets.  A hearing on the\r     Commission s application for a preliminary injunction and other relief is\r     scheduled for Wednesday, September 10, 1997.\r\r     The Commission seeks a final judgment permanently enjoining Jason S.

According\r     to the Commission\s complaint filed in federal district court in Los\r     Angeles, from July 1994 through October 1994, the defendants, Rob Nite, age\r     46, Philip L. Thomas, age 43, and David V. Sims, age 47, offered and sold\r     to the public interests in a bogus program to trade these purported\r     securities, amassing approximately $3.7 million.  For their investment, the\r     victims were promised astronomical returns on relatively small investments. \r     Specifically, the complaint alleges that the defendants guaranteed the\r     victims that for an initial investment of either $50,000 or $150,000, they\r     would receive returns of $1 million per week for 40 weeks, or $40 million. \r     Contrary to their promises, the defendants did not invest the victims\\r     funds, but instead misappropriated most, if not all, of the funds for their\r     own personal benefit, including donations to religious organizations,\r     purchases of luxury automobiles and gifts to family members.\r\r          The scheme allegedly perpetrated by the defendants is commonly\r     referred to as a prime bank scheme, and has been the subject of official\r     warnings issued to investors by several federal agencies including the\r     Securities and Exchange Commission and the Board of Governors of the\r     Federal Reserve System.\r\r          Defendant Nite is currently incarcerated in federal prison in Arizona\r     serving a 44 month sentence for mail fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy,\r     conduct unrelated to this lawsuit.

Deborah Bahret, Burgess-Pittman, Connor, Gore, Katz\r     and Perry are former employees, and Jensen is a former director, of Paragon\r     Mortgage Corporation, a now defunct mortgage banking company formerly\r     headquartered in Smyrna, Georgia.  Anderson is an attorney in Atlanta and\r     Bradley Bahret is the husband of Deborah Bahret.\r\r          The complaint alleges as follows.  From 1989 through 1993, W. Gene\r     Ross and Lynn K. Ross (the Ross brothers) misappropriated $229,040 from\r     Paragon to pay principal and interest on four personal loans.  Gene Ross\r     was Paragon\s chief executive officer and chairman of its board, and Lynn\r     Ross was a director of Paragon and its president.\r\r          Jensen was chairman of the Paragon board\s special litigation\r     committee which retained special counsel to investigate the apparent\r     misconduct of the Ross brothers.  Jensen illegally tipped his mother to\r     sell 1,000 shares of Paragon stock on November 15, 1993, and illegally\r     tipped his daughter to sell 2,500 shares on December 2, 1993, before the\r     Ross brothers\ misconduct was publicly disclosed on December 21, 1993. \r     Previously, in October 1993, Jensen had illegally tipped his mother to\r     purchase 1,000 shares of Paragon stock prior to a favorable, public\r     announcement regarding Paragon\s planned takeover of a competitor. \r     Jensen\s illegal tipping allowed his mother and daughter to obtain ill-\r     gotten gains and avoid losses totalling $5,125.  \r\r          On December 13, 1993, Connor illegally tipped her husband about\r     nonpublic information regarding the Ross brothers\ misconduct.  The next\r     day, Connor\s husband sold 1,500 shares of Paragon stock.\r\r          On the morning of December 21, 1993, Jensen and Paragon\s new\r     president, conducted a confidential, internal meeting for Paragon \r     employees.  Jensen and Paragon\s president read the employees a \r\r                                        - 2 -\r\r\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c\r\r\r\r\r\r\r     press release which the employees were told would not be issued until after\r     the stock market closed that day.  The press release included information\r     regarding the Ross brothers\ misconduct and resignations, problems with\r     Paragon\s 1992 and 1993 financial statements, and uncertainties regarding\r     Paragon\s ability to conduct its mortgage lending business.  During the\r     meeting, Jensen and Paragon\s president told the employees on several\r     occasions that they were prohibited from selling their Paragon stock or\r     conveying the information to others because of insider trading laws.  The\r     warnings were consistent with Paragon\s written corporate policy which\r     prohibited Paragon\s employees from selling Paragon stock, or advising\r     others to sell Paragon stock, while the employee was in possession of\r     material, nonpublic information.  All Paragon employees had received a copy\r     of this policy which had been written by Jensen.  The employees were also\r     told that selling their stock would be illegal and could subject them to\r     criminal prosecution, including jail time, and were told that the\r     Securities and Exchange Commission would investigate any trading of Paragon\r     stock.      \r\r          Shortly after the meeting, Deborah Bahret illegally tipped her\r     husband, a former stockbroker, and advised him to sell 2,000 shares of\r     Paragon stock; Burgess-Pittman illegally tipped her sister and advised her\r     to sell 1,000 shares of Paragon stock; Katz illegally sold 1,500 shares of\r     Paragon stock and then illegally tipped Anderson who sold 1,000 shares of\r     Paragon stock; and Gore and Perry, after reviewing the press release in\r     Paragon\s Denver, Colorado office, illegally sold 2,000 and 3,000 shares of\r     Paragon stock, respectively.  Later that day, trading in Paragon\s stock\r     was halted and for the first time, Paragon publicly issued the press\r     release which it had provided to its employees earlier that day.  On\r     December 23, 1993, Paragon\s stock resumed trading, hitting a low of $ 3/4\r     per share, down 63% from the previous closing price of $2 per share, before\r     closing at $1 1/4 per share, down approximately 40% from the previous\r     closing price.\r\r          Anderson, Deborah Bahret, Burgess-Pittman, Connor, Katz and Perry,\r     have each consented to a permanent injunction, without admitting or denying\r     the allegations set forth in the complaint, which enjoins them from\r     violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. \r     Anderson, Deborah Bahret, Burgess-Pittman, Connor, Katz and Perry have\r     agreed to pay disgorgement in the amounts of $937.50, $2,000, $937.50,\r     $1,406.25, $1,500 and $2,250, respectively, for losses they illegally\r     avoided, plus pay $187.50, $500, $225, $187.50, $393 and $600,\r     respectively, of prejudgment interest.

Gene Ross was Paragon\s chief executive officer and\r     chairman of its board, Lynn Ross was a director of Paragon and its\r     president, and Higgins-Hallke was Paragon\s chief financial officer.\r\r          The complaint alleges that the Ross brothers misappropriated\r     approximately $230,000 from Paragon over a five-year period by causing\r     Paragon to repay personal loans with corporate funds, and by personally\r     intercepting checks remitted to Paragon and endorsing them for their\r     personal benefit.  The Ross brothers concealed this theft from Paragon\s\r     shareholders and also misled Paragon\s independent auditors concerning\r     their theft.  \r\r          The complaint also alleges that from 1990 through 1994 the defendants\r     overstated Paragon\s income in various annual and quarterly financial\r     statements filed with the Commission.  In some instances, Paragon reported\r     net income when it should have reported net losses and in other reports,\r     Paragon understated its net losses by over 200% and overstated its income\r     by 225%.  \r\r          In June 1990, Paragon\s board of directors granted stock options to\r     purchase 530,000 shares of Paragon\s common stock, worth $258,750, to the\r     Ross brothers and four other Paragon employees.  The Commission alleges\r     that Gene Ross failed to report this transaction in Paragon\s June 30, 1990\r     quarterly and September 30, 1990 annual financial statements.  The\r     Commission also alleges that Gene Ross altered Paragon\s September 30, 1990\r     annual financial statements by deleting $200,000 of compensation expense\r     which had been recorded in Paragon\s books and certified by Paragon\s\r     independent auditor.\r\r          The Commission\s complaint also charges that Gene Ross and Higgins-\r     Hallke inflated the income reported in Paragon\s September 30, 1992 annual\r     financial statements by improperly reporting $814,949 of gains from the\r     sale of certain loans.  Additionally, Higgins-Hallke failed to report\r     $24,961 of medical claims incurred during 1992 related to Paragon\s self-\r     insured employee medical plan.  \r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c\r\r\r\r\r\r\r          The Commission also charges that Gene Ross illegally sold Paragon\r     common stock, and illegally tipped three members of his family to sell\r     their Paragon common stock, before the Ross brothers\ misconduct was\r     publicly disclosed.  The complaint alleges that in December 1993, Gene Ross\r     told his wife to conduct a meeting at their house with Gene Ross\ two adult\r     sons and his wife\s brother.  At the meeting, Gene Ross\ wife, on her\r     husband\s instructions, tipped these three family members, who were\r     employees of Paragon and whom Gene Ross knew held Paragon stock. \r     Subsequent to this meeting, Gene Ross\ sons and brother-in-law sold Paragon\r     stock.\r\r          Gene Ross and Lynn Ross (the Ross brothers) and Higgins-Hallke have\r     each consented to a permanent injunction, without admitting or denying the\r     allegations set forth in the complaint, which enjoins them from violating\r     the antifraud, reporting, books and records, and internal accounting\r     control provisions of the federal securities laws.  The Ross brothers have\r     also consented to be permanently enjoined from violating the proxy\r     provisions of the federal securities laws.  Gene Ross has agreed to pay a\r     total of $65,000 of disgorgement of insider stock trading losses illegally\r     avoided by him and his family plus pay prejudgment interest thereon, and\r     civil penalties.  Lynn Ross has agreed to pay civil penalties in the amount\r     of $25,000.  Higgins-Hallke will not be required to pay civil penalties\r     based upon her inability to pay such penalties.  In addition, all three\r     defendants have agreed to be barred from acting as officers or directors of\r     public companies.\r\r          Previously, the Commission instituted administrative proceedings in\r     which five CPAs, who served as Paragon\s independent auditors at various\r     times from 1990 through 1993, were charged with having engaged in improper\r     professional conduct during their work for Paragon.  Those auditors settled\r     the proceedings without admitting or denying the charges against them.

Benson (Benson) and Geoffrey J. O\Connor\r     (O\Connor).  The Order was entered following a two day hearing before\r     Judge Dalzell in United States District Court for the Eastern District of\r     Pennsylvania.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission)\r     instituted the civil injunctive action on August 27, 1997.  On that same\r     date, the Honorable Anita B. Brody granted the Commission\s motion for a\r     temporary restraining order.  She also granted a freeze of assets against\r     the defendants as well as six relief defendants.\r\r          In addition to entering the preliminary injunction, Judge Dalzell\r     continued the freeze of assets ordered by Judge Brody.  Pursuant to the\r     Order, he also appointed Robert F. Sanville, C.P.A., Sanville & Company, as\r     trustee for the assets of TIGC, and required the defendants and relief\r     defendants to repatriate all funds and assets held in off-shore bank\r     accounts to Sanville.  A trial date of November 20, 1997 has been\r     scheduled.\r\r          The Commission\s complaint alleges that, from at least August 1994\r     through the present, TIGC, Benson and O\Connor have engaged in a fraudulent\r     scheme through which they have raised at least $5 million, and possibly as\r     much as $9.7 million, from at least 4,200 public investors, including at\r     least 58 investors residing in Philadelphia and the surrounding area.  The\r     Complaint alleges that the defendants induced investors to purchase\r     interests in TIGC\s Asset Enhancement Plan by promising them rates of\r     return ranging from 138 to 181 percent.  These returns were portrayed as\r     guaranteed.  Through various offering materials, TIGC, Benson and\r     O\Connor claimed that they could generate these returns by pooling investor\r     funds in TIGC bank accounts and investing them in so-called Prime Bank\r     instruments or other unspecified investments.\r\r          At the preliminary injunction hearing, the Commission presented expert\r     testimony of Professor James Byrne, who testified that the TIGC offering\r     was fraudulent, and that the instruments and investments described in the\r     TIGC offering materials did not exist.  The Commission also presented\r     testimony of Staff Accountant Kevin B. de Lacy who testified that, rather\r     than investing the proceeds as represented, TIGC, Benson and O\Connor\r     diverted the money to various bank accounts, where some\r\r         or all of it was misappropriated.  Substantial sums were diverted to\r     accounts under their control or under the control of the six relief\r     defendants.  Mr. de Lacy further testified that funds raised in the TIGC\r     offering were used to pay existing investors or were diverted to off-shore\r\x0c\r\r\r\r\r\r\r     bank accounts in St. Kitts, West Indies, Spain and the Principality of\r     Monaco.\r\r          To date, the Commission has confirmed that more than $3 million in\r     assets has been frozen.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 2======\r\x0c"

Moore (Moore).  The judgment of permanent\r     injunction enjoined Moore from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities\r     Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and\r     Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Moore was ordered to pay disgorgement in the amount\r     of $606,258.81, the sum which Moore fraudulently obtained from investors,\r     along with prejudgment interest thereon.  Moore was further ordered to pay\r     a civil penalty of $100,000 since his conduct involved fraud and resulted\r     in a substantial loss to other persons. \r\r          The Commission\s complaint, filed on September 30, 1993, alleged that,\r     from approximately September 1990 through at least April 1991, Moore and a\r     co-defendant solicited individuals each to  invest $1,500 for which Moore\r     promised to provide 100 shares of stock.  The shares of stock were to be\r     issued in an off-shore bank in the Republic of Nauru, later identified to\r     be the defendant, Pioneer Inc..  Moore received more than $300,000 from\r     more than 300 investors in at least 34 states and several foreign countries\r     from the sale of the stock.  Additionally, Moore and a co-defendant\r     solicited individuals to invest in certificates of deposit issued by\r     Pioneer Inc. and Pioneer Ltd. (represented to be a licensed and chartered\r     bank in Grenada) from approximately the Spring of 1991 through at least\r     December 1991.  Moore received more than $240,000 from hundreds of\r     investors from at least 46 states, United States territories and several\r     foreign countries from these sales.\r\r          The complaint further alleged that Moore and others made numerous\r     misrepresentations and omissions of material facts to investors in\r     connection with the offer and sale of Pioneer Inc. stock, and Pioneer Inc.\r     and Pioneer Ltd. certificates of deposit.  The misrepresentations and\r     omissions made by Moore concerned the returns that such securities would\r     provide to investors, the safety of these investments, the involvement of\r     major insurance companies to insure investors\ funds, guarantees that\r     investors\ funds would be refunded, the operations and status of Pioneer\r     Inc. and Pioneer Ltd. including the expertise of their management.

The Court found that Kathryn Casperson was in contempt\r     of court for failure to account for two cash withdrawals totalling $88,100,\r     and her current sources of income.  In so finding, the Court stated that: \r\r          The SEC is engaged in trying to enforce the Court\s disgorgement\r          Order to obtain funds for victims of Jerome Casperson\s\r          multimillion-dollar fraud.  This is an important goal that must\r          not be obfuscated by stonewalling or by an unsupported invocation\r          of the Fifth Amendment privilege.\r\r          The Court similarly found that Kathryn Casperson was in contempt\r     because she failed to account for $26,500 in cash she personally received\r     from a bank account held jointly with her spouse.  The Court found that\r     Something more than a bald statement of non-recollection was required for\r     Kathryn Casperson to meet her burden to show, categorically and in detail,\r     an inability to comply with the Court\s disgorgement and accounting order. \r\r\r          Finally, the Court found that Kathryn Casperson was in contempt for\r     failure to disgorge four specific pieces of jewelry as ordered.  The Court\r     found Kathryn Casperson\s claims that she lost her diamond wedding ring and\r     earrings and that she had never owned a Cartier watch or diamond tennis\r     bracelet not only contradictory of her spouse\s testimony, but also\r     unsupported by any credible evidence at all.

Honey, of Boca Raton, Florida, is Phoenix s\r     president, and Johnston, of Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, is Phoenix s vice-\r     president.

According to the Complaint, Phoenix fraudulently raised $11.3\r     million through the sale of the Notes to at least 130 investors in numerous\r     states.

The Complaint alleged\r     that, in fact, no more than 60% of investor funds were protected. The\r     Complaint also alleged that Phoenix failed to disclose to investors that\r     Johnston has a history of securities violations, including being\r     permanently enjoined from violating the federal securities laws, and being\r     permanently barred from the securities industry.

Cal. 1997)\r\r          The Securities and Exchange Commission today accused a former\r     stockbroker in the Hayward, California, branch of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.\r     (Dean Witter) of defrauding elderly clients over a six-year period.\r       \r          In a complaint filed today in the United States District Court for the\r     Northern District of California, the Commission alleged that between\r     September 1989 and September 1995 Michael J. Oberholzer defrauded four\r     elderly Dean Witter clients on fixed incomes by trading their accounts in\r     ways that were contrary to their interests so that he could obtain greater\r     commissions.  These customers lost a total of $320,000 as a result of\r     Oberholzer\s actions.\r\r          The complaint alleges that Oberholzer traded excessively in these\r     customers\ accounts solely in order to obtain commissions for himself,\r     traded on margin in their accounts without authorization, and purchased\r     securities in their accounts that were unsuitable for their financial\r     situation.  The Commission also alleged that Oberholzer made material\r     misrepresentations and omissions to the customers, and that he falsified\r     Dean Witter\s books and records in connection with this fraudulent conduct. \r     The customers were were retired, elderly women on fixed incomes with little\r     or no financial sophistication.  Each of them had conservative financial\r     objectives and invested a substantial part of their assets with Dean\r     Witter. \r\r          Oberholzer agreed to settle this action simultaneously with the filing\r     of the complaint, without admitting or denying the Commission\s\r     allegations.  As part of the settlement, Oberholzer consented to the entry\r     of an order by the Commission barring him from association with a broker,\r     dealer, investment company, investment adviser, or municipal securities\r     dealer.  Oberholzer also consented to a permanent injunction ordering him\r     not to violate the securities laws in the future.  Specifically, he\r     consented to be enjoined not to violate Section 17(a) of the Securities Act\r     of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the\r     Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a)(1) of the\r     Exchange Act and Rule 17a-3 thereunder.\r       \r          The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Federal Bureau of\r     Investigation in this matter.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c"

Cleveland,\r     Sr., and his son Charles R. Cleveland, Jr. on September 4, 1997. The\r     indictment charges the Clevelands with unlawfully and deceptively\r     appropriating funds belonging to investors with the intent to deprive the\r     owners of their property. Another son, James Russell Cleveland, was\r     indicted on the same charges in September 1996 and remains in custody in\r     lieu of a $200,000 bond.  \r\r          The indictments are based on activities alleged against James R.\r     Cleveland in a civil action filed by the Commission on May 22, 1996. The\r     Commission\s complaint alleges that James R. Cleveland, individually, and\r     doing business as Central Texas Securities, took in at least $4.8 million\r     from his customers to purchase municipal securities at below market prices,\r     but never purchased the bonds for the investors.

MARK A. RITACCO, ET AL., United\r     States District Court for the District of Oregon, Civil Action No. CV \97-\r     1307 ST.\r\r                    SEC Sues Oregon Investment Adviser\r\r          The Securities and Exchange Commission today accused a Lake Oswego,\r     Oregon investment adviser and former stockbroker of defrauding investors in\r     Oregon, Washington and Utah out of more than $1.8 million between 1992 and\r     1995.  The Commission today sued Mark A. Ritacco, age 36, in United States\r     District Court in Portland.  Ritacco ran an investment advisory business\r     known as Integrated Wealth Management, Inc., with offices in Newport and\r     Portland, through which he raised money from investors.  Integrated is\r     currently known as Oregon Financial Services.\r\r          The complaint alleges that from 1992 to 1993, Ritacco raised \r     $1.6 million from investors by selling high-risk promissory notes that he\r     falsely described as being guaranteed and probably safer than a money\r     market fund.  In reality, according to the complaint, the notes were\r     issued by a series of high risk, start-up companies, which later were\r     unable to repay the debts.  The complaint also alleges that from 1993 to\r     1995 Ritacco improperly diverted approximately $248,600 in proceeds from\r     securities sales on behalf of three companies that he controlled to a\r     fourth company that he also controlled.  The complaint names as defendants\r     Ritacco and two of his companies, Metro Property Development, Inc., and\r     Pacific Property Development, Inc.  The complaint also names as a relief\r     defendant Pacific Northwest Housing, Inc., of Vancouver, Washington, an\r     unaffiliated real estate development company that received certain loans\r     from Ritacco\s companies. \r\r          Ritacco has reached a settlement with the Commission in which he\r     consented to the entry of a permanent injunction prohibiting him and his\r     two companies from future violations of the federal securities laws.  The\r     settlement also requires Ritacco and his companies to repay more than\r     $315,000, which represents all funds that are recoverable at this time. \r     These payments will be made by  relief defendant Pacific Northwest Housing,\r     which consented to an order directing it to repay certain loans from\r     Ritacco\s companies over time into a fund for eventual distribution to\r     investors.  In the settlement, Ritacco and his companies neither admitted\r     nor denied the allegations in the complaint.\r\r          According to the complaint, in May 1992 Ritacco began selling high\r     risk promissory notes issued by a series of companies including Immcon,\r     Inc., and Pilot Marketing, Inc., both of Spokane, Washington, and JJJ\r     Electronics, Inc., of Utah.  At the time, Ritacco was employed as a\r     stockbroker by Laney & Company.  Laney fired Ritacco in September 1992 for\r     selling the high risk notes \r\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                                        - 2 -\r\r     without the firm\s approval.  After leaving Laney, Ritacco worked through\r     Integrated Wealth Management, the investment advisory firm he owned, where\r     he continued to sell the high risk notes to his advisory clients through\r     March 1993.  In total, Ritacco sold approximately $1.6 million in\r     promissory notes to 45 clients by falsely claiming that the investments\r     were safe, insured or bonded and failing to disclose that the companies\r     issuing the notes were in fact high risk, start-up ventures.  Immcon, JJJ\r     Electronics and Pilot Marketing have each since failed to repay the notes\r     and have been dissolved.\r\r          In a separate scheme, the complaint alleges that beginning in June\r     1993 Ritacco sold approximately $582,350 in promissory notes on behalf of\r     three companies he controlled:  Metro; Pacific; and American Capital\r     Holdings.  Ritacco told investors that the proceeds of these notes would be\r     used primarily to make loans to Pacific Northwest Housing, the unaffiliated\r     real estate development company, and that the loans would be secured by\r     residential real estate.  In fact, Ritacco diverted approximately $248,600\r     of these funds to another company he controlled.  That company, Secure\r     Concepts, failed in its efforts to develop and market an automobile anti-\r     theft device and currently has no ongoing operations.\r\r          Ritacco\s settlement with the Commission, which currently awaits\r     approval by the federal district court, calls for entry of an order: (1)\r     enjoining Ritacco, Metro and Pacific from future violations of Section\r     17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933; Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the\r     Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; (2) enjoining\r     Ritacco from future violations of Sections 204, 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4)\r     of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rules 204-1(b)(1) and 206(4)-4\r     thereunder; and (3) requiring Ritacco, Metro and Pacific to disgorge their\r     illegal profits of $248,600 plus prejudgment interest of $66,613, or a\r     total of $315,213.  Disgorgement and prejudgment interest will come from\r     Pacific Northwest Housing\s repayment of loans it received from Metro and\r     Pacific.\r\r          The Commission also announced that following entry of a final judgment\r     by the federal district court, it will begin separate administrative\r     proceedings against Ritacco and his advisory firm, Integrated Wealth\r     Management.  As part of the settlement, Ritacco has consented to the\r     issuance of an order in the administrative proceedings revoking\r     Integrated\s registration as an investment adviser and barring Ritacco from\r     participating in the securities industry.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 2======\r\x0c"

Pierce used  the funds\r     withdrawn from those accounts for his own benefit. \r\r          The Commission also  announced today  that, on September  8, 1997,  it\r     entered  an administrative  order by  consent permanently  barring O\Rourke\r     from the securities industry on the basis of the injunction entered against\r     her.

(SSI), a Denver, Colorado oil and gas software company\r     whose shares formerly traded on NASDAQ, seeking a permanent injunction and\r     other relief.\r\r          The Commission\s complaint alleges that during 1993, 1994 and 1995,\r     SSI materially overstated its revenue and earnings by backdating or\r     misdating contracts, booking revenue without contracts, overaccruing\r     project revenues and providing confidential side letters modifying payment\r     obligations.  As a result of these practices, the complaint alleges that\r     SSI reported false and misleading information in its Annual Reports for\r     fiscal 1993 and 1994, its Quarterly Reports for the first three quarters of\r     fiscal 1994 and the first quarter of fiscal 1995.  In addition, SSI\r     conducted an offering of 2 million shares of common stock from which it\r     obtained more than $8 million on a registration statement that materially\r     overstated revenue, net income and earnings per share for the 1993 fiscal\r     year and the first quarter of 1994.  The complaint further alleges that SSI\r     filed false Current Reports on Form 8-K in July and August 1995 reporting\r     the resignation of its auditors.  By engaging in such conduct, the\r     complaint alleges that SSI violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of\r     1933, and Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the\r     Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and\r     13a-13 thereunder.\r\r          Specifically, the complaint alleges that, beginning in at least 1993,\r     SSI recognized revenues on contracts to Value Added Resellers (VARs) that\r     included confidential side-letters either excusing payment to SSI until the\r     VARs received payment from a third-party, or rendering the contract\r     ineffective and cancelable until a specified future event, normally the\r     sale of SSI\s software to the VAR\s customer.

On\r     August 15, 1997, Judge Milton Shadur of the United States District Court\r     for the Northern District of Illinois sentenced Wick to twenty-seven months\r     in prison based on his fraudulent sales as described in the Information\r     filed by the Assistant United States Attorney for the Northern District of\r     Illinois.  According to the Information, Wick fraudulently obtained\r     approximately $354,000 from individuals for investment in the Options Group\r     Trading Company, a purported futures and options hedge fund.  In connection\r     with these sales, Wick misrepresented, among other things, his educational\r     background, his employment history, the success of the fund and the rate of\r     return on the individuals investments.  Wick also failed to tell investors\r     that he was on probation for bank fraud at the time he solicited funds from\r     them.  Instead of investing the money as promised, the Information provides\r     that Wick deposited the entire amount in his personal bank account for his\r     own use.\r\r          On the recommendation of Wicks probation officer, Judge Wayne\r     Andersen of the United States District Court for the Northern District of\r     Illinois also sentenced Wick to ten months in prison for probation\r     violations, including his fraudulent Options Group sales.

The Commissions\r     complaint alleges that between August 1993 and May 1994, Maury H. Joseph\r     (Joseph), Florida West s former CEO, and Allen E.

Furthermore, the\r     Complaint alleges that Joseph and Beni caused these misrepresentations and\r     omissions to be repeated in the Company s debenture offering memorandum\r     dated March 4, 1994.

Fried (D. Fried) of Robbinsville,\r     New Jersey, by United States District Judge Dickinson R. Debevoise,\r     District of New Jersey, for insider trading in violation of the federal\r     securities laws.  The Final Judgment permanently enjoins D. Fried from\r     violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange\r     Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, orders him to disgorge trading profits of\r     $5,829, plus prejudgment interest of $2,479.79, and to pay a penalty of\r     $5,829, for a total of $14,137.79.

Fried consented\r     to the entry of the Final Judgment without admitting or denying any of the\r     substantive charges against him.  The litigation is ongoing against\r     defendants A. Fried and Ferry.\r\r          In its complaint, which was filed on March 12, 1996, the Commission\r     charged that D. Fried, A. Fried and Ferry purchased securities of American\r     Biltrite Inc. (ABL) after receiving, from D. Fried\s parents, co-\r     defendants Donald and Renee Ferguson,  material, non-public information\r     that ABL intended to enter into a joint venture agreement with Congoleum\r     Corporation (Congoleum).  The complaint alleged that, on November 30,\r     1992, in connection with his responsibilities as vice-president of\r     engineering of the Amtico division of ABL, Donald Ferguson learned that ABL\r     planned to publicly announce the intended joint venture.  D. Fried, A.\r     Fried and Ferry purchased a total of 6,550 shares of ABL stock on December\r     1 and/or 2, 1992.  ABL made a public announcement of the intended joint\r     venture on December 3, 1992, which caused the price of ABL\s stock to\r     increase four points, or approximately 25%.\r\r          Final Judgments of Permanent Injunction were entered on March 13, 1996\r     against Donald and Renee Ferguson enjoining them from committing further\r     violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder\r     and imposing a penalty of $5,829 against each of them.

The Commission\s\r     complaint seeks an order requiring Zelenka to comply with the Commission\s\r     Order by paying the disgorgement, prejudgment interest and civil penalties\r     which he owes.  The complaint further requests that Zelenka be held in\r     contempt of Court if he fails to promptly pay the $1,483,444.80 in fines\r     owed.\r\r          The Complaint alleges that the Commission\s Order directed Zelenka,\r     inter alia, to disgorge $1,372,069, the sum which Zelenka fraudulently\r     obtained from investors, plus prejudgment interest in the amount of\r     $113,075.80, and to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  Zelenka has failed to\r     comply with the Order.  The Commission\s Order found that Zelenka was the\r     president of H.L. Camp & Co.

CHARLES O. HUTTOE, ET AL., Civil\r     Action No. 96-02543 (GK)(D.D.C.)\r\r     UNITED STATES v. THEODORE R. MELCHER, JR., Cr. 97-244-A (AVB) (E.D.Va.)\r\r          The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that the Honorable\r     Albert V. Bryan, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of\r     Virginia, today sentenced Theodore R. Melcher, Jr. (Melcher), who\r     published a daily stock newsletter disseminated over the internet, to a\r     federal prison term of 12 months, followed by 2 years supervised release\r     and a $20,000 fine.  Melcher, a resident of Tennessee, was sentenced\r     pursuant to a criminal information charging him with criminal violations of\r     Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5\r     thereunder by engaging in a conspiracy to defraud subscribers of the\r     newsletter in connection with the purchase and sale of the stock of Systems\r     of Excellence, Inc. (SOE).  Melcher pled guilty to the information on\r     June 9, 1997.  The plea was filed under seal and remained sealed until\r     today.  The criminal case against Melcher was the result of a coordinated\r     investigative effort by the Commission, the U.S. Attorney\s Office for the\r     Eastern District of Virginia and the Internal Revenue Service - Criminal\r     Investigation Division from Northern Virginia.\r\r          The criminal information alleged that, in January 1996, Melcher\r     entered into an agreement with Charles O. Huttoe, former Chairman of the\r     Board and Chief Executive Officer of SOE, pursuant to which Melcher\r     received shares of SOE stock from Huttoe in exchange for favorably\r     commenting upon and recommending the purchase of the SOE stock to the\r     subscribers of SGA Goldstar Research, Inc. (SGA), the corporation owned\r     by Melcher which published the newsletters.  Thereafter, Melcher received a\r     total of 250,000 shares of SOE stock, the vast majority of which were\r     acquired through Alpha Securities Ltd. (Alpha), a Bahamian entity that he\r     controlled, to avoid the payment of personal income tax, and also received\r     an interest in SOE stock that was received from an entity that had a\r     similar arrangement with Huttoe.  The information further alleges that SGA\r     promoted SOE stock to its subscribers from January 23, 1996 through about\r     October 8, 1996, but that Melcher failed to disclose in the newsletter that\r     he was compensated for favorably promoting SOE stock, as required by the\r     federal securities laws.  According to the information, Melcher caused SGA\r     to issue strong buy recommendations, while at the same time failing to\r     disclose that he was selling his own shares, and failed to verify certain\r     material facts concerning SOE as he indicated had been done in a number of\r     specific publications.  The information alleges that Melcher\s fraudulent\r     conduct with regard to SOE resulted in trading profits of approximately\r     $515,802.\r\r          Melcher previously was named as a defendant in a civil injunctive\r     action brought by the Commission on November 7, 1996.  On that day, the\r     Commission obtained a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) against Melcher,\r     SGA, and Alpha that, among other things, prohibited ongoing violations of\r\x0c\r\r\r\r\r\r\r     the securities laws, and froze those defendants\ assets.  Like the criminal\r     information unsealed today, the complaint alleged that Melcher took bribes\r     from Huttoe in the form of SOE stock to recommend SOE to subscribers of the\r     SGA Goldstar Whisper Stock Report, a tout sheet that was disseminated over\r     the internet and otherwise.  The Complaint further alleged that Melcher\r     then took advantage of the inflated market for SOE stock that he had\r     created by dumping his own SOE stock on unwitting investors.  On January\r     21, 1997, the Commission filed an amended complaint alleging that from in\r     or around 1991, Melcher engaged in a systematic practice of publishing\r     promotional coverage for other issuers in exchange for compensation,\r     without disclosing the compensation.  The Commission\s litigation against\r     Melcher, SGA, and Alpha is ongoing.\r\r          The Commission also announced that on August 18, 1997, in its ongoing\r     civil litigation, the Court appointed Thomas A. Ferrigno of the Washington,\r     D.C. office of O\Melveny & Myers LLP as Receiver in the case for the\r     purposes of receiving and marshalling monies and other assets that are\r     ordered by the Court to be disgorged by defendants and relief defendants,\r     aiding the Commission in devising a disgorgement plan for the return of\r     disgorged assets to defrauded investors, and administering such a\r     disgorgement plan once it has been approved by the Court.  The Commission\r     further announced that on May 19, 1997, pursuant to a settlement, the Court\r     ordered that relief defendant Investors Associates, Inc. pay $1,100,000,\r     plus $24,379 in prejudgment interest, to the Registry of the Court. \r     Investors Associates, Inc. did not admit or deny the allegations of the\r     Commission\s Amended Complaint. \r\r          The Commission previously has made several announcements concerning\r     this matter.

The Complaint, which was filed on\r     December 5, 1995, alleged that, from December 1984 to June 1994, E.\r     Collins, along with his now deceased brother, Thomas Collins, through their\r     company Lake States, Inc., raised $120 million from 460 investors, residing\r     in 15 states.  The Complaint alleged that T. Collins and E. Collins made\r     misstatements and omitted to state material facts to investors regarding\r     the use of proceeds, the rate of return and the risk of the investment.  \r\r          The Complaint alleged that investors were told that their funds would\r     be pooled with other investors funds to invest in commodity futures and\r     other business ventures.  Instead of investing all of the money as\r     represented, the Complaint alleged that T. Collins and E. Collins were\r     running a Ponzi scheme and that most of investor funds were used to pay\r     personal and business expenses and to pay interest and principal to prior\r     investors.  The Complaint further alleged that E. Collins and T. Collins\r     told investors to expect a 40% to 90% return on their investment.  Finally,\r     the Complaint alleged that T. Collins and E. Collins failed to register\r     these securities, in the form of investment contracts, and failed to\r     register as broker-dealers with the Commission.\r\r          The Honorable Blanche Manning of the U.S. District Court for the\r     Northern District of Illinois entered the Order enjoining E.

The Order also\r     requires disgorgement in the amount of $950,000, plus prejudgment interest;\r     however, payment is waived based on E. Collins demonstrated inability to\r     pay.\r\x0c"

ROY HANDOJO, Civil Action No. 97-Civ. \r     6805 (S.D.N.Y.)  (LAP)  (filed September 12, 1997)\r\r     On September 12, 1997, the Commission filed a civil complaint in the United\r     States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Roy\r     Handojo ( Handojo ).  The complaint alleges that Handojo, an Indonesian\r     national and visiting analyst employed in the bank group at J.P. Morgan &\r     Co., Inc. s New York office ( J.P. Morgan ), engaged in flagrant insider\r     trading in four companies involved in merger negotiations in which J.P.\r     Morgan s bank group was participating as an adviser.  In three separate\r     merger transactions during July and August 1997, Handojo purchased\r     securities days before the companies publicly announced that they had\r     entered into definitive merger agreements.  Handojo reaped at least\r     $363,189 in profits from his trades.  The Commission s complaint alleges\r     that Handojo violated Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of\r     1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement,\r     and civil penalties.\r\r     The complaint alleges that, without any prior trading experience, the 25\r     year old Hondojo purchased 6,209 shares of the common stock of Signet\r     Banking Corp., a J.P. Morgan client, less than a week before the July 21,\r     1997 announcement of Signet s acquisition by First Union Corp.  Handojo\r     realized nearly $90,000 in profits when he later sold the stock.  He also\r     bought 12,500 shares of ACC Consumer Finance Corp. common stock several\r     days before the August 25, 1997 announcement that Household International,\r     another J.P. Morgan client, would acquire ACC by merger.  ACC s stock\r     soared 34% on the day of the announcement, and Handojo sold his entire\r     position for nearly $60,000 in profits.  Finally, in the three days prior\r     to the August 29, 1997 announcement of NationsBank Corporation s\r     acquisition of Barnett Banks, Inc., a J.P. Morgan client, Handojo purchased\r     280 Barnett call options, 80 call options in NationsBank, and 500 shares of\r     stock in each bank.  In the week following the announcement, which caused a\r     24% surge in Barnett s stock price, Handojo sold all his Barnett shares and\r     call options for a total profit of $214,000.\r\r     On September 12, 1997, the Court ordered a temporary freeze of the assets\r     in defendant s brokerage and bank accounts, and granted the Commission\r     expedited discovery and other ancillary relief.

THE GENEVA GROUP and NICHOLAS GARCIA,\r     Civil Action No. SACV97-740 AHS (C.D.

On the Commission s application, the Court has ordered defendants\r     Geneva and Garcia immediately to cease their fraudulent activities.  In\r     addition, to protect investor funds, the Court has frozen Geneva s and\r     Garcia s assets pending further litigation.  \r\r     The Commission told the Court that the defendants have been soliciting\r     investors to buy shares of ForceTek Holding, Inc. -- a company controlled\r     by Garcia s associates that apparently has no business operations -- with\r     materials that describe the business of Force Technologies, Inc., a\r     different and unrelated Canadian company that trades in Canada under the\r     symbol FRCE.  Earlier this year, Garcia and Geneva obtained 900,000 shares\r     of Force Technologies and then solicited investors to buy the stock. \r     According to the marketing materials used by the defendants, the businesses\r     of Force Technologies include the marketing and distribution of safety\r     film, and the development of an Internet gaming site and an HIV saliva\r     test.\r\r     This summer, according to the Commission, Garcias associates acquired\r     control of a public shell corporation whose stock had been cleared for\r     quotation on the NASD Bulletin Board, changed its name to ForceTek Holding,\r     Inc., and changed its trading symbol to FRCE, the same symbol as that used\r     by Force Technologies in Canada.  The defendants started soliciting\r     investors to buy ForceTek stock, using materials very similar, and in some\r     instances substantially identical, to those they had used to offer and sell\r     Force Technologies stock.\r\r     Based on these allegations, the Commission claims that the defendants\r     violated the antifraud and broker-dealer registration provisions of the\r     federal securities laws.  The Court has scheduled a hearing for\r     September 26, 1997, to determine whether the relief granted yesterday\r     should be extended.\r\r     The Commission thanks the National Association of Securities Dealers for\r     its assistance in this matter. \r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c"

Simultaneously with the filing of the\r     Commission\s complaint, Borg consented to the entry of an order of\r     permanent injunction from further violations of the antifraud provisions of\r     the federal securities laws.

According to the complaint,\r     on September 20 and 29, 1995, after having assisted in negotiating the\r     terms of the agreement for his employer, Motorola, Borg illegally purchased\r     a total of 2,000 shares of Ibis common stock.

The complaint alleges that from June 1993 through May 1996,\r     the Defendants raised over $4.25 million from over 190 investors\r     nationwide.  The Defendants told investors that their money would be used\r     to manufacture and market computer equipment designed to capture and\r     transmit medical images, to purchase computer hardware and computer chip\r     manufacturing equipment, and for working capital.  The Commission alleges\r     that only a small portion of investor funds were used to purchase computer\r     equipment and that most funds were used to: (1) pay returns to earlier\r     investors in a Ponzi scheme, (2) pay the expenses of a related company,\r     (3) make loans to related companies, (4) purchase an interest in an\r     unrelated company, (5) pay personal expenses, and (6) pay commissions to\r     sales agents.\r\r          The Commission sued Microwest Industries, Inc., MicroWest\r     Microsystems, Inc.

Farrell, James L. Ericksteen, Gary L. Moore,\r     Jill Hall and Guido Bensberg.\r\r          The complaint alleges that for a period of at least two years\r     beginning in 1992, defendants Ferracone, Farrell, Ericksteen, Moore and\r     Hall, acting through various corporate and trust entities, engaged in a\r     fraudulent stock leasing scheme.  According to the complaint, these\r     defendants acquired hundreds of millions of shares of restricted stock in\r     at least 18 publicly-traded companies by falsely promising the issuing\r     companies that they would pay the issuing companies large monthly rental\r     fees for the stock, that they would not sell, pledge, or otherwise transfer\r     the stock in any way, and that the companies could take the stock back\r     after a year.  The complaint alleges that after acquiring the stock\r     certifiicates, the defendants repeatedly attempted to transfer the stock to\r     third parties without disclosing the many restrictions that encumbered the\r     shares, in order to fraudulently obtain property, money, or credit.\r\r          According to the complaint, the defendants fraudulent scheme resulted\r     in losses to such third parties of at least $9.5 million.  Specifically,\r     the complaint alleges that the defendants subleased certain of the\r     restricted stocks to defendant Bensberg, who fraudulently pledged the stock\r     as collateral to obtain $3 million from Bank Leu pursuant to a line of\r     credit.  The complaint further alleges that in another instance, Bensberg\r     directly acquired restricted stock from a public company and fraudulently\r     pledged it to obtain $6.5 million from the London office of Lehman\r     Brothers, also pursuant to a line of credit.\r\r          The Commissions complaint charges the defendants with violating\r     Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the\r     Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks relief\r     against all defendants in the form of permanent injunctions, disgorgement\r     of illicit gains, and civil monetary penalties.\r\r          The Commissions investigation is continuing.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c"

Among the misrepresentations and omissions made by\r     defendants were the following: statements that investors could receive\r     returns of 500% or more; statements that the investment was fully insured\r     and virtually risk free when in fact ostrich breeding is a high-risk,\r     highly speculative investment; and the failure to disclose that many of the\r     defendants had been ordered by several states to cease and desist their\r     offer and sale of the ostrich investments.  \r\r          The injunctions granted on September 12, 1997, enjoin defendants F.\r     Stewart, Stahl, Foxx and Rios from committing future violations of the\r     anti-fraud, registration and broker-dealer registration provisions of the\r     federal securities laws.   The Final Judgments also order each defendant to\r     pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains and note the appropriateness of\r     imposing civil penalties, but waive disgorgement because of defendants\\r     inability to pay and do not impose penalties for the same reason.

The Complaint seeks, among other things, permanent\r     injunctions, an accounting, disgorgement and civil penalties.\r\r          The Commission\s Complaint alleges that from in or about January 1991\r     through in or about February 1995, Omni and others engaged in three\r     separate fraudulent offerings.  From these offerings, Omni raised\r     approximately $4 million.

Following these fraudulent statements, between in or about\r     March and in or about December 1993, Omni, Bubalo and Koehler offered and\r     sold newly issued shares of common stock and raised approximately $500,000\r     from approximately 46 investors located in several states.  These investors\r     were told that if they bought stock at prices around $0.75 per share they\r     were guaranteed a profit based on a\r\r                                        - 2 -\r\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c\r\r\r\r\r\r\r     tender offer price of at least $2.50 per share.  The majority of Omni\r     investors tendered their shares to Omni.\r\r          In addition, the Commission\s Complaint alleges that as a third part\r     of the fraud, between in or about March 1994 and in or about February 1995,\r     after Omni investors had tendered their shares, Omni, Bubalo, Farley, Rude\r     and others sold previously tendered Omni shares to new investors.  In this\r     secondary market, Omni raised approximately $2.2 million from approximately\r     122 investors in several states.

To date, no tender offer payout has been made to any Omni\r     shareholder.  \r\r          Finally, the Commission\s Complaint alleges that throughout the course\r     of the fraud, Omni, Bubalo, Hetherington and Wilcox made misrepresentations\r     and omitted to state material facts in press releases and newspaper\r     articles regarding Omni\s revenues, sales to the Ukraine and the listing of\r     Omni common stock on NASDAQ.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 2======\r\x0c"

In its\r     complaint, the Commission alleges that, from in or about October 1993\r     through August 1996, Clifford raised approximately $1.8 million, primarily\r     through the fraudulent sale of promissory notes, to approximately 74\r     investors.  The Commission further alleges that Clifford falsely stated to\r     investors that all of their funds would be invested in start-up companies,\r     mutual funds, stocks, and/or commodities.  Instead, the complaint alleges\r     the mutual funds did not exist and that Clifford used investor funds for\r     undisclosed purposes including to make principal and interest payments to\r     earlier investors.  Additionally, it is alleged that Clifford expended a\r     sizeable portion of investor funds for his personal expenses.  Finally, the\r     Commission alleges that Clifford omitted to disclose material information\r     regarding the terms of the investments in the start-up companies and\r     Clifford\s financial condition. \r\r          The Commission\s complaint alleges that Clifford violated the anti-\r     fraud provisions found in Sections 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933,\r     Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5\r     thereunder and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of\r     1940 (Advisers Act).  The complaint further alleges that Clifford\r     violated the investment adviser registration provisions found in Section\r     203(a) of the Advisers Act.  \r\r          Simultaneously with the filing of the complaint, a stipulation and\r     consent and proposed final judgment were also filed as to Clifford in which\r     he agrees, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission\s\r     complaint, and pending final approval by the Court, to be permanently\r     enjoined from future violations of the above provisions of the federal\r     securities laws.  Further, Clifford agrees to disgorge $1,077,692.00,\r     representing his gains from the conduct alleged in the complaint, plus pre-\r     judgment interest thereon, provided that payment of all but $30,000 is\r     waived based upon Clifford\s demonstrated inability to pay.

It is alleged, however, that the\r     Defendants are operating a Ponzi-like scheme whereby the source of\r     distributions to investors, although represented to be oil and gas\r     revenues, in fact is mostly other investor monies.  Additionally, the\r     Defendants in some cases do not own the oil and gas wells they claim to\r     own.  The Defendants also sold the same interests in wells to at least\r     three different groups of investors.  Furthermore, contrary to the\r     Defendants\ representations, investor funds were commingled and are not\r     safeguarded in escrow accounts.\r\r          The Complaint alleges that the Defendants violated the antifraud\r     provisions, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b)\r     of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that\r     Amerivest further violated the broker-dealer antifraud provisions, Section\r     15(c)(1)(A) of the Exchange Act and Rule 15c1-2 thereunder.

The\r     Complaint seeks the entry of a final order of permanent injunction against\r     Malek, Turner and Cooperstock, disgorgement of Turners ill-gotten gains\r     and civil penalties against Turner and Cooperstock.  The Complaint alleges\r     that all three defendants violated the securities registration and the\r     antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and the\r     broker-dealer registration and antifraud provisions of the Securities\r     Exchange Act (Exchange Act).\r\r          In its Complaint, the Commission alleges that, from approximately 1990\r     through October 1995, Malek was the president and a 50 percent shareholder\r     in Lease Equities Fund, Inc. (LEF), which leased equipment for use by\r     businesses and financed these transactions by offering and selling\r     securities in the form of promissory notes secured by the equipment leases. \r     According to the Complaint, LEF also offered and sold promissory notes\r     secured by cable television agreements assigned to LEF by NBF Cable\r     Systems, Inc. (NBF), a cable television company affiliated with LEF.  The\r     Complaint alleges that, from 1990 through October 1995, Malek operated a\r     Ponzi scheme by using part of the proceeds of new promissory notes to repay\r     previous investors in the notes, by forging equipment leases and by\r     overassigning leases.  The Complaint further alleges that, from 1990\r     through approximately 1995, Malek caused LEF to offer and sell unregistered\r     LEF securities and that, from approximately October 1992 through October\r     1995, Turner and Cooperstock offered and sold unregistered LEF securities. \r     According to the Complaint, Malek, Turner and Cooperstock made\r     misrepresentations and omissions of material fact to investors concerning\r     the use of investor funds, the source of funds to be repaid to investors,\r     the risks associated with the securities, the collateral for the securities\r     and the returns to be realized, and Turner made misrepresentations and\r     omitted to state facts regarding his ownership interest in NBF and his\r     status as an officer of both LEF and NBF.\r\r          Malek and Cooperstock have consented, without admitting or denying the\r     allegations in the Complaint, to the entry of a Final Judgment and Order of\r     Permanent Injunction which will enjoin them from future violations of\r     Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act and Sections 10(b),\r     15(a) and 15(c) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 15c1-2 thereunder. \r     The Final Judgment will not order Cooperstock to pay a civil penalty,\r     pursuant to Section 21(d) of the Exchange Act, based on his demonstrated\r     inability to pay.

Kirk, Stephen P. Morin, Jerome Allen, Bruce S.\r     Moody, and The 1991 RPM Irrevocable Trust (the RPM Trust).  The\r     Commission\s complaint alleges that from as early as July 1991 through\r     April 1993, Ferrofluidics, a NASDAQ-listed company, materially inflated its\r     revenues and earnings in financial statements filed with the Commission and\r     in other disclosures made to the investing public.  The complaint alleges\r     that Ronald Moskowitz, Ferrofluidics\ former chief executive officer,\r     chairman of the board of directors and largest shareholder, was the\r     architect of the fraudulent scheme, and that Jan Kirk, Stephen Morin and\r     Jerome Allen participated in the scheme and concealed the fraud from\r     Ferrofluidics\ auditors.  The complaint also alleges that defendant Bruce\r     Moody, the trustee of defendant RPM Trust, helped Moskowitz conceal his\r     beneficial interest in the Ferrofluidics shares held by the RPM Trust, and\r     facilitated Moskowitz\s sale of Ferrofluidics stock valued at approximately\r     $13 million during the time of the fraudulent conduct.\r\r          The complaint alleges that defendants prepared and disseminated a\r     series of materially false and misleading statements concerning, among\r     other things, a 1992 sham private placement of stock by the company, sales\r     of the company\s products, and equity investments made by the company. \r     Defendants also allegedly disseminated favorable projections concerning\r     Ferrofluidics\ future business prospects and profitability, without having\r     any reasonable basis for such projections.  The complaint alleges that, as\r     a result of defendants\ activities, potential and actual investors in\r     Ferrofluidics were led to believe that Ferrofluidics was a prosperous\r     company with marketable and attractive products, and tremendous\r     opportunities for rapid growth and earnings.  In fact, Ferrofluidics was\r     then experiencing significant losses and encountering problems developing\r     and manufacturing its products. \r\r          The complaint alleges that during the relevant period Moskowitz\r     (directly and through trusts that he controlled) and Allen sold\r     Ferrofluidics stock worth millions of dollars, in a series of private\r     placements and open market transactions, while in the possession of\r     material, nonpublic information about the company.\r\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c\r\r\r\r\r\r\r          The complaint alleges that the defendants (except Moody) violated the\r     antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  Ferrofluidics,\r     Moskowitz, Kirk and Morin also violated certain reporting, internal\r     controls and record-keeping provisions of the federal securities laws.  The\r     complaint also alleges that Allen violated Section 17(b) of the Securities\r     Act of 1933 by publishing and circulating The International Investor, a\r     newsletter that ran numerous articles recommending the securities of\r     Ferrofluidics, without disclosing that he had been compensated by the\r     company.  The complaint also alleges that Moskowitz and the RPM Trust\r     violated Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 13d-\r     2 thereunder by failing to make the disclosures and filings required of\r     persons who directly or indirectly acquire a beneficial interest of 5% or\r     more of any class of a registered equity security.  For the same reasons,\r     Kirk and Morin allegedly violated Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and\r     Rule 13d-1 thereunder. \r\r          The complaint alleges that Moody aided and abetted Moskowitz\s and the\r     RPM Trust\s violations of the antifraud provisions by helping Moskowitz\r     conceal his beneficial interest in the Ferrofluidics shares held by the\r     Trust, and by permitting Moskowitz\s sales of Ferrofluidics shares while\r     Moskowitz possessed material nonpublic information about the company. \r     Moody allegedly aided and abetted the RPM Trust\s violation of Section\r     13(d) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13d-2 thereunder by failing to make the\r     required disclosure concerning the Ferrofluidics shares beneficially owned\r     by Moskowitz in the Trust\s Schedules 13D filed with the Commission.  \r\r          The Commission is seeking injunctive relief, disgorgement of\r     defendants\ ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, the imposition of civil\r     penalties against Moskowitz, Kirk, Allen, Morin and the RPM Trust, and\r     officer and director bars against Moskowitz, Kirk and Morin. \r     Simultaneously with the filing of the complaint, and without admitting or\r     denying the Commission\s allegations, Ferrofluidics and Morin agreed to the\r     entry of permanent injunctions.  Morin also consented to pay a $25,000\r     civil penalty, and to the entry of an order barring him for five years from\r     serving as an officer or director of a public company.  Morin has also\r     offered to consent to a five-year bar from practicing as an accountant\r     before the Commission pursuant to Commission Rule of Practice 102(e).\r\r          In a related cease-and-desist proceeding (In the Matter of Kedar\r     Gupta, Alvan Chorney, and Herbert Moskowitz, Admin.

The Commission also found that\r     Noorani violated Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act for assisting\r     Ferrofluidics in selling 1,155,00 of its shares when he was not registered\r     as a broker-dealer.  Chalut and Noorani were ordered to pay disgorgement of\r     $21,000 and $65,000, respectively.\r\r          In the Matter of Paul Y. Okuda, Stephen A.

The Division\r     seeks disgorgement and prejudgment interest against all three respondents\r     and civil money penalties and administrative sanctions against Okuda and\r     Chester.\r\r          In the Matter of Dickinson & Co. and Marshall T.

DALE J. LANGE, ET AL. (United\r     States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, Civil\r     Action No.97-CV-6018)\r\r          On September 25, 1997, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\r     (Commission) filed a complaint in United States District Court for the\r     Eastern District of Pennsylvania against seven individuals for insider\r     trading in the securities of Cephalon, Inc. (Cephalon).  The trading\r     occurred prior to a public announcement on June 10, 1995 by Cephalon\r     concerning favorable test results involving Myotrophin, a drug Cephalon\r     developed to treat individuals suffering from Amyotrophic Lateral\r     Sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig\s disease.\r\r          The complaint names the following individuals as defendants: Dale J.\r     Lange (Lange), a clinical investigator for Cephalon and a member of the\r     medical faculty and Associate Professor of Neurology at Columbia\r     University\s College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York City; Philip S.\r     Portoghese (Portoghese), a member of Cephalon\s Scientific Advisory\r     Board, Stuart W. and Stephen P. Portoghese, Portoghese\s sons; Frank G.\r     Lepore (Frank Lepore) and Mark F. Lepore (Mark Lepore), officers of a\r     graphic arts company that was retained by Cephalon to prepare certain\r     materials depicting the Myotrophin test results; and Timothy L. Garner\r     (Garner), a former Cephalon employee.  The Commission alleges that each\r     of the defendants, while in possession of material non-public information\r     concerning the favorable Myotrophin test results, purchased, or tipped\r     others who purchased, Cephalon securities prior to the public announcement\r     of the Myotrophin results.\r\r          According to the complaint, Lange served as both a clinical\r     investigator and an advisor/consultant during the course of the Myotrophin\r     trials.  Upon learning of the favorable test results, he purchased a total\r     of 3,000 shares of Cephalon common stock during the one-month period prior\r     to the company\s public announcement.  His profits from the trades totalled\r     $26,496.  The complaint further alleges that P. Portoghese, a member of\r     Cephalon\s Scientific Advisory Board (Board), first learned about the\r     positive Myotrophin results during a telephone conference call between\r     Cephalon officers and Board members.  The Commission alleges that\r     Portoghese told his sons, Stuart and Stephen, about the test results, and\r     that they purchased 615 and 200 shares of Cephalon, respectively, within\r     one and one-half hours after the telephone conference call ended.\r\r          The Commission\s complaint alleges that Frank and Mark Lepore obtained\r     the information when Cephalon retained their company to enhance certain\r     slides, charts and graphs, which depicted the results of the Myotrophin\r     clinical trials.  During the ten day period prior to Cephalon\s public\r     announcement, Frank Lepore purchased 600 shares of Cephalon common stock\r     and 50 Cephalon call options.  During that same period, Mark Lepore, his\r     son, purchased 25 Cephalon call options.  According to the complaint, Frank\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c\r\r\r\r\r\r\r     and Mark Lepore realized profits of $25,737 and $15,084, respectively. \r     Finally, the Commission alleges that Garner, who had never before purchased\r     securities, purchased 100 shares of Cephalon common stock and 10 Cephalon\r     call options prior to the public announcement.  Garner was employed as a\r     scientist at Cephalon and worked on projects analyzing proteins used for\r     Myotrophin.  He earned $4,656 in profits as a result of his trading.  \r\r          The Commission alleges that Lange, Frank Lepore, Mark Lepore and\r     Garner purchased of Cephalon securities despite having signed\r     confidentiality agreements with the company.  In these agreements, they\r     each acknowledged that the information they would receive from Cephalon was\r     confidential and proprietary.  According to the complaint, in his\r     agreement, Lange also agreed not to purchase Cephalon securities during the\r     term of the agreement.\r\r          The Commission\s complaint charges each of the defendants with\r     violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule\r     10b-5 thereunder.  In the complaint, the Commission also seeks disgorgement\r     and the imposition of civil penalties against each of the defendants. \r     Simultaneous with the filing of the complaint, Frank Lepore, Mark Lepore\r     and Garner each consented, without admitting or denying the allegations in\r     the complaint, to the entry of a Final Judgment and Order enjoining them\r     from future violations of the relevant securities laws.  Frank Lepore also\r     agreed to disgorge his profits of $25,737, together with prejudgment\r     interest, and to the imposition of a civil penalty of $25,737.  Mark Lepore\r     agreed to disgorge his profits of $15,084, together with prejudgment\r     interest, and to the imposition of a civil penalty of $15,084.  Garner\r     agreed to disgorge his profits of $4,656, together with prejudgment\r     interest.  As part of the settlement with Garner, the Commission has\r     declined to seek to impose a civil penalty based on Garner\s demonstrated\r     inability to pay. \r\r          Cephalon is a Delaware corporation with headquarters in West Chester,\r     Pennsylvania.  The company originates and develops pharmaceutical products\r     for the treatment of neurological disorders.  Lange resides in Scarsdale,\r     New York.  Portoghese resides in North Oaks, Minnesota, and his sons,\r     Stuart and Stephen, are both residents of St. Paul, Minnesota.  Frank and\r     Mark Lepore are residents of Mt.

The Complaint alleges that, between January 1992 and May\r     1993, Defendants Lee, a resident of Lynn, Massachusetts, and Almeder, a\r     resident of Weymouth, Massachusetts, fraudulently offered and sold stock of\r     DreamWorld, Inc. (DreamWorld) to at least 28 investors who invested more\r     than $250,000.  According to the Defendants, the proceeds of the sales of\r     the securities would be used for the development of a vast theme park and\r     entertainment complex on the banks of the Cape Cod Canal in Bourne,\r     Massachusetts, when, in fact, the money was used for personal and living\r     expenses, including Almeder\s lease of a Jaguar automobile.  The action was\r     filed in the United States District Court for the District of\r     Massachusetts.\r\r          The Complaint alleges the Defendants committed securities fraud by\r     falsely telling investors that: (1) they had obtained a commitment of $300\r     million in financing; (2) they had secured or were about to secure\r     sponsorship of the theme park by major corporate investors; (3) they owned\r     sufficient land on which to build the theme park; (4) Dreamworld was a\r     secure investment due to the value of land it already owned; (5) Dreamworld\r     stock was currently worth $1.00 to $1.50 per share, based upon the current \r     value of its assets and would be worth $15 per share within a couple of\r     years; and (6) they had obtained all necessary permits for a large portion\r     of the park.\r\r          The Commission alleges that the defendants violated\r     Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the\r     Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

(United States\r     District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, Civil Action No.\r     97-CV-265J)\r\r          The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) announced that,\r     on September 26, 1997, the Honorable William L. Standish of the U.S.\r     District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania issued a temporary\r     restraining order against John Gardner Black (Black), Devon Capital\r     Management, Inc. (Devon), and Financial Management Sciences, Inc.\r     (FMS).  Among other things, the Order freezes the defendants\ assets and\r     appoints as Trustee over those assets Dick Thornburgh, formerly Attorney\r     General of the United States, United States Attorney for the Western\r     District of Pennsylvania and Governor of Pennsylvania.  \r\r          The complaint alleges an on-going fraudulent scheme perpetrated by\r     Black through Devon, a Pennsylvania-based registered investment adviser,\r     and FMS, an affiliate of Devon\s.  Both Devon and FMS are wholly owned and\r     controlled by Black.  The complaint alleges that the scheme has resulted in\r     the loss of millions of dollars of municipal bond proceeds invested by\r     school districts throughout western and central Pennsylvania.\r\r          Devon manages approximately $345 million in assets for approximately\r     100 investment advisory clients, the vast majority of which are local\r     school districts seeking to invest the proceeds of municipal bond\r     offerings.  Devon has invested approximately $233 million of these funds,\r     on behalf of 75 local school districts, in a form of investment called a\r     Collateralized Investment Agreement (CIA).  In promotional materials,\r     Devon represented to these school districts that the CIA is an investment\r     which pays a specified rate of return over a fixed period and which is\r     fully protected by a pool of securities equalling the amount of the school\r     districts\ total principal investment.  The complaint alleges that, in\r     fact, the school districts that have invested in the CIA program have\r     suffered a combined loss of their principal investment of approximately $71\r     million.    \r\r          The complaint alleges that, in an effort to conceal this loss of\r     principal from the school districts that have invested in the CIA program,\r     Devon and Black have misrepresented to them the value of the assets held as\r     collateral, overstating the actual value of those assets by approximately\r     $71 million.  The complaint further alleges that Black has continued to\r     accept new clients for investment into the CIA program without disclosing\r     to these new clients that, as a result of the shortfall in the funds\r     already under management, any funds that new clients invest into the CIA\r     program are immediately diluted.  The complaint alleges that Devon must\r     continue to attract new funds for investment in the program in order to\r     fulfill its entire obligations to current advisory clients in the CIA\r     program.\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c\r\r\r\r\r\r\r          Finally, the complaint alleges that Black, Devon and FMS have\r     benefitted financially from this fraudulent scheme.

The Complaint alleges that, between November 1992 and\r     December 1993, the Defendant, a resident of Gloucester, Massachusetts, and\r     a registered investment adviser, misappropriated from three clients more\r     than $50,000 intended for investment in securities and used the funds to\r     pay his own personal expenses.  The action was filed in the United States\r     District Court for the District of Massachusetts.     \r\r          D\Alelio is a recidivist securities violator.  In October 1992, he was\r     charged by the Massachusetts Securities Division (Securities Division)\r     with engaging in dishonest and unethical practices in the securities\r     business, based upon complaints by previous customers that he had effected\r     unauthorized trades in their accounts and had misappropriated their funds. \r     In May 1994, after a hearing on those charges, D\Alelio was found liable. \r     He was fined, compelled to disgorge profits and his registration as a\r     securities agent in Massachusetts was revoked.

The complaint was filed in federal district court in Los\r     Angeles.\r\r          From 1989 to 1994, Flaherty sold contracts for the purchase and\r     processing of cinder ore into refined gold or other precious metals to at\r     least 49 investors, raising approximately $680,000.  In 1993, Flaherty\r     gained control of Phoenix Metals, whose stock trades on the OTC Bulletin\r     Board under the symbol PMTU.  From 1994 to 1995, Phoenix Metals and\r     Flaherty sold Phoenix Metals stock to approximately 30 investors, raising\r     $1,835,000.

Phoenix Metals and Flaherty made numerous misrepresentations\r     to investors: (1) Flaherty promised investors in the cinder ore contracts\r     that they would receive a guaranteed 300% return but he has not paid\r     investors any return; (2) Phoenix Metals and Flaherty falsely claimed\r     extensive ownership of cinder ore in Arizona and Nevada; and (3) Phoenix\r     Metals and Flaherty falsely claimed that they owned cinder ore processing\r     facilities and had the present capability of processing cinder ore into\r     precious metals on a commercially viable basis.\r\r          The Complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement and an\r     accounting against Phoenix Metals for violating Section 17(a) of the\r     Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of\r     1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and against Flaherty for violating Section\r     17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the\r     Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c"

Cantor & Co., Inc., engaged\r     in a scheme to manipulate the price of AFGL International common stock by,\r     among other things, executing a succession of prearranged trades at ever-\r     increasing prices with the intent to, and having the effect of,\r     manipulating the price of AFGL International common stock from\r     approximately $1 per share to approximately $7 per share.  Over the course\r     of the manipulation period, the defendants accumulated over 76% of the\r     public float in AFGL common stock and placed it into Wegard\s inventory. \r     After defendants had accumulated the AFGL common stock and manipulated the\r     price of the stock to the $7 per share level, Greer, through Wegard, began\r     a sales effort through which Wegard sold over one million shares of AFGL\r     common stock to the investing public over the course of nine days, yielding\r     a profit of approximately $3.5 million to Wegard and its owner and\r     president, Greer.  During the period of the manipulation and subsequent\r     thereto, Wernick made a profit of at least $207,500 by trading AFGL common\r     stock and warrants through his wife\s account.\r\r          Defendants Greer and Wernick are alleged to have violated Sections\r     17(a)(1), 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section\r     10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated\r     thereunder.

BRIAN E. WILLIS AND WILLIAM SANCHEZ\r     (United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Civil\r     Action NO. 97-CV-7268)\r\r          The Securities and Exchange Commission announced the filing of a civil\r     injunctive action by the Commission on September 30, 1997, against Brian E.\r     Willis and William Sanchez in the United States District Court for the\r     Southern District of New York.    \r\r          The Commissions  Complaint alleges that, beginning in at least January\r     1995 and continuing though May 1996, the defendants engaged in a scheme to\r     defraud investors by making fraudulent representations and omission in\r     connection with the sale of interests in a purported trading program\r     involving the foreign currency exchange spot market.  The Complaint alleges\r     that, since January 1995, the defendants sold at least $4 million in\r     interests in its purported trading program to at least 335 investors.  The\r     Complaint alleges that defendants Willis and Sanchez, acting through\r     Templer International, Ltd. ( Templer ) a now defunct corporation,\r     misrepresented to investors that it was in the business of trading in the\r     foreign currency market using specialized skills and expertise when, in\r     fact, Temper did not conduct trading in the foreign currency market, but\r     rather misappropriated investor money for personal use and to make payments\r     to existing investors.  Additionally, Temper documents indicated that 100%\r     of investor funds had been pooled and traded as one account.  The complaint\r     also alleges that Willis and Sanchez, through the medium of Templer,\r     promised exorbitant returns to investors of anywhere from 14% monthly to\r     60% annually.\r\r          The Commission Complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief against\r     Willis and Sanchez from violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the\r     Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5\r     thereunder, and ancillary relief in the form of disgorgement with\r     prejudgment interest.  \r\r          Willis and Sanchez were indicted on September 11, 1997 in connection\r     with the conduct described herein and charged with mail and wire fraud and\r     conspiracy to commit said acts in violation of Title 18 U.S.C.

15519,1997,,"b\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                   UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION\r\r     Litigation Release No. 15519 / September 30, 1997\r\r     SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION v. DAVID R. PFISTER, RICHARD G. PFISTER,\r     TY BARTEL, NICK A. SKANSI, NICK L. SKANSI, GEORGE S. PHARIS, CHOK-TAT TAN,\r     JODY L. LAFONT, JEFFREY J. JANDEGIAN, and RANDOLPH R. BLACKBURN, 97 Civ.\r     7274 (S.D.N.Y.) (JGK)\r\r           The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) announced today\r     that it has charged eleven individuals (the Defendants) with insider\r     trading in the securities of Freeport-McMoRan Oil and Gas Royalty Trust\r     (FMR).  The Defendants purchased FMR securities just prior to FMR\s\r     announcement in June 1994 of a large oil discovery in the Gulf of Mexico in\r     which FMR held a royalty interest (the West Cameron Discovery). \r     Together, the Defendants received over $200,000 in illicit profits by\r     buying FMR securities prior to the announcement of the West Cameron\r     Discovery.\r\r          Named in the Complaint are:  \r\r               David R. Pfister (David Pfister), age 37, residing in\r               Lafayette, Louisiana;\r\r               Richard G. Pfister (Richard Pfister), age 62,   residing in\r          Metaire, Louisiana;\r\r               Ty Bartel (Bartel), age 49, residing in Mandeville, Louisiana;\r\r               Nick A. Skansi (Nick Skansi), age 41, residing in New\r               Orleans, Louisiana;\r\r               Nick L. Skansi (Nick Skansi Sr.), age 67, residing in\r                    New Orleans, Louisiana;\r\r               David J. Skansi (David Skansi), age 37, residing in       New\r          Orleans, Louisiana;\r\r               George S. Pharis (Pharis), age 35, residing in New   Orleans,\r          Louisiana;\r\r               Chok-Tat Tan (Tan), age 50, residing in New Orleans,\r               Louisiana;\r\r               Jody L. Lafont (Lafont), age 38, residing in Harahan,\r               Louisiana;\r\r               Jeffrey J. Jandegian (Jandegian), age 46, residing in\r                    River Ridge, Louisiana; and\r\r               Randolph R. Blackburn (Blackburn), age 51, residing  in\r          Lafayette, Louisiana.\r\r          According to the Complaint:\r\x0c\r\r\r\r\r\r\r          In June 1994, David Pfister worked for CLK, a geological consulting\r     firm that provided services to FMR.  While at work on June 23, 1994, David\r     Pfister learned about the West Cameron Discovery.  David Pfister\r     immediately tipped his father, Richard Pfister, and his friends, Bartel and\r     Nick Skansi.  Nick Skansi then tipped Nick Skansi Sr., David Skansi,\r     Pharis, and Tan -- Nick Skansi\s father, brother, brother-in-law, and co-\r     worker, respectively.  Nick Skansi and Pharis also tipped Lafont, then a\r     registered representative of Hibernia Investment Services Inc., a\r     registered broker-dealer, who placed orders to purchase FMR securities for\r     himself, Nick Skansi, Pharis, and David Skansi.  Richard Pfister tipped his\r     co-worker, Jandegian.

District Court for the Northern\r     District of California against Francis X. Wazeter, III (Wazeter) of\r     Kalamazoo, Michigan, John W. Howell (Howell) of Sonoma, California, Maria\r     M. Wenner (Wenner) of San Francisco, California and Stanley M. Blanshei of\r     Alamo, California.  Wazeter was the former president of International\r     Research and Development Corporation (IRDC), a Mattawan, Michigan company,\r     and Carme, Inc. (Carme), a Novato, California subsidiary of IRDC.  Howell,\r     Blanshei and Wenner were the former General Manager, Sales Manager and\r     Chief Financial Officer respectively of Carme.  The Complaint alleges that,\r     at the direction of Wazeter, Howell, Blanshei and Wenner booked millions of\r     dollars in fictitious sales to Carme, which were included in the\r     consolidated financial statements of IRDC and resulted in the material\r     overstatement of, among other things, IRDCs accounts receivable, assets,\r     revenues and earnings in periodic reports filed with the Commission by\r     IRDC, which Wazeter signed.  The complaint also alleges that Wazeter lied\r     and caused others to lie to accountants in connection with the audit of\r     IRDCs December 1993 consolidated financial statements and the preparation\r     of periodic reports required to be filed with the Commission.  \r\r          Specifically, the Complaint alleges that the inclusion of these\r     fictitious sales figures in IRDCs consolidated financial statements caused\r     IRDC to overstate its accounts receivable, revenue and/or other assets by a\r     total of more than $3.5 million and its net earnings and earnings per share\r     by 50% to 1800% in IRDCs Forms 10-Q dated June 30, 1993, September 30,\r     1993, March 31, 1994, June 30, 1994 and September 30, 1994 and IRDCs Form\r     10-K for the year ending December 31, 1993.  IRDCs inflated revenue and\r     earnings figures were also included in press releases issued to the public. \r     Thus, the fraudulent scheme conducted by Wazeter, Howell, Blanshei and\r     Wenner resulted in a fraud on the market for IRDC common stock and violated\r     Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act\r     of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2\r     promulgated thereunder.   \r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c"

(IDB), a telecommunications company\r     formerly headquartered in Los Angeles, California, for securities fraud for\r     falsely overstating IDB\s 1994 first quarter earnings and engaging in\r     insider trading.  The Commission\s Complaint also names as a defendant a\r     third former IDB officer, charging him with securities fraud for falsely\r     overstating IDB\s earnings.  The Complaint was filed in Federal Court in\r     Los Angeles.  \r\r          The defendants in the Commission\s action are:\r\r          *    Jeffrey P.

Sudikoff, Cheramy and Wann then\r     publicly disseminated these overstated earnings in a press release and a\r     Form 10-Q quarterly report filed with the Commission.  The Complaint\r     further alleges that Sudikoff, Cheramy and Wann concealed the fraud by\r     fabricating documents, knowingly making false adjusting entries on IDB\s\r     books and records in circumvention of IDB\s internal controls and lying to\r     IDB\s independent auditors.  The Complaint alleges that by this conduct,\r     Sudikoff, Cheramy and Wann violated the antifraud provisions of Section\r     10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-\r     5 thereunder, the reporting provisions of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act\r     and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-13 thereunder, the books and records provisions of\r     Section 13b-5 of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 under the Exchange Act,\r     and the lying to auditors provision of Rule 13b2-2 under the Exchange Act. \r\r          Moreover, the Complaint alleges that Sudikoff and Cheramy engaged in\r     insider trading by selling large blocks of IDB stock in March 1994 and May\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c\r\r\r\r\r\r\r     1994 while in possession of material, nonpublic information that IDB\s\r     first quarter earnings would not meet analysts\ projections and that the\r     announced $15 million earnings had been materially overstated.  The\r     Complaint alleges that Sudikoff and Cheramy avoided losses of $649,000 and\r     $2,212,500, respectively, from their unlawful trading.  The Complaint also\r     alleges that Sudikoff tipped material, nonpublic information concerning\r     IDB\s 1994 first quarter earnings overstatement to his parents, who then\r     sold IDB stock in May 1994 and avoided losses totalling $21,382.  The\r     Complaint alleges that by this conduct, Sudikoff and Cheramy committed\r     securities fraud in violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of\r     1933 and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.   \r\r          Additionally, the Complaint alleges that Sudikoff failed to report his\r     sales to the Commission and that Cheramy failed to report his sales in a\r     timely manner in violation of the stock sale reporting provisions of\r     Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 16a-3 thereunder.\r\r          The Commission\s Complaint, filed in the United States District Court\r     for the Central District of California, seeks permanent injunctions, civil\r     penalties, and officer and director bars against Sudikoff, Cheramy and\r     Wann.

The SEC entered an administrative order the same day barring the\r     firm and president from participating in any penny stock offering, and\r     barring the president from the securities industry.\r\r          The consent decree and administrative order arose out of the SEC\s\r     action, filed on September 29, 1997, in the U.S. District Court for the\r     Southern District of Florida against a Florida promoter and his companies\r     for alleging defrauding Spanish citizens and for filing false financial\r     information with the SEC.

The SEC alleges that Burns is a repeat\r     securities violator previously criminally convicted in Arizona for fraud in\r     connection with the sale of unregistered securities.\r\r          All American Environmental Funding Corporation was a privately-held\r     corporation in the environmental clean-up business Burns formed in November\r     1993.  It is currently in bankruptcy.\r\r          VDS Enterprises, Inc. was a shell corporation incorporated in Delaware\r     in 1985 that later merged with VDS; the SEC alleges that it and VDS were\r     effectively the same entity.\r\r          Diversified Capital Resources, Inc., was an investment banking\r     business headquartered in Miami, Florida.\r\r          Angel Lorie, 54 years of age, resides in Miami, Florida, and was\r     Diversified\s president and sole stockholder.\r\r          According to the SEC\s complaint, Burns, VDS and All American offered\r     and sold $2.7 million worth of VDS stock to citizens of Spain by\r     disseminating fraudulent information, and filed false and misleading\r     financial information with the SEC.  The SEC alleges that investors were\r     told that VDS/All American: (a) had acquired a solid waste collection and\r     disposal business in Venezuela; (b) had anticipated combined annual\r     revenues of $45 to $50 million; (c) held assets of $16,343,371 and\r     shareholder equity of $14,751,412; and (d) held service contracts for $100\r     million worth of environmental clean-up work.

In addition, the Complaint alleges that Burns\\r     background was misrepresented and that his criminal conviction was not\r     disclosed to investors.  The Complaint seeks a permanent injunction against\r     Burns, VDS and All American, as well as disgorgement of ill-gotten profits,\r     civil money penalties and an officer and director bar against Burns.\r\r          The SEC\s Complaint also alleges that Diversified and Lorie recklessly\r     sold VDS stock to the public without being registered as a broker-dealer\r     with the SEC.  On September 30, 1997, the Honorable Kevin Michael Moore,\r     United States District Judge for the Southern District of Florida, entered\r     a consent final judgment against  Diversified and Lorie, permanently\r     enjoining them from recklessly offering or selling securities in violation\r     of Sections 17(a)(2) and  17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933\r     (Securities Act) and from acting as unregistered broker-dealers in\r     violation of Section 15(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934\r     (Exchange Act).  Disgorgement was waived and money penalties were not\r     imposed due to Diversified\s and Lorie\s demonstrated financial inability\r     to pay.\r\r          On the same day as the consent final judgment was entered, September\r     30, 1997, the SEC entered an administrative order against Diversified and\r     Lorie, by consent, pursuant to which they agreed to be barred from\r     participating in any penny stock offering.

JOHN PATRICK BRINK\r     CF #97-1233, Harris County District Court No. 208\r                 \r          On September 26, 1997, John Patrick Brink was indicted by a grand jury\r     in Harris County, Texas, on two counts of securities fraud and two counts\r     of misapplication of fiduciary funds. Brink was charged with failure to\r     disclose material information to investors who purchased units in ventures\r     sponsored by Energy Service Co., Inc., including, among other things,\r     information that investors\ funds were used for purposes unrelated to those\r     for which they had invested, and that the company had insufficient funds to\r     pay back investment funds owed to previous investors.\r\r          The indictments are based on activities alleged against Brink in a\r     civil action brought by the Commission on March 27, 1997, in United States\r     District Court, Houston, against Enserco, Inc., d/b/a Energy Service\r     Company, Brink, Anthony J. Leo and Frank Bravo, Jr. The Commission\s\r     complaint alleges, among other things, that the defendants raised\r     approximately $3.6 million from investors for the purpose of purchasing oil\r     field equipment and pipe. Enserco was to resell the equipment and return a\r     portion of the profits to investors. In fact, according to the complaint,\r     Brink operated an undisclosed Ponzi scheme whereby monies contributed by\r     new investors were paid as purported profits to previous investors.\r     Further, the complaint alleges that Brink misappropriated investors\ funds.\r     The Commission\s action is continuing. \r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c"

James G. Hanley, \r     Civil Action No. 1:97CV02307(SS) (D.D.C.)\r\r          The SEC today filed a civil action in the United States District Court\r     for the District of Columbia seeking a permanent injunction and a civil\r     money penalty of $25,000 against James G. Hanley of Newport Beach,\r     California.  Hanley was formerly the Vice-President of Operations of\r     Pinnacle Micro, Inc., an Irvine, California-based manufacturer of optical\r     disk drives.  The Complaint alleges that certain Pinnacle employees\r     including Hanley engaged in certain improper accounting practices that\r     violated generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and caused\r     Pinnacle materially to overstate its sales and earnings reported in\r     financial statements contained in certain annual and quarterly reports\r     filed with the SEC.  \r\r          Specifically, the Complaint alleges that, on April 18, 1995, Pinnacle\r     amended its annual report to restate its financial statements for the\r     quarter and year ended December 31, 1993.  Pinnacle reduced fourth quarter\r     net income from $652,000 to a loss of ($804,000) and year-end net income\r     from $2.6 million to $1.6 million.  The restatements were due principally\r     to Pinnacle improperly recording revenue in its year ended December 31,\r     1993 from products shipped after the close of the year-end (post-period\r     shipments).\r\r          The Complaint alleges that, in order for Pinnacle to meet its year-end\r     sales targets, Hanley circumvented Pinnacles system of internal accounting\r     controls or caused certain of the companys financial books and records to\r     be falsified in that he supervised the shipping department s improper post-\r     period shipments.  The Complaint alleges that, in order for Pinnacle to\r     improperly recognize revenue for post-period shipments, the shipping\r     department, among other things, predated packing lists, shipping records,\r     and invoices to conceal that the shipments actually occurred after the end\r     of the reporting period.\r\r          In addition, the Complaint alleges that Hanley, among others,\r     participated in Pinnacle s inconsistent accounting for sales of certain\r     electronic chips in order to meet Pinnacle s sales target in the third\r     quarter ended September 30, 1993.  The Complaint further alleges that\r     Hanley failed to disclose to Pinnacles independent auditor both Pinnacles\r     improper post-period shipments and inconsistent recording of revenue from\r     the electronic chips sales. \r\r          Hanley, without admitting or denying the allegations of the Complaint,\r     consented to the entry of a Final Judgment permanently enjoining him from\r     violating Section 13(b)(5) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c\r\r\r\r\r\r\r     (Exchange Act) and Rules 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder and ordering him to\r     pay a $25,000 civil money penalty.\r\r          In a related administrative proceeding, the SEC also entered a cease-\r     and-desist order against Pinnacle, Scott A. Blum, formerly the Executive\r     Vice-President of Sales, and Lilia Craig, formerly the Vice-President of\r     Finance.  The cease-and-desist order finds that Pinnacle (a) improperly\r     recorded revenue from post-period shipments after the close of its December\r     31, 1993 financial reporting period; (b) inconsistently accounted for sales\r     of the electronic chips in its third quarter ended September 30, 1993; and\r     (c) capitalized certain non-recurring engineering expenditures that should\r     have been charged to expense as research and development costs in its third\r     quarter ended September 30, 1995. The order also finds that Blum caused the\r     improper post-period shipments, in that Blum was aware of Pinnacle s post-\r     period shipments and failed to take any steps to terminate the practice. \r     The order also finds that Blum suggested the use of, and failed to inform\r     Pinnacle s independent auditor about, the inconsistent accounting for sales\r     of the electronic chips.  Lastly, the order finds that Craig failed to\r     inform Pinnacle s independent auditor about Pinnacle s post-period\r     shipments. \r\r          Without admitting or denying the allegations in the order, Pinnacle\r     consented to cease and desist from violations of Sections 13(a),\r     13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1,\r     and 13a-13 thereunder; Blum consented to cease and desist from causing\r     violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange\r     Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder, and Blum and Craig both\r     consented to cease and desist from violations of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-2.\r     [Release No. 34-39194; AAER 975]\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 2======\r\x0c"

Bishop was taken into custody at the September 29, 1997,\r     hearing on the Commission\s motion for judgment of civil contempt.  On\r     October 1, 1997, Judge Schwartz issued an Order Granting Motion By\r     Plaintiff Securities And Exchange Commission For Judgment Of Civil Contempt\r     Against Defendant Jay R.

Thereafter, Gurino secretly took over\r     control of Atratech, which allowed Atratech to fraudulently obtain\r     approximately $18 million in public works contracts that it would not\r     otherwise have been able to obtain.

Beckwith, United States District Judge for the\r     Southern District of Ohio, Western Division, entered a Final Judgment\r     against defendant Mark E. Gatch.  Gatch, a resident of Amelia, Ohio, was a\r     co-founder, president, and chief financial officer of Ben Mar Investments,\r     Inc. (Ben Mar), a defunct unregistered investment adviser based in\r     Florence, Kentucky.  \r\r          The Commission\s complaint, filed on June 25, 1997, alleges, among\r     other things, that, from February 1992 through March 1995, Gatch and his\r     partner, Henry Benjamin Schmidt, conducted a Ponzi scheme through Ben Mar. \r     The Complaint alleges that Gatch and Schmidt illegally raised approximately\r     $19.5 million from at least 365 investors by selling unregistered\r     promissory notes that promised interest based on the performance of an\r     investment pool managed by Ben Mar (the Ben Mar Fund).  The Complaint\r     further alleges that, in connection with this Ponzi scheme and otherwise,\r     Gatch made material misrepresentations and omitted material facts to Ben\r     Mar Fund investors and other advisory clients of Ben Mar, illegally sold\r     unregistered securities of Ben Mar (the promissory notes), and failed to\r     comply with the registration and custody provisions of the Investment\r     Advisers Act of 1940.  Gatch, who previously pleaded guilty to criminal\r     wire fraud based upon some of the same conduct alleged by the Commission\s\r     Complaint, is currently serving a five-year prison sentence.  See United\r     States v. Mark E. Gatch, Case No. 96-90 (WOB) (E.D.

The Final Judgment does not impose a\r     civil penalty against Gatch, based on his demonstrated inability to pay\r     such a penalty.  (In the criminal action, Gatch was ordered to pay\r     restitution of $12,566,595.49.) \r\r          Gatch consented to the entry of the Final Judgment without admitting\r     or denying the allegations in the Commission\s complaint.

The Commission\s complaint also\r     alleges that some of the funds that Perez stole were deposited into a bank\r     account in Ayendez\s name.\r\r          Perez, 49 years old, is a resident of Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico. \r     Ayendez operates Agencia Hipica, an off track betting service in Caparra,\r     Puerto Rico.\r\r          The Commission\s complaint charges Perez with violations of the\r     antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically, Section\r     17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the\r     Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Among other things, the Commission seeks\r     preliminary and permanent injunctions against Perez prohibiting further\r     violations of the antifraud provisions, and requests that Perez and Ayendez\r     disgorge their ill-gotten proceeds and that Perez pay a civil monetary\r     penalty for his misconduct.  \r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c"

It is alleged that the\r     Defendants were operating a Ponzi-like scheme whereby the source of\r     distributions to investors, although represented to be oil and gas\r     revenues, in fact is mostly other investor monies.  Additionally, the\r     Defendants in some cases do not own the oil and gas wells they claim to\r     own.

Gary W. Berus, Patricia S. Gale,\r     Robert W. Harper and Nancy A. Swoffer, (United States District Court for\r     the Eastern District of Michigan, Civil Action No. 96-CV-74524)\r\r          The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on October 3,\r     1997, Judge Nancy G. Edmunds of the United States District Court for the\r     Eastern District of Michigan entered an Order of Permanent Injunction\r     (Order) against Patricia S. Gale (Gale) enjoining her from further\r     violations of Sections 17(a)(1), 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities\r     Act of 1933, Sections 10(b), 15(a)(1) and 15(c)(1) of the Securities\r     Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 15c1-2 promulgated thereunder and\r     ordering  disgorgement in the amount of $39,939.29, including prejudgment\r     interest, and civil penalties.  The Court will set the specific amount of\r     civil penalties in a subsequent hearing.  However, since Gale has filed for\r     bankruptcy in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of\r     Michigan, the Commission will not seek to enforce the obligation of Gale to\r     pay disgorgement or civil penalties except in accordance with the United\r     States Bankruptcy Code.  Gale consented, without admitting or denying the\r     allegations in the Commission\s complaint, to the entry of the Order.\r\r          The Complaint, filed on September 30, 1996, alleged, among other\r     things, that during the period from 1990 through 1994, Gale, as one of two\r     salespersons for two promoters, participated in a scheme whereby a total of\r     approximately 120 investors were defrauded through the offer and sale of\r     over $3 million in securities.  Specifically, Gale offered and sold\r     fictitious certificates of deposit (CDs) issued by a purported\r     international bank, Century Security Bank and Trust, Ltd. (Century\r     Security).  Furthermore, in two separate scams, Gale sold interests in two\r     investment clubs, the Profit Masters Group (Profit Masters) and Meca\r     International, Inc. (Meca).\r\r          In connection therewith, Gale told CD investors that they were\r     purchasing variable rate CDs issued by a legitimate bank, with their money\r     to be used by Century Security to finance various business ventures.  The\r     CDs were portrayed as safe investments with significant rates of returns. \r     Investment club investors were told that their funds would be pooled to\r     purchase common stocks.  Depending on the investment scam, investors were\r     promised annual returns ranging from 8% to 24%.  As a result, investors\r     were persuaded to sell legitimate, conservative investments to finance\r     their Century Security, Profit Masters and/or Meca investments.\r\r          However, Gale never conducted any investigation into the accuracy of\r     the above representations regarding Century Security, Profit Masters or\r     Meca, but instead simply reiterated the promoters\ representations.  In\r     reality, Century Security, Profit \r\r                                        - 2 -\r\r\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c\r\r\r\r\r\r     Masters and Meca were operated as three separate ponzi schemes.  In each\r     of the three schemes, investor money was deposited into brokerage accounts,\r     bank accounts and a credit union account, all of which were controlled by\r     the promoters.  Undisclosed to investors, the promoters then used investor\r     funds to pay personal and business expenses, to make payments to prior\r     investors and to unsuccessfully trade in speculative investments, including\r     commodity futures and options.  Consequently, returns to existing investors\r     were dependent upon the ability of the promoters to continually raise\r     additional funds from new investors.  Furthermore, in contravention to\r     Gale\s representations, Century Security was not even a legitimate banking\r     operation.  Finally, Gale failed to disclose to investors the commissions\r     she received from the sale of the above investments.  Thus, in connection\r     with the offer, purchase and sale of securities, misrepresentations and\r     omissions of material fact were made regarding the legitimacy of the\r     investments, the returns to be expected, the risks involved, the\r     commissions received and the use of investor proceeds.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 2======\r\x0c"

September 30, 1997)\r\r          The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on September 30,\r     1997, it filed a Complaint in the United States District Court for the\r     Northern District of Illinois against Bruce Van Wagner (Van Wagner),\r     Jocelyn Van Wagner, Peter Van Wagner, Mary Jane Reed, Laurey Van Wagner,\r     Ellis Van Wagner, Mark Van Wagner, Carol Gwaltney, Barbara Blanchard, and\r     Dudley Blanchard, and naming Donald Gwaltney and Jane Gwaltney as relief\r     defendants.  The Complaint alleges that Bruce Van Wagner, a resident of\r     Lake Forest, Illinois and formerly Chairman of the Board of Antec\r     Corporation, and his wife, Jocelyn Van Wagner, illegally passed material\r     non-public information regarding Antec to five of their children, Peter Van\r     Wagner, Mary Jane Reed, Laurey Van Wagner, Ellis Van Wagner and Mark Van\r     Wagner,  and three of their neighbors, Carol Gwaltney, Barbara Blanchard\r     and Dudley Blanchard, all of whom traded while in possession of that\r     information.  Van Wagner was Chairman of Antec, a publicly-held company\r     based in Rolling Meadows, Illinois, from 1993 until February 1997, and is\r     currently a member of Antec s Board of Directors.  The Complaint alleges\r     that all ten defendants violated the antifraud provisions of the Securities\r     Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934\r     (Exchange Act).  The Complaint seeks the entry of a final order of\r     permanent injunction against each of the ten defendants, disgorgement of\r     the traders  ill-gotten gains and civil penalties.\r\r          In its Complaint, the Commission alleges that Antec issued a press\r     release on June 9, 1995, announcing that its second quarter earnings would\r     be significantly short of analysts  expectations. On the day of the\r     announcement, the stock dropped $8.00 per share, or 34%, from its previous\r     day s close of $23.50 per share. The Commission alleges that Van Wagner\r     learned of the potential shortfall in earnings on our about June 1, 1995\r     and that he passed this confidential non-public information to his wife\r     Jocelyn Van Wagner.  The Complaint further alleges that, between June 1 and\r     June 9, Van Wagner and Jocelyn Van Wagner tipped five of their children and\r     three of their neighbors, all of whom sold Antec stock within the four days\r     prior to the June 9 press release, thereby avoiding a total of\r     approximately $75,000 in losses.

According to the\r     complaint, the defendants told investors that the oil and gas prospects\r     presented minimal risks, that the wells would produce investment returns of\r     more than 40% per annum for periods as long as 25 years, and that their\r     entire investment would be returned in less than two years.

Blacher (Blacher), from\r     offering or selling promissory notes in what the SEC alleges to be an\r     elaborate Ponzi scheme.  The preliminary injunction enjoins the defendants\r     from violating the registration and anti-fraud provisions of the federal\r     securities laws, namely Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act\r     of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange\r     Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Orders of Preliminary Injunction also\r     continue the freeze of defendants\ assets.  The defendants consented to the\r     Court\s actions.\r\r          On October 8, 1997, the Commission filed a complaint against Medco and\r     Blacher, among others, seeking emergency relief.  On October 9, 1997, the\r     Court entered a temporary restraining order and asset freeze against the\r     defendants.  The Court also appointed a receiver who immediately secured\r     Medco\s premises and is now in possession of Medco\s office and its books\r     and records.\r\r          According to the SEC\s complaint, the defendants made material\r     misrepresentations and omissions in connection with their sale of at least\r     $16 million in promissory notes to the investing public.  The notes\r     promised investors returns of between 12% to 16% annually, depending upon\r     the amount of the investment and maturity of the note.  The complaint\r     further alleges that Medco represented to investors that the notes were\r     collateralized by used medical equipment which Medco purchased and then\r     leased out to end-users such as doctors and clinics.  According to the\r     SEC\s allegations, Medco is leasing only a fraction of the medical\r     equipment it has claimed to be leasing.  In fact, the SEC contends that one\r     lessee, which purportedly was leasing medical equipment securing $1.6\r     million of investor funds, was a fictitious entity created by Blacher that\r     had no leases, office space or real business.  The SEC also contends that\r     Medco significantly over-valued the medical equipment purportedly\r     collateralizing investor funds.  The SEC\s complaint further alleges that\r     Blacher lied about his professional background and that of Medco\s.  The\r     SEC also alleges that Medco wired at least $250,000 of investor funds to an\r     off-shore bank account in Luxembourg.      \r\r          In addition to a permanent injunction, the SEC\s action also seeks\r     disgorgement of ill-gotten profits against the defendants and money\r     penalties against Blacher.\r\r\r          Named as relief defendants in the Commission\s lawsuit were The Hi\r     Lily Company and Nationwide Health Services, Inc.

ROY HANDOJO, Civil Action No. 97-Civ. \r     6805 (S.D.N.Y.)  (LAP)\r\r     On October 20, 1997, the Commission filed an amended complaint in its\r     insider trading case against Roy Handojo ( Handojo ) in the United States\r     District Court for the Southern District of New York.  The amended\r     complaint alleges that Handojo, an Indonesian national and visiting analyst\r     formerly employed in the Financial Institutions Group at J.P. Morgan & Co.,\r     Inc. s New York office ( J.P. Morgan ), engaged in flagrant insider trading\r     in five companies involved in four separate merger negotiations in which\r     J.P. Morgan s Financial Institutions Group was participating as an adviser. \r     From July through September 1997, in each of the merger transactions,\r     Handojo purchased securities days before the companies publicly announced\r     that they had entered into definitive merger agreements.  Handojo reaped\r     more than $477,000 in profits from his trades.  The Commission s complaint\r     alleges that Handojo violated Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange\r     Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks injunctive relief and\r     disgorgement.\r\r     The amended complaint alleges that, without any prior trading experience,\r     the 25 year old Hondojo purchased 6,209 shares of the common stock of\r     Signet Banking Corp., a J.P. Morgan client, less than a week before the\r     July 21, 1997 announcement of Signet s acquisition by First Union Corp. \r     Handojo realized approximately $90,000 in profits when he later sold the\r     stock.  He also bought 12,500 shares of ACC Consumer Finance Corp. common\r     stock several days before the August 25, 1997 announcement that Household\r     International, another J.P. Morgan client, would acquire ACC by merger. \r     ACC s stock soared 34% on the day of the announcement, and Handojo sold his\r     entire position for approximately $60,000 in profits.  In addition, in the\r     three days prior to the August 29, 1997 announcement of NationsBank\r     Corporation s acquisition of Barnett Banks, Inc., a J.P. Morgan client,\r     Handojo purchased 280 Barnett call options, 80 call options in NationsBank,\r     and 500 shares of stock in each bank.  In the week following the\r     announcement, which caused a 24% surge in Barnett s stock price, Handojo\r     sold all his Barnett shares and call options for a total profit of more\r     than $214,000.  Finally, in the two weeks before the September 15, 1997\r     announcement that Star Banc Corp. would acquire Great Financial Corp.,\r     Handojo purchased 21,900 shares of Great Financial common stock.  At the\r     time of Handojo s purchases, J.P. Morgan was acting as an adviser to an\r     Ohio-based bank holding company in its competing effort to acquire Great\r     Financial.  Handojo still holds 17,800 of his Great Financial shares. \r     Based on Great Financial s closing price three days after the news\r     announcement, the total profits Handojo reaped from his trading is more\r     than $115,000.  Although the Commission was aware of Handojo s purchases of\r     Great Financial at the time it filed its original complaint on September\r     12, 1997, the Commission excluded those purchases from the complaint\r     because the merger negotiations were still nonpublic.\r\r     On September 12, 1997, the Court ordered a temporary freeze of the assets\r     in defendant s brokerage and bank accounts, and granted the Commission\r     expedited discovery and other ancillary relief.  A preliminary injunction\r     hearing is scheduled for October 29, 1997.  The Commission s investigation\r     is continuing.

DAVID SCOTT HEREDIA  CV-97-6091\r\r          The Securities and Exchange Commission announced the filing of a\r     complaint (Complaint) in the United States District Court for the Eastern\r     District of New York against David Scott Heredia (Heredia), a former\r     registered representative at Stratton Oakmont, Inc. (Stratton), seeking\r     to permanently enjoin Heredia from violating the antifraud provisions of\r     the federal securities laws, and seeking disgorgement, plus prejudgment\r     interest, and civil penalties from the defendant.  Heredia is 26 years old\r     and currently resides in Orlando, Florida.\r\r          Stratton is a now defunct broker-dealer which had previously been a\r     defendant and respondent in several Commission enforcement actions.  These\r     actions alleged, in part, that several of Stratton\s registered\r     representatives were engaging in fraudulent high-pressure boiler-room sales\r     practices, including making baseless price predictions and material\r     misrepresentations and omissions regarding certain over-the-counter\r     securities, and/or encouraging or permitting unauthorized trading in\r     Stratton customer accounts.  According to the Complaint, from at least May\r     1994 through at least February 21, 1995, Heredia, while a registered\r     representative at Stratton, repeatedly and fraudulently made material\r     misrepresentations and omitted to disclose material facts to customers in\r     an effort to solicit securities transactions.  The Complaint alleges that\r     Heredia made baseless price predictions to at least two customers regarding\r     the securities of companies for which Stratton had underwritten the initial\r     public offerings, including, but not limited to, the securities of Octagon,\r     Inc., Select Media Communications, Inc. and/or United Leisure Corporation. \r     The Complaint further alleges that Heredia made several unauthorized\r     purchases of these securities, in the accounts of at least two customers,\r     and that Heredia fraudulently claimed to possess material nonpublic\r     information about several of the companies listed above, and failed to\r     execute customer sell orders.  As a result of his fraudulent activities,\r     Heredia\s customers suffered total losses of at least $250,000 and Heredia\r     earned approximately $6,500 in commissions.

Bradbury also failed to disclose\r     material conflicts of interest with respect to certain investments,\r     recommended unsuitable investments, and acted as an unregistered broker-\r     dealer.  Many of Bradbury\s victims were retirees and other persons of\r     limited means, many of whom met Bradbury through an evangelical church\r     group.  The investments are now worthless.\r\r          The Commission also announced that on October 27, 1997, it\r     simultaneously instituted and settled administrative proceedings against\r     Bradbury and BFG.

According to the Commission\s complaint,\r     Perez misappropriated money on at least twenty-one separate occasions (i)\r     by falsely endorsing checks written to or by his customers or (ii) by\r     fraudulently inducing his customers to endorse checks to him.   The\r     complaint alleges that Perez lied to his customers (i) by telling them that\r     they needed to provide additional funds to cover margin debts, which did\r     not in fact exist; (ii) by falsely telling them he would use their money to\r     buy investments; and (iii) in at least one instance, by falsely telling an\r     investor that he would use the funds to open an investment account for the\r     investor.  The Commission\s complaint also alleges that some of the funds\r     that Perez stole were deposited into a bank account in Mestres\ name.\r\r          Perez, 49 years old, is a resident of Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico. \r     Mestres operates Agencia Hipica, an off track betting service in Caparra,\r     Puerto Rico.\r\r          The Commission\s complaint charges Perez with violations of the\r     antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically, Section\r     17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the\r     Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Hammer (Hammer), the former CEO, and Joseph Letzelter,\r     Jr. (Letzelter), the former controller, of Sheffield Industries, Inc., a\r     bankrupt manufacturing company which had been based in Miami, Florida.  The\r     Commissions complaint alleged that between June 1991 and January 1993,\r     Hammer and Letzelter perpetrated a massive fraud on Sheffields investors\r     by maintaining two sets of books and by filing materially false financial\r     reports with the Commission on Sheffields behalf.\r\r     The complaint alleged that six of Sheffields SEC filings, which Hammer\r     signed, overstated accounts receivable and inventory by as much as 40%, and\r     falsely stated that Sheffield had complied with a critical loan covenant\r     from a principal lender when, in fact, it was in default thereunder. \r     Hammer, with Letzelters assistance, orchestrated the scheme by causing\r     Sheffield to keep two sets of books and records: a secret set which\r     accurately reflected the companys deteriorating financial condition, and a\r     public set which fraudulently overstated the companys financial condition. \r     Thus, the complaint alleged that Sheffield, through Hammer, Letzelter and\r     others, failed to make and keep books and records which accurately\r     reflected Sheffields financial and accounting transactions, and failed to\r     maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide\r     assurances that accounting transactions were recorded as necessary to\r     permit the proper preparation of financial statements in conformity with\r     generally accepted accounting principles.\r\r     The complaint also alleged that Hammer announced in a newswire report that\r     he anticipated revenues for Sheffield for the fiscal year ended 1992 to be\r     approximately $36 million, with anticipated net profits of approximately\r     $.75 per share on 2.6 million average shares outstanding (or approximately\r     $1.95 million in net profits.)  However, on December 17, 1992, Sheffield\r     reported losses of $1,800,000.

The\r     Commission\s complaint alleges, among other things, that the defendants\r     raised about $51.4 million from at least 3,750 investors through their\r     fraudulent scheme.  Amtel sold pay telephones to investors and agreed to\r     lease the pay telephones from the investor for a five year term for $50 per\r     month.

Massachusetts, filed October 30, 1997). \r\r          The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today the filing of a\r     Complaint against Bond Dellapp Fletcher (Fletcher), the owner and\r     president of Mediajet, Inc. (Mediajet), for aiding and abetting the\r     financial fraud conducted by Emanuel Pinez (Pinez) and Centennial\r     Technologies, Inc. (Centennial).  Mediajet, a manufacturer of font\r     cartridges for laser printers and located in Beverly, Massachusetts, is\r     also named as a defendant in the lawsuit.  The Complaint alleges that, from\r     January 1996 through January 1997, Fletcher caused Mediajet to create false\r     records and engage in several acts calculated to enable Centennial to\r     include more than $3 million in phony revenue in its reported financial\r     results.  According to the Complaint, Fletcher engaged in this fraudulent\r     conduct at the request of Pinez, the former CEO of Centennial.  In return\r     for the participation of Fletcher and Mediajet in Centennial\s fraud, Pinez\r     gave Fletcher at least 260,000 shares of Centennial common stock.  Fletcher\r     subsequently sold those shares for $6,834,184.  The Complaint also alleges\r     that Pinez made loans to Fletcher and Mediajet totaling $190,000.\r\r          According to the Complaint, Centennial and Pinez engaged in a\r     fraudulent scheme to defraud investors in Centennial stock by falsely\r     overstating the company\s revenues and profits.  Defendants Fletcher and\r     Mediajet aided and abetted Centennial\s scheme by, among other things,\r     fabricating fictitious purchase orders, signing backdated sales orders\r     falsely acknowledging receipt of products from Centennial, accepting\r     shipment of mock and/or obsolete computer equipment, and using Centennial\s\r     funds to purchase treasurers checks, payable to Centennial, on behalf of\r     purported Centennial customers.  For example, in January 1997, Fletcher, at\r     Pinez\s request, signed and backdated fictitious Centennial sales orders\r     totaling $1,250,000.  Fletcher, according to the Complaint, was\r     acknowledging receipt of Centennial products for Mediajet and two other\r     Centennial customers, when, in fact, the only goods shipped were holiday\r     fruit baskets. \r\r          The Complaint alleges that Fletcher and Mediajet aided and abetted\r     Centennial\s violations of several antifraud and reporting provisions of\r     the securities laws.

ANDREW S. LANE, JACK LANE, JACK O.\r     SCHER, DEBORAH S. GAMES, CRAIG L. SAMPSON, BRUCE SAMPSON, and TRACY ANN\r     STODDART, 97 Civ. 8144.       \r\r          The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) today filed an\r     insider trading complaint against Andrew S. Lane (Lane), 34, and Jack\r     Lane, 69, of Stamford, Connecticut; Jack Scher, 70, of Faber, Virginia;\r     Deborah S. Games, 29, of Greenwich, Connecticut; Craig L. Sampson, 43, of\r     White Plains, New York; Bruce Sampson, 70, of Trumbull, Connecticut; and\r     Tracy Ann Stoddart, 36, of Santa Fe, New Mexico.  The Commission\s\r     Complaint charges the defendants with insider trading and/or tipping others\r     to trade in the securities of The MEDSTAT Group, Inc. (Medstat) in\r     advance of a tender offer for Medstat by The Thomson Corporation\r     (Thomson).  Simultaneous with the filing of the Complaint, Andrew and\r     Jack Lane, Scher, Games and Craig and Bruce Sampson consented to the entry\r     of permanent injunctions against them and agreed to pay a total of\r     $888,665.67 in disgorgement of illegal profits, prejudgment interest and\r     penalties, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission\s\r     complaint.  \r\r          According to the Commission\s Complaint, by at least August 1, 1994,\r     Lane, who was then the Director of Finance at Thomson Business Information,\r     a Thomson operating group, learned of Thomson\s plans to acquire Medstat. \r     The Complaint alleges that from August 1 through November 14 Lane bought a\r     total of 3,000 shares of Medstat in a series of small purchases.  The\r     Complaint also alleges that Lane tipped his father Jack Lane, his family\r     friend Scher, his then-roommate Games, his former girlfriend Stoddart, and\r     his friend Craig Sampson concerning the planned tender offer.  The\r     Complaint further alleges that Craig Sampson tipped his father Bruce\r     Sampson.\r\r          As to Scher, the Complaint alleges that Lane communicated with Scher\r     approximately 12 times as the Medstat-Thomson deal unfolded, tipped him\r     concerning the planned tender offer and that at propitious times in the\r     course of the negotiations Scher bought Medstat stock for himself and\r     recommended it to others.  Specifically, the Complaint alleges that Scher\r     bought a total of 6,500 shares of Medstat for himself in three\r     transactions, first in August, and again on two occasions in October when\r     the deal negotiations intensified after a brief hiatus.  The Complaint\r     further alleges that while in possession of material nonpublic information\r     he obtained from Lane, Scher recommended Medstat as an investment to a\r     total of 21 family members, friends and colleagues with sufficient fervor\r     to induce each of them to purchase Medstat, and that four of Scher\s\r     friends and colleagues passed his Medstat recommendation to others who also\r     bought Medstat.  In all, the Complaint alleges that 37 persons trading\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c\r\r\r\r\r\r\r     directly or indirectly on Scher\s recommendation bought a total of\r     approximately 34,000 shares of Medstat.  \r\r          As to Lane\s other tippees the Complaint alleges that: Jack Lane\r     bought 500 shares of Medstat; that Games bought a total of 3,250 shares of\r     Medstat, 1,650 of which she sold at a profit before the tender offer\r     announcement; that Stoddart bought a total of 1906 shares of Medstat for\r     herself 700 of which she sold before the tender offer announcement, and\r     that she recommended Medstat to a family member who bought 235 shares; and\r     that Craig Sampson passed the material nonpublic information he received\r     from Lane to his father Bruce Sampson, who bought 1,500 shares of Medstat. \r\r\r          The Complaint alleges that as a result of their insider trading and\r     tipping, each of the defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the\r     Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3\r     thereunder.  As relief it seeks a permanent injunction against future\r     violations of these provisions, and an order requiring defendants to\r     disgorge their illegal trading profits plus prejudgment interest and to pay\r     civil penalties.\r\r          Simultaneously with the filing of the Complaint, five of the six\r     defendants consented to the entry of final judgments against them without\r     admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint.  Each of the\r     settling defendants consented to the entry of the requested injunction. \r     Scher agreed to disgorge all of his own trading profits and those of the 37\r     persons whose trades resulted directly or indirectly from his\r     recommendations, together with prejudgment interest for a total of\r     $511,334.99.  Scher also agreed to pay a penalty of $282,924, equal to the\r     his own profits and those of the 21 persons to whom he directly recommended\r     Medstat.  Lane agreed to disgorge $71,712.56, representing his own profits\r     and other trading profits, not otherwise disgorged, that he is responsible\r     for, with all but $50,000 waived in light of his demonstrated inability to\r     pay based on his sworn representations in his statement of financial\r     condition.  Jack Lane agreed to disgorge his profits together with\r     prejudgment interest in the total amount of $7,664.86, and to pay a civil\r     penalty equal to his profits of $6,000.82.  Bruce Sampson agreed to\r     disgorge his profits together with prejudgment interest in the amount of\r     $17,242.13 and to pay a civil penalty equal to his profits of $13,498.87. \r     Games agreed to disgorge her profits of $17,814.42, which amount is waived\r     in light of her demonstrated inability to pay based on her sworn\r     representations in her statement of financial condition.  \r\r          This is the Commission\s second enforcement action alleging insider\r     trading in advance of the November 16, 1994 announcement of a tender offer\r     for Medstat.  See SEC v. William J. Rauwerdink, (S.D.N.Y.), Lit.

Gersh (United States District Court for the\r     District of Massachusetts, 97CR10277(RGS), filed October 10/23/97)\r      \r          On October 23, 1997, the United States Attorney for the District of\r     Massachusetts filed an Information charging that, between January 1990 and\r     July 1995, Robert D. Gersh (Gersh), of Burlington, Massachusetts,\r     misappropriated over $4 million in investor moneys that had been entrusted\r     to two corporations under his control, Boston Municipal Securities, Inc.\r     (BMS) and Devonshire Escrow and Transfer Corp. (Devonshire).  Gersh was\r     charged with ten counts of Interstate Transportation of Stolen Property. \r     If convicted, Gersh faces a maximum sentence of ten years in prison for\r     each count of the Information. \r\r          The Information involves essentially the same underlying facts that\r     were the subject of a November 25, 1995 Commission complaint filed against\r     Gersh, BMS and Devonshire.  The Information charges that, in 1990 and 1991,\r     Gersh, acting through BMS and Devonshire, marketed and sold over $14\r     million of five-year Certificates of Participation (COPs) to investors. \r     Under the terms of the COPs, investor money was to be invested in pools of\r     equipment leases entered into by state and local governments.  According to\r     the Information, although a large share of the investors\ money was\r     initially invested in state and municipal lease obligations, many of the\r     states and municipalities paid off their leases within one or two years. \r     Those payments returned millions of dollars to BMS and Devonshire. \r     According to the Information, Gersh was required either to return the money\r     to investors or to reinvest it in safe, highly-liquid securities.  Instead,\r     Gersh used approximately $4 million of the COPs money to finance various\r     business ventures in his own name, including a medical billing company, a\r     Judaica book store, several kitchen supply stores, and a model airplane and\r     ship distributorship.  According to the Information, Gersh covered up his\r     diversion of the COPs funds by using some of the money to make semiannual\r     interest payments to investors, leading them to believe that their\r     principal investment was safe and sound.\r\r          The Commission\s complaint, filed on November 29, 1995, alleged that\r     the defendants had conducted a fraudulent offering of $14 million in COPs. \r     On March 20, 1997, the Honorable Reginald C. Lindsay of the U.S. District\r     Court for the District of Massachusetts enjoined Gersh, BMS and Devonshire\r     from further violations of certain antifraud provisions of the securities\r     laws.  Gersh, BMS and Devonshire consented to the injunctive orders without\r     admitting or denying the complaint\s allegations.  Gersh was also ordered\r     to disgorge $7,451,935, plus prejudgment interest thereon, provided,\r     however, that payment of $5,949,185 of such amount, plus the prejudgment\r     interest, was waived based on his demonstrated inability to pay.\r\r          The complaint alleged violations of the antifraud provisions of\r     Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c\r\r\r\r\r\r\r     promulgated thereunder and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and\r     sought a temporary restraining order, preliminary and permanent\r     injunctions, disgorgement, civil monetary penalties and an asset freeze and\r     other equitable relief.  On November 30, 1995, the Court issued a temporary\r     restraining order and asset freeze against the defendants.  In addition, on\r     December 11, 1995, the Court granted the Commission\s motion for\r     appointment of a receiver to take control of the assets of the corporate\r     and relief defendants, and those assets are being operated by the receiver\r     for the benefit of investors.  On January 12, 1996, after a hearing, Judge\r     Lindsay granted the Commission\s request for a preliminary injunction\r     against the defendants.\r\r          On April 1, 1997, the Commission announced the entry of an order\r     instituting administrative proceedings against Gersh and the simultaneous\r     acceptance of his offer of settlement.  Gersh was barred from the\r     securities industry.\r\r          For further information, See Litigation Release Nos. 14742, 14785 and\r     15310, and Rel. Nos. 34-38459 and IA-1626.\r\x0c"

November 5, 1997)\r\r          On November 5, 1997, the Commission filed an action in federal\r     district court against a former compliance officer of Bankers Trust\r     Securities Corp. and four other individuals, alleging that they engaged in\r     a scheme to purchase the securities of Caesars World, Inc. just before the\r     public announcement on December 19, 1994, that ITT Corp. was making a\r     tender offer for Caesars.  The complaint alleges that the illegal insider\r     trading yielded profits of $458,200.\r\r          According to the complaint, defendant Alan Stricoff learned of the\r     proposed tender offer in the course of his employment as\r     assistant vice president in the compliance department of Bankers\r     Trust Securities, a registered broker dealer.  Bankers Trust\r     Securities served as a financial advisor to ITT in the tender\r     offer and its parent, Bankers Trust New York Corporation, served\r     as ITTs investment banker.  According to the complaint, Bankers Trust\r     Securities discharged Alan Stricoff in January 1995.  \r\r          The Commission alleged that in breach of his duty of trust\r     and confidence to his employer, Alan Stricoff directly or indirectly tipped\r     his brother, the defendant Jeffrey Stricoff, his father-in-law, the\r     defendant Marvin Stone, his brother-in-law, the defendant Todd Stone, and\r     Todd Stones close friend, the defendant Daniel M. Porush, each of whom\r     then purchased Caesars call option contracts shortly before the tender\r     offer was announced.  Porush was the president of Stratton Oakmont Inc., a\r     broker-dealer based in Lake Success, N.Y.\r\r          According to the complaint, the price of the Caesars call options\r     increased by about $16 a share following the annoucement of the tender\r     offer, and the defendants subsequent sales brought profits of $83,350 for\r     Jeffrey Stricoff, $30,850 for Marvin Stone, $157,000 for Todd Stone, and\r     $157,000 for Porush.  The complaint also alleges that defendants Todd Stone\r     and Porush caused a close friend of Todd Stone to purchase Caesars call\r     options, making profits of $30,000.\r\r          The Commissions complaint alleges that each defendant violated\r     Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules\r     10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder and seeks an order enjoining the defendants from\r     violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, the\r     disgorgement of illegal profits, and the imposition of civil monetary\r     penalties.\r\r\r\r\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c"

VLADISLAV STEVEN ZUBKIS, et al., 97\r     Civ. 8086, U.S.D.C., S.D.N.Y. \r\r          The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) today announced\r     the filing of a Complaint in the United States District Court for the\r     Southern District of New York alleging numerous violations of the federal\r     securities laws.  The Complaint alleges that Vladislav Steven Zubkis\r     (Zubkis) masterminded a wide-ranging fraudulent scheme to illegally raise\r     money from more than 1,100 investors located throughout the United States. \r     Zubkis\s scheme involved a public corporation, Stella Bella Corporation,\r     USA, now known as International Brands, Inc. (SBAM), and Z 3 Capital\r     Corporation (Z3).  Zubkis directed SBAM as well as Z3, another\r     corporation he controlled, to issue unregistered securities, and Zubkis\r     then had these securities sold to investors throughout the United States\r     through registered and unregistered broker-dealers that employed fraudulent\r     sales practices.  Over 1,100 investors ultimately purchased SBAM and Z3\r     securities, generating over $10 million in proceeds.\r\r     Named as defendants were:\r\r          *    VLADISLAV STEVEN ZUBKIS, 37, a resident of Bonita, California. \r               At all relevant times, Zubkis controlled SBAM\s capital raising\r               efforts, and directed all of SBAM\s stock issuances.  Zubkis was\r               also the chairman of the board of directors, sole officer, and\r               majority shareholder of Z3.\r\r          *    STELLA BELLA CORPORATION, USA, N/K/A INTERNATIONAL BRANDS, INC.,\r               a publicly traded corporation based in San Diego, California. \r               SBAM manufactures and sells wholesale and retail gourmet coffee\r               and other products.\r\r          *    Z 3 CAPITAL CORPORATION, a corporation that purportedly acquired\r               and managed business enterprises through wholly owned\r               subsidiaries, and that operated an unregistered broker through\r               which SBAM and Z3 securities were sold to investors.\r\r          *    MARK SCIALDONE, 24, a resident of San Diego, California, who,\r               until the summer of 1995, was the chairman of the board of\r               directors and president of SBAM.\r\r     The Complaint alleges as follows:\r\r          From approximately June 1993 to May 1996, Zubkis directed the issuance\r     of millions of SBAM shares that were then sold to the public through a\r     registered broker-dealer and through an unregistered broker Zubkis\r     controlled. Zubkis established this unregistered broker through Z3.  Zubkis\r     also directed Z3 to issue over 2,000 securities known as Triple Crown\r     Units that were also sold to the investing public through the unregistered\r     broker as well as a registered broker-dealer.  Zubkis paid salespersons at\r     Z3\s unregistered broker commissions as high as 50% to induce these\r\x0c\r\r\r\r\r\r\r     salespersons to sell the SBAM and Z3 securities to their retail customers. \r     In addition, Zubkis directed these salespersons to use a variety of\r     fraudulent sales practices to persuade customers to purchase these\r     securities.  For example, investors were told that SBAM was about to merge\r     with a prominent company, when, in fact, no such merger was ever\r     contemplated.  These salespersons also made baseless stock price\r     predictions.  Moreover, Z3 and Zubkis also disseminated information to\r     investors that falsely stated that proceeds received from the sales of Z3\r     securities would be used for business purposes when, in fact, Zubkis used a\r     portion of the proceeds for his own personal purposes.  Zubkis also used\r     portions of the proceeds to pay salespersons at the registered and\r     unregistered broker-dealers, and to finance SBAM\s retail operations.\r\r          Finally, while the SBAM securities were being offered and sold, SBAM\r     and Scialdone, SBAM\s president, disseminated to investors materially false\r     and misleading information concerning SBAM\s financial condition and the\r     extent of its retail operation.  Specifically, SBAM disseminated materially\r     false and misleading information that predicted substantial growth in\r     SBAM\s profits, sales, and revenues when no factual basis existed to\r     predict such growth.  SBAM also disseminated information that grossly\r     exaggerated the number of retail outlets for SBAM\s coffee.  The Complaint\r     alleges that Zubkis and Z3 violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the\r     Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Sections 10(b), 15(a), and\r     15(c)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules\r     10b-5, 15c1-2, 15c1-5, and 15c1-6 promulgated thereunder.  The Complaint\r     also alleges that SBAM violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities\r     Act, and that both SBAM and Scialdone violated Section 10(b) of the\r     Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.\r\r          In January 1997, the New York State Attorney General\s Office filed an\r     enforcement action and obtained a restraining order barring SBAM and Z3\r     from selling securities within or from the State of New York.  This\r     injunction currently remains in effect.  The defendants have been held in\r     criminal contempt by a Justice of the New York Supreme Court for violating\r     the court\s order to produce documents.  The Commission wishes to\r     acknowledge the assistance of the New York State Attorney General\s Office\r     in the Commission\s action against Zubkis, SBAM, Z3, and Scialdone.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 2======\r\x0c"

In its Complaint, which it filed on\r     April 5, 1994, the Commission alleged that the three entities and thirteen\r     other defendants raised that amount from more than 100 investors in 25\r     states through a fraudulent boiler-room offering of unregistered\r     securities.  The Commission further alleged that each of the defendants\r     made false statements and omissions of material fact to potential\r     investors, including representations that the proceeds of the sales of the\r     securities would be used to make automobile loans the repayment of which\r     was insured, when, in fact, most of the proceeds of the securities sales\r     were converted to the personal benefit of the defendants.  The Commission\r     charged the defendants with violations of the antifraud and securities and\r     broker-dealer registration provisions of the federal securities laws.  The\r     three entities consented to the entry of the final judgment without\r     admitting or denying any of the Commission s substantive allegations.\r\r          The three entities  disgorgement liability will be partially satisfied\r     by the immediate deposit into the court registry of approximately $730,000\r     held by the three entities under the terms of an asset freeze order issued\r     by the court at the outset of the case. The remainder of the disgorgement\r     liability will be paid as the entities  assets are marshaled and liquidated\r     by a receiver in whose control the three entities were placed pursuant to\r     prior order of the court.  Upon dissolution, the three entities will be\r     required to pay all of their remaining assets to the registry of the court\r     in satisfaction of their disgorgement liability and any unsatisfied\r     disgorgement liability will be waived based upon financial inability to\r     pay.  Civil monetary penalties were not imposed based upon a demonstrated\r     inability to pay.  The three entities previously were enjoined permanently\r     by default from further violating the provisions of the federal securities\r     laws the Commission alleged they had violated.\r\r          The Commission now has obtained complete relief against fourteen of\r     the sixteen defendants in this case.

Viatical\r     settlements are financial transactions involving the purchase, at a\r     discount, of life insurance policies from terminally ill policy-holders in\r     exchange for the policy-holders\ death benefits.\r      \r     Named in the complaint were:\r\r          PCO, Inc. d/b/a Personal Choice Opportunities (PCO, Inc.), a Nevada\r          corporation with its principal place of business in Palm Springs,\r          California.  PCO, Inc. was purportedly in the business of purchasing\r          viatical settlements; and\r\r          David W. Laing (Laing), age 52, of Palm Springs, California.  Laing\r          was, at the time of the transactions and events alleged in the\r          Complaint, the president and sole shareholder of PCO, Inc. \r\r          The Complaint alleges that between June 1996 and April 1997, Laing and\r     PCO, Inc. solicited investors to invest in the Loan Program by falsely\r     representing, among other things, that they would use investor funds to\r     purchase viatical settlements, which would yield an annual return of 25\r     percent.  Rather than investing in the viatical settlements, however, Laing\r     and PCO, Inc. allegedly misappropriated and otherwise misused the\r     investors\ funds.

Action No. 95-9283 (JES).\r\r          On November 6, 1997, the United States District Court for the Southern\r     District of New York granted the Commission s motion for summary judgment\r     against two brothers, Robert and Thomas Flanagan, finding that they had\r     engaged in insider trading in the securities of three AT&T acquisition\r     targets.  The Court permanently enjoined Robert Flanagan from future\r     violations of Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of\r     1934, and ordered him to disgorge $961,887.66 in trading profits, pay\r     prejudgment interest of $722,644.23, and pay a civil penalty of\r     $2,483,189.67.  The Court also entered a permanent injunction against\r     Thomas Flanagan based on the same statutory provisions and ordered him to\r     disgorge $379,524.98 in trading profits, pay prejudgment interest of\r     $290,034.10, and pay a civil penalty of $1,138,574.94.\r\r          In its summary judgment motion, the Commission demonstrated that in\r     1990 and 1991, Charles Brumfield, at the time an AT&T labor relations\r     executive, learned about AT&Ts secret plans to acquire NCR Corporation,\r     Digital Microwave Corporation, and Teradata Corporation.  Brumfield then\r     leaked this information to a colleague at AT&T, Thomas Alger.  Alger, in\r     turn, tipped Robert Flanagan, who arranged for others (including his\r     brother Thomas) to buy securities in the acquisition targets both for him\r     and for themselves.  Some of the profits from those trades were then paid\r     to Robert Flanagan, who kicked back a portion to Brumfield and Alger as\r     payment for the information.\r\r          Both Robert and Thomas Flanagan were previously convicted of related\r     criminal charges.  In September 1995, a jury found Robert Flanagan guilty\r     of securities fraud and conspiracy to commit securities fraud, wire fraud,\r     and obstruction of agency proceedings.  He was sentenced to two years\r     imprisonment, three years supervised release, and a $5,000 fine.  His\r     conviction was affirmed on appeal.  Thomas Flanagan pled guilty in August\r     1995 to conspiracy to commit securities fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction\r     of agency proceedings, and was sentenced to four months imprisonment, four\r     months home detention, and three years supervised release.\r\r          The Commission has obtained judgments against or settled with twelve\r     of the defendants in its civil action.

On July 19, 1996, the Court entered a Final Judgment\r     against Smith and his company, Atlantic Pacific Guarantee Corporation,\r     requiring them to disgorge $126,584 plus prejudgment interest within ninety\r     days.  The Commission alleged that Smith and Atlantic Pacific received\r     $126,584 in investor funds which had been fraudulently obtained by Kenton\r     Capital, Ltd. and its promoters in connection with prime bank trading\r     programs.  The Commission alleged that Kenton and its promoters projected\r     to investors annual returns on these trading programs ranging from 34,200%\r     to over 1,200,000%.  Smith and Atlantic Pacific failed to pay any money,\r     and on July 2, 1997, Smith filed bankruptcy individually and on behalf of\r     Atlantic Pacific.\r\r          In its opinion, the Court cited numerous examples where Smith was\r     unable to document or account for the transfer of various assets.  The\r     Court also noted that Smith submitted false financial statements to the\r     Commission.  Thus, the Court held that Smith failed to prove his inability\r     to pay the disgorgement.

(PSFL).\r\r          The Complaint alleges that:\r\r               Setteducate, directly or indirectly, falsely represented to four\r               investors that he was attempting to raise $1 million to be put in\r               an escrow account in order to borrow against it, and with the\r               borrowed money, facilitate the procurement of a purchase order\r               that purportedly could be used to buy bank instruments. \r               Setteducate represented that investors would make a profit by\r               being paid a percentage of the face value of such instruments. \r               Setteducate represented that the required investment per investor\r               was $50,000 and that the return on each investment would be $2.5\r               million.  \r\r               Setteducate, directly or indirectly, falsely represented to two\r               other investors that he could obtain bank purchase orders\r               representing loan funds in the amount of $100 million to be\r               exchanged for bank instruments described as Prime World Bank\r               SBLC [stand by letters of credit].  Setteducate promised these\r               investors that they would earn between eight and ten million\r               dollars on this transaction.  These representations were\r               materially false and misleading because such purchase orders\r               are neither issued nor accepted by banks for the purpose of\r               buying and selling financial instruments.  \r\r               Setteducate prepared and signed contracts falsely representing\r               that he would use investors  money to obtain the issuance of\r               purchase orders for bank instruments.  Instead, in each\r               instance, Setteducate misappropriated the investors  money for\r               his personal and business expenses associated with the PSFL. \r\r          In its Complaint, the Commission alleges that Setteducate violated the\r          antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 17(a) of\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c\r\r\r\r\r\r\r          the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities\r          Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

JOHN LOGAN, United States District\r     Court for the District of Columbia, Civil Action No. 97CV02718\r             \r          The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced the filing of a\r     civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the\r     District of Columbia in Washington, D.C., against John Logan, a former\r     Regional Sales Director in the Contact Lens Division ( CLD ) of Bausch &\r     Lomb, Incorporated ( B&L ).\r\r          The Commissions Complaint alleges that, during 1993, Logan granted,\r     and instructed others to grant, certain distributors of B&L contact lenses\r     the right to return those lenses, in connection with a year-end 1993\r     company marketing program called the  December Program.   According to the\r     Complaint, Logan knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that B&L would\r     incorrectly record these transactions as sales and improperly recognize the\r     revenue generated by the sales.  The Complaint alleges that as a result of\r     his conduct, Logan aided and abetted B&L s violation of the antifraud,\r     reporting, recordkeeping, and internal controls provisions of the federal\r     securities laws and directly violated the internal controls provisions.\r\r          The Complaint alleges that ultimately, B&L improperly recognized $22\r     million in revenue from the December Program, which consisted of the sale\r     of significant amounts of contact lenses through consignment sales to the\r     CLD s distributors less than two weeks before B&L s 1993 year-end.  This\r     improper revenue recognition, together with the improper recognition of\r     revenue from the fictitious sale of sunglasses in its Asia-Pacific\r     Division, resulted in B&L materially overstating its 1993 revenue by $42.1\r     million and its 1993 net income by at least $17.6 million, or 11%.  This\r     income overstatement appeared in the company s financial statements filed\r     with the Commission for its fiscal years ended December 1993 and 1994.\r\r          Simultaneously with the filing of the Complaint, Logan consented to\r     the entry of a proposed Final Judgment that would enjoin him from\r     violating, or aiding and abetting violations of, the antifraud, reporting,\r     recordkeeping, and internal controls provisions of the federal securities\r     laws, Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and (B), and 13(b)(5) of the\r     Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, and 13a-1\r     thereunder.  Logan also agreed to pay a $10,000 civil penalty pursuant to\r     Section 21(d)(3) of the Exchange Act.  The Commission has submitted the\r     proposed Final Judgment for approval and entry by the Court.\r\r\r\r\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c"

Scullin, Jr. of the United States District\r     Court for the Northern District of New York entered a Final Judgment and\r     Order against John S. Nadolski, the former president of Marietta\r     Corporation, a manufacturer of guest amenity products headquartered in\r     Cortland, New York.  The Final Judgment permanently enjoins violations of\r     Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the\r     Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; (2) bars him\r     from serving as an officer or director of any public company for a period\r     of five years; and (3) requires him to pay disgorgement of $300,000 and\r     prejudgment interest of $100,000.  Under the terms of settlement,  Nadolski\r     would pay $300,000 upon entry of the Final Judgment and be required to pay\r     the remaining $100,000 through the sale of assets.  In the event Nadolski\r     is unsuccessful in selling his assets, a court-appointed receiver would be\r     employed to sell those assets at the best available price.  Nadolski\r     consented to this relief, without admitting or denying the allegations in\r     the Commissions complaint. \r       \r          The Commission originally filed this action against Nadolski on August\r     18, 1995, alleging multiple violations of the federal securities laws\r     including insider trading.  The complaint alleged that between 1989 and\r     1991 Nadolski engaged in a fraudulent scheme to misrepresent Mariettas\r     financial condition by causing false accounting entries to be made in its\r     financial books and records, overstating sales and understating expenses. \r     These changes dramatically increased the net income Marietta reported in\r     public filings with the Commission.  In its annual report on Form 10-K for\r     the fiscal year ended September 30, 1989, Marietta overstated its net\r     income by $1,216,368, an overstatement of 70 percent.  \r\r          The complaint further alleged that in November 1989, Nadolski sold\r     100,000 shares of Marietta stock for $1.92 million while in possession of\r     inside information about Mariettas financial condition.  Specifically, the\r     complaint alleged that Nadolski knew that information concerning Mariettas\r     sales, profits and financial condition had been falsely reported to the\r     public, and that the fact and extent of the falsification had not been\r     disclosed to the public.  \r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c"

The Final Judgment ordered Myers to pay\r     disgorgement in the amount of $519,000, plus prejudgment interest thereon,\r     but waived payment of the same based upon a sworn financial statement\r     submitted by Myers which demonstrated inability to pay.  Myers consented to\r     this relief, without admitting or denying the allegations in the\r     Commission\s complaint. \r\r          On September 30, 1996, Judge Brown had entered a permanent injunction\r     against Myers, pursuant to her consent, under which she was permanently\r     enjoined from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act\r     of 1933, and Sections 10(b) and 15(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of\r     1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  \r\r          On September 14, 1996, the staff filed this action in the United\r     States District Court for the District of New Jersey, naming CNC Trading\r     Company, Inc,, Charles N.

The Commission charged that from 1985\r     through February 1995, Cugliari, with the assistance of Myers and others,\r     conducted a Ponzi scheme involving the fraudulent sale of approximately $70\r     million of unregistered CNC investments to over 2,000 public investors. \r     Cugliari solicited investors by offering them the purported opportunity to\r     finance CNC\s purchase of various food products.  To attract interest,\r     Cugliari told investors that the food products would be resold for a profit\r     and that each investor\s portion of this profit would yield a return of\r     approximately 3 1/2 percent per month, or 42 percent per year.  However,\r     rather than buying the particular food products which investors contracted\r     for, Cugliari commingled investor funds in bank accounts that he controlled\r     and used the money to pay returns to previous investors, and to pay\r     salaries, sales commissions and personal expenses.<(1)>  \r\r          The Commission further charged that Myers and others made numerous\r     material misrepresentations and omissions in connection with the sale of\r     CNC investments to public investors.

RICHARD P. POIRIER, JR., JAMES E.\r     EATON and MICHAEL S. DEVEGTER, United States District Court for the\r     Northern District of Georgia, Civil Action No. 1-97-CV-3478\r\r     The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that it filed a Complaint\r     in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia\r     against Richard P. Poirier, James E. Eaton, and Michael S. deVegter,\r     charging them with securities fraud in connection with two municipal\r     securities offerings involving Fulton County, Georgia.  The two offerings\r     were an October 1992 offering of $163.375 million in revenue bonds by\r     Fulton County and a May 1993 offering of $336 million in revenue bonds by\r     the Fulton-DeKalb Hospital Authority.  DeVegter, formerly a vice-president\r     in the Public Finance Department of Stephens Inc., was a financial advisor\r     to Fulton County in both transactions, and a financial advisor to the\r     Hospital Authority in the second transaction.  Poirier was formerly a\r     partner and Eaton was formerly a vice-president at Lazard Freres & Co. \r     Lazard Freres was the senior managing underwriter for the Fulton County\r     transaction and co-senior managing underwriter for the Hospital Authority\r     transaction.\r\r     The Complaint alleges that in the Summer of 1992, deVegter entered into an\r     undisclosed arrangement with Poirier, Eaton and a consultant for Lazard\r     Freres. The consultant asked deVegter to assist Lazard Freres in obtaining\r     the position of senior managing underwriter for the Fulton County\r     transaction and promised deVegter that he would be compensated for his\r     efforts.  DeVegter agreed, and provided assistance to the firm in its\r     successful bid to become senior managing underwriter for the offering.  The\r     Complaint alleges that in December 1992, following closing of the bond\r     issue, Poirier and Eaton caused Lazard Freres to issue an $83,872 check to\r     the consultant, who then paid deVegter half of that fee, $41,936.\r\r     The Complaint charges that shortly before he received the $41,936, deVegter\r     helped Lazard Freres with its efforts to be named underwriter on the\r     Hospital Authority transaction, deVegter assisted Lazard Freres in this\r     transaction by, among other things, assisting Lazard Freres with the hiring\r     of a local consultant and joining in the recommendation to the Hospital\r     Authority that Lazard Freres be named as co-senior managing underwriter.\r\r     The Complaint alleges other fraudulent conduct in connection with the\r     selection of Lazard Freres as senior managing underwriter for an April 1992\r     $184.5 million offering by the School District of Duval County, Florida. \r     In that transaction, Poirier caused two materially misleading\r     representations to be made to the issuer.  Both representations attested to\r     the absence of any consultant or lobbyist services or fees in connection\r     with Lazard Freres selection.  In fact, a lobbyist was used, and Poirier\r     had agreed to a success fee on the transaction, which he caused the firm to\r     pay.  That payment was in violation of the underwriting agreement with the\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c\r\r\r\r\r\r\r     School District.\r\r     The Complaint charges other improper conduct by Poirier as part of his\r     efforts to obtain underwriting business for his firm.  In 1992 and 1993,\r     Poirier arranged for the reimbursement by Lazard Freres of at least $62,500\r     in political contributions to the campaigns of two incumbent governors at a\r     time when the firm was seeking and obtaining municipal securities business\r     from their respective jurisdictions.  Poirier enlisted others to arrange\r     for third parties to make the political contributions, and reimbursed those\r     third parties, through false invoices for consulting and other services\r     submitted to Lazard Freres.\r\r     According to the Complaint, Poirier, Eaton and deVegter defrauded Fulton\r     County, the Fulton DeKalb Hospital Authority, and investors in the two\r     offerings by failing to disclose deVegter s agreement to assist Lazard\r     Freres, the $41,936 payment, and the actual and potential conflicts of\r     interest created by those arrangements.  As a result, the three violated\r     the following antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws:  Section\r     17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities\r     Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The Complaint charges that\r     Poirier s and Eaton s conduct also violated Exchange Act Section 15B(c)(1),\r     rule G-17 of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, which prohibits\r     unfair practices in the conduct of municipal securities business, and MSRB\r     rule G-20, which prohibits certain gifts and payments in the conduct of\r     municipal securities business.  Poirier is also charged with violations of\r     the antifraud provisions and MSRB rule G-17 in connection with the Duval\r     County transaction, and with violations of MSRB rule G-17 in connection\r     with the reimbursement of political contributions.\r\r     In its Complaint, the Commission seeks to enjoin the three defendants from\r     violating the provisions described above.  In addition, the Commission\r     seeks orders requiring each of the defendants to pay civil money penalties. \r     Simultaneous with the filing of the Complaint, and without admitting or\r     denying the allegations contained in the Complaint, Eaton agreed to the\r     entry of a final judgment of permanent injunction barring future violations\r     of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b) and 15B(c)(1) of the\r     Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and MSRB rules G-17 and G-20; and\r     ordering him  to pay a civil penalty of $15,000 pursuant to Section\r     20(d)(1) of the Securities Act and Section 21B(a) of the Exchange Act.  As\r     part of his settlement with the Commission, Eaton has agreed to the entry\r     of a Commission order barring him  permanently from the securities\r     business.\r\r      The Commissions investigation concerning pay-to play-practices in Florida and Georgia\r      continues.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                                    ======END OF PAGE 2======\r\x0c"

The court granted the Commission\s\r     request for emergency relief, including a temporary restraining order and\r     an asset freeze.     \r\r     Named in the Complaint are:\r\r          Paramount Capital Management, Inc.

(Micronet).  The Complaint alleges\r     that, when investors seek information about Micronet, instead of sending\r     them a prospectus, Paramount and John Doe refer them to a Web Site on the\r     Internet for MicroNet Technology, Inc. -- a company that has not\r     undertaken any initial public securities offering, has no plans to do so,\r     and denies any knowledge of Paramount or Kenneth Bridget.\r\r     The Commission alleges that Paramount and John Doe also deceived investors\r     by falsely portraying themselves as a bona fide broker-dealer and\r     registered representative.  Paramount and John Doe allegedly sent investors\r     a brochure describing Paramount as a securities broker-dealer, even though\r     Paramount is not registered with the Commission as such.

Uniglobe Trading Company, Inc., et.\r     al., 97 Civ. 08659 (USDC SDNY)\r\r          The Commission today filed a complaint and obtained emergency relief\r     in an action involving the offer to sell forged and fictitious certificates\r     of deposits (CDs) purportedly issued by an Argentinean bank and treasury\r     bonds purportedly issued by the government of Japan.   Judge Charles\r     Brieant issued a temporary restraining order and other relief against\r     Uniglobe Trading Company Inc. (Uniglobe), a Yonkers, New York entity which\r     claims to assist clients in the transfer of financial instruments and\r     commodities; two of its officers, Clint Holland (Holland) and Margaret\r     Laughrin (Laughrin); Moorgreen Holdings Limited (Moorgreen), a Gibralter\r     company with offices in Spain; and a Moorgreen representative, Raymond\r     Nakachian (Nakachian).  The Commission alleged in its complaint that since\r     at least October 1997, the defendants have been engaging in an apparent\r     scheme to defraud U.S. investors through the offer of fraudulent securities\r     in violation of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws,\r     Sections 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the\r     Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.\r\r          The complaint alleged that the defendants have offered for sale at\r     least two, and possibly as many as sixteen, fraudulent certificates of\r     deposit (CDs) of Banco de la Nacion Argentina with stated principal amounts\r     exceeding [U.S.] $100 million each.  The defendants offered the CDs, due to\r     mature in approximately one year, at substantial discounts from face value,\r     in cash only transactions.  The Commission alleged that during the same\r     time period, Uniglobe, Holland and Laughrin also offered for sale\r     approximately 24 treasury bonds purportedly issued by the Japanese\r     government each in dominations of $500 million yen [approximately U.S. $4.2\r     million].  The Commission, citing evidence from the Argentinean bank and\r     Japanese government, alleged that the instruments are fraudulent.\r\r          To prevent Uniglobe, Laughrin, Holland, Moorgreen and Nakachian from\r     continuing to offer these and other securities and potentially selling them\r     to investors, the Commission requested the relief granted by Judge Brieant\r     including a temporary restraining order, an order freezing the CDs and\r     bonds, and an order that the defendants tender the instruments to the\r     registry of the Court.  Further, the Judges order requires an accounting\r     from the defendants of all assets, including certificates of deposit,\r     financial instruments or government bonds, held by the defendants or\r     offered by the defendants for sale or other transfer.  In addition to the\r     emergency relief granted today, the Commission seeks civil penalties\r     against the defendants.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c"

(Sakura), for fraud in connection with the\r     sale of municipal securities.  The Complaint alleges that in two municipal\r     bond transactions in which Sakura provided forward purchase agreements\r     (forward) to the issuers, Strauss made materially misleading statements\r     and/or affirmative misrepresentations to the issuers with respect to\r     undisclosed payments that Sakura, through Strauss, made to Stifel, Nicolaus\r     & Company, Inc. (Stifel), the underwriter for the transactions.  The\r     Complaint alleges that these undisclosed payments jeopardized the tax-\r     exempt status of the bonds.\r\r          The Complaint alleges that in a 1992 transaction for the Oklahoma\r     Turnpike Authority, the forward stated that Sakura did not intend to take\r     any actions which would jeopardize the tax-exempt status of the bonds.  The\r     Complaint alleges that at the time Strauss signed the forward on behalf of\r     Sakura, he knew that Sakura was planning to pay a $6.593 million brokerage\r     fee to Stifel, and that Strauss knew or was reckless in not knowing that\r     such a brokerage fee would jeopardize the tax-exempt status of the bonds. \r     The Complaint also alleges that in a 1992 transaction for the Sisters of\r     St. Mary\s Health Care Obligated Group (SSM), at the request of bond\r     counsel, Strauss signed a certificate on behalf of Sakura stating that\r     Sakura would not make any payments, other than certain payments to the\r     issuer, in connection with the forward.  However, the Complaint alleges\r     that Strauss caused Sakura to make a $100,000 payment to Stifel. \r\r          The Complaint alleges that by his conduct, Strauss violated Section\r     17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities\r     Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Complaint seeks relief\r     including a permanent injunction barring Strauss from future violations of\r     those provisions and the imposition of a civil penalty.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c"

CHARLES O. HUTTOE, ET AL., Civil\r     Action No. 96-02543 (GK)(D.D.C.)\r\r          The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) today announced\r     settlements with Charles O. Huttoe and certain other persons and entities\r     to be named as Relief Defendants in the action previously filed against\r     him.  The Commission filed its complaint on an emergency basis in this\r     action on November 7, 1996, and charged Huttoe, formerly the Chairman of\r     the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Systems of Excellence, Inc.\r     (SOE), with orchestrating what was then an ongoing, massive market\r     manipulation of that company\s securities.  The complaint alleged that he\r     secretly distributed millions of SOE shares in the names of his family\r     members and corporations, issued false favorable information concerning SOE\r     and its business, and then sold his shares into the inflated market.  The\r     Commission has also moved to recover Huttoe\s illegal profits from several\r     Relief Defendants -- persons and entities that the Commission has alleged\r     were the beneficiaries of a massive effort by Huttoe to dissipate and\r     secrete those profits before the Commission\s complaint was filed.\r\r          As part of the settlement, Huttoe, without admitting or denying the\r     allegations made in the Commission\s complaint, consented to the entry of a\r     final judgment of permanent injunction prohibiting him from violating\r     Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act),\r     Sections 10(b), 13(b)(5), and 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934\r     (Exchange Act), and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, 13b2-2, 16a-2, and 16a-3\r     thereunder.  The Order also permanently bars Huttoe from acting as an\r     officer or director of a public company.  The Order requires that Huttoe\r     disgorge $12,543,770, the total amount of monies or benefits that he\r     derived from the conduct alleged in the complaint, provided that except for\r     surrendering to the Court-appointed receiver in this case certain assets\r     described in Huttoe\s sworn statement of his financial condition, payment\r     of the disgorgement amount is waived in light of his demonstrated inability\r     to pay based on his sworn representations in his statement of financial\r     condition.  The Order also requires Huttoe to cooperate with the Commission\r     and the Court-appointed receiver to, among other things, effect the\r     surrender of all the proceeds of the fraud that are held by any other\r     person.  As an additional part of the settlement, Huttoe consented to the\r     entry of a Commission Order barring him from association with any broker,\r     dealer, municipal securities dealer, investment adviser or investment\r     company.  \r\r          As previously announced, on November 13, 1996, Huttoe pled guilty to a\r     two count information charging him with securities fraud and money\r     laundering arising out of his conduct at SOE.  On January 31, 1997, he was\r     sentenced to 46 months of imprisonment.  He is presently serving that\r     sentence. See Lit. Rel. 15237 (January 31, 1997).\r\r          The Commission also announced settlements with Karen Purvis Huttoe\r     (Purvis), who is Huttoe\s wife, and Tammy Jo Perkins (Perkins), who is\r\x0c\r\r\r\r\r\r\r     Huttoe\s niece.  The Commission previously had alleged that Huttoe had\r     issued SOE shares to them as well as to the late Josephine Brooks\r     (Brooks), Huttoe\s mother, that those shares were sold during the\r     manipulation and that Purvis, Perkins and Brooks had violated Section 5 of\r     the Securities Act.  In light of evidence obtained in discovery in this\r     matter, the Commission today requested leave of the Court to amend its\r     complaint to drop the charge that they violated Section 5 of the Securities\r     Act, and instead to name Purvis and Perkins as Relief Defendants.  Purvis\r     and Perkins have consented to orders requiring that they disgorge the\r     contents of the brokerage and bank accounts in their names that were used\r     to sell SOE securities or into which proceeds of those sales were\r     deposited.  The Commission also filed a motion with Brooks\ counsel\s\r     consent requiring that assets held in such accounts in her name be\r     surrendered to the Court-appointed receiver.  Purvis also agreed to\r     disgorge an additional $258,650 representing illegal proceeds that she\r     received from Huttoe, provided that payment was waived in light of her\r     demonstrated inability to pay based on her sworn representations in her\r     statement of financial condition.\r\r          The Commission also announced developments with regard to several\r     other Relief Defendants.  Today, Starlog Franchise Corp., Hope Associates,\r     L.L.C., Michael Michaelson, Raymond J. Markman, Herman Rush, Mark Savel and\r     George Holsten filed consents to the entry of orders requiring them to\r     disgorge a total of $950,000 that the Commission alleged they received,\r     directly or indirectly, from Huttoe.  Finally, the Commission announced\r     that on November 7, 1997, the Court granted its motion for leave to amend\r     its complaint to add Mary Jane Hubbard as a Relief  Defendant, granted a\r     preliminary injunction against Hubbard and froze $531,450 representing\r     funds Hubbard received from Huttoe.\r\r          The Commission previously has made several announcements concerning\r     this matter.

Seigel also consented to pay\r     disgorgement of $1,068,125 and prejudgment interest of $74,365.08 totaling\r     $1,142,490.08.  Seigel demonstrated through sworn statements of his\r     financial condition that he did not possess sufficient assets with which to\r     pay the entire judgment.  To satisfy this judgment, Seigel has been ordered\r     to turn over the bulk of his assets, valued at $317,496.81 to the Court-\r     appointed Permanent Receiver, Arthur N. Greenberg, Esq.\r\r          The Commissions complaint, filed December 19, 1995, alleged that\r     Seigel and other defendants fraudulently offered securities in the form of\r     29 oil and gas limited partnerships from May 1993 to December 19, 1995. \r     The complaint alleged that Seigel and other defendants ran a Ponzi-like\r     scheme that paid investor returns with other investors money.  This Ponzi-\r     like scheme raised approximately $34,934,000 from investors, many of whom\r     are elderly.  The complaint further alleged that Seigel and other\r     defendants variously violated Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the\r     Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of\r     1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  \r\r     See Litigation Release Nos. LR-14766, 14866, 15331, 15525, and 15567.  For\r     more information, please contact Marianne Wisner, Staff Attorney, at (213)\r     965-3983 or James A.

(INBC),\r     from her uncle, defendant Robert Hunter, an INBC director.  Naumann\r     purchased INBC stock just prior to the merger announcement in November 1993\r     while in possession of this material, nonpublic information and made $2,250\r     in profits.  Naumann also purchased stock for her business associate and\r     tipped her mother and cousin, both of whom purchased INBC stock as well.\r\r          Greenwood, who was a director of the Cheltenham Bank, a wholly owned\r     subsidiary of INBC, purchased INBC stock after learning about the\r     acquisition proposal and made $150,412 in profits.  Also, in January 1993\r     Greenwood sold approximately 95 per cent of his holdings in INBC stock\r     after learning that INBC had suffered a quarterly loss in earnings and\r     prior to the public release of that information.  In so doing, Greenwood\r     avoided losses of $33,750.\r\r          Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, Naumann\r     and Greenwood consented to the entry of final judgments of permanent\r     injunction against future violations of the antifraud provisions of the\r     federal securities laws.  Naumann agreed to disgorge her profits and the\r     profits of her tippees, which totaled $5,050, pay prejudgment interest of\r     $1,904.19, and a penalty of $5,050.  Greenwood agreed to disgorge his\r     profits and the amount of his losses avoided, or $184,162.50, pay\r     prejudgment interest of $70,608.99, and a penalty of $184,162.50.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r     PERMANENT INJUNCTIONS ENTERED AGAINST KATHY NAUMANN AND W.

HAROLD E. TOBIN, Civil Action No. 97-\r     5124 IH (SHx) (C.D. Cal.)\r\r          The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on November 20,\r     the Honorable Irving Hill of the United States District Court for the\r     Central District of California entered a Final Judgment against defendant\r     Harold E. Tobin (Tobin), a resident of Rancho Mirage, California.  Tobin,\r     who is 57 years old, was the president, founder, and sole shareholder of\r     defunct Tobin Investment Corporation (TIC), which was located in\r     Huntington Beach, California.  The Final Judgment permanently enjoins Tobin\r     from future violations of the securities registration, broker-dealer\r     registration, and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, and\r     orders Tobin to pay disgorgement in the amount of $3,747,505, plus\r     prejudgment interest.  The Final Judgment waives payment of the\r     disgorgement and interest based upon a sworn financial statement\r     demonstrating Tobin\s inability to pay.  Tobin consented to the entry of\r     the Final Judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the\r     Commission\s Complaint.\r\r          In its Complaint, the Commission alleged that Tobin fraudulently\r     raised $4,952,505 from 90 mostly elderly investors nationwide from\r     September 1994 until January 1995 through the offer and sale of promissory\r     note investments.  The money raised from investors was to be used to fund a\r     Las Vegas, Nevada residential real estate development project called\r     Rancho Mirage.  The Rancho Mirage project was never developed, and most\r     of the money raised in the offering was used to pay:  (a) construction\r     costs associated with other real estate projects being developed by Tobin\r     and financed by TIC; (b) interest to investors in other real estate\r     projects being developed by Tobin and financed by TIC; (c) interest to\r     investors in the Rancho Mirage project; (d) an undisclosed 3% commission to\r     TIC sales agents; and (e) an undisclosed payment of 5% to TIC for\r     operating costs.  The Final Judgement enjoins Tobin from future\r     violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933,\r     Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule\r     10b-5 thereunder.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c"

PETER T. CASERTA, SALVATORE T. MARINO\r     AND DANA C. VERRILL, United States District Court for the Eastern District\r     of New York, Civil Action No. CV 97-7091        .\r\r     The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced the filing of a\r     complaint with the United States District Court for the Eastern District of\r     New York against Peter T. Caserta, Salvatore T. Marino and Dana C. Verrill,\r     former directors and officers of Spectrum Information Technologies, Inc. \r     Spectrum, currently headquartered in Purchase, New York, has been engaged\r     in various aspects of the computer industry since its inception in 1984. \r     According to the Commission s complaint, Caserta and Verrill devised a\r     scheme to raise capital for Spectrum illegally.  Thereafter, Caserta and\r     Marino engaged in a fraudulent scheme to inflate Spectrum s financial\r     results and stock price.  During this period, Caserta and Marino benefited\r     by selling Spectrum stock while in possession of material nonpublic\r     information concerning the scheme.\r\r     Specifically, the complaint alleges that during 1992, Caserta and Verrill\r     obtained cash to finance their floundering company s operations by\r     conducting an unregistered stock offering.  The distribution of stock was\r     effected by disguising it as stock sales to employees under an employee\r     stock option plan.  This offering, which Caserta and Verrill directed and\r     controlled, raised approximately $3 million for Spectrum.\r\r     Having obtained necessary cash and thus having improved Spectrum s\r     prospects, according to the Complaint, defendants Caserta and Marino turned\r     their attention to boosting Spectrum s stock price.  In May 1993, in an\r     interview with a reporter, defendant Caserta knowingly overstated the value\r     of a licensing agreement that Spectrum had entered into with AT&T Co.  This\r     material misstatement was disseminated to the public, artificially\r     inflating Spectrum s value, thereby defrauding investors and triggering\r     then-record trading in Spectrum s stock.    \r\r     The Complaint also alleged that between May and November 1993, defendants\r     Caserta and Marino fraudulently overstated the value of three additional\r     licensing agreements Spectrum negotiated.  In order to convince the public\r     and other potential licensees of the value of Spectrum s patented\r     technology, Caserta and Marino set out to arrange  seven figure  license\r     payments by Megahertz Corporation, Apex Data Corporation and U.S. Robotics,\r     Inc.  However, when each prospective licensee refused to pay seven figures\r     to license Spectrum s technology, Caserta and Marino conceived and\r     implemented a cash in/cash out scheme whereby the vast majority of the\r      seven figure  fees to be paid by the licensees would be offset by equal\r     payments from Spectrum to the licensees under companion advertising\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c\r\r\r\r\r\r\r     agreements.  At the direction of Caserta and Marino, Spectrum s filings\r     with the Commission improperly reflected the  seven figure  licensing fees\r     as revenue and income.  Because of this improper accounting treatment, and\r     corresponding misleading disclosures and press releases, investors were\r     misled into thinking that Spectrum had earned millions of dollars in fees\r     and had experienced its first two consecutive profitable quarters when, in\r     reality, Spectrum could not obtain licensing fees of that magnitude and had\r     suffered significant losses.\r\r     The Commission further alleged that defendants Caserta and Marino benefited\r     from their scheme by exercising options and selling Spectrum stock while in\r     possession of the material nonpublic information that Spectrum s technology\r     was not worth what Spectrum s filings and press releases claimed it to be,\r     and that Spectrum continued to experience significant losses during the two\r     quarters for which Spectrum had improperly reported a profit.  Caserta and\r     Marino avoided millions of dollars in losses by trading while in possession\r     of this material, nonpublic information.  \r\r     The Commission s action seeks judgments: (1) permanently enjoining\r     defendants from further violating the securities laws; (2) requiring each\r     defendant to pay appropriate civil penalties under the securities laws; (3)\r     requiring Caserta and Marino to disgorge all losses avoided as a result of\r     their trading on insider information, plus pre-judgment interest; and (4)\r     permanently prohibiting Caserta and Marino from acting as a director or\r     officer of any issuer that has a class of stock registered with the\r     Commission or is required to file reports with the Commission.\r\r     The Commission s investigation in this matter is continuing.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 2======\r\x0c"

The Order, entered on December 5, 1997, restrains Frith\r     and CPB from violating the net capital, customer protection, antifraud, and\r     books and records provisions of the federal securities laws.  The Order\r     also froze all of the assets of Frith, CPB and Adbot, Inc., another company\r     owned and managed by Frith. CPB is in the business of matching buyers and\r     sellers of limited partnerships through a modified auction process.\r\r          From approximately May 1996 through the present, Frith and CPB have\r     fraudulently diverted at least $3.4 million in funds owed to CPB s\r     brokerage customers in connection with transactions in limited partnership\r     units to various improper uses, including coverage of CPB s operating\r     losses, and distributions to Frith and Adbot. In doing so, CPB failed to\r     maintain sufficient funds in a special reserve account required for the\r     protection of customers and failed to maintain the legally required amount\r     of net capital for an extended period.  In addition, CPB and Frith\r     submitted false reports based on CPB s inaccurate books and records to the\r     Commission and the National Association of Securities Dealers.\r     In doing so, CPB and Frith violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of\r     1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of\r     1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and CPB violated\r     and Frith aided and abetted violations of Sections 15(c)(1) and 15(c)(3) of\r     the Exchange Act and Rule 15c1-2, 15c3-1, and 15c3-3 thereunder, and Rules\r     17(a) and 17(e) of the Exchange Act and Rules 17a-3 and 17a-5 thereunder.\r\r          Also on December 5, on the application of Securities Investor\r     Protection Corporation, the Court appointed a temporary receiver for CPB.

In addition, the Complaint alleges that Sers violated the\r     same provisions when he sold, on his own behalf and on behalf of the Relief\r     Defendants, at least $5.8 million of Trinity USA securities by means of the\r     Bulletin Board trading system of the National Association of Securities\r     Dealers; and an additional 7.8 million shares through unlicensed salesmen.\r\r          According to the Complaint, Trinity USA, a Brownwood, Texas oil and\r     gas company, and Sers, have misrepresented to investors the financial\r     condition of Trinity USA; the title to and conditions surrounding certain\r     oil and gas drilling rights located near Cali, Colombia; the performance of\r     two exploratory gas wells and the gas reserves claimed to be found at the\r     drilling location; and efforts of Trinity USA to become a reporting\r     company.  Trinity USA and Sers have failed to disclose, the Complaint\r     alleges, the actual number of shares of Trinity USA issued and outstanding,\r     the issuance to Sers and the Relief Defendants of millions of shares of the\r     company for little, if any, consideration; or the use of at least $1\r     million of Trinity USA funds for the personal benefit of Sers.\r\r          On November 6, 1997, the Commission suspended trading in the\r     securities of Trinity USA for a single ten day period.

The defendants\r     represented to investors that:  investor funds would only be used to\r     purchase and trade Treasury securities; investors would receive 1% per\r     month in profits from trading Treasury securities; if the 1% monthly return\r     from trading profits were not achieved, investors\ funds would be returned;\r     and only after payment of the 1% monthly return, would the trustees of the\r     Trusts, sales agents, and others be paid from excess trading profits.\r\r          The Complaint further alleges that, contrary to these representations,\r     the defendants operated a Ponzi-like scheme that paid investors their 1%\r     monthly return from other investors\ funds, failed to return investors\\r     funds after suffering large trading losses, misappropriated investor funds\r     for their personal benefit, and transferred over $3 million of investor\r     funds to Bahamian bank accounts.\r\r          The Trustees are Palo Verde 136, Inc., Advantage Marketing Group,\r     Inc., and FLC Corporation.

The Judgment additionally orders that the Trustees shall pay\r     disgorgement, prejudgment interest and, if appropriate, civil penalties in\r     amounts subsequently to be determined by the Court.

Roger D. Wyatt and David L.\r     Holewinski, Civil Action No. 96-5399 TJH (Mcx) (C.D. Cal.)\r\r          The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on November 24,\r     1997, the Honorable Terry J. Hatter, Jr., United States District Judge for\r     the Central District of California, entered a Final Judgment against Roger\r     D. Wyatt of Houston for insider trading in the securities of Chantal\r     Pharmaceutical Corporation, a Los Angeles based company.  \r\r          The Judgment against Wyatt provides that he is enjoined from future\r     violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  He\r     was also ordered to pay disgorgement in the amount of $50,125, representing\r     the amount of losses he and his tippee avoided from insider trading plus\r     prejudgment interest in the amount of $8,705.21 and civil penalties in the\r     amount of $150,375.  In sum, Wyatt was ordered to pay a total of\r     $209,205.21.  The Judgment was entered following the Commissions\r     successful motion to enter a Default Judgment against Wyatt for his willful\r     failure to comply with a court order directing him to produce documents\r     relating to his brokerage account situated in the Cayman Islands.\r\r          The Commission filed a Complaint on August 5, 1996, against Wyatt,\r     alleging insider trading in connection with his sale of Chantal stock in\r     February 1993.  The Complaint alleged that the sale took place prior to a\r     public announcement by Chantal, on February 25, 1993, that The Upjohn\r     Company had terminated a licensing agreement with Chantal because tests\r     showed that Chantals Cyoctol compound was not an effective anti-acne drug. \r     The Complaint further alleged that Chantals joint venture with Upjohn was\r     its sole source of income at the time.  \r\r          The Complaint also alleged that between mid-January 1993 and February\r     25, 1993, Wyatt, while acting as a consultant to Chantal, became aware of\r     confidential information concerning Upjohns testing of Cyoctol and sold\r     10,000 Chantal shares through a brokerage account in the Cayman Islands. \r     Additionally, the Complaint alleged that Wyatt conveyed this information to\r     David L. Holewinski, an individual with whom Wyatt maintained a close,\r     personal and business relationship.  Holewinski, in turn, directed his\r     broker to sell all of his and his wifes Chantal shares immediately\r     following a telephone conversation with Wyatt on February 25, 1993. \r     Holewinskis trades occurred just before the public announcement by\r     Chantal.  The Judgment against Wyatt leaves Holewinski as the sole\r     remaining defendant in the matter.  \r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c"

(World Plus) and Atlantic Pacific Funding Corporation\r     (Atlantic).  \r\r          In the Final Judgment, the Court permanently enjoined the defendants\r     from violating the anti-fraud and registration provisions of the federal\r     securities laws and ordered the defendants to disgorge $2,492,000 in ill-\r     gotten gains, plus prejudgment interest.  Because Bonham is currently in\r     Chapter 7 bankruptcy, the disgorgement award against defendants will be\r     carried out in accordance with the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and the proceeding\r     In re: Raejean S. Bonham, aka Jean Bonham, aka Jeannie Bonham, dba World\r     Plus, Case No. F95-00897-HAR, filed in the United States Bankruptcy Court\r     for the district of Alaska.\r\r          As stated in the Final Judgment, between 1988 and 1995, Bonham\r     operated a fraudulent Ponzi scheme, based in Fairbanks, Alaska, through\r     which she raised more than $42 million from at least 1,192 investors across\r     the United States.  Selling short-term, high interest World Plus and\r     Atlantic contracts to the investing public, Bonham misrepresented to\r     investors that investor funds would be used to purchase large blocks of\r     frequent flyer miles from multinational corporations.  In fact, Bonham\s\r     investment program was a Ponzi scheme: Bonham used investor funds\r     primarily to pay other investors when their contracts became due, not to\r     purchase blocks of airline miles or tickets.  The Final Judgment enjoins\r     defendants from further violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the\r     Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 15(b) of the Exchange Act of\r     1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.\r\r          On October 24, 1997, Bonham was indicted on multiple counts of mail\r     fraud, money laundering and violation of monetary transactions relating to\r     her fraudulent investment program.

The defendants were enjoined, pursuant to their\r     consent, without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions\r     Complaint, from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), 17(a)(1),\r     17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the\r     Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder and\r     Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940\r     and Rule 206(4)-4 promulgated thereunder.

The\r     scheme involved the defendants misrepresentations and omissions regarding\r     the risks and returns associated with investments in Associates I and Golf\r     I, Medskers ownership, financial and beneficial interest in the\r     partnerships primary investment, and the subsequent cover up of that\r     fraud.

The Order enjoins the defendants from future violations of the\r     anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws while reserving the\r     issues of the dollar amounts of disgorgement and civil penalties to be paid\r     by them.  The Order provides for a forty-five day period of discovery\r     relating to the issues of disgorgement and civil penalties.  At the\r     conclusion of the discovery period, if the parties are unable to agree on\r     the amounts of disgorgement and penalties to be paid, the parties will\r     request that Judge Ambrose hold an evidentiary hearing and make rulings on\r     these remaining issues.\r\r          Defendants Black, Devon and FMS consented to the Order without\r     admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission\s Complaint.\r\r          The Commission filed this action as an emergency matter on September\r     26, 1997.  On the same date, the Court granted the Commission\s requested\r     relief, including a temporary restraining order, freeze of assets and an\r     order appointing the Honorable Richard Thornburgh, formerly Attorney\r     General of the United States, United States Attorney for Western\r     Pennsylvania and Governor of Pennsylvania, as Trustee.  \r\r          The Order of permanent injunction maintains the freeze of the\r     defendants\ assets until such time as the issues of payment of disgorgement\r     and civil penalties are resolved.  Previously, on October 30, 1997, the\r     Court denied defendant Black\s request to release $625,000 of the frozen\r     assets to pay legal fees, in part because he had failed to demonstrate that\r     he did not have access to other funds.  At the same time the Court denied\r     in substantial part defendant Black\s request to release approximately\r     $127,000 of the frozen funds to pay living expenses, allowing him only\r     $25,000 for this purpose.   \r\r          The Commission\s Complaint alleged that Black, acting through Devon, a\r     Pennsylvania-based registered investment adviser, and FMS, an affiliate of\r     Devon\s engaged in a fraudulent scheme in connection with the solicitation\r     and management of Devon\s investment advisory clients\ funds.  The\r     Complaint alleged that the scheme resulted in the loss of millions of\r     dollars of municipal bond proceeds invested by school districts and other\r     local government units throughout Western and Central Pennsylvania.\r\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c\r\r\r\r\r\r\r          At the time the Complaint was filed, Devon managed approximately $345\r     million in assets for approximately 100 investment advisory clients, the\r     vast majority of which were local school districts seeking to invest the\r     proceeds of municipal bond offerings.  The Complaint alleged that Devon had\r     invested approximately $233 million of these funds, on behalf of 75 local\r     school districts, in a form of investment called a Collateralized\r     Investment Agreement (CIA).  In promotional materials, Devon represented\r     to these school districts that the CIA was an investment which paid a\r     specified rate of return over a fixed period and which was fully protected\r     by a pool of securities equalling the amount of the school districts\ total\r     principal investment.  The Complaint alleged that, in fact, the school\r     districts that had invested in the CIA program have suffered a combined\r     loss of their principal investment of approximately $71 million.  Finally,\r     the Complaint alleged that Black, Devon and FMS benefitted financially from\r     this fraudulent scheme.\r\r          The Complaint alleged that Devon, FMS and Black violated the antifraud\r     provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b)\r     of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The\r     Complaint further alleges that Devon, aided and abetted by Black, violated\r     the antifraud and custody provisions in Section 206(1), (2) and (4) of the\r     Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-2(a) thereunder.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 2======\r\x0c"

Uniglobe Trading Company, Inc., et.\r     al., 97 Civ. 08659 (USDC SDNY)\r\r          The Commission today filed an amended complaint and obtained emergency\r     relief in a pending action involving the offer to sell forged and\r     fictitious treasury bonds purportedly issued by the government of Japan. \r     Judge Charles Brieant issued a temporary restraining order and other relief\r     against Northeast Investment Institution, Inc. (Northeast), a Fayetteville,\r     North Carolina entity and against four representatives of Northeast\r     including Thomas Patrick McGlon, president and a director; Daniel\r     Watlington, secretary and a director; William Muwwakkill, vice-president,\r     treasurer and a director; and Tyrone P. Jones, III, a special consultant. \r     The Commission alleged in its complaint that since at least October 1997,\r     the defendants have been engaging in an apparent scheme to defraud U.S.\r     investors through the offer of fraudulent Japanese treasury bonds in\r     violation of the antifraud provisions, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act\r     of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and\r     Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Commission alleged that Northeast and its\r     representatives have offered for sale as many as 24 treasury bonds\r     purportedly issued by the Japanese government totalling 12 billion yen\r     (approximately [U.S.] $120 million).  The fraudulent bonds were seized by\r     the Federal Bureau of Investigation in October 1997 but the defendants\r     allegedly continued to offer the bonds alleging that 12 replacement bonds\r     had been issued representing the same purported 12 billion yen debt\r     obligation of Japan.  The Commission, introducing evidence from the\r     Japanese government, alleges that bonds are not valid obligations of Japan\r     and that Northeast and its representatives have used a fraudulent letter\r     from the Ministry of Finance of Japan purportedly authenticating the bonds.\r\r          To prevent Northeast, McGlon, Watlington, Muwwakkill, and Jones from\r     continuing to offer these and other securities and potentially selling them\r     to investors, the Commission requested the relief granted by Judge Brieant\r     including a temporary restraining order, an order freezing the bonds, and\r     an order that the defendants tender the instruments to the registry of the\r     Court.  Further, the Judge\s order requires an accounting from the\r     defendants of all assets, including financial instruments or government\r     bonds, held by the defendants or offered by the defendants for sale or\r     other transfer.  In addition to the emergency relief granted today, the\r     Commission seeks civil penalties against the defendants. \r\r          The Commission today also announced that Judge Brieant issued a\r     preliminary injunction against the five original defendants in that action\r     who offered to sell forged and fictitious certificates of deposits (CDs)\r     purportedly issued by an Argentinean bank in addition to the fictitious\r     treasury bonds purportedly issued by the government of Japan.  Judge\r     Charles Brieant issued the preliminary injunction against Uniglobe Trading\r     Company Inc. (Uniglobe), a Yonkers, New York entity which claims to assist\r     clients in the transfer of financial instruments and commodities; two of\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c\r\r\r\r\r\r\r     its officers, Clint Holland (Holland) and Margaret Laughrin (Laughrin);\r     Moorgreen Holdings Limited (Moorgreen), a Gibralter company with offices in\r     Spain; and a Moorgreen representative, Raymond Nakachian (Nakachian).  The\r     complaint alleged that the defendants have offered for sale at least two,\r     and possibly as many as sixteen, fraudulent certificates of deposit (CDs)\r     of Banco de la Nacion Argentina with stated principal amounts exceeding\r     [U.S.] $100 million each and a false certificate of custody depost (safe\r     keeping receipt) purportedly issued by Deutsche Bank Argentina S.A.  The\r     defendants offered the CDs, due to mature in approximately one year, at\r     substantial discounts from face value, in cash only transactions.  The\r     Commission, citing evidence from the Argentinean banks, alleged that the\r     instruments are fraudulent.

The five actions are the result of an undercover\r     investigation into illegal practices in the over-the-counter securities\r     markets conducted by the United States Attorney\s Office for the Southern\r     District of New York (USAO) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI),\r     with assistance from the Commission and the National Association of\r     Securities Dealers Regulation (NASDR).  This is the same undercover\r     investigation that on October 10, 1996, led to arrest of forty-six (46)\r     individuals, and the institution of administrative proceedings by the\r     Commission against twenty-nine (29) of the individuals arrested.  \r\r          In today\s actions, the allegedly fraudulent schemes involve: (a)\r     payments of bribes totalling approximately $3.3 million to brokers who, in\r     turn, induced their customers to purchase microcap securities; (b)\r     manipulation of the prices set by market makers for purchase and sale of\r     those microcap stocks; and (c) material misrepresentations about the\r     companies that issued microcap securities.  The defendants in these actions\r     include: (a) so-called stock promoters who paid the bribes and\r\x0c\r\r\r\r     manipulated the public markets for microcap securities; (b) individual\r     brokers and several brokerage firms who received bribes and engaged in\r     other fraudulent conduct; and (c) senior management of the companies that\r     issued the securities.  In each of these actions, the Commission seeks\r     permanent injunctions against future violations of the federal securities\r     laws, court orders prohibiting the defendants from future participation in\r     offerings of penny stocks, and disgorgement the alleged profits of the\r     fraudulent schemes, plus pre-judgment interest.  \r\r          As detailed further below, fourteen of the defendants named in these\r     actions are, or have been, the subject of parallel criminal proceedings\r     brought by the USAO involving conduct related to the allegations contained\r     in the Commission\s Complaint\s.  \r\r     1.   SEC v. Szur, et al.\r\r          The Commission\s Complaint, filed in Manhattan, alleges as follows:\r\r          Defendants Jeffrey Szur and Bertram Slutsky directed a scheme to\r     manipulate the market for securities issued by Securitek International,\r     Inc. (Securitek), a Delaware corporation supposedly engaged in developing\r     and marketing security systems, during the period from January 1996 through\r     August 1996.  At the time of the fraud Szur was the President and indirect\r     owner of defendant J.S. Securities, Inc., a registered broker-dealer that\r     later changed its name to First National Equity Corp. (JSSI), Slutsky was\r     Securitek\s former president and, with his companion, defendant Diane\r     Lakin, Securitek\s largest shareholders.  Slutsky paid undisclosed bribes\r     to Szur and JSSI employees of up to 50% of the proceeds from the sales of\r     Securitek stock to unsuspecting retail customers.  These bribes enabled\r     Slutsky and Lakin to sell their large block of Securitek stock into an\r     artificially pumped-up public market.  Slutsky and Lakin sold more than 1.5\r     million shares of Securitek stock for more than $3.5 million, while Szur\r     and JSSI employees received approximately $1.2 million in bribes from\r     Slutsky.\r\r          Szur recruited defendants Vadim Kaplun and Joseph Epstein to operate a\r     JSSI branch office located at 63 Wall Street (the 63 Wall Branch) as a\r     boiler room where registered and unregistered salespersons engaged in\r     fraudulent, high-pressure sales tactics in the offer and sale of Securitek\r     stock to retail customers.  Szur also recruited defendants Cary Weinstein\r     and David Gold to operate a JSSI branch office in Westbury, New York (the\r     Westbury Branch), which also operated as a boiler room, and defendants\r     Ronald Gray and Alex Levin, unregistered persons, to operate two additional\r     cold-calling operations to sell Securitek to retail customers.  Szur never\r     identified Gray\s and Levin\s operations to the NASD as branch offices of\r     JSSI.  Szur purported to be the registered representative for trades\r     executed by Gray, while defendant George Elian, a registered broker,\r     purported to be the registered representative for trades executed by\r     Levin\s group. Slutsky paid bribes to Szur, Kaplun, Weinstein, Gold, and\r     others. Finally, to conceal the scheme, Szur and other JSSI employees\r     falsified JSSI\s books and records and provided false and misleading\r     documents to the Commission staff.\r\r          Based on the conduct described above concerning Securitek, the\r     Commission alleges that Szur, Slutsky, JSSI, Kaplun, Weinstein, Gold, Gray,\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 2======\r\x0c\r\r\r\r     and Levin violated the general antifraud provisions of the Securities Act\r     of 1933 (Securities Act), and of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934\r     (Exchange Act).  The Commission alleges that Lakin, Elaine Szur, and Elian\r     aided and abetted the violations of the antifraud provisions of the\r     Exchange Act by Szur, Slutsky, and JSSI.  In addition, the Commission\r     charges that JSSI violated the broker-dealer antifraud provisions, the\r     books and records, and the Commission\s penny stock rules (Sections\r     10(b), 15(b), 15(c), 15(g), and 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-3,\r     15b-7, 15c1-2, 15g-2, 15g-3, 15g-4, 15g-5, 15g-6, 15g-9, 17a-3, and 17a-4\r     thereunder).  The Commission further alleges that Szur and Elaine Szur are\r     liable as control persons, pursuant to Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act,\r     for the above violations of the Exchange Act and related rules by JSSI. \r     Finally, the Commission alleges that Kaplun, Weinstein, Gold, Gray, and\r     Levin violated the broker-dealer registration provisions of the Exchange\r     Act.\r\r          On July 31, 1997, the USAO obtained a superseding, 29-count indictment\r     against Szur, Elaine Szur, Kaplun, Weinstein, Gold, and Gray, in connection\r     with sales of Securitek stock to JSSI customers (the Securitek Criminal\r     Action).  Defendants in the Securitek Criminal Action are charged with: (a)\r     conspiracy to commit securities fraud, wire fraud, and commercial bribery;\r     (b) wire fraud; (c) commercial bribery; (d) creating false books and\r     records for JSSI; and (e) money laundering.  In early August 1997, in\r     connection with sales of Securitek stock, Slutsky pled guilty to\r     (a) conspiracy to commit securities fraud, wire fraud, and commercial\r     bribery; and (b) securities fraud.  Of those charged today, six are\r     awaiting trial on the superseding indictment.\r\r     2.   SEC v. Badger, et al.\r\r          The Commission\s Complaint, filed in Salt Lake City, Utah, alleges as\r     follows:\r\r          During the period from early 1993 through early 1996, defendant George\r     Badger directed a scheme to manipulate the market for securities issued by\r     defendant Golf Communities of America, Inc., f.k.a. Golf Ventures, Inc.\r     (GVI) by bribing registered broker-dealers and some individual registered\r     representatives to sell GVI stock to unsuspecting retail customers, and\r     causing GVI to file false periodic reports with the Commission and to issue\r     false press releases to the public.  GVI is a Utah corporation primarily\r     engaged in developing a golf course known as Red Hawk International Golf &\r     Country Club (the Red Hawk Project).  \r\r          Badger and his son, defendant Karl Badger, arranged to have bribes\r     paid in the form of cash payments or free GVI securities to registered\r     representatives and broker-dealers.  In October 1993, GVI paid a $10,000\r     consulting fee to Burnett Grey & Co., at the time a registered broker-\r     dealer, in exchange for Burnett Grey directing its brokers to sell GVI\r     stock to its retail customers.  That agreement was negotiated by Badger and\r     defendant Marion Sherrill, the then-President of Burnett Grey.  In December\r     1993, after Sherrill left Burnett Grey, defendant Harmon S. Hardy, the\r     majority shareholder of Burnett Grey, agreed with Badger to continue to\r     sell GVI stock to its retail customers.  As additional compensation for\r     Burnett Grey\s selling efforts, Badger later arranged for a block of GVI\r     shares to be transferred to Burnett Grey so that Burnett Grey could meet\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 3======\r\x0c\r\r\r\r     its net capital requirements and continue to operate as a broker-dealer. \r     During the period from October 1993 through February 1994, defendant Terry\r     Hughes and other brokers employed by Burnett Grey caused their customers to\r     purchase approximately 48,000 shares of GVI stock for approximately\r     $340,000, pursuant to the agreement between GVI and Burnett Grey.\r\r          After Burnett Grey went out of business in early 1994, defendant\r     Marvin Susemihl introduced Badger to defendant Harold Gallison, the\r     President of defendant La Jolla Capital Financial Corp. (La Jolla Capital),\r     a registered broker-dealer,  where Susemihl was a registered\r     representative.  Susemihl and Gallison negotiated an arrangement whereby\r     GVI paid La Jolla Capital approximately $35,000 as a phony consulting fee\r     in exchange for La Jolla Capital directing its brokers to sell GVI stock to\r     La Jolla Capital\s retail customers.  During the period from May 1994\r     through August 1994, La Jolla Capital representatives, including Hughes and\r     Susemihl, arranged the purchase of approximately 63,000 shares of GVI stock\r     at an aggregate price of approximately $498,000, pursuant to the agreement\r     between GVI and La Jolla Capital.\r\r          Badger and Karl Badger paid bribes to defendants David Rosenthal,\r     Andrew Sears, and William Slone, registered representatives associated with\r     other broker-dealers, who sold GVI stock to their retail customers in\r     exchange for the payments received from Badger and Karl Badger.  \r\r          Finally, during 1995 and 1996, GVI failed to disclose in various\r     public filings and announcements that Badger controlled GVI, making nearly\r     all important decisions regarding GVI\s business activities.  In addition,\r     GVI made material misstatements and omitted critical facts concerning its\r     principal business -- the development of a residential golfing and\r     recreational community, the Red Hawk Project, on undeveloped land in\r     southwestern Utah.  For example, in late October and early November 1996,\r     GVI announced that Granite Construction Corp. (Granite) had completed 85%\r     of the mass dirt movement associated with the Red Hawk Project, should\r     complete onsite sewer installation by Wednesday, Oct. 30, and that Granite\r     had completed installation of certain sewer lines.  In fact, Granite walked\r     off the job in late October 1996, after completing less than 50% of its\r     scheduled work, because GVI had run out of money to pay Granite. \r     Defendants Duane Marchant and Stephen Spencer served as GVI\s President and\r     Chief Financial Officer, respectively, at the time that GVI engaged in\r     these false and misleading disclosures.  \r\r          Based on the foregoing, the Commission alleges in its complaint that\r     Badger, GVI, Marchant, Spencer, Karl Badger, Sherrill, Hardy, La Jolla\r     Capital, Gallison, Susemihl, Hughes, Slone, Rosenthal, and Sears violated\r     the general antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. In\r     addition to the relief the Commission is seeking in all these actions, in\r     this particular action, the Commission seeks a permanent bar against\r     Badger, Marchant, and Spencer from serving as an officer or director of any\r     public company.\r\r          In April 1997, Badger pled guilty in the United States District Court\r     for the Southern District of New York to a four-count information alleging:\r     (i) conspiracy to commit securities fraud, wire fraud, money laundering and\r     commercial bribery; (ii) securities fraud; (iii) criminal contempt; and\r     (iv) perjury.  \r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 4======\r\x0c\r\r\r\r     3.   SEC v. Scudiero, et al.\r\r          The Commission\s Complaint, filed in Manhattan, alleges as follows:\r\r          During the period from late 1995 through October 1996, defendant\r     Andrew Scudiero directed fraudulent schemes to manipulate the markets for\r     securities issued by Interactive Information Solutions, Inc. (Interactive),\r     a New York corporation engaged in developing voice-data technology, and\r     StockNet, Inc. (StockNet), a Delaware corporation primarily engaged in the\r     business of developing an internet fantasy stock market game.  Scudiero\s\r     schemes involved bribing registered representatives to sell shares of\r     Interactive and StockNet to retail customers, and controlling the prices\r     offered for the companies\ securities.  Scudiero received large blocks of\r     stock issued by those companies at the time that he arranged for the\r     securities of those companies to become publicly traded.\r\r          In early 1996, Scudiero set up a brokerage operation in New York City\r     associated with First Liberty Investment Group (First Liberty), a\r     registered broker-dealer.  Because Scudiero had been barred from the\r     securities industry as a result of his criminal conviction for drug\r     dealing, Scudiero arranged for defendant Eric Nicholsberg to act as\r     Scudiero\s nominee at the First Liberty branch operation.  Thereafter,\r     Scudiero hired defendants Dominick Chieco, Craig Marino, Mat Matles, and\r     Raymond Selvaduri as brokers at his First Liberty branch and paid them more\r     than $100,000 in cash bribes in exchange for selling Interactive stock to\r     retail customers.  Defendant Frank Hartmann, at Scudiero\s direction, set\r     up various bank and brokerage accounts in his name that Scudiero used to\r     sell Interactive stock and pay cash bribes to brokers.  Scudiero determined\r     the price of Interactive stock and directed the market maker at another\r     registered broker-dealer to enter quotes for the stock and to purchase the\r     stock to fill customer orders with Interactive shares held in a brokerage\r     account controlled by Scudiero.  Nicholsberg, Chieco, Marino, Matles, and\r     Selvaduri sold over 115,000 shares of Interactive to unsuspecting retail\r     customers for more than $1 million.  In addition to retailing Interactive\r     through his First Liberty branch, Scudiero also bribed defendants Michael\r     Dreitlein,  Anthony Giambrone, and Ian Hosang, who were employed at other\r     broker-dealers, to sell Interactive stock to retail customers.  Dreitlein\r     and Giambrone sold approximately 95,000 Interactive shares to their retail\r     customers for approximately $900,000.  Hosang sold over 100,000 shares to\r     his customers at a cost of approximately $800,000.  \r\r          During September-October 1996, Scudiero paid bribes totalling\r     approximately $1.5 million to Nicholsberg, Caputo, Chieco, Marino, Matles,\r     Selvaduri, and Hosang to sell StockNet securities to their retail\r     customers.  These bribes were in the form of both cash payments and\r     StockNet securities.  As a result, over 500,000 shares of StockNet were\r     sold to retail customers for more than $3 million.\r\r          Based on the conduct described above, the Commission alleges that\r     Scudiero, Nicholsberg, Caputo, Chieco, Marino, Matles, Selvaduri,\r     Dreitlein, Giambrone, and Hosang violated the general antifraud provisions\r     of the federal securities laws.  The Commission also alleges that Hartmann\r     aided and abetted Scudiero\s violations.  \r\r\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 5======\r\x0c\r\r\r\r          In April 1997, Scudiero was indicted on three counts of wire fraud and\r     one count of interstate travel in aid of a fraud in connection with the\r     Interactive fraud. \r\r     4.   SEC v. Ruge, et al.\r\r          The Commission\s complaint, filed in Manhattan, alleges as follows:\r\r          From early 1995 through early 1996, defendants Leonard Alexander Ruge,\r     Richard Wolff, Jeffery Stone, and Mac Beagelman engaged in a fraudulent\r     scheme to manipulate the market for securities issued by International\r     Investment Group, Ltd. (IIGR), a Delaware corporation engaged in the\r     development of telephone technology.  At the time, Beagelman was IIGR\s\r     Chairman and one of its principal stockholders.  Beagelman negotiated\r     agreements with Ruge, Wolff, and Stone whereby each of them received blocks\r     of IIGR stock at the price of $1.00 per share from the company.  The stock\r     was then deposited into brokerage accounts in Canada and the United States,\r     and customer buy orders were filled with stock from these accounts.  Once\r     the proceeds were sent to the brokerage firms maintaining these accounts,\r     IIGR received $1 per share, and Ruge, Wolff, and Stone received the\r     balance, which they used to pay themselves and to pay bribes to brokers who\r     generated the purchase orders.  \r\r          Beginning in mid-1995, Wolff paid bribes totalling approximately\r     $75,000 to defendants Michael Scott Symons, Eugene Flaksman, Mark Furman,\r     Alex Grinshpon, Daniel Kolchkov, Jeff Sanders, Alex Solon, and Mark\r     Zaborsky in exchange for these defendants selling IIGR stock to their\r     retail customers.  At that time, Symons, Flaksman, Furman, Grinshpon,\r     Kolchkov, Sanders, Solon, and Zaborsky worked at Symons Financial Group\r     (Symons Financial) in Boca Raton, Florida, a branch operation of Investech\r     Capital Corporation, a registered broker-dealer.  During the period from\r     June to August 1995, these defendants sold approximately 100,000 shares of\r     IIGR stock to their customers for $230,000.  In 1995, Wolff also paid\r     bribes totalling approximately $9,000 to defendants Richard Balber and\r     Stephen Evers in exchange for these defendants selling IIGR stock to their\r     retail customers.  At that time, Balber and Evers worked at a branch office\r     of Meyers Pollock & Robbins, Inc. (MPR), a registered broker-dealer,\r     located in Hollywood, Florida.  Balber and Evers sold approximately 6,800\r     shares of IIGR stock to their retail customers for $29,000.\r\r          In August 1995, Ruge took over the leadership of the IIGR manipulation\r     scheme from Wolff.  Ruge continued to pay bribes to the Symons Financial\r     brokers through Wolff and, in addition, paid bribes to Stone for sales of\r     IIGR stock to Stone\s retail customers.  At that time, Stone was operating\r     Stone Asset Management, Inc. in Dallas, Texas, as a branch operation of\r     T.L. Group, Ltd., a registered broker-dealer.  During the period from\r     August to December 1995, Stone sold approximately 200,000 shares of IIGR\r     for approximately $685,000, and received bribes totaling approximately\r     $150,000.  During the same period, the other broker defendants sold\r     approximately 200,000 additional shares for approximately $550,000, and\r     received bribes totaling approximately $175,000.\r\r          In December 1995, Stone took over the leadership of the IIGR\r     manipulation scheme from Ruge.  Thereafter, Beagelman paid Stone for retail\r     sales of IIGR stock by issuing stock at $1.00 per share to Stone, and\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 6======\r\x0c\r\r\r\r     permitting Stone to sell the stock at the market price of $1 1/2 and 2 1/4\r     per share to customers.  During January and February 1996, Stone sold\r     60,000 IIGR shares to his retail customers for $120,000.\r\r          Based on the conduct described above, the Commission alleges that\r     Ruge, Wolff, Stone, Beagelman, Symons, Balber, Evers, Flaksman, Furman,\r     Grinshpon, Kolchkov, Sanders, Solon, and Zaborsky violated the general\r     antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.\r\r          On July 31, 1997, the USAO obtained a superseding indictment against\r     Ruge, charging him with: (a) two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud\r     and commercial bribery; (b) two counts of wire fraud; and (c) one count of\r     interstate travel in aid of commercial bribery.  On September 30, 1997,\r     Symons was indicted by the USAO on charges of conspiracy to commit\r     securities fraud, wire fraud, and commercial bribery, and Stone was\r     indicted on charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and commercial\r     bribery.  \r\r     5.   SEC v. Pignatiello, et al.\r\r          The Commission\s complaint, filed in Manhattan, alleges as follows:\r\r          From September 1995 through early 1996, defendant Joseph Pignatiello\r     directed schemes to manipulate the markets for securities issued by\r     Spaceplex Amusement Centers International Ltd, Inc. (Spaceplex), a Nevada\r     corporation which operated a family amusement center in St. James, New\r     York, and America\s Coffee Cup, Inc. (ACC), a Colorado corporation that\r     sold coffee through one supermarket chain in southern California.  For both\r     Spaceplex and ACC, Pignatiello was hired by senior management of these\r     companies to manipulate the over-the-counter markets for the companies\\r     common stock in anticipation of making secondary public offerings based on\r     the artificially pumped-up markets for these securities.  \r\r          Defendant James Manas was the President of Spaceplex and one of its\r     principal stockholders.  Manas hired Pignatiello to raise the price of\r     Spaceplex stock to more than $5.00 per share in advance of a proposed $10\r     million secondary offering.  In turn, Pignatiello worked with defendants\r     John Fasano, Peter Mazzeo, and Constance Pignatiello in connection with the\r     Spaceplex manipulation.  Pignatiello and Fasano contacted an undercover FBI\r     agent posing as a broker (the Agent) and offered to pay the Agent a bribe\r     in the form of free Spaceplex stock in exchange for selling Spaceplex stock\r     to the Agent\s supposed retail customers.  As part of the Spaceplex\r     manipulation, Pignatiello directed Mazzeo to become a market maker in\r     Spaceplex stock.  At the time, Mazzeo worked as a trader at Colin, Winthrop\r     & Co., a registered broker-dealer.  Thereafter, Mazzeo followed\r     Pignatiello\s instructions in setting the prices at which Colin, Winthrop\r     offered to purchase and sell Spaceplex stock, including steadily raising\r     those prices during the period from early January through mid-February\r     1996.  In addition to directing Mazzeo\s operation as a market maker,\r     Pignatiello and Constance Pignatiello began purchasing Spaceplex stock\r     through Mazzeo in order to discourage downward pressure on the market price\r     for Spaceplex common stock.  The Spaceplex manipulation scheme slowly\r     ground to a halt when the Agent refused to carry through on Spaceplex\r     purchases because Pignatiello, Manas and Fasano failed to provide the Agent\r     with free-trading Spaceplex stock, and Spaceplex\s operating subsidiary\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 7======\r\x0c\r\r\r\r     experienced increasing financial difficulties and filed for bankruptcy\r     protection in April 1996.\r\r          In September 1995, defendants Robert Marsik and Mark Pierce hired\r     Pignatiello to raise the public market price of ACC common stock in advance\r     of a secondary offering of ACC securities.  At the time, Marsik and Pierce\r     served as directors of ACC and were ACC\s principal shareholders.  In\r     addition, Marsik served as ACC\s President.  From September 1995 through\r     March 1996, ACC paid Pignatiello a monthly fee for his services and\r     provided Pignatiello with a small block of ACC stock.  In turn, Pignatiello\r     directed Mazzeo at Colin, Winthrop to act as a market maker for ACC stock\r     and, through accounts controlled by Constance Pignatiello and himself,\r     Pignatiello began purchasing ACC stock to absorb the supply of ACC stock\r     coming into the market.  For example, during the period from October 1995\r     through April 1996, account records show that Pignatiello was responsible\r     for 94% of all retail purchases of ACC stock.  As Pignatiello exerted\r     control over the supply of ACC common stock, the price of ACC common stock\r     rose from $.20 in September 1995 to $2.00 per share in May 1996, just prior\r     to a scheduled secondary offering.  The ACC manipulation scheme failed to\r     achieve its original goals when the secondary offering scheduled for May\r     1996 was withdrawn by ACC\s underwriter and a secondary offering completed\r     in August 1996 involved much less favorable terms for ACC, Marsik and\r     Pierce.\r\r          Based on the conduct described above, the Commission alleges that\r     Pignatiello, Fasano, and Manas violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act\r     and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder in connection with their manipulation\r     of the price of Spaceplex stock.  The Commission further alleges that\r     Pignatiello, Marsik, and Pierce violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act\r     and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder in connection with their manipulation\r     of the price of ACC stock.  Finally, the Commission alleges that Mazzeo and\r     Constance Pignatiello aided and abetted Pignatiello\s violations of Section\r     10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.\r\r          In April 1997, Pignatiello and Fasano were indicted by the USAO on\r     charges of conspiracy, securities fraud, and wire fraud in connection with\r     the Spaceplex fraud (the Spaceplex Criminal Action).  Manas has pled guilty\r     to related criminal charges.\r\r     ____________\r\r          In the three administrative proceedings filed on October 10, 1996\r     against Szur and Slutsky, Scudiero, and Ruge, the Commission\s Division of\r     Enforcement today filed motions to dismiss the proceedings without\r     prejudice as the result of the civil actions filed today.

(IRG), and Nasim Nicky Aziz, formerly\r     Executive Vice President of IRG.  The complaint charges Sachdeva, 40, of\r     the Dallas, Texas area, with directing and participating in illegal schemes\r     to reduce IRG\s operating expenses and increase its income, which rendered\r     IRG\s registration statement for its Initial Public Offering (IPO) false\r     and misleading.  The complaint charges Aziz, 38, also of the Dallas area,\r     with knowingly falsifying books and records in furtherance of a post-IPO\r     scheme to reduce IRG\s expenses.  IRG, a Carrollton, Texas-based\r     distributor of computers and computer-related equipment, is now in Chapter\r     7 bankruptcy proceedings.  The Commission\s complaint alleges the\r     following:\r\r          In 1992 and 1993 Sachdeva directed the company to submit fraudulent\r     claims for reimbursement of certain co-operative advertising expenses to\r     computer manufacturers whose products IRG sold.  Sachdeva also directed IRG\r     employees to use fraudulent airline tickets for business travel.  These\r     fraudulent schemes materially reduced IRG\s expenses by an amount\r     equivilant to 8.5 percent and 5.1 percent, respectively, of IRG\s reported\r     pre-tax income for the first quarter of fiscal 1993 (October-December 1992)\r     and for the first and second quarters (October 1992-March 1993), and\r     financial statements reflecting these fraudulently-avoided expenses were\r     included as part of the registration statement for IRG\s IPO in May 1993. \r     In addition, the registration statement failed to disclose that IRG had\r     reduced its expenses fraudulently, or to disclose the risks that the\r     advertising scheme posed to IRG\s continued relationships with its key\r     suppliers.  In furtherance of these schemes, Sachdeva authorized false\r     entries in IRG\s books and records, ignored known deficiencies concerning\r     IRG\s internal controls, and concealed the misconduct from IRG\s auditors\r     and underwriters.  \r\r          After the IPO Sachdeva and Aziz engaged in additional fraudulent\r     schemes, and directed or countenanced other fraud by IRG employees to\r     reduce IRG\s operating expenses.  These schemes included intentionally\r     damaging computers so that they could be returned as defective, shipping\r     computers with false FCC compliance certifications, purchasing bootleg\r     Microsoft software for resale, continuing to use fraudulent airline\r     tickets, and attempting to evade customs duties.  With respect to the\r     scheme involving customs duties, Aziz obtained a fictitious invoice that\r     understated the price of computers to be purchased overseas in an attempt\r     to avoid paying the import duty on the full value of the computers.  \r\r\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c\r\r\r\r\r\r\r          Simultaneously with the filing of the complaint, Sachdeva consented,\r     without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, to the entry\r     of a final judgment enjoining him from future violations of Section 17(a)\r     of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B) and\r     13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and\r     Exchange Act Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1, and requiring him to pay a civil\r     penalty of $50,000.

The complaint alleges\r     that from August through November 1992, DeSimone, a former registered\r     representative at PaineWebber Inc. ( PaineWebber ), DeCabia, a former\r     registered representative at Josephthal Lyon & Ross, Inc., now Josephthal &\r     Co. ( Josephthal ), and Gary Moody, a self-described dealer in prime bank\r     securities, engaged in a scheme to defraud the Nauru Phosphate Royalties\r     Trust ( the Trust ) out of approximately $20 million for the purchase of\r     prime bank securities.  The defendants never purchased any prime bank\r     securities for the Trust because such securities do not exist.  DeSimone,\r     DeCabia and Moody were each convicted of a felony in the state of New York\r     as a result of their involvement in the scheme.\r\r     The Commission s complaint alleges that the Trust exists for the benefit of\r     the residents of the Republic of Nauru, a small island nation off the coast\r     of Australia.  The complaint alleges that by mining and selling phosphate\r     deposits, a chemical constituent of bird guano, the Trust amassed\r     considerable funds, some of which the Trust invested with the defendants. \r     The complaint also alleges that through a series of fraudulent\r     misrepresentations, DeCabia persuaded an agent of the Trust to deposit\r     $20.75 million of the Trust s funds into an account at Josephthal for the\r     purchase of prime bank securities.  DeCabia was the registered\r     representative on that account.  According to the complaint, through a\r     series of further misrepresentations, the defendants persuaded an agent of\r     the Trust to transfer a total of $20.55 million from the Josephthal account\r     to an account at PaineWebber in the name of Moody s alter-ego corporation. \r     DeSimone was the registered representative on that account.  The complaint\r     alleges that without the knowledge or consent of the Trust, the defendants\r     caused $19.75 million of the Trust s funds to be transferred from the\r     account at PaineWebber to an account in Singapore.  The complaint also\r     alleges that the defendants never purchased any securities on behalf of the\r     Trust.

The\r     Commission also announced that earlier this week, on December 16, 1997, it\r     filed a lawsuit in the Central District of California against William Madon\r     (Madon), alleging antifraud and securities registration violations in\r     connection with the sale of interests in an unregistered investment\r     company.  The Commission alleges in its Complaint that Madon, a resident of\r     Coto de Caza, California, raised at least $5 million from approximately 250\r     investors nationwide to invest in Capital Growth.  Madon represented\r     Capital Growth to be a mutual fund with a portfolio of stocks.  In fact,\r     Capital Growth, Madon\s sole proprietorship, never purchased stock;\r     instead, Madon misappropriated investor funds for his own benefit and to\r     operate a Ponzi scheme.\r\r          The Commission\s Complaint charges Madon with violating the antifraud\r     provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities\r     Act), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5\r     thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act\r     of 1940 and the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and\r     5(c) of the Securities Act.

ROBERT HOWARD AND ROBERT E. VERRANDO,\r     U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (97 Civ. 9378\r     (SWK) (December 22, 1997)\r\r          The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a Complaint in the\r     U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against Robert\r     Howard and Robert E. Verrando, the Chairman and President, respectively, of\r     Presstek, Inc., a Hudson, New Hampshire-based manufacturer of printing\r     press technology and related products. Without admitting or denying the\r     allegations in the Complaint, Howard, 74, and Verrando, 66, consented to\r     the entry of final judgments of permanent injunction against them that also\r     require them to pay a total of $2.9 million in civil penalties. In a\r     related matter the Commission issued a Cease-and-Desist order against\r     Presstek by consent.\r\r          The Complaint alleges that between 1994 and 1996, Howard and Verrando\r     caused Presstek to disseminate, through its own statements and its\r     distribution of certain third-party statements, materially misleading\r     information concerning its sales and business prospects.  The Complaint\r     alleges that Presstek s stock price has been extremely volatile, and that\r     most of the false and misleading statements were made during a period in\r     which its price increased from $45 in November 1995 to $200 a share in May\r     1996.  They also occurred amid a public tug-of-war between investors with\r     long and short positions in Presstek stock.  Specifically, the Complaint\r     alleges the following: \r\r     In 1994 and 1995, Howard directed Presstek to distribute several thousand\r        copies of several editions of the Cabot Market Letter ( Cabot Letter ),\r        a financial newsletter that aggressively touted Presstek and which\r        contained excessive earnings projections for the company. Howard knew,\r        or was reckless in not knowing, that those earnings projections far\r        exceeded Presstek s contemporaneous internal projections.  Presstek\r        adopted those unrealistic projections by distributing the Cabot Letters\r        without disclaimer, and during a time when Presstek elected not to make\r        public its own projections because management did not view them as\r        reliable.\r\r     In the Fall of 1995 and continuing thereafter, Presstek failed to disclose\r        adverse developments in its business relationship with its primary\r        customer, Heidelberger Druckmaschinen A.G. ( Heidelberg ).\r\r          In May 1995, Heidelberg, a large German printing press manufacturer,\r          had unveiled the Quickmaster-DI ( Quickmaster ), a new printing press\r          that used Presstek s technology and equipment.  However, in September\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c\r\r\r\r\r\r\r          1995, Heidelberg management informed Howard that mass commercial\r          shipment of the Quickmaster would be postponed due to problems with\r          the press s performance.  By November 1995, as a result of\r          Heidelberg s delay, Heidelberg \r\r          and Presstek also agreed to reduce Presstek s shipments to Heidelberg\r          of equipment for the Quickmaster by 25 percent for 1996.  Prior to the\r          reduction, Presstek had planned to increase its shipments in 1996 by\r          50 percent.  Heidelberg agreed to provide Presstek with monetary\r          concessions to help Presstek maintain capacity and offset earnings\r          lost due to the production delay, including the payment to Presstek of \r          $7 million in equal monthly payments through 1996. \r\r          Although fully informed of this situation, Verrando drafted a press\r          release concerning the Quickmaster that was issued by Presstek on\r          November 7, 1995.  Howard read that release shortly before or after it\r          was issued.  That press release falsely claimed Heidelberg had  sold \r          over 500 Quickmasters, when, in fact, Heidelberg had only received\r          more than 500 orders for the press.  Additionally, the press release\r          failed to disclose the technical problems that delayed commercial\r          production, or that such problems resulted in a reduction of\r          Presstek s shipments of  Quickmaster systems for 1996.  Presstek s\r          Form 10-K for 1995, and its Forms 10-Q for the first three quarters of\r          1996, also failed to disclose the adverse developments with\r          Heidelberg. \r\r     Later in November 1995, Howard reviewed and edited the draft of a research\r        analyst\s report on Presstek and had Presstek distribute the report,\r        which in final form substantially overstated Presstek\s sales and\r        earnings expectations.  For example, the report projected 1996 sales of\r        another Presstek laser imaging product of $26 million, when Presstek\r        internally projected only $10 million.  It also projected 1996 sales of\r        consumable printing plates of $33.2 million, contrasted with Presstek s\r        internal projection of $8.7 million.  It projected 1997 earnings of\r        $2.42 per share, 80% more than Presstek s internal projection of $1.34\r        per share. Howard did not correct those errors, and Presstek distributed\r        the erroneous report for more than six months to investors without\r        disclaimer.  Verrando was aware that projections in the analyst s report\r        were significantly greater than Presstek s contemporaneous projections,\r        but failed to halt its distribution.\r\r     \xf9  The price of Presstek stock increased by a material amount the first\r        trading day after the release of the November 7 press release (15%) and\r        the release of the research analyst s report (10%).\r\r          Simultaneously with the filing of the Complaint, Howard and Verrando\r     consented, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint,\r     to the entry of a final judgment enjoining them from future violations of\r     Sections 10(b) and 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange\r     Act), and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 13a-1, 13a-13 and 12b-20.  Howard and\r     Verrando agreed to pay civil penalties of $2.7 million and $200,000,\r     respectively.\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 2======\r\x0c\r\r\r\r\r\r\r          In the settled cease-and-desist proceedings, the Commission found that\r     Presstek violated the same provisions of the securities laws.  Without\r     admitting or denying the findings therein, Presstek has consented to the\r     entry of an Order making findings and ordering Presstek to cease and desist\r\r\r     from further violations of these provisions described in the Complaint.
