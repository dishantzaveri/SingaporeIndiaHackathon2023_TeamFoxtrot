24038,2018,SEC Halts Ongoing Fraud by Purported Hedge Fund Manager,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a purported hedge fund manager in New York City with a brazen offering and investment adviser fraud thereby putting an end to an ongoing scheme.The SEC alleges that, since at least 2014, Nicholas Joseph Genovese and his hedge fund Willow Creek Investments LP raised more than $5.3 million from at least six investors by affirmatively misrepresenting his prior money-management, securities industry experience, and size of operations.Â In particular, the SEC charged that Genovese:Â falsely stated that he managed $4 billion of the Genovese Drug Store familys assets; falsely stated that his hedge funds investment adviser had $30-39 billion of assets under management, when, in reality, it appears to have had less than $10 million in assets under management; falsely stated that his advisory firm had between 42 and 60 employees, when, in reality, it had less than 10 employees; andÂ falsely stated that his hedge fund had investment gains of 30-40 percentÂ per year, when, in reality, it sustained losses.Â In addition, in furtherance of his scheme, Genovese lied about his education and prior work experience, and concealed his criminal past from investors.The SEC also alleges that Genovese and his advisory firm Willow Creek Advisors LLC misappropriated investor funds to fund securities trading in Genoveses personal brokerage account, which sustained over $8 million of trading losses between 2015 and 2017, and Genoveses lifestyle by paying approximately $263,000 for, among other things, ATM cash withdrawals, food, hotel and transportation charges, including being chauffeured in a Bentley. According to the SECs complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Genoveses fraud appears to be ongoing evidence by recent money coming into his account as well as a recent refusal of an investors redemption request.The SECs complaint charges Genovese and his hedge fund with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and charges Genovese and his advisory firm with violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.Â The SEC is seeking a temporary restraining order to freeze their assets and prohibit them from committing further violations of the federal securities laws.Â  The SEC seeks a final judgment ordering them to disgorge their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and for Genovese and his investment advisory firm to pay financial penalties.The U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York has filed parallel criminal charges against Genovese.The SECs investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Gerald Gross, Alexander Vasilescu, James Hanson, Karen Lee, and Adam Nowicki of the New York Regional Office.Â The litigation will be led by Mr. Vasilescu, Mr. Hanson and Ms. Lee.Â The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.Â The SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Steven Vitulano, Terrence P.

24049,2018,Court Orders Connecticut Hedge Fund Manager and Firms to Pay Nearly $13 Million in SEC Case,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that it obtained final judgments against a Ridgefield, Connecticut-based hedge fund manager and his investment advisory businesses.  The federal court in Connecticut ordered the defendants to pay nearly $13 million in disgorgement and penalties after the court had previously determined that the defendants had illegally diverted investor money for use by other hedge funds that were illiquid and in need of cash.The court earlier found Stephen Hicks and the businesses liable on the SECs claim that they misappropriated investor funds.  The SEC alleged that investors were defrauded because they were not told about the transfers of hedge fund assets while they were taking place.  According to the SECs complaint, Hicks sent a letter to investors admitting that legal and administrative expenses had been improperly allocated between funds, but rather than repaying the money, he transferred illiquid securities to the funds.The February 10th judgments against Stephen Hicks, Southridge Capital Management LLC, and Southridge Advisors LLC incorporated the Partial Final Judgment issued by the District Court on August 2, 2017.  The Final Judgment enjoined the Southridge entities and Hicks from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933; and Section 206(1), (2), and (4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder, and required them to pay $7,864,064 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest that was previously ordered.  Hicks also must pay a $5 million penalty.The additional claims resolved by the final judgments involved accusations that Hicks fraudulently misstated the value of the funds largest investment to artificially inflate the management fees Defendants collected from investors.  This settlement also resolves allegations that Hicks fraudulently solicited investors by telling them that the majority of their investments would be placed in unrestricted, free-trading shares (meaning shares that were available to be sold), cash, or near cash.  According to the complaint, Hicks instead invested large portions of the solicited money in relatively illiquid deals.  The defendants consented to the entry of the final judgments, and neither admit nor deny the allegations in the SECs complaint.For further information, please refer to Litigation Release Nos. 23905 (Aug. 11, 2017) (partial final judgment and 21709 (Oct. 25, 2010) (case filed)."

The complaint, which the Commission filed in January 2015, charged investment adviser Daniel Thibeault and others with fraud for misappropriating money from an investment fund.  The complaint named Mr. Thibeaults wife, Shawnet Thibeault, as a relief defendant.  According to the complaint, she received some of the money that had been misappropriated from investors.  The judgment entered against Shawnet Thibeault orders her to disgorge over $500,000.According to the complaint, Mr. Thibeault misappropriated money from an investment fund that he was managing.  Specifically, the SEC alleged that Mr. Thibeault and his companies were the investment advisers to the GL Beyond Income Fund, and that they misappropriated at least $15 million of the Funds money.  According to the complaint, Mr. Thibeault represented that investors money would be pooled and used to make or purchase consumer loans.  These consumer loans would then constitute the Funds assets, and would provide a return to the investors when interest and principal payments were made on the loans.  The complaint alleged that Mr. Thibeault and the other defendants (not including Shawnet Thibeault) engaged in a scheme to create fictitious loans to steal money from the Fund, and to report those fake loans as assets of the Fund.  Mr. Thibeault and the other defendants designed this scheme to conceal their misappropriation of millions of dollars from the Fund.The final judgment against Shawnet Thibeault orders her to pay disgorgement of $468,236, representing money she received as a result of the violations alleged in the Complaint, along with prejudgment interest of $49,826, for a total of $518,062.  These funds will be added to the restitution fund in Daniel Thibeaults related criminal case, United States v. Daniel Thibeault, Crim. No. 15-cr-10031-LTS (D. Mass.), which is expected to be distributed to harmed investors by the United States Attorneys Office.For further information, see Litigation Release Nos. 23718 (Jan. 12, 2017) [Final Judgment Against Defendant Entities]; 23654 (Sept. 26, 2016) [Final Judgment Against Thibeault]; 23573 (June 20, 2016) [Criminal Sentencing]; 23488 (Mar. 11, 2016) [Criminal Plea]; 23207 (Feb. 26, 2015) [Criminal Indictment]; 23178 (Jan. 22, 2015) [Entry of Asset Freeze]; 23171 (Jan. 9, 2015) [Civil Complaint]."
24053,2018,Court Enters Judgments Against Remaining Defendants in SEC Insider Trading Case Involving Massachusetts-Based Group of Amateur Golfers,"On January 10, 2018 and February 16, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts entered final judgments against Jamie Meadows and Eric McPhail, respectively, defendants in an SEC enforcement action filed in July 2014 alleging that McPhail, Meadows and others committed insider trading in the stock of Massachusetts-based American Superconductor Corp.  The SEC has now obtained final judgments against all of the defendants in this case, and has obtained orders for full disgorgement of all ill-gotten gains against the traders.The SECs complaint, filed on July 11, 2014, alleged that McPhail repeatedly provided non-public information about American Superconductor to six of his friends, including Meadows.  McPhails source of inside information was an American Superconductor executive who belonged to the same country club as McPhail and was a close friend.  According to the complaint, from July 2009 through April 2011, the executive told McPhail about American Superconductors expected earnings, contracts, and other major pending corporate developments, trusting that McPhail would keep the information confidential, while McPhail instead misappropriated the inside information and tipped his friends, including Meadows, who improperly traded on the information.  The SECs complaint alleged that the six traders profited by a total of over $554,000 through their illegal insider trading.The judgment against McPhail, to which he consented, enjoined him from committing future violations of the antifraud provisions of federal securities laws.  In June 2015, McPhail was convicted after a jury trial in a related criminal insider trading action brought by the U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts, and in September 2015 he was sentenced to 18 months in prison and two years of supervised release.  The judgement against Meadows enjoined him from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, ordered him to pay full disgorgement of $191,521 plus prejudgment interest of $41,841, and ordered him to pay a civil penalty of $191,521.  Meadows had consented to a judgment with the injunction and disgorgement and interest amounts, and the court determined the amount of the penalty after a hearing.The five other defendants have previously settled the SECs charges by consenting to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of the Exchange Act, paying full disgorgement and civil penalties.  The judgments against McPhail and Meadows bring the SECs case to a conclusion.For further information, see Litigation Release Nos. 23686 (Nov. 9, 2016), 23357 (Sept. 21, 2015), 23323 (Aug. 19, 2015), 23289 (June 17, 2015), 23264 (May 18, 2015), and 23040 (July 11, 2014)."

24085,2018,"Rio Tinto, Former Top Executives Charged with Fraud","On October 17, 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged mining company Rio Tinto and two former top executives with fraud for inflating the value of coal assets acquired for $3.7 billion and sold a few years later for $50 million.The SECs complaint, which was filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that Rio Tinto, its former CEO Thomas Albanese, and its former CFO Guy Elliott failed to follow accounting standards and company policies to accurately value and record its assets.Â  Instead, as the project began to suffer one setback after another resulting in the rapid decline of the value of the coal assets, they sought to hide or delay disclosure of the nature and extent of the adverse developments from Rio Tintos Board of Directors, Audit Committee, independent auditors, and investors.Based on the complaints allegations, Rio Tinto plc, Rio Tinto Limited, Albanese, and Elliott are charged with violating the antifraud, reporting, books and records and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws.Â  The SEC seeks permanent injunctions, return of allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest, and civil penalties from all the defendants, and seeks to bar Albanese and Elliott from serving as public company officers or directors.According to the SECs complaint, in 2011, Rio Tinto acquired coal assets in Mozambique shortly after disclosing huge losses associated with its previous large-scale acquisition of Alcan.Â  Both acquisitions took place under Albaneses leadership.Â  The second acquisition was also unsuccessful as it was based on the incorrect assumption that Rio Tinto could inexpensively mine, transport, and sell large quantities of high-quality coal, chiefly using barges for shipping.Â  The SECs complaint alleges that the project suffered setbacks almost immediately, as Rio Tinto, Albanese, and Elliott learned that there was less coal and of lower quality than expected, and that Mozambique had rejected its barge application. The complaint alleges that the drop in quantity and quality of coal, coupled with the lack of infrastructure to transport it, significantly eroded the value of the acquisition.The complaint alleges that after already impairing Alcan twice, Rio Tinto, Albanese, and Elliott knew that publicly disclosing its second failure and rapidly declining value would call into question their ability to pursue the core of Rio Tintos business model to identify and develop long-term, low-cost, and highly-profitable mining assets.Â  Instead, they concealed the adverse developments, allowing Rio Tinto to release misleading financial statements days before a series of U.S. debt offerings.Â  Rio Tinto raised $5.5 billion from U.S. investors, approximately $3 billion of which was raised after May 2012, when executives at Rio Tinto Coal Mozambique had already told Albanese and Elliott that the subsidiary was likely worth negative $680 million.Â  The complaint alleges Albanese then repeated and reinforced the false positive outlook for the project in public statements.The alleged fraud continued until January 2013, when an executive in Rio Tintos Technology & Innovation Group discovered that the coal assets were being carried at an inflated value on Rio Tintos financial statements.Â  After an internal review allegedly triggered by the executives report to Rio Tintos Chairman, Rio Tinto announced that Albanese had resigned and the company reduced the value of the coal assets by more than $3 billion, or more than 80 percent.Â  After a second reduction, Rio Tinto sold the Mozambique subsidiary for $50 million, billions of dollars below the acquisition price.The SECs investigation was conducted by D. Mark Cave, Jeffrey Weiss, and George Spanos and supervised by Melissa Hodgman.Â  The SECs litigation will be conducted by Mr. Cave, Dean M. Conway, and Gregory Miller, and supervised by Bridget Fitzpatrick.Â  The SEC greatly appreciates the assistance and collaboration of the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority and the Australian Securities & Investments Commission."

24099,2018,Defendant in SEC Cases Involving Ticket Resale Investment Schemes Sentenced to More than Six Years Imprisonment in Parallel Criminal Case,"Joseph Meli has been sentenced by a federal court in Manhattan to more than six years in prison in connection with a multi-million dollar Ponzi scheme involving purported resales of tickets to popular concerts and Broadway shows.  The criminal case arises from the same conduct alleged in two Securities and Exchange Commission enforcement actions filed against Meli in 2017.Meli was arrested in January 2017 and later pleaded guilty to securities fraud.  In connection with his plea, Meli admitted to raising millions of dollars from investors including by providing some investors with fake agreements containing fraudulent signatures that claimed to show Melis company had agreements with various production and management companies to purchase large blocks of tickets.  On April 3, 2018, a federal court sentenced Meli to 78 months imprisonment followed by three years of supervised release, and ordered him to pay forfeiture in the amount of $104,765,565 and restitution in an amount to be finalized at a later date.In 2017, the SEC filed two enforcement actions against Meli in federal district court in Manhattan.  In the first action, the SEC alleged that Meli and his co-defendants solicited investments for the bulk purchase and resale of tickets to popular Broadway shows and concerts, but used the majority of the more than $97 million raised to make payments to earlier investors and to enrich Meli, his family, and a co-defendant.  On April 26, 2017, the court entered a preliminary injunction and asset freeze against Meli and his co-defendants in that matter.  In the second action, the SEC alleged that Meli and New York sports radio personality Craig Carton raised millions from investors by falsely claiming that they had access to large blocks of face-value tickets to popular concert performances.  Instead of purchasing tickets for resale, Carton and Meli allegedly misappropriated at least $3.6 million to repay earlier investors and to cover other expenses, including Cartons gambling debts.  Both SEC actions charge Meli and his co-defendants with securities fraud in violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SECs litigation against Meli and his co-defendants remains ongoing.The SECs cases are being handled by Dahlia Rin, John McCann, Martin Healey, and Celia Moore of the Boston Regional Office.

(Medical Action), a Brentwood, New York, medical products supplier.  According to the complaint, Barbera then told his father and brother that they should purchase Medical Action stock in advance of the acquisition so that they could profit from the deal.

Stanley ran a Ponzi scheme through his retirement planning and real estate investment business, The Lifepay Group, LLC.  Stanley is alleged to have lured at least thirty elderly victims to invest approximately $2.4 million of their retirement savings with baseless promises and claims of outsized investment returns.  He kept the scheme afloat for years by paying early investors with later investors funds and by convincing investors to roll over their investments.  The SEC further alleges that Stanley pilfered from the estate of an elderly womans family trust, diverting nearly $100,000 to fund the Lifepay Ponzi scheme.  In addition, the SECs complaint alleges that, beginning in 2015, Stanley and Michael E. Watts orchestrated a second offering fraud through a company they controlled, SMDRE, LLC.  Stanley and Watts allegedly used a collection of misrepresentations and empty promises to convince a group of predominantly elderly victims to invest roughly $1.4 million in SMDRE.Stanley is alleged to have used roughly $1.3 million of the Lifepay offering proceeds for personal expenses, including country club memberships, daily living expenses, travel, and entertainment expenses.  In addition, Watts and Stanley allegedly engaged in shell game transactions so they could use the vast majority of SMDRE investor funds for personal expenses and to keep the Lifepay Ponzi scheme afloat.The SECs complaint charges Stanley, Watts, Lifepay, and SMDRE with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.

24108,2018,SEC Detects Brokers Defrauding Customers,"On September 28, 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged three New York-based brokers with making unsuitable recommendations that resulted in substantial losses to customers and hefty commissions for the brokers.  One of the brokers agreed to pay more than $400,000 to settle the charges.Brokers must make recommendations that are compatible with their customers financial needs, investment objectives, and risk tolerances.  An SEC examination of the firm Alexander Capital L.P. detected potential misconduct among certain brokers, and the ensuing investigation has led to the filing of an SEC complaint against William C. Gennity and Rocco Roveccio.  The SEC also issued an order against Laurence M. Torres.The SECs complaint alleges that Gennity and Roveccio recommended investments that involved frequent buying and selling of securities without any reasonable basis to believe their customers would profit.  According to the complaint, since customers incur costs with every transaction, the price of the security must increase significantly during the brief period it is held in an account for even a minimal profit to be realized.The SEC further alleges that Gennity and Roveccio churned customer accounts, engaged in unauthorized trading, and concealed material information from their customers - namely that the transaction costs associated with their recommendations (commissions, markups, markdowns, postage, fees, and margin interest) would almost certainly outstrip any potential monetary gains in the accounts.  According to the SECs complaint, customer losses totaled $683,038 while Gennity and Roveccio received approximately $280,000 and $206,000, respectively, in commissions and fees.The SECs order against Torres finds that he had no reasonable basis to believe it was suitable to recommend a high-cost pattern of frequent trading that gave his customers virtually no chance of making even a minimal profit.  Torres also engaged in churning and made unauthorized trades.  Without admitting or denying the findings, Torres agreed to be barred from the securities industry and penny stock trading, and he must pay $225,359.36 in disgorgement plus $25,748.02 in interest, and a $160,000 penalty.The SECs litigation against Gennity and Roveccio will proceed in federal district court in Manhattan, with the complaint charging them with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.The SECs investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by David Oliwenstein, David Stoelting, Roseann Daniello, and Steven G. Rawlings.  The litigation will be led by Mr. Stoelting and Mr. Oliwenstein, and the case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.

Lee, who operated under an alias Rashid K. Khalfani and hid his past criminal convictions, with raising nearly $2 million through his firm Capital Cove Bancorp LLC for purported investments in two private funds that invested in distressed real estate.

24112,2018,Court Finds Two Brokers Liable for Fraud Involving Mortgage Backed Securities,"The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on March 29, 2018, Judge Kenneth A. Marra of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida issued a final judgment in a bench trial conducted in 2011 against eight former Brookstreet Securities Corp. brokers.Â  The SEC had alleged that the brokers committed fraud related to their sale of Collateralized Mortgage Obligations (CMOs), which are created from mortgage backed securities.  The SECs complaint alleged that the brokers misrepresented the CMOs to their customers as safe, secure, liquid investments that guaranteed by the United States government and suitable for retirees, retirement accounts, and investors with conservative investment goals.  In fact, according to the complaint, many of the CMOs purchased for Brookstreet customer accounts carried no government backing, were largely illiquid, and were only suitable for sophisticated investors with a high-risk investment profile.The court ruled in the SECs favor against two of the brokers, William Betta, Jr. and Travis A. Branch, and issued an injunction permanently restraining them from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.Â  The court declined to impose civil penalties, but retained jurisdiction to conduct further proceedings to determine the amount of disgorgement against Betta and Branch.Â  The court also issued final judgments in favor of defendants Troy L. Gagliardi, Alfred B. Rubin, Steven I. Shrago, Russell M. Kautz, and Shane A. McCann.Â Â Clifford Popper, the Brookstreet broker who selected the CMOs for Brookstreet investor accounts, died after trial and before the judgment was issued.Before trial, Barry M. Kornfeld and James J.

Â Pursuant to his settlement, Caprio disgorged $81,673, paid $130,000 in civil penalties, and agreed to be barred from associating with any broker, dealer, or investment adviser for a period of ten years.Â  Kornfeld entered into a bifurcated settlement in which he agreed to be barred from barred from associating with any broker, dealer, or investment adviser, with monetary relief to be determined at a later date.The SECs investigation was conducted by Morgan B.

According to the complaint, Chahal lured investors by falsely claiming to be an experienced and successful trader who could generate above-market returns for clients through a low-risk trading strategy.  The SEC alleges that, in reality, Chahal had substantially no experience working in the financial or securities industry or trading securities on behalf of clients.  The complaint further alleges Chahal initially invested client funds in a variety of investments, but suffered significant trading losses.  According to the complaint, instead of disclosing the losses, Chahal lied to his clients about their investment returns, continued raising funds, then used the money for his personal benefit, including to pay for his luxury car, rent, travel, dining, and other living expenses, and to make Ponzi-like payments to earlier investors.The U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Virginia also announced criminal charges against Chahal.  The Commodities Futures Trading Commission also charged Chahal.The SECs complaint, filed in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia on April 12, 2018, charges Chahal with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

As part of Milnes criminal sentence, the court ordered him to pay the remaining $5.25 million to the SEC as a condition of his supervised release.At a hearing on April 5, 2018, the court found that, while Milne had paid approximately $500,000 of the $5.25 million still due to the SEC, he had the ability to pay much more as evidenced by his expenditures on luxury services, personal items, and travel.  Although the court had previously continued the hearing on multiple occasions to provide Milne the opportunity to make additional payments to the SEC, he repeatedly failed to do so.The case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael S. McGarry from the District of Connecticut with the assistance of Marsha C. Massey, Supervisory Assistant Chief Litigation Counsel and head of the SECs Office of Collections."

In separate, settled administrative proceedings, the SEC charged another individual and two public companies related to one of the schemes.The SECs complaint alleges that attorney Diane J. Harrison, Esq. and her husband, Michael J. Daniels, both of Palmetto, Florida, manufactured at least five microcap issuers with the undisclosed intent to sell them based on their status as public companies with purportedly unrestricted shares available for resale in the public markets.  According to the complaint, Daniels and Harrison created the false appearance that the companies were pursuing specific business plans with independent management and shareholders by installing friends and family (including defendant Catherine A. Bradaick-Zolla of Sarasota, Florida, who also provided other assistance to the fraud) as purported officers and shareholders.  The SEC alleges that, in reality, Daniels and Harrison controlled the shares.  According to the complaint, Daniels and Harrison sold four of the five companies to Andy Z. Fan of Las Vegas, Nevada and, along with Bradaick-Zolla, continued to provide support to Fan.Â  For example, the SEC alleges that Daniels, Harrison, and Bradaick-Zolla prepared false SEC filings, Harrison submitted false legal opinion letters, and Daniels and Bradaick-Zolla entered manipulative trades to artificially set the price of the stocks in the public market.  The SEC previously issued a stop order on the public offering of the fifth company in Daniels and Harrisons pipeline.The SECs complaint also alleges that Harrison participated in a separate fraudulent scheme involving at least 11 undisclosed blank check companies secretly controlled by Alvin S. Mirman and Sheldon R. Rose.  The SEC previously filed enforcement actions against Mirman and Rose, who were also convicted of criminal charges and sentenced to prison based on the same alleged conduct.  According to the SECs complaint, Harrison provided at least 21 false legal opinion letters in furtherance of Mirman and Roses scheme.The SECs complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, alleges that Harrison and Daniels violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5 and Rule 13a-14 thereunder, and aided and abetted violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13 and 13a-14 thereunder.  The complaint also alleges that Daniels violated Section 9(a) of the Exchange Act, and that Harrison also violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act.  The complaint further alleges that Harrison and Bradaick-Zolla aided and abetted violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, penny stock bars, and officer-and-director bars against each defendant.In separate orders instituting settled administrative proceedings, the Commission charged Fan and two public companies under his control, AF Ocean Investment Management Company and ChinAmerica Andy Movie Entertainment Media Company, with issuing false press releases and making false SEC filings regarding their purported revenues.

24123,2018,Court Enters Final Judgment Against Microcap Executive and Co-Defendant Involved in Fraudulent Scheme,"The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on April 30, 2018, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts entered a default judgment in an ongoing enforcement action against Christopher R. Esposito, the owner and Managing Director of Lionshare Ventures, LLC (Lionshare), in a case involving an alleged scheme to defraud investors by misappropriating investor funds and concealing the ownership and control of a publicly traded company.  The court also entered a final judgement by consent on December 11, 2017, against another defendant in the case, Rene Galizio.The SECs complaint, filed on May 26, 2016, alleged a two-part scheme involving Esposito, Lionshare, and several co-defendants.  First, Esposito raised more than $550,000 in investor funds through an unregistered offering of Lionshare securities and then misappropriated $375,000 for his personal benefit.  According to the complaint, Esposito spent almost $300,000 of the funds raised on personal expenses and used $75,000 to acquire control of a Massachusetts-based, publicly traded company, Cannabiz Mobile, Inc., by purchasing all of its convertible debt.In the second phase of the scheme, the SECs complaint alleged that Esposito and Lionshare, together with co-defendant Anthony Jay Pignatello of Manhattan Beach, California, concealed Esposito and Lionshares de facto control of Cannabiz and a large percentage of Cannabizs securities in order to evade SEC Rule 144, which limits securities sales by certain company affiliates, such as control persons.  Esposito allegedly did this by, among other things, installing co-defendant James Gondolfe as the sole officer and director of Cannabiz - even though Esposito and Lionshare secretly controlled the company - to make false statements in Cannabizs public filings with the SEC and other documents.  According to the SECs complaint, Esposito paid third-party stock promoters to tout Cannabiz stock in order to increase its price and trading volume.  Both during and after this promotional campaign, Esposito sold significant amounts of Cannabiz convertible debt to others for a profit of almost $304,000.  Esposito, Pignatello, and Galizio also allegedly sold millions of shares of Cannabiz stock directly into the public market for a profit.The final judgment, which was entered against Esposito by default by the Honorable Allison D. Burroughs of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, enjoins Esposito from future violations of Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The judgment also orders Esposito to pay, on a joint and several basis with Lionshare, disgorgement and pre-judgment interest in the total amount of $1,107,413 and a civil penalty of $160,000.  Additionally, the final judgment against Esposito bars him from acting as an officer or director of any issuer that has a class of securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act, and permanently bars him from participating in an offering of a penny stock.On December 11, 2017, the Court entered a final judgment by consent against Galizio.  That judgment enjoined Galizio from future violations of Section 5 of the Securities Act and ordered her to pay disgorgement of $22,500 and a civil penalty of $7,500.  The judgment also barred Galizio from participating in an offering of a penny stock.The court previously entered final default judgments against Gondolfe and Cannabiz on January 27, 2017 and against Lionshare on April 14, 2017.The SECs litigation in this matter continues against Pignatello."

Davis, who tipped material nonpublic information to Walters.In its complaint, filed on May 19, 2016, the SEC alleged that Davis, then a board member of Dean Foods Company, owed Walters money. Â According to the SEC complaint, Davis regularly shared inside information about Dean Foods with Walters in advance of market-moving events, using prepaid cell phones and other methods in an effort to avoid detection.

He will be sentenced by the court at a later date.The allegations regarding Greenway Technology in the criminal indictment against Hand stem from the same conduct alleged in the SECs complaint against him.  According to the SECs complaint, filed in federal court in Boston on December 10, 2015, Hand facilitated a scheme to pump and dump Greenways stock by authoring false legal opinion letters that were designed to evade restrictions on stock sales by company insiders and clear the way for Greenway stock held by him and other scheme participants to be sold to unsuspecting investors in the market.  According to the complaint, Hand and his co-schemers secretly planned and orchestrated the sale of Greenway stock to the public without proper securities registration statements and at prices artificially inflated by news releases, promotional materials, or blast e-mails containing false, exaggerated or misleading information, and by engaging in undisclosed coordinated trading of the stock.

This is the second case the SEC has filed arising from the Equifax data breach. In March, the former chief information officer of Equifaxâs U.S. business unit was charged with insider trading. In a complaint filed in federal court in Atlanta, the SEC charged that Equifax software engineering manager Sudhakar Reddy Bonthu traded on confidential information he received while creating a website for consumers impacted by a data breach.

The SEC alleges that Bonthu violated company policy when he traded on the non-public information by purchasing Equifax put options. Less than a week later, after Equifax publicly announced the data breach and its stock declined nearly 14 percent, Bonthu sold the put options and netted more than $75,000, a return of more than 3,500 percent on his initial investment. Bonthu, 44, was terminated from Equifax in March after refusing to cooperate with an internal investigation into whether he had violated the companyâs insider trading policy.In a parallel proceeding, the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Northern District of Georgia filed criminal charges against Bonthu.To settle the SECâs civil charges, Bonthu has agreed to a permanent injunction and to return his allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest.

24184,2018,None,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against a Virginia investment adviser firm and its sole owner, for operating a nearly $5 million Ponzi scheme.  The SEC also obtained an order freezing assets in more than 30 brokerage and bank accounts controlled by the defendants.According to the SECs complaint, Edward Lee Moody and his wholly-owned investment adviser firm CM Capital Management, LLC, has operated a Ponzi scheme and defrauded dozens of investors.  The SEC alleges that Moody obtained $4.95 million from approximately 60 individuals and entities for investment purposes.  Moody represented his firm as a successful money management company that profitably invested client funds in securities.  In order to maintain this illusion, Moody and CM Capital made periodic repayments to investors and sent fictitious monthly account statements that purported to show that clients had earned profitable returns on their securities investments.  The SEC alleges that, in reality, Moody invested none of the $4.95 million, but instead, he used the investor funds to pay off earlier investors, to fund his own speculative trading, and for personal expenses.  Among other expenses, Moody used investor funds to buy a house, a car, remodel his new home, travel, and cover his restaurant and bar tabs.The SECs complaint, filed under seal on June 27, 2018 and unsealed July 2, 2018 in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Richmond Division, charges Moody and CM Capital Management with violations of the anti-fraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act.The court granted the SECs request for a temporary restraining order freezing assets and other emergency relief.

24185,2018,SEC Charges Real Estate Investment Funds and Executives for Misleading Investors,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against two real estate investment funds and four executives in connection with their alleged roles in misleading investors by failing to disclose that it could not pay its distributions and was using money from a newer fund to pay distributions to investors in the older fund. The SEC also charged a fifth executive for allegedly signing false SEC filings.According to the SECâs complaint, Texas-based United Development Funding (UDF) is a family of private and publicly-traded investment funds that deploys investor capital as loans to homebuilders and land developers. UDF allegedly solicited investors by advertising annualized returns of up to 9.75 percent as well as regular distributions. According to the complaint, for almost five years, UDF did not tell investors that it lacked the monthly cashflow at times to cover investor distributions in one of its older funds, UDF III. Instead, to pay these distributions, the newer UDF IV fund loaned money to developers who had also borrowed money from UDF III. Rather than using those funds for development projects that were underwritten by UDF IV, UDF directed the developers to use the loaned money to pay down their older loans from UDF III. In most of these cases, the developer never received the borrowed funds at all, and UDF simply transferred the money between funds so that UDF III could make the distributions to its investors. UDF III, UDF IV, and UDF executives Hollis Greenlaw, Benjamin Wissink, Theodore Etter, and Cara Obert knew or should have known that they had misled investors about the use of funds and the nature and status of loans made to developers.The complaint also alleges that UDF III failed to appropriately impair loans in violation of GAAP, and that UDF IV did not adequately disclose the status of real property within its portfolio. Finally, the complaint alleges that David Hanson signed false and misleading SEC filings and management representation letters without taking sufficient actions to ensure the accuracy of or a sufficient basis for many of their representations.Without admitting or denying the SECâs allegations, Greenlaw, Wissink, Etter, and Obert agreed to pay $8.2 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. Hanson agreed to pay a $75,000 civil penalty. The defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that order them to be permanently enjoined from violating Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933, and the disclosure, books and records and internal accounting control provisions of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder.
