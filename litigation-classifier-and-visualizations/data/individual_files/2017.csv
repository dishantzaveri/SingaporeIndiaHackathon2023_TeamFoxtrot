23715,2017,SEC Charges Two Brokers With Defrauding Customers,"[On January 9, 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged two New York-based brokers with fraudulently using an in-and-out trading strategy that was unsuitable for customers in order to generate hefty commissions for themselves., The SECs complaint alleges that Gregory T. Dean and Donald J. Fowler did no reasonable diligence to determine whether their investment strategy involving frequent buying and selling of securities could deliver even a minimal profit for their customers.  Their strategy, which generally involved selling the securities within a week or two of purchase and charging customers a commission for each transaction, allegedly resulted in substantial losses for 27 customers., The SECs complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, charges Dean and Fowler with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5., The SECs investigation was conducted by Kristin M.

However, Gray did not purchase enough shares before Twitter went public in November 2013, and he only managed to pay investors in the Twitter-related fund by tapping three other unrelated funds.

23718,2017,SEC Obtains Final Judgments Against Entities Involved in Massachusetts Investment Advisers $15 Million Fund Fraud,"[On December 23, 2016, the Honorable Nathaniel M. Gorton of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts entered final judgments by default against Graduate Leverage, LLC, GL Capital Partners, LLC, GL Investment Services, LLC, Taft Financial Services, LLC, and GL Advisor Solutions, Inc., These entities were controlled and manipulated by Daniel Thibeault, the individual defendant in this SEC enforcement action filed in January 2015, who misappropriated money from an investment fund that he was managing. The entities have all stopped their former business operations. The final judgments against these companies impose permanent injunctions against future violations of certain antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and order all but one of them to pay disgorgement and interest, jointly and severally, of approximately $17.1 million., In its complaint, filed on January 9, 2015, the SEC alleged that Thibeault, GL Capital Partners, LLC, and the other entity defendants, engaged in securities fraud and fraud by an investment adviser. Specifically, the SEC alleged that GL Capital Partners, LLC and its principal, Thibeault, were the investment advisers to a fund called the GL Beyond Income Fund, and that they misappropriated at least $15 million of the money that belonged to this fund. The GL Beyond Income Funds assets consisted primarily of individual variable rate consumer loans. According to the complaint, Thibeault and other defendants solicited investments in the GL Beyond Income Fund by representing that investors money would be pooled and used to make or purchase consumer loans. These consumer loans would then constitute assets of the GL Beyond Income Fund, and would provide a return to the investors when interest and principal payments were made on the loans. The SEC alleged that beginning in 2013 or earlier, Thibeault and the other defendants engaged in a scheme to create fictitious loans to divert investor money from the GL Beyond Income Fund, and to report these fake loans as assets of the GL Beyond Income Fund. This scheme was designed to conceal the fact that Thibeault and the other defendants had misappropriated millions of dollars from the GL Beyond Income Fund., The final judgments against Graduate Leverage, LLC, GL Capital Partners, LLC, GL Investment Services, LLC and Taft Financial Services, LLC permanently enjoin each of them from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933. In addition, the final judgments against GL Capital Partners, LLC and GL Investment Services, LLC permanently enjoin each of them from violating Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

The judgment also orders Mulholland to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $24,659,355.57, which is to be deemed satisfied by the restitution order expected to be entered against Mulholland at sentencing in the parallel criminal case, conditioned upon the accuracy and completeness of his disclosures concerning his assets in that case., Mulholland also consented to the entry of an SEC order, based on the courts entry of judgment, which imposes industry and penny stock bars., The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority., See also Litigation Release No. <a href=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2015/lr23293.htm>23293</a> (June 25, 2015).,  , <i>https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2017/lr23719.htm</i><br/>]"

Henderson and his company San Francisco Regional Center LLC falsely claimed to foreign investors that their $500,000 investments would help create at least 10 jobs within several distinct EB-5 related businesses he created, including a nursing facility, call centers, and a dairy operation.  This would qualify the investors for a potential path to permanent U.S. residency through the EB-5 program., But according to the SECs complaint, Henderson jeopardized investors residency prospects and combined the $100 million he raised from investors into a general fund from which he allegedly misused at least $9.6 million to purchase his home and personal items and improperly fund several personal business projects such as Bay Area restaurants that were unrelated to the companies he purportedly established to create jobs consistent with EB-5 requirements.  According to the SECs complaint, Henderson also improperly used $7.5 million of investor money to pay overseas marketing agents, and he shuffled millions of dollars among the EB-5 businesses to obscure his fraudulent scheme., The SECs complaint charges violations of the antifraud provisions of the securities laws in Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.  The SEC is seeking a court order appointing a receiver over San Francisco Regional Center and Hendersons other businesses involved in the alleged fraud.

Schiltz of the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota entered a final judgment against Minnesota resident James M. Louks and his company, FiberPoP Solutions, Inc. Louks and FiberPoP are defendants in an SEC civil enforcement action who were charged with raising money from investors under false pretenses while failing to produce the promised returns until the SECs emergency action stopped them from doing so., In September 2015, the SEC <a href=https://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2015-176.html>announced fraud charges</a> and an emergency order to halt Louks and FiberPop from continuing to raise money from investors. In its complaint, the SEC alleged that Louks and FiberPoP, since 2003, defrauded approximately 100 investors by promising them massive returns, while actually spending the investors funds on various schemes, which the SEC alleged typically bore the hallmarks of prime bank schemes. Prime bank schemes lure investors to participate in a sham international investing opportunity with phony promises of exclusivity and enormous profits., On September 2, 2015, the court entered a temporary restraining order barring Louks and FiberPoP from, among other things, soliciting or accepting any monies from actual or prospective investors. On November 4, 2015, the court permanently enjoined Louks and FiberPoP from violating Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and from soliciting or accepting any monies from actual or prospective investors. Since that time, Louks and FiberPoP were held in civil contempt on three separate occasions for violating the Courts orders. In March 2016, Louks and FiberPoP were held in contempt for soliciting and accepting at least $590,000 from investors after the Courts September 2015 restraining order. In June 2016, Louks and FiberPoP were again found in contempt for soliciting and accepting another $42,000 from investors after the Courts November 2015 permanent injunction. In September 2016, Louks was held in contempt for violating a court order which required him to submit a sworn affidavit regarding his compliance with the June 2016 order. Louks was incarcerated for eleven days before curing the contempt., The final judgment orders Louks and FiberPoP to pay, jointly and severally, $7,679,578.72 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest., For more information, see Press Release No. <a href=https://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2015-176.html>2015-176</a> (Sept. 2, 2015) and Litigation Releases No. <a href=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2015/lr23402.htm>23402</a> (Nov. 9, 2015) and No. <a href=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2016/lr23500.htm>23500</a> (Mar. 25, 2016).

The information alleged that Krinos instead used the investors money for personal expenses and unauthorized foreign currency transactions., The charges in the criminal information arise from similar conduct alleged in a related SEC enforcement action. On October 16, 2014, in an administrative proceeding, the SEC charged Krinos, Krinos Holdings, and Fordgate Acquisition Corp. with violations of the federal securities laws. The SECs Division of Enforcement alleged that, among other things, from January 2012, through at least November 2013, Krinos, through Krinos Holdings, raised approximately $1 million from at least 18 investors through the unregistered sale of common stock and secured convertible debenture notes. The Division alleged that throughout this period, Krinos made materially false and misleading representations to investors about the use of investor funds and Krinos Holdings business operations and prospects.

Beginning in January 2012, Sandoval and Cidre allegedly became aware of potential overstatement of inventory by tens of millions of dollars and allegations of an inventory theft scheme by the subsidiarys employees. Instead of disclosing these matters to GCC, the SEC contends that Sandoval and Cidre deliberately omitted them from required reports and certifications to executive management. Sandoval and Cidre also allegedly directed their subordinates to destroy documents and to conceal the accounting problems from others within GCC, including internal auditors. The improper accounting allegedly caused GCC to overstate its inventory balance by more than $40 million, and resulted in a restatement of its financial statements., The SECs complaint charges Sandoval and Cidre with violating, and aiding and abetting GCCs and each others violations of, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as books and records and reporting violations.

23727,2017,"SEC Uncovers Cherry-Picking Scheme, Charges Investment Adviser Behind It","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that a Massachusetts-based investment adviser agreed to be banned from the securities industry after the agency uncovered an illegal cherry-picking scheme through its data analysis used to detect suspicious trading patterns., The SEC filed fraud charges in federal district court against Michael J. Breton and his firm Strategic Capital Management, alleging they defrauded clients out of approximately $1.3 million. Breton allegedly placed trades through a master brokerage account and then allocated profitable trades to himself while placing unprofitable trades into the client accounts., Breton and his firm agreed to a partial settlement subject to court approval. Monetary sanctions would be determined at a later date. In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the District of Massachusetts today announced criminal charges against Breton., The Market Abuse Units analysis of Bretons trading showed that he defrauded at least 30 clients during a six-year period as outlined in the SECs complaint. Breton allegedly purchased securities for his own accounts and the client accounts through a block trading or master account on days when public companies scheduled earnings announcements. He typically delayed allocation of those trades until later in the day after learning the substance of the announcement., According to the SECs complaint, when companies announced positive earnings that would presumably increase the stock value, Breton disproportionately allocated those trades to his accounts. And when a company announced negative earnings that would presumably decrease the stock value, Breton disproportionately allocated those trades to client accounts., The SECs complaint charges Breton and Strategic Capital Management with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 as well as Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act. Breton and his firm agreed to be permanently enjoined from future misconduct, and Breton consented to the issuance of an SEC order barring him from the securities industry., The SECs investigation was conducted by Caitlyn M.

Investors paid $230 to become members of Race Cycler and recruited other members in order to move up the pyramid and eventually earn reward points, which could be converted to cash.  The reward payments to earlier investors were made from the funds received from later investors.  According to the complaint, Young promoted Race Cycler as a legitimate enterprise selling e-books, but the products Race Cycler purported to sell were practically valueless and existed only to give the illusion of a legitimate enterprise.  In February 2015, following discussions with the SECs staff, Young voluntarily shut down Race Cycler., Young agreed to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, a permanent conduct-based injunction, and an order requiring him to pay $342,510 of approximately $1.32 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest based on his sworn statement of financial condition.

23730,2017,SEC Obtains Final Judgments Against Medical Marijuana Industry Company and CEO for Involvement in Fraudulent Scheme,"[On January 27, 2017, the federal court in Boston, Massachusetts, entered final judgments against Cannabiz Mobile, a publicly traded company purportedly servicing businesses in the medical marijuana industry, and its sole officer and director, James Gondolfe.  Among other things, the judgments order Gondolfe to pay a total of $266,681, and Cannabiz to pay a total of $786,694, and bar Gandolfe from serving as an officer or director of certain public companies or from participating in an offering of a penny stock., In May 2016, the SEC charged Gondolfe and Cannabiz, both of Cambridge, Massachusetts, along with two other individual defendants and one other company defendant, for their roles in a scheme to defraud investors by concealing the ownership and control of Cannabiz by defendant Christopher Esposito of Topsfield, Massachusetts, in order to enrich themselves by facilitating the sale of hundreds of millions of shares of Cannabiz stock into the public market, in violation of SEC statutes and regulations.  According to the SECs complaint, between early 2014 and August 2015, Esposito, with Anthony Jay Pignatello of Manhattan Beach, California, concealed Espositos de facto control of Cannabiz and a large percentage of Cannabizs securities in order to profit by evading SEC Rule 144, which limits securities sales by affiliates, such as control persons. Esposito did this by, among other things, installing Gondolfe, as the sole officer and director of Cannabiz - even though Esposito secretly controlled the company - to make false statements in Cannabizs public filings and other documents.  Gondolfes actions allowed Esposito to pay third-party stock promoters to tout Cannabiz stock in order to increase its stock price and trading volume, sell significant amounts of Cannabiz convertible debt to others for almost $304,000, and with Pignatello and Renee Galizio of Loxahatchee, Florida, sell millions of shares of Cannabiz stock directly into the public market., The final judgments, which were entered by default by the Honorable Allison D. Burroughs of the United State District Court for the District of Massachusetts, enjoin Gondolfe and Cannabiz from future violations of Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The judgments also order Gondolfe to pay disgorgement and pre-judgment interest in the total amount of $106,681 plus a $160,000 civil penalty and Cannabiz to pay disgorgement and pre-judgment interest in the total amount of $11,694 plus a $775,000 civil penalty. Additionally, the final judgment against Gondolfe bars him from acting as an officer or director of any issuer that has a class of securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act, and permanently bars him from participating in an offering of a penny stock., The SECs litigation in this matter continues against Esposito, Lionshare Ventures, LLC, Pignatello and Galizio., The SECs investigation was conducted by Scott R.

The SEC alleges no such agreement or purchase ever happened., Meli and Harriton allegedly raised more than $81 million from at least 125 investors in 13 states., In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Meli., The SECs complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges Meli and Harriton along with their four purported ticket reselling businesses named Advance Entertainment, Advance Entertainment II, 875 Holdings, and 127 Holdings.

According to the SECs complaint, Cohn invested less than half of the money raised from investors and used more than $400,000 for personal expenses, including a Hollywood mansion, luxury automobile, and extravagant tabs at high-end nightclubs.  The SEC claimed that Cohn used his lavish lifestyle to portray himself as a successful trader and investor, when in reality he lost nearly all of the money invested.

The SECs order required Hold Brothers to pay approximately $2.5 million in disgorgement, civil penalties, and interest, in five installments.  Hold Brothers made only the first payment installment before ceasing its broker-dealer operations and defaulting on more than $2 million still owed under the SECs order., On November 21, 2014, the SEC <a href=/litigation/complaints/2014/comp23143.pdf>filed an application</a> in federal court in New Jersey seeking an order commanding Hold Brothers to pay the unpaid balance of disgorgement, civil penalty and post-order interest, and holding Gregory Hold and Steven Hold, the owners of Hold Brothers, jointly and severally liable as control persons for culpably causing Hold Brothers failure to comply with the SECs order., Hold Brothers consented to the entry of a judgment enforcing the SEC consent order, finding Hold Brothers liable for $2,116,998.69 in disgorgement, civil penalties, and interest, and ordering Hold Brothers to pay $707,764.22 in partial satisfaction of that judgment.

23741,2017,Company and Executives Charged with Financial Reporting Violations,"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged two former executives of a computer network testing company with violations related to their financial reporting obligations to investors., The SECs complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, alleges that the former CFO and director of accounting at Calabasas, California-based Ixia, Thomas Miller and William Liang, participated in a scheme to prematurely recognize certain revenues and concealed the improper revenue recognition practice from the companys auditors.  The SECs complaint charges Miller and Liang with violating Exchange Act Sections 13(b)(5) and Rules 13b2-1 and 13b2-2, aiding and abetting Ixias violations of Exchange Act Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and (B), and Miller for violating Exchange Act Rule 13a-14.  The SECs complaint seeks financial penalties and permanent injunctive relief against Miller and Liang., The SEC separately announced settled administrative proceedings against Ixia and Victor Alston, Ixias former CEO, arising from the same alleged misconduct., The SECs order finds that Victor Alston, who was elevated to top executive at Calabasas, Calif.-based Ixia in 2012, made changes in the companys revenue and other financial metrics in an effort to meet market expectations.  Alston ordered changes to Ixias practice of deferring revenue recognition from its sales of software combined with training and professional services until the customer actually received the training or other services, which often occurred many months after the sale., According to the SECs order, Alston issued a directive to split artificially the software and the professional services into separate purchase orders, which gave the false appearance that customers were buying Ixias professional services in stand-alone sales rather than as components of the software sales.  This allowed Ixia improperly to recognize software revenues earlier than allowed under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and the companys own stated revenue recognition policy., The SECs order further finds that the practice of splitting purchase orders exploited a material weakness in the companys internal controls over financial reporting (ICFR) that was concealed from investors and Ixias outside auditors.  As CEO, Alston was obligated to disclose material weaknesses in Ixias 2012 annual report but failed to do so.  Similarly, he wasnt truthful in his periodic representation letter to Ixias auditors., Without admitting or denying the findings, Ixia consented to the SECs order alleging violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 thereunder and agreed to pay a $750,000 penalty.  Alston, without admitting or denying the findings, consented to the SEC order alleging violations of Section 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Exchange Act Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) and Rules 10b-5(b), 10b-5(c), 13b2-1, 13b2-2, and 13a-14 thereunder, causing Ixias violations, and agreed to a five-year officer-and-director bar and payment of a $100,000 penalty., The SECs investigation was conducted by Jason P.

23752,2017,SEC Halts Fraudulent Offering of Private Fund Investments,"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced fraud charges and an emergency court order to stop a fraudulent offering of investments in private funds., The SECs complaint, filed under seal in federal court in Dallas, Texas on February 14, 2017, alleges that since February 2015, Patrick O. Howard and two Dallas-based companies he controls - Optimal Economics Capital Partners, LLC and Howard Capital Holdings, LLC - have raised approximately $13 million from 119 investors through the fraudulent offer and sale of interests in three private funds. According to the SECs complaint, Howard and his companies told investors that they would earn between 12% and 20% annual returns through investing in these funds with minimal risk exposure. They also allegedly represented that nearly all investor funds would be used to acquire the interests in the portfolio companies revenue streams, and that the promised returns were backed by insurance. The SEC alleges that these representations were false. According to the SEC, Howard and his companies only used $7.5 million of the $13 million in investor funds to acquire revenue streams from portfolio companies and spent most of the rest on Howards personal expenses and on unrelated business expenses. In addition, the SECs complaint alleges that, to cover up the fact that revenue from the portfolio companies was insufficient to support the guaranteed minimum returns promised to investors, Howard sent to investors account statements that depicted false account balances and encouraged investors to reinvest their purported earnings back in the funds. Additionally, Optimal Economics allegedly used new investor funds to make Ponzi-like payments to earlier investors., The SECs complaint further alleges that Howard falsely represented his status as a registered investment adviser. The SEC encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people selling them investments. A quick search on the <a href=http://www.investor.gov/>SECs investor.gov website</a> would have shown that Howard was not registered as an investment adviser., In response to the SECs request for emergency relief, the court issued a temporary restraining order halting the offering, as well as orders appointing a receiver over, and freezing, the defendants assets. The court also unsealed the SECs complaint and scheduled an additional hearing for February 27, 2017., The SECs complaint charges Optimal Economics Capital Partners, LLC, Howard Capital Holdings, LLC, and Howard with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

23753,2017,Houston Man Charged with Conducting Multiyear Offering Fraud Targeting Fellow Members of His Success Club,"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against Darrell Glenn Hardaway and his company Hardaway Net-Works, Inc. (HNW), arising from their role in a multiyear offering fraud targeting members of a nationwide self-described success club known as the Global Information Network (GIN)., The SECs complaint, filed in federal court in Houston, Texas, alleges that since November 2010, Hardaway has raised at least $4.7 million from over one hundred investors residing in multiple states through the U.S.  Hardaway, who was a high-ranking member in GIN, marketed securities in his company, HNW, to his fellow members.  Hardaway focused on GIN members both because they had great trust in him and because they had taken an oath not to criticize him.  Hardaway persuaded GIN members to invest in HNW through promises of securing a national roster of customers and ultimately taking the company public.  The SECs complaint alleges that Hardaways representations were false.  In fact, the complaint alleges that Hardaway instead used most investor funds to pay himself a salary and on various personal expenses.  As the years passed, Hardaway continued to mislead HNW investors regarding HNWs business prospects, prospects for going public, and the use of investor funds.  When victims sought information about their investments, the SEC alleges that he refused to answer their questions, threatened legal action, and cited a GIN-related rule that prohibits members from criticizing each other., Hardaway also allegedly used $40,000 of investor funds to acquire a non-operating public shell company that he renamed Vortronnix Technologies, Inc.  While in control of Vortronnix, Hardaway signed the companys Form 10-Q for the third quarter of 2015 and certifications required by Sarbanes-Oxley despite knowing that there had been no review of the companys financial statements by its auditor, as required by SEC rules.  Vortronnixs auditor immediately directed Hardaway to withdraw the Form 10-Q, a directive which Hardaway allegedly ignored.  Vortronnix did not publicly disclose that the auditor had not reviewed the companys third quarter of 2015 financial statement until 3 1/2 months after the auditors directive, when Vortronnix filed a Form 8-K announcing the resignation of its auditor., The SEC alleges that Vortronnix remains delinquent in its public reports with the SEC and has never traded publicly., The SECs complaint charges Hardaway and HNW with violating Sections 5(a) and (c), and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and charges Hardaway with violating Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 13a-14, and aiding and abetting Vortronnixs violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 13a-13 and 13a-15(a)., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SECs complaint, Hardaway and HNW each agreed to the entry of permanent injunctions and to defer determination of any disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Hardaway also agreed to the entry of an officer and director bar.  The settlement is subject to court approval., The SECs investigation was conducted by Jeffrey Cohen and Jody Moore of the SECs Fort Worth Regional Office.  The case was supervised by David L.

Lee., On February 13, 2014, <a href=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr22927.htm>the SEC charged Lee</a> with defrauding his advisory clients in several ways, including providing false performance reports to clients, charging unearned fees, misrepresenting the risks associated with option trading, and misrepresenting his background.  According to the SECs complaint, Lee diverted the proceeds of his fraud to relief defendants ELX International, Inc. (ELX), Advanced Century Corp. (ACC), SOT Group, Inc. (SOT), and Ultra International, Inc. (Ultra) - shell corporations Lee controlled - to avoid holding assets in his name.  The SEC alleged that ELX, ACC, SOT, and Ultra funneled the proceeds of Lees fraud to relief defendants Larissa Ettore (Lees girlfriend), Clayton K. Lee (Lees son), and Lolita Gatchalian (Lees long-time associate)., On October 9, 2014, Lee pleaded guilty to one count of obstruction of justice in a related criminal matter.  On May 4, 2015, Lee was sentenced to 78 months imprisonment., On July 15, 2016, the district court entered a final judgment against Lee, permanently enjoining him from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Sections 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940; and ordering Lee to pay approximately $2.2 million in disgorgement plus prejudgment interest.  Lees liability is subject to a dollar-for-dollar credit for any payments made to satisfy the restitution order imposed against him in the related criminal matter., On January 12, 2017, the district court granted the SECs motion for case-terminating sanctions against relief defendants Ettore, Clayton K. Lee, and Gatchalian for discovery abuses and for failing to comply with the courts orders.  On January 13, 2017, the district court granted default judgment against relief defendants ELX, SOT, ACC, and Ultra on the SECs motion for reconsideration of a prior order., The final judgment against the seven relief defendants orders them to pay more than $2.2 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest.  The final judgment further orders reductions to Lees liability for payments made by the relief defendants and reductions to the four shell company relief defendants for payments made by the individual relief defendants.,  , <i>https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2017/lr23754.htm</i><br/>]"
23755,2017,SEC Charges Financial Adviser With Stealing Client Funds,"[On February 21, 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged a Chicago area investment adviser representative with misappropriating more than $900,000 from a clients account through more than 40 unauthorized transactions., The SECs complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that William P. Carlson, Jr., an investment adviser representative associated with a registered investment adviser, forged a clients signature on check and journal requests and caused checks to be issued from the clients account to a third party who gave the proceeds to Carlson. Carlson also directed that checks made payable to the client be issued from the clients account, and then intercepted those checks, forged the clients endorsement on those checks, and deposited the checks into his own account. In submitting these fraudulent check requests, Carlson repeatedly caused securities held by the client to be sold to fund the unauthorized withdrawals., The SECs complaint charges Carlson with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and with violating or, alternatively, with aiding and abetting violations of, Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

Karroum allegedly told investors their funds would be used for forex trading and would be kept safe.  According to the complaint, while Karroum used some funds for forex trading, after 2010, Karroum stopped sending investor money to his forex broker for trading even though he continued to solicit new investors.  Instead, he allegedly used investor funds for undisclosed purposes, including making Ponzi-like payments to investors, paying unrelated business expenses, and misappropriating funds for his and his wifes personal use or benefit, such as for purchases at Victorias Secret, the Disney Store, Gymboree, Papaya Clothing, McDonalds, and Joseph A. Bank, and to pay premiums on his life insurance policy.  In addition, as alleged in the complaint, from late 2013 until November 2014, Karroum hid trading losses from his investors.  In total, at least 14 investors lost approximately $1.7 million of their principal., The SECs complaint charges Karroum and FX &amp; Beyond with violating Sections 17(a), 5(a), and 5(c) of the Securities Act, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.

The SECs complaint alleges that, in a scheme spanning at least four years, Sean Stewart illegally tipped his father, Robert K.

On August 12, 2015, Robert Stewart pled guilty to conspiracy to commit securities fraud.

23764,2017,First Circuit Affirms Federal Criminal Conviction Against Boston-Area Defendant Accused of Insider Trading,"[On February 24, 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed a jury verdict in a criminal action finding Watertown, Massachusetts real-estate developer Robert H. Bray guilty of securities fraud through insider trading., On January 28, 2016, a jury in the federal court in Boston, Massachusetts returned a guilty verdict against Bray. On May 9, 2016, U.S. District Judge William G. Young sentenced Bray to two years in prison, three years of supervised release, and ordered him to pay forfeiture of $299,762.15 and a fine of $1 million in the criminal action. Bray subsequently appealed the conviction., The criminal case against Bray was based on the same conduct underlying <a href=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr23070.htm>the SECs civil action</a>, which was filed on August 18, 2014. The SECs complaint alleged that J. Patrick ONeill, a former senior vice president at Eastern Bank Corporation, learned through his job responsibilities that his employer was planning to acquire Wainwright Bank &amp; Trust Company and he then tipped Bray, a friend and fellow golfer with whom he socialized at a local country club. In the two weeks preceding a public announcement about the planned acquisition, Bray sold his shares in other stocks to accumulate funds he used to purchase Wainwright securities. Bray had never previously purchased Wainwright stock. After the public announcement of the acquisition caused Wainwrights stock price to increase nearly 100 percent, Bray sold all of his shares during the next few months for nearly $300,000 in illicit profits., The SECs action, which remains pending against Bray, seeks an injunction from further violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, disgorgement of allegedly ill-gotten gains with interest, and civil penalties of up to three times the gain. ONeill previously agreed to settle the SECs allegations against him by consenting to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoined him from violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court <a href=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2016/lr23621.htm>entered a final judgment against ONeill</a> on August 18, 2016., For further information, see Litigation Release Nos. <a href=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr23070.htm>23070</a> (Aug. 18, 2014) [Civil Complaint] <a href=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr23131.htm>23131</a> (Nov. 14, 2014) [Bray arrest]; <a href=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr23150.htm>23150 </a>(Dec. 5, 2014) [ONeill guilty plea]; <a href=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2016/lr23456.htm>23456 </a>(Jan. 29, 2016) [Bray guilty verdict]; <a href=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2016/lr23539.htm>23539 </a>(May 13, 2016) [Bray sentence]; <a href=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2016/lr23621.htm>23621 </a>(Aug. 18, 2016) [ONeill final judgment].,  , <i>https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2017/lr23764.htm</i><br/>]"
23765,2017,SEC Charges Mexico-Based Homebuilder In $3.3 Billion Accounting Fraud,"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that Mexico-based homebuilding company Desarrolladora Homex S.A.B. de C.V. has agreed to settle charges that it reported fake sales of more than 100,000 homes to boost revenues in its financial statements during a three-year period., The SEC used satellite imagery to help uncover the accounting scheme and illustrate its allegation that Homex had not even broken ground on many of the homes for which it reported revenues., The SEC alleges that Homex, one of the largest homebuilders in Mexico at the time, inflated the number of homes sold during the three-year period by approximately 317 percent and overstated its revenue by 355 percent (approximately $3.3 billion). The SECs complaint highlights, for example, that Homex reported revenues from a project site in the Mexican state of Guanajuato where every planned home was purportedly built and sold by December 31, 2011. Satellite images of the project site on March 12, 2012, show it was still largely undeveloped and the vast majority of supposedly sold homes remained unbuilt., According to the SECs complaint, Homex filed for the Mexican equivalent of bankruptcy protection in April 2014 and emerged in October 2015 under new equity ownership. The companys then-CEO and then-CFO have been placed on unpaid leave since May 2016. Homex has since undertaken significant remedial efforts and cooperated with the SECs investigation., The SEC separately issued a trading suspension in the securities of Homex., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SECs complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, Homex consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining the company from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-16 thereunder, and agreed to be prohibited from offering securities in the U.S. markets for at least five years. The settlement is subject to court approval., The SECs investigation, which continues, is being conducted by Alfred C. Tierney, Benjamin D. Brutlag, Andrew M. Shirley, Juan M.

A second defendant - a resident of Griffing, Georgia - was found not liable., The SEC <a href=https://www.sec.gov/News/PressRelease/Detail/PressRelease/1365171484100>charged</a> the two men - Peter Doffing and Joel Jinks - in 2012 along with six others, alleging that they were involved in an insider trading ring that generated more than $500,000 in illegal profits based on nonpublic information about the Sanofi-Aventis/Chattem merger. The SEC alleged that in November 2009, a board member of Chattem consulted his personal accountant in confidence about the tax consequences of the impending merger on his Chattem stock options. According to the SEC, the accountant then tipped a broker in Griffin, Georgia about the merger, who, in turn, tipped Doffing. Doffing, the jury concluded, bought Chattem stock and options shortly before the merger was announced, making about $500,000 in profit. Jinks, who also bought Chattem stock shortly before the merger was announced and made about $25,000 in profits when the merger was announced, was found not liable., Aside from Doffing and Jinks, the SEC has charged 10 other individuals with insider trading concerning the Sanofi-Aventis/Chattem merger. The SEC obtained settlements with six of the charged individuals that resided in the United States totaling more than $390,000 in monetary sanctions. The SEC obtained jury verdicts against two of the charged individuals in March 2014. And, in December 2009, the SEC obtained an order freezing over $4 million in trading profits generated by <a href=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21347.htm>two French citizens residing in Belgium</a>., The U.S. Attorneys Office for the Northern District of Georgia charged criminally - and obtained guilty pleas from - four of the 12 individuals charged by the SEC., The court will decide sanctions against Doffing at a later date.

The criminal complaint against Allen and Daub alleged that they collected funds from investors for certain fictitious or oversubscribed loans to professional athletes and created the false impression that athletes were repaying certain fictitious or oversubscribed loans on schedule by making scheduled monthly payments to investors from new investor funds.  They pled guilty to the criminal charges in November 2016., In the SECs parallel enforcement action, filed in federal court in April 2015, the SECs complaint alleges that Allen and Daub, and three corporate entities they owned or controlled - Florida-based Capital Financial Partners Enterprises LLC, and Boston-based Capital Financial Partners LLC and Capital Financial Holdings LLC - operated a Ponzi scheme that raised almost $32 million from investors who were promised profits from loans to professional athletes.

But Defendants obtained few notes, failed to convert notes to securities, and generated no profits.  Instead, the Defendants simply misappropriated most of the money for their own purposes and investors lost everything they invested.  Michael Osborn owned and controlled VIP.  Along with Williams, Michael Osborn used a VIP-owned website called AgedDebt.net to solicit investors and tout their scheme. To hide his criminal past from prospective investors, Michael Osborn used an alias in his communications with prospective investors, and used his wife, Shenae Osborn, to sign corporate documents and investment contracts with investors.  During the scheme, VIP reported hundreds of thousands of dollars of fictitious investments gains to its investors.  In fact, VIP never sold the securities it claimed and generated no investment gains.  The Osborns and Williams simply took the money to pay personal expenses, including extended stays at a New York hotel where the Osborns resided, and to pay a legal judgment owed by Michael Osborn., The complaint alleges that, based on this conduct, VIP, Michael Osborn, Shenae Osborn and Williams violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The SEC alleges that Vincent Mehdizadeh created a shell company called New-Age Investment Consulting to carry out illegal stock sales and used the proceeds from those sales to boost Medboxs revenue.  Medbox allegedly issued press releases headlining the phony revenues as record earnings to legitimize itself as a viable commercial operation when in fact nearly 90 percent of the companys revenue in the first quarter of 2014 stemmed from sham transactions with New-Age.

Avalon allegedly made more than $21 million in the layering scheme involving U.S. stocks during a five-year period. According to the SECs complaint, Avalon also made more than $7 million in illicit profits through a cross-market manipulation scheme in which the firm bought and sold U.S. stocks at a loss in order to manipulate the prices of the stock and its corresponding options so that it could then profitably trade at artificial prices. Avalon allegedly used traders in Eastern Europe and Asia to conduct its trading, and the firm kept a portion of the profits and collected commissions from the traders., The SECs complaint also describes fraud charges against Avalons named owner Nathan Fayyer and Sergey Pustelnik, who allegedly kept his controlling interest in Avalon undisclosed and embedded himself at Lek Securities as a registered representative, using his position to facilitate the schemes., The SEC further alleges that Lek Securities and its owner Samuel Lek made the schemes possible by providing Avalon with access to the U.S. markets, approving the cross-market trading scheme, and improving its trading technology to assist Avalons trading. According to the SECs complaint, Lek Securities also relaxed its layering controls after Avalon complained. Avalon was the highest-producing customer for Lek Securities in terms of trading commissions, fees, and rebates generated., After filing its complaint in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, the SEC obtained an emergency court order freezing Avalons assets held in its account at Lek Securities as well as freezing and repatriating funds that Avalon has transferred overseas., The SECs investigation was conducted by Sarah S.

The announced purchase price was a 34.4 percent premium over Mobileyes closing price on Friday, March 10, of $47.27 per share.  After the announcement, Mobileye opened at its high for the day, $61.51, and closed at $60.62 per share, a 28 percent increase over its March 10 closing price., The SEC alleges that Ariel Darvasi and Amir Waldman were in possession of material nonpublic information about the impending acquisition when they purchased Mobileye securities.  On the morning of March 2, Darvasi liquidated all of the securities in his account and that afternoon, he purchased 30,000 shares of Mobileye worth nearly $1.4 million. On March 13, 2017, Darvasi sold 100 Mobileye shares for a realized gain of $1,473.45. The unrealized gain on his remaining 29,900 shares is approximately $427,000., The SEC alleges that Waldman began accumulating Mobileye call option contracts at strike prices above Mobileyes then current price starting on February 1, the same day that Intel and Mobileye executed a non-disclosure agreement. By February 28, Waldman had accumulated 7,012 call options contracts with strike prices ranging from $49 to $55. Mobileye last closed at or above $49 per share on August 23, 2016 and had not closed above $50 in the prior 17 months. Between March 1 and March 10, Waldman accumulated an additional 1,605 call options contracts with strike prices ranging from $49 to $55. As of March 10, Waldman spent $237,581 to acquire 5,339 Mobileye call options. After the announcement of the acquisition, Waldman sold 1,697 of his options contracts for a realized gain of approximately $1.54 million.

Vitale. The SECs complaint alleges that they misrepresented to investors that their money would be used to develop and market LottoNet and that sales agents did not receive commissions. At least 35 percent of investor proceeds were allegedly paid to boiler room sales agents in the form of commissions, and LottoNet allegedly siphoned investor funds for personal spending on clothing, wedding-related expenses, and strip clubs., According to the SECs complaint, which was unsealed in federal court today, among the pitches used in sales agent scripts prepared for cold calls to investors was youre looking at a monthly dividend payout of $8,500 every month on a $25,000 investment if LottoNet reaches 1 percent market share. The scripts also allegedly touted the purported safety of the investment, noting a 60 percent return as a worst case scenario if the company was ever sold. The SEC alleges that while LottoNet has raised a total of approximately $4.8 million from investors, the company had only paid $10,525.43 in investment returns to investors through the end of February. Sales agents allegedly have been paid more than $1.1 million out of investor funds., The SECs complaint further alleges that Vitale, who personally raised at least $1.4 million from investors, used the alias Donovan Kelly in an apparent attempt to hide from investors that he is permanently barred by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)., The SECs investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Miami office by Kate Zoladz, Gary Miller, and Allen J.

Among other things, the court ordered Jones to pay more than $3.9 million of allegedly ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties., On March 15, 2016, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action in federal court in Boston alleging that from approximately 2007 through 2015, Jones raised money by issuing promissory notes and personal guarantees to around 21 investors in several states and Washington, D.C.  Jones allegedly solicited investors to invest in an enterprise he called The Bridge Fund that purportedly provided high-yielding bridge loans to Jamaican businesses waiting for funding from approved commercial bank loans.  The SEC alleged that, instead of investing the money as he had promised, Jones used a large portion to make Ponzi payments to other investors and some to pay for his own personal expenses. The complaint alleged that many of the investors are retirees who are not sophisticated investors.  Jones is alleged to have issued periodic account statements to investors, some of whom routinely received payments, while others rolled over the accrued interest in their accounts.  Beginning in 2015, Jones allegedly failed to make certain interest payments.  According to the complaint, in July 2015, an attorney representing Jones informed many of the investors that Jones had used their funds for personal living expenses and to pay other investors.

23800,2017,SEC Charges Corporate Officer of 2 Utah Water Companies with Securities Fraud,"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced fraud charges against a former corporate secretary and treasurer of two Utah water companies for misappropriating and fraudulently selling corporate shares., The SECs complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Utah, alleges that Michael D. Shumway misappropriated unauthorized shares of stock in American Fork Irrigation Company (AFIC) and Lehi Irrigation Company (LIC) and sold them to unwitting investors for at least $435,500.  Shumway also allegedly misappropriated at least $633,396 from AFIC and LIC.  From at least 2003 through May 2015, Shumway allegedly engaged in a fraudulent scheme of falsifying AFIC and LIC books and records and issuing unauthorized shares in those companies and fraudulently selling the shares to investors.  The complaint alleges that shares in AFIC and LIC convey the right to an appropriation of water from each company.  The allegedly unauthorized shares Shumway sold did not have such water rights.  Shumway also allegedly established secret bank accounts that he used to misappropriate AFIC and LIC funds for his personal use.  Shumway allegedly misled the companies officers and directors in carrying out his fraud.  The total value of Shumways alleged misappropriation of shares and funds from AFIC and LIC is at least $1,068,896., The SECs complaint charges Shumway with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement, and an officer and director bar against Shumway.  Shumway agreed, without admitting or denying the allegations in the SECs complaint to the entry of a judgment imposing permanent injunctions and an officer-and-director bar, and ordering him liable for disgorgement of $435,500, payment of which will be deemed satisfied by the restitution ordered in the parallel federal criminal case., On December 14, 2016 Shumway pleaded guilty in federal district court in Utah to one count of felony wire fraud.  On April 5, 2016, he was sentenced to 12 months and 1 day and ordered to pay $1,100,481.78 in restitution., The SECs investigation was conducted by William McKean and Justin Sutherland.

23801,2017,SEC Obtains Second Asset Freeze in Suspected Insider Trading on Mobileye N.V. Acquisition,"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced it has obtained an emergency court order to freeze the assets of two Virginia-based traders who gleaned nearly $1 million in trading profits in advance of the March 13, 2017 announcement that Intel Corp. had agreed to acquire Israel-based Mobileye, N.V.  This is the SECs second civil action in connection with the Mobileye announcement., The SECs emergency action to freeze the proceeds of the traders allegedly highly suspicious transactions ensures that the potentially illegal profits cannot be removed from the accounts while the agencys investigation of the trading continues in both cases., According to the SECs complaint filed in federal court in New York, before market opening on Monday, March 13, Intel announced that it had agreed to acquire Mobileye through a tender offer for approximately $15.3 billion, or $63.54 per share.  The allegedly announced purchase price was a 34.4 percent premium over Mobileyes closing price on Friday, March 10, of $47.27 per share.  After the announcement, Mobileye opened at its high for the day, $61.51, and closed at $60.62 per share, a 28 percent increase over its March 10 closing price., The SEC alleges that Lawrence F. Cluff, Jr. and Roger E. Shaoul were in possession of material nonpublic information about the impending acquisition when they purchased Mobileye securities.  All of the suspicious trading allegedly occurred in two accounts held in Cluffs name.  Cluff had an existing account that was dormant since 2011 until he purchased Mobileye stock on January 30, 2017.  Cluff allegedly also opened a second account on January 29, which has only traded in Mobileye securities.  On February 1, the complaint alleges that Cluff transferred $161,500 to the new account and used essentially all of those funds to purchase 3,782 Mobileye shares at a cost of $161,421.68.  On that same day, he allegedly transferred $5,000 to the old account and used those funds, plus margin, to purchase Mobileye stock over the next two days., The complaint alleges that on February 28, an additional $28,000 was wired to Cluffs new account.  Around the time of this transfer, Shaoul allegedly appears to have impersonated Cluff in order to start issuing trading instructions to accumulate more Mobileye call options.  On March 8, Cluffs new account allegedly sold 425 Mobileye shares for $19,920.43, and then between March 8 and March 10, the account purchased approximately $20,000 in additional Mobileye call options expiring March 17 and March 24 with strike prices ranging from $50 to $55.  As of close of trading on Friday, March 10, the last trading day prior to the announcement, Cluffs new account allegedly held 3,414 Mobileye shares and 1,209 Mobileye call options with strike prices between $50 and $55.  Mobileyes shares had not closed above $50.00 in the prior 17 months.  After the announcement of the acquisition, Cluff sold 862 Mobileye call options for proceeds of $617,563.85 and his accounts have unrealized gains of approximately $335,000, representing a total profit of approximately $925,000., The emergency court order obtained by the SEC freezes the traders assets and prohibits the traders from destroying any evidence.  The SECs complaint charges the traders with violating Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder.  In addition to the emergency relief, the SEC seeks a final judgment ordering the traders to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains with interest, pay civil penalties, and be permanently enjoined from future violations., The expedited investigation is being conducted by Kevin M. Comeau, Daniel M. Konosky and Jay A. Scoggins of the SECs Denver Regional Office, under the supervision of Kurt L. Gottschall, and Julie K. Lutz.  The SECs litigation is being handled by Terry R.

23802,2017,27 Firms and Individuals Charged With Fraudulent Promotion of Stocks,"[The Securities and Exchange Commission filed enforcement actions against 27 individuals and entities behind various alleged stock promotion schemes that left investors with the impression they were reading independent, unbiased analyses on investing websites while writers were being secretly compensated for touting company stocks., SEC investigations uncovered scenarios in which public companies hired promoters or communications firms to generate publicity for their stocks, and the firms subsequently hired writers to publish articles that did not publicly disclose the payments from the companies. The writers allegedly posted bullish articles about the companies on the internet under the guise of impartiality when in reality they were nothing more than paid advertisements. More than 250 articles specifically included false statements that the writers had not been compensated by the companies they were writing about, the SEC alleges., According to the SECs orders as well as a pair of complaints filed in federal district court, deceptive measures were often used to hide the true sources of the articles from investors. For example, one writer wrote under his own name as well as at least nine pseudonyms, including a persona he invented who claimed to be an analyst and fund manager with almost 20 years of investment experience. One of the stock promotion firms went so far as to have some writers it hired sign non-disclosure agreements specifically preventing them from disclosing compensation they received., The SEC filed fraud charges against three public companies and seven stock promotion or communications firms as well as two company CEOs, six individuals at the firms, and nine writers. Of those charged, 17 have agreed to settlements that include disgorgement or penalties ranging from approximately $2,200 to nearly $3 million based on frequency and severity of their actions., The SECs litigation continues against promotion firms Lidingo Holdings, LLC and CSIR Group, LLC, their associates Kamilla Bjorlin, Andrew Hodge, Christine Petraglia and Herina Ayot, and writers, Brian Nichols, Vincent Cassano, Thomas Meyer and John Mylant. The complaints charge each of the litigating parties with violations, and/or aiding and abetting violations, of Sections 17(a) and 17(b) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC is seeking injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus pre- and post-judgment interest, and civil money penalties. In addition, the SEC is seeking penny stock bars against Bjorlin, Hodge, Petraglia and Ayot and an officer and director bar against Bjorlin., The SEC also instituted separate charges against another company for its involvement in circulating promotional materials that did not comply with prospectus requirements under the federal securities laws. The company settled the case., The SEC released an investor alert warning that articles on an investment research website that appear to be an unbiased source of information or provide commentary on multiple stocks may be part of an undisclosed paid stock promotion. Investors should never make an investment based solely on information published on an investment research website. When making an investment decision, thoroughly research the company using multiple sources., The SECs investigations were conducted by Beth Groves, Ian Rupell, Shelby Hunt, Jim Blenko, and Jonathan Jacobs with assistance from Michi Harthcock, Jamie Wohlert, Suzanne Romajas, and Frederick Block.

Glick and his unregistered investment advisory firm Financial Management Strategies (FMS), continued the freeze of assets in the name of the Defendants, and repeated its order that the Defendants repatriate foreign assets.  The court also continued the freeze of assets held in the name of relief defendant Glick Accounting Services.  The preliminary injunction order extended the terms of a temporary restraining order and asset freeze order that the court entered on March 23, 2017., In the complaint filed on March 23, 2017, the Commission alleged that Glick and FMS raised more than $6 million from investors, and that Glick and FMS misappropriated a significant portion of the investor funds to, among other things, pay personal expenses, purchase a Mercedes-Benz, pay other investors, and pay off loans and debts.  The complaint further alleged that Glick and FMS provided investors with false account statements to conceal the misappropriation.  The complaint also named Glicks business partner David B. Slagter, and Glicks business acquaintance, Edward H. Forte, as relief defendants for the purposes of recovering client funds that Glick transferred or paid them in the form of advances or loans., The April 6 order preliminarily enjoins Glick and FMS from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

23804,2017,Defendant in SEC Enforcement Action Indicted for Orchestrating $30 Million Stock Manipulation Scheme,"[On March 22, 2017, Ryan Gilbertson, a Minnesota man previously accused by the SEC of orchestrating an elaborate scheme to siphon millions of dollars from Dakota Plains Holdings, Inc., was indicted on 13 counts of wire fraud.  Also charged in the indictment were Douglas Hoskins and Nick Shermeta., The charges in the indictment arise from the same conduct alleged by the SEC.  According to <a href=https://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2016-231.html>the SECs complaint</a>, filed in federal court in Minnesota on October 31, 2016, Gilbertson and another company co-founder, installed their fathers as figurehead executives in order to secretly wield control of the company and issue millions of shares of stock to themselves, family, and friends.  They allegedly later hired one of their friends as CEO.  They allegedly caused the company to enter into an agreement to borrow money from them under generous terms that included extra bonus payments to Gilbertson, and other lenders based on the price of Dakota Plains stock after 20 days of trading following a reverse merger into a company with publicly-traded shares., According to the SECs complaint, Gilbertson enlisted friends and associates including Douglas Hoskins to choreograph extensive sales and purchases of Dakota Plains stock and cause the price to skyrocket from 30 cents to more than $12 per share during that 20-day period. The allegedly inflated stock price obligated Dakota Plains to make bonus payments totaling $32,851,800 to Gilbertson and others. After allegedly meeting his target to receive the bonus payments, Gilbertson ceased his alleged manipulation efforts. The stock price then allegedly steadily declined to pennies per share and the company was eventually delisted., Also named in the indictment was Minnesota-based stockbroker Nicholas Shermeta.  Shermeta consented to <a href=http://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2016/34-79195.pdf>an SEC order</a>, entered on October 31, 2016, finding that he willfully violated Section 15(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  According to the SECs order, he solicited investors for Dakota Plains and recommended the stock to his clients at the registered brokerage firm where he worked, but improperly brokered the sales through his unregistered firm rather than through his employer. Without admitting or denying the findings, Shermeta agreed to the entry of the SECs order requiring him to pay $75,000 in disgorgement, $11,075.49 in prejudgment interest, and a $50,000 penalty.  The SECs order also imposed industry bars on Shermeta with a right to apply for reentry after three years.,  , <i>https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2017/lr23804.htm</i><br/>]"
23805,2017,SEC Charges Two Lawyers and a Paralegal in a Stock Manipulation Scheme,"[The Securities and Exchange Commission filed fraud charges yesterday against a New York City-based securities lawyer for orchestrating taking control of two publicly traded shell companies and rigging them and their securities for use in market manipulation schemes for his personal profit.  Another lawyer and a paralegal are also charged for their roles in furthering the schemes., According to the SECs complaint, filed in federal court in New York City, Mustafa David Sayid used his position as a securities lawyer to gain control of two microcap companies, Nouveau Holdings, Ltd. and Striper Energy, Inc.  According to the SECs complaint, from 2012 to 2015, Sayid caused the two companies to issue convertible debt to him that could be redeemed for company stock for purported legal fees owed to him.  The complaint charges that Sayid profited by selling the convertible debt to a pair of stock manipulators, setting them up to dump large blocks of the companys stock in the over-the-counter markets.  Sayid allegedly made multiple false statements to investors and other third parties, while he coordinated with the pump-and-dump operators who were responsible for pumping each companys share price and then dumping the stock., According to the SECs complaint, Sayid hired Norman Reynolds, a securities lawyer practicing in Houston, Texas, to issue false opinion letters to persuade Nouveaus transfer agent to remove restrictive legends from millions of shares of Nouveau, which were then sold in a dump of Nouveaus stock.  The SEC alleges that Reynolds based his legal opinion on fabricated documentation from Sayid while negotiating for payment from the proceeds of the Nouveau pump and dump., The SEC alleges that Sayid hid his control of Nouveau and Striper by installing officers and directors at the companies who would follow his direction, including his paralegal, Kevin Jasper of New York City.  Jasper aided Sayids market manipulation schemes by signing false documents at Sayids direction., The SECs complaint charges Sayid, Reynolds, and Jasper with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and additionally charges Sayid and Reynolds with violating Sections 5(a) and (c) of the Securities Act., Jasper, who is cooperating with the SECs litigation against Sayid and Reynolds, has agreed to the entry of a judgment imposing permanent injunctions of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and permanent officer-and-director and penny stock bars, with the issue of any civil money penalties to be determined upon the SECs motion.

At the SECs request, U.S. District Judge Terry R. Means has entered an asset freeze and appointed a receiver over the company., The SECs complaint, filed on April 13, 2017 in Fort Worth federal court, alleges that, since early 2014, Mantford C. Hawkins and David E. Bell - the CEO and COO, respectively, of 4D Circle LLC - raised at least $9 million from 50 investors in seven states and Canada.  The complaint alleges that 4D Circle purported to be a wealth creation company focused on acquiring apartment and office buildings, to which it would then apply supposedly proprietary technology and managerial practices to generate greater profitability [with] less risk for our investors.  The companys website and written offering materials allegedly elaborated on these claims, asserting for instance that investors could earn returns of 30% within a 9-month time frame; investments were bonded; and investor funds were protected through the use of escrow accounts and third-party oversight.  The offering materials also allegedly included case studies of particular properties the company had acquired, which purported to demonstrate the profitability of its model., But, according to the SECs complaint, these representations and case studies were false.  The SEC contends, for instance, that Hawkins and Bell knew that:, The SECs complaint charges 4D Circle, Bell, and Hawkins with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In addition to seeking the asset freeze and receivership, the complaint seeks preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties., After receiving subpoenas in the Commissions underlying investigation and without admitting or denying the SECs allegations, 4D Circle consented to the asset freeze, receivership, and a preliminary injunction, while Hawkins and Bell agreed to preliminary injunctions barring them from committing further anti-fraud violations during the litigation., The SECs investigation was conducted by Robert C.

According to the SECs complaint, Esposito and Lionshare raised the funds from investors between June 2011 and June 2012, spending almost $300,000 of investor funds for personal expenses, and using $75,000 of investor funds to acquire control of a Massachusetts-based publicly-traded company, Cannabiz Mobile, Inc., by purchasing all of its convertible debt. The SECs complaint further alleged that, between May 2012 and August 2015, Esposito and Lionshare, together with Anthony Jay Pignatello of Manhattan Beach, California, concealed Esposito and Lionshares de facto control of Cannabiz and a large percentage of Cannabizs securities in order to profit by evading SEC Rule 144, which limits securities sales by affiliates, such as control persons.  Esposito and Lionshare allegedly did this by, among other things, installing James Gondolfe as the sole officer and director of Cannabiz - even though Esposito secretly controlled the company - to make false statements in Cannabizs public filings and other documents.  Esposito paid third-party stock promoters to tout Cannabiz stock in order to increase its stock price and trading volume; he sold significant amounts of Cannabiz convertible debt to others for almost $304,000; and with Pignatello and Renee Galizio of Loxahatchee, Florida, sold millions of shares of Cannabiz stock directly into the public market., The final default judgment, which was entered by the Honorable Allison D. Burroughs of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, enjoins Lionshare from future violations of Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Meadlin, with disseminating false information to prospective investors and clients in order to induce them to invest money with them., The case arose from the SECs Aberrational Performance Inquiry, an initiative led by the Enforcement Divisions Asset Management Unit that uses proprietary risk analytics to identify hedge funds with suspicious returns., The SECs complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that beginning in September 2012 and continuing through April 2013, Meadlin disseminated dozens of emails to prospective investors and clients in which he inflated Hyalines assets under management (AUM), claiming that Hyaline managed between $17 million and $25 million when it managed no more than $5.5 million during that time. The complaint also alleges that beginning in January 2013 and continuing to at least June 2014, Meadlin began touting a purported quantitative trading strategy and a fictitious Hyaline Capital Quantitative Fund (HCQF) in email solicitations to more than two dozen prospective investors and in subscription hedge fund databases. Meadlin allegedly claimed that HCQF had as much as $25 million in assets, and claimed historical performance returns dating back to 2009 that were purportedly from a proprietary algorithm, when, in fact, HCQF never existed; neither Meadlin nor Hyaline had acquired a proprietary algorithm; and the stated performance returns were based almost entirely on paper trades without real capital and exaggerated by approximately 20%. The complaint also alleges that before July 2013, Meadlin and Hyaline managed no assets in any quantitative strategy at all, and even after July 2013, they never managed more than $3.3 million in AUM in the strategy. The SECs complaint further alleges that Meadlin and Hyaline fraudulently induced investments from at least two clients using the false performance and AUM data., The SECs complaint charges Meadlin and Hyaline with violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the securities laws and seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement and penalties against Meadlin and Hyaline., The SECs investigation was conducted by Stephen B.

The complaint alleges that Fox had previously operated another oil and gas company - Frisco Exploration Company - but formed Wayne Energy in March 2015, after Frisco Exploration failed.   Wayne Energy was to be the manager of the joint venture.   The SEC further alleges that, to raise funds for the joint venture, Fox simply recycled offering documents he had used at Frisco Exploration.   But, according to the SECs complaint, other than occasionally changing the names of the entities, Fox did not customize the offering documents to the joint ventures business or risks.   And, according to the SEC, these offering documents falsely stated that Wayne Energy would not commingle its funds with those of the joint venture, and that Wayne Energy was an operator licensed with the Texas Railroad Commission, neither of which statements was true., In addition, the SEC alleges that Fox misappropriated most of the funds raised from investors.   Rather than use these funds for the Upshur County well, the complaint alleges that Fox spent approximately $500,000 of investor money on personal expenses, including more than $236,000 in casino gambling charges and cash withdrawals and approximately $240,000 on house and car payments, vacations, dining and shopping, and jewelry., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SECs complaint, Fox and Wayne Energy have agreed to a settlement that permanently enjoins them from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and requires them to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court upon the SECs motion.

The complaint further alleges that both Watts executed sham transactions - including one with Kent Wattss nephew, Kirby Caldwell - which allowed them to secretly control millions of shares of Hydrocarb stock.  The SEC contends that Kent Watts misled Hydrocarbs outside auditor about key details of these transactions, including the Wattss continued control over the shares transferred to Caldwell.

The complaint alleges that Krimm and KFS falsely claimed that they owned and operated their own highly successful mortgage loan business.

The complaint alleges that, contrary to what investors were told, Krimm and KFS operated no mortgage lending business of their own, and they used over 75% of the money from new investors to pay Krimms personal expenses and to pay back prior investors to maintain the appearance that KFS was performing profitably., In a parallel action, the Investor Protection Unit of the Delaware Department of Justice today announced criminal charges against Krimm., The SECs complaint alleges that Krimm and KFS violated the antifraud provisions of the securities laws in Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as the securities registration provisions in Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act.

Abdallah, 09-cr-717 (E.D.N.Y.), Abdallah used a fictitious name to hide his criminal past from one of his victims, and when soliciting investments, Abdallah lied to his victims regarding the nature and use of investment proceeds.

Varacchi and his firm allegedly stole at least $3.95 million from investors, including over $1 million to settle litigation brought by Varacchis prior employer. On February 3, 2017, the <a href=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2017/lr23742.htm>SEC obtained an asset freeze</a> and other preliminary relief against Sentinel, Varacchi, and the Radar Funds., Sentinel, Varacchi, and the Radar Funds consented to entry of the judgment.

According to the SECs complaint, Crowe met the deputy treasurers demand for campaign contributions by filtering $16,000 through his personal bank account and reimbursing individuals for contributions made in their own names.  The SEC also alleged that Crowe continued to make concealed campaign contributions in response to the deputy treasurers threats that State Street would lose the business.  The SEC previously reached settlements with State Street and one of its former employees in related actions., Without admitting or denying the SECs allegations, Crowe consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violations of Section 17(a)(1) of the Securities Act of 1933, ordering him to pay $16,000 in disgorgement plus $3,840.01 in prejudgment interest, and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $75,000.,  , <i>https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2017/lr23823.htm</i><br/>]"

The defendants have agreed to pay more than $4 million to settle charges that they used new investor money to repay earlier investors in Ponzi-like fashion and tapped investor funds for the CEOs personal use., The complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleges that from at least November 2013 through at least November 2015, Verto Capital and Schantz raised approximately $12.5 million selling promissory notes to purportedly fund Verto Capitals purchase and sale of life settlements, which are life insurance policies sold in the secondary market.  The SEC alleges that they misrepresented to investors that Verto Capital was a profitable company and investor funds would be used for general working capital purposes.  Verto Capital and other Schantz businesses had been unprofitable for several years, according to the SECs complaint, and Schantz resorted to taking disproportionately large distributions of investor funds for himself and using new investor money to repay earlier investors., Verto Capital and Schantz also allegedly made misrepresentations to investors about the safety of the notes and collateral underlying them.  The SEC alleges that the promissory notes were primarily sold through a group of insurance brokers in Texas, and religious investors were targeted., A Fair Fund will be created to return money collected in the settlement to harmed investors.  Schantz and Verto Capital agreed to pay disgorgement of $3,433,666 plus interest of $124,851 and a penalty of $600,000.

Humphrey, who worked at the SEC from 1998 to 2014, concealed his personal trading from the SECs ethics office and later misrepresented his trading activities to the SECs Office of Inspector General when questioned during an investigation., SEC employees are subject to rigorous rules regarding securities transactions to guard against even the appearance of using public office for private gain. The ethics rules specifically prohibit trading in options or derivatives. The rules also require staff to disclose their securities holdings and transactions to the agencys ethics office in annual filings., According to the SECs complaint, Humphrey violated the rules by engaging in transactions involving derivatives, failing to obtain pre-clearance before trading non-prohibited securities, and failing to hold securities for the required period., The SECs complaint charges Humphrey with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act. Humphrey has agreed to settle the charges and pay $51,917 in disgorgement of profits made in the improper trades plus $4,774 in interest and a $51,917 penalty.

But they never came close to raising the funds necessary to start the project, and in the meantime they pocketed the $5.6 million they did raise and used it for extravagant trips and personal purchases at stores such as Saks Fifth Avenue, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Prada, and Versace.

23829,2017,SEC Announces Charges in Fraudulent Real Estate Investment Scheme,"[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on April 28, 2017, it charged Carl Keith Battie with orchestrating a multiyear fraudulent real estate investment scam that victimized at least 70 investors., According to the SECs complaint, filed in federal district court in Dallas, Texas, Battie, 59, a British citizen who resided in Decatur, Georgia until his arrest in January 2015, raised nearly $9 million between 2008 and 2014, through two investment programs tied to single and multi-family real estate. According to the SEC, Battie concealed his identity from investors by using a now-deceased Dallas-based pitchman to market the investments. But, the SEC alleges that Battie controlled the entire scheme behind the scenes, created most of the investment literature and slide presentations the pitchman used, and often spoke with investors by phone using aliases. The SEC alleges that Battie falsely described both investments as Truly Passive and Guaranteed and asserted that they would generate returns ranging from 16% to 35% per year. Offering materials further falsely claimed that Batties organization had a team of professionals operating thousands of properties. Investors in the second program were falsely told that they were buying so-called mortgage notes, which were promissory notes purportedly secured by residential real estate, at sharp discounts to the value of the properties securing them, which supposedly locked in instant profit, and that all payments on the note were guaranteed regardless of any default by the properties tenants or mortgagees., But, as the SEC alleges, almost nothing told to investors was true. There was no team with thousands of properties; just Battie and a couple of administrative assistants, and fewer than 150 properties. And these properties bore little resemblance to those described in offering materials and sales pitches. Nearly all were highly distressed, having been acquired by Battie out of foreclosure. A few were superficially refurbished, but most were not improved at all. To provide the purported instant profit to mortgage note investors, Battie artificially inflated the apparent market value of the properties by repeatedly selling them back and forth between companies he controlled. To the extent any tenants occupied the properties, they were uniformly high-risk and low revenue, which forced Battie to rely on new investor funds to make Ponzi payments to earlier investors., In a parallel federal criminal case, Battie has pleaded guilty to one charge of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and has been sentenced to 10 years in prison and ordered to pay restitution of $11,402,794.47., The SECs action charges Battie with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Battie has consented to a permanent injunction against future violations of all of these provisions. Battie is liable for disgorgement, plus prejudgment interest, of over $10 million, which is deemed satisfied by the criminal restitution order. The SEC is not imposing a civil penalty due to Batties prison sentence., The SEC investigation was conducted by Richard Zadina, and Chris Davis has led the SECs litigation.

The SECs original complaint, filed on December 21, 2016, charged Naris Chamroonrat of Bangkok, Thailand, and Adam L. Plumer of Las Vegas, Nevada, in connection with the scheme. The SEC alleges that the defendants pocketed more than $1.4 million in deposits from hundreds of defrauded investors worldwide., The SECs amended complaint alleges that Armon, Avnon, and G6, together with the previously charged defendants Chamroonrat and Plumer, lured investors to day-trade through Nonko Trading, an unregistered brokerage firm, with promises of generous leverage, low trading commissions, and low minimum deposit requirements. According to the SECs complaint, rather than using a live securities trading platform, Nonko Trading provided certain investors with training accounts that merely simulated the placement and execution of trade orders. So when these investors sent funds to Nonko Trading and proceeded to place trade orders, the orders were never actually routed to the markets. The SEC alleges that investor money was instead used to fund defendants personal expenses, pay associates, and make Ponzi-like payments to investors who asked to close their accounts., According to the SECs complaint, the scheme deliberately targeted investors who were inexperienced and more likely to place unprofitable trades, making them less likely to ask to withdraw funds from their accounts., In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the District of New Jersey announced criminal charges against Avnon and Armon. In May 2017, Chamroonrat entered a guilty plea in the parallel criminal case., The SECs amended complaint charges Avnon, Armon, and G Six, as well as the previously charged defendants Chamroonrat and Plumer, with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b), 15(a)(1) and 20(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.

Murray purchased Fitbit call options just minutes before a fake tender offer that he orchestrated was filed on the SECs EDGAR system purporting that a company named ABM Capital LTD sought to acquire Fitbits outstanding shares at a substantial premium.  Fitbits stock price temporarily spiked when the tender offer became publicly available on Nov. 10, 2016, and Murray sold all of his options for a profit of approximately $3,100., The SEC alleges that Murray created an email account under the name of someone he found on the internet, and the email account was used to gain access to the EDGAR system.

23838,2017,SEC Halts Fraudulent Mortgage Investment Scheme,"[On May 15, 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed an emergency action to stop a fraudulent mortgage investment scheme that raised approximately $22.7 million from approximately 100 investors., The SECs complaint, filed under seal in federal court in Sherman, Texas on May 15, 2017 and unsealed on May 19, 2017, alleges that Frisco, Texas resident Thurman P. Bryant, III and his company, Bryant United Capital Funding, Inc. (BUCF), have raised approximately $22.7 million from approximately 100 investors across the country, approximately $1.4 million of which Bryant has raised just since January 2017.  Bryant falsely promised these investors a risk-free, guaranteed minimum 30% annual returns on investments Bryant claimed he would make in the mortgage industry.  Specifically, he allegedly told investors that BUCF would fund mortgages, and that those mortgages would be immediately sold to third parties in exchange for a fixed fee.  He also allegedly told investors that their funds would be placed in a safe escrow account to serve solely as proof of funds to secure a line of credit from which BUCF would fund the mortgage loans.  In addition, Bryant and BUCF allegedly sent investors monthly account statements purportedly showing that their initial investment monies were still safe in an escrow account., The SEC alleges, however, that Bryants representations were false.  The complaint alleges, for instance, that contrary to what he told investors, Bryant commingled investor funds in a single deposit account and intentionally misappropriated $4.8 million to cover personal expenses, including rent and luxury car payments, a housekeeper, meals and groceries, private school tuition, horse riding expenses, and for an apartment; funneled approximately $16.1 million to Houston, Texas-based relief defendants Arthur F. Wammel and Wammel Group for high-risk securities trading and investments in various businesses; sent $1.37 million to supposed concert promoter Carlos D. Goodspeed d/b/a Top Agent Entertainment for no apparent legitimate or lawful reason; sent $140,000 to Thurman P. Bryant, Jr. as purported but unearned investment returns; and made Ponzi payments to investors.  The SEC also alleges that the monthly account statements defendants distributed were false, misleading, and served to further their fraudulent scheme., The SECs complaint charges Bryant and BUCF with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and disgorgement with prejudgment interest., At the SECs request, U.S. District Judge Amos L. Mazzant of the Eastern District of Texas appointed a receiver over the defendants assets and entered a temporary restraining order, asset freeze, and other equitable relief., The SECs investigation was conducted by Jason Reinsch and Carol Stumbaugh of the SECs Fort Worth Regional Office.

23839,2017,"Civil Action No. 2:16-cv-03250 (C.D. Cal., filed May 12, 2016)","[A federal grand jury in San Francisco has indicted Gregg Jaclin, a New Jersey securities attorney, on charges relating to a scheme to manufacture public shell companies and sell them, including to some purchasers who used the shells for market manipulation schemes.  The 8-count indictment, returned May 18, 2017, also charges Jaclin with obstruction of justice of two SEC investigations.  Jaclin was charged in 2016 in <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2016/lr23537.htm>a parallel SEC matter</a>., According to the indictment, Jaclin was an attorney specializing in penny stock companies.  He worked with another individual-an undisclosed control person-to incorporate ten new companies, take them public, help get regulatory clearance to enable public trading of their stock, and sell them.  Eight companies were sold for a total of approximately $2.25 million.  Two companies were the subject of SEC enforcement actions before they could be sold.  (see Stop Orders <a href=/litigation/admin/2013/33-9444.pdf>33-9444</a> (Aug. 22, 2013) and <a href=/litigation/stoporders/2014/33-9577.pdf>33-9577</a> (April 23, 2014))., According to the indictment, for each company and with Jaclins knowledge or at his suggestion or direction, the control person hired a CEO and created a business plan to give the impression of a real company poised for growth.  In fact, each CEO took all direction from the control person, and the true plan was to sell the company.  Jaclin and those working at his direction, however, prepared numerous false and misleading documents that hid the control person and the actual business plan:  registration statements to take the companies public; quarterly and annual reports; and attorney opinion letters.  Jaclin also facilitated the sale of the shell companies by locating some of the purchasers and documenting all of the transactions., The criminal case against Jaclin is based on much of the same conduct alleged in an amended SEC complaint, which was filed on November 22, 2016.  The SECs complaint alleged that Jaclin and his co-defendant, undisclosed control person Imran Husain, engaged in a shell factory scheme to create and sell public companies at a profit.  The SECs amended complaint charged:  (i) Husain with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and, in the alternative, as a control person, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; (ii) Jaclin with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder; (iii) Husain and Jaclin, in the alternative, with aiding and abetting violations of Section 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and (iv) Husain and Jaclin with aiding and abetting violations of Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 15d-1, and 15d-13 thereunder.

According to the SECs complaint, Worrall serves as a health insurance specialist in the Center for Medicare and tipped Blaszczak about at least three pending CMS decisions that affected the amount of money that companies receive from Medicare to provide services or products related to cancer treatments or kidney dialysis., Blaszczak allegedly tipped two analysts at a hedge fund advisory firm that paid him as a consultant.

The SEC alleged that Broidy billed clients approximately $643,000 in excess fees and covered it up by altering the amount of management fees recorded on forms issued by brokerage firms before sending the forms to his clients.  The SEC further alleged that Broidy fraudulently obtained additional funds to pay his personal expenses by misappropriating approximately $865,000 in assets from clients trusts for which he was trustee, and that Broidy also defrauded advisory clients about some investments they made in privately-held companies when he did not inform them he was affiliated with those companies.

Mining for bitcoin or other virtual currencies means applying computer power to try to solve complex equations that verify a group of transactions in that virtual currency.  The first computer or collection of computers to solve an equation is awarded new units of that virtual currency.  According to the SECs complaint, GAW Miners and ZenMiner did not own enough computing power for the mining they promised to conduct, so most investors paid for a share of computing power that never existed.  Returns allegedly paid to some investors came from proceeds generated from sales to other investors., The final judgment against GAW Miners and ZenMiner permanently enjoins each of them from violating Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and orders each of them to pay, jointly and severally, $10,384,099 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest.

According to the complaint, in April 2014, at the request of its new auditors, CannaVEST restated the three quarterly filings for 2013 in order to report PhytoSpheres $8 million value, not the $35 million it had previously reported., The SECs complaint charges CannaVEST with fraud, filing false financial reports, and other federal securities law violations, and seeks a permanent injunction and civil money penalties.

23863,2017,SEC Charges CEO and Attorney With Scheme To Disguise Nature Of Company Financing,"[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced charges involving a scheme to disguise the nature of a public companys financing amid financial difficulties, and a corresponding manipulation of the price of the companys stock perpetrated by an individual previously barred from serving as an officer or director., According to the SECs complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, beginning in 2012, Arista began to experience difficulty raising long-term capital for its operations. On the recommendation of William A. Schmitz, Aristas CEO, Michael T. Hughes, Arista counsel, and Peter Kolokouris, an Arista consultant who settled fraud charges with the Commission in the 1990s, Arista raised approximately $1 million through private sales of Arista stock owned by Kolokouris family. According to the SEC, in 2012, Schmitz and Hughes helped the Kolokouris family sell their stock to private investors, with the proceeds then used to provide desperately needed financing for the company, but in the guise of a fictitious loan from a purportedly independent third party, which was in fact controlled by Kolokouris. In order to effectuate the stock sales, the complaint alleges that Kolokouris manipulated Arista stock, which inflated the public market price and thereby misled the private investors to believe that they were acquiring the Kolokouris family stock at a discount. The complaint further alleges that Arista falsely and misleadingly stated in numerous public filings with the Commission - beginning with a September 10, 2012 Form 8-K - that the financing came from a line of credit with a third-party lender. Kolokouris, Schmitz and Hughes created internal Arista documentation designed to give the false appearance that Aristas disclosures were consistent with internal corporate records. Lastly, the SEC alleges that Kolokouris and various Kolokouris family members violated Regulation M by purchasing shares while engaged in a distribution of Arista stock., The SECs complaint charges:, Schmitz has agreed to settle the SECs fraud charges, without admitting or denying liability, and has agreed to a three-year officer and director bar, a three-year penny stock bar, and to pay a penalty of $80,000.

The complaint alleges that, in connection with these unregistered stock offerings, Lovera made numerous misstatements to investors about Oxford Citys assets, its business plan, its future profitability, and the composition of its management. The complaint further alleges that Lovera and others falsely told prospective investors they could lock in a discounted price on Oxford City stock using the companys voice verification system, which they claimed linked the investors personal information to a filing with the SEC.

In fact, the SEC alleges that Bitcoin Store has never had any operations nor generated the gross sales it touted.  In 2015, for example, Bitcoin Stores bank accounts allegedly received less than $250,000 in incoming transfers, none of which appear to reflect revenue from customers.

Ho then used all of the money in a newly-opened brokerage account - about $8000 - to purchase 296 Shaw short term call options on Friday, July 27, 2012, the last trading day before the public announcement of the merger.  Prior to purchasing these options, Ho had multiple communications with two individuals who had personal relationships with a Shaw employee who had information concerning the merger.

For example, as part of one such scam, a boiler room salesman allegedly claimed that the Walt Disney Company was buying into a purported media and internet company and that would cause the penny stocks price to increase substantially., During these calls, victims were allegedly harassed and threatened by sales personnel.  When one victim complained about his losses, a sales representative allegedly said, I am tired of hearing from you.  Do you have any rope at home?  If so tie a knot and hang yourself or get a gun and blow your head off.  According to the SECs complaint, in a typical phone call, telemarketers would direct victims to place trades and tell them how many shares to purchase and at what price.  With this information about the victims trades, the orchestrators and the boiler room sales personnel allegedly placed opposing sell orders to dump their own shares, realizing more than $14 million in illegal proceeds while the victims lost millions of dollars, including retirement savings., In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York announced criminal charges., The SECs complaint, filed in federal district court in Brooklyn, N.Y., charges all defendants with fraud and nine with market manipulation.  The SEC is seeking permanent injunctions, disgorgement with interest, civil penalties, penny stock bars, and an officer-and-director bar from one of the orchestrators of the scheme.

They then allegedly created the false appearance of active trading by making manipulative trades from those accounts to inflate the stock prices.  According to the SECs complaint, Flowers and Nevett subsequently dumped their own shares into the open market at the expense of innocent investors, who were left with stock that is virtually worthless., The SEC alleges that Flowers, his company Fruition Inc.

The first computer or collection of computers to solve an equation is awarded new units of that virtual currency.  According to the SECs complaint, GAW Miners and ZenMiner did not own enough computing power for the mining they promised to conduct, so most investors paid for a share of computing power that never existed.

According to the SECs complaint, between August and October 2012, Genovese schemed with Mirman to sell Liberty Silver shares to JTFs customers in part by agreeing to loan $2 million indirectly to JTF without disclosing the loan to the customers.  The complaint alleges that Genovese also touted Liberty Silver in newspaper articles while failing to disclose that he had paid for the articles, that he was dumping millions of shares of Liberty Silver stock, and the financial arrangements between himself and JTF.

23896,2017,CEO of Oil and Gas Company Caught Using Investor Funds for School Tuition and Entertainment,"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that a Texas-based oil and gas company and its CEO have agreed to pay $750,000 for misleading investors about amounts spent on commission payments to sales agents and administrative expenses, and for misappropriating investor funds for personal expenses., According to the SECs complaint, from approximately November 2014 through July 2016, 7S Oil &amp; Gas, LLC and William Alexander Gilligan Sewell raised almost $7 million from at least 70 investors nationwide through a series of unregistered offerings in oil and gas projects. The SEC alleges that 7S and Sewell lured investors primarily through a network of sales agents and also a series of YouTube videos including one in which Sewell claimed that for sure you will get some type of return because theres no such thing as a dry hole, as well as another video depicting oil gushing out of a well with Sewell commenting that you got back gold coming out of that well.  The SEC also alleges that 7S offering documents told investors that no more than 10% would be spent on marketing costs, commissions to sales agents, and salaries and that 85% of investor funds would be spent on oil and gas operations.  In reality, as alleged in the complaint 7S paid commissions as high as 35% to its sales agents out of investor proceeds and applied only at most 57% of investor funds toward operating the wells.  7S and Sewell also allegedly used more than $90,000 in investor funds to pay tuition for his children, entertainment expenses, and other personal expenses.  The SEC also alleges that 7S paid out sham royalty payments to some investors, which led investors to believe 7S was making a return on their investment based on oil sold to an independent third party., The SECs complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, charges 7S and Sewell with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The SEC also alleges that Vergeous and Renfroe misled investors by failing to disclose that Dream Team held complete control over all intellectual property rights associated with any joint video game projects and that Renfroe had a 30 percent ownership stake in Dream Team, despite stating that no conflicts of interest exist., The SECs complaint further alleges that Renfroe was not registered with the SEC as a broker-dealer.

23911,2017,SEC Uncovers Wide-Reaching Insider Trading Scheme,"[, The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced insider trading charges against seven individuals who generated millions in profits by trading on confidential information about dozens of impending mergers and acquisitions.  Data analysis allowed the SECs enforcement staff to uncover the illicit trading despite the traders alleged use of shell companies, code words, and an encrypted, self-destructing messaging application to evade detection., In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York today unsealed criminal charges against the same seven individuals., According to the SECs complaint, Daniel Rivas, a former IT employee of a large bank, was at the center of the alleged scheme, misusing his access to a bank computer system to tip four individuals who traded on the information.  He allegedly tipped others who also traded and passed along the tips.  According to the complaint, the traders profited on market-moving news related to 30 impending corporate deals from October 2014 to April 2017., The SECs complaint alleges that Rivas frequently tipped his girlfriends father, James Moodhe, who traded on the information and used coded conversations and in-person meetings to relay the tips to his friend, Michael Siva, a financial advisor at a brokerage firm.  Siva allegedly used the confidential information to make profitable trades for his brokerage firm clients, earning commissions for himself in the process, and he passed numerous tips along to a client who traded on them.  The complaint alleges that Siva also traded on behalf of himself and his wife based on two of the tips he got from Moodhe, a former financial services company treasurer., A separate trading ring allegedly involved two of Rivass friends in Florida, Roberto Rodriguez and Rodolfo Sablon, who discussed tips on an encrypted, self-destructing smartphone messaging application and used shell companies to carry out their insider trading.  Although Rodriguez and Sablon were inexperienced traders, in just over a year they turned less than $100,000 into more than $2 million in profits by making aggressive options trades based on the confidential information.  Rodriguez also is alleged to have passed several tips to one of his friends who also traded., According to the SECs complaint, a third trading ring involved Jhonatan Zoquier, another inexperienced trader who profited by trading on inside information communicated through the encrypted messaging application.  The complaint further alleges that New Jersey-based Zoquier repeatedly passed the confidential information along to Jeffrey Rogiers of Oakland, California, who placed several illegal trades for himself and tipped others to trade., The case stems from the SEC Market Abuse Units Analysis and Detection Center, which uses data analysis tools to detect suspicious patterns such as improbably successful trading across different securities over time. Enhanced detection capabilities enabled SEC enforcement staff to spot the unusual trading activities., The SECs complaint, which was filed in the Southern District of New York, charges Rivas, Moodhe, Rodriguez, Sablon, Zoquier, Siva, and Rogiers with violating Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions along with the return of allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest and penalties., The SECs investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Walker Newell and David Makol with assistance from John Rymas.

The SEC alleges that Drake went to elaborate lengths to conceal his fraud, including creating and sending false documents and masquerading as another person to corroborate his lies., The SEC alleges that Drake, then with Los Angeles-based HCR Wealth Advisors, deceived the clients for more than three years, telling them that they paid a special VIP annual rate of 0.15 to 0.20 percent of their assets under management when in fact they paid 1 percent.  Drakes deception led the clients to pay $1.2 million more in management fees than Drake represented.Â  Drake personally received approximately $900,000 of incentive-based compensation based on the fees paid by the clients during the course of his deception., According to the SECs complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, Drake repeatedly lied to the clients and their representatives and sent false and misleading emails, deceptive fee reports, and other fabricated documents.

For each of those offerings, a community facilities district established by the City of Beaumont, California agreed to provide investors with annual continuing disclosures, including important financial information and operating data. From at least 2004 to April 2013, the district regularly failed to provide investors with the promised information. The Beaumont Financing Authority failed to disclose this poor record of compliance when it conducted the 2012 and 2013 offerings totaling more than $32 million.

Earlier, on November 9, 2016, as part of a settlement, Judge Pauley entered a final judgement against Cayman Islands-based, Caledonian Bank Ltd. and Caledonian Securities Ltd. (Caledonian Entities)., The SEC charged these defendants with conducting unregistered sales of penny stock securities, reaping over $75 million in illegal sales proceeds.   Simultaneously with filing its complaint, the SEC obtained an emergency court order freezing assets of the Defendants located in the United States., The defendants, as alleged, sold penny stocks in unregistered distributions from their U.S. brokerage accounts of four shell company issuers, namely, Swingplane Ventures, Inc., Goff Corp., Norstra Energy Inc. and Xumanii, Inc.  Each of the unregistered distributions took place through virtually the same scheme.  The issuers first filed with the Commission bogus Form S-1 registration statements that purported to register public offerings of securities when, in fact, no bona fide offerings or sales occurred because the securities purportedly sold remained in the control of the issuers and their affiliates.  In the sham offerings, the issuers pretended to sell securities to investors residing in such places as Serbia, Mexico, Ireland, Norway, Panama, and Jamaica, while the issuers or their affiliates maintained control and possession of the stock certificates in a scheme where:  (1) restricted stock was passed off as free trading unrestricted stock; (2) the share certificates issued were subsequently transferred, without restrictive legends, to the defendants; and (3) the defendants deposited the shares into their U.S. brokerage accounts and sold the shares to the public.  The defendants then offered and sold into the public markets hundreds of millions of shares of the four issuers in unregistered distributions simultaneously with aggressive and extensive promotion campaigns.  Each of the four stocks lost virtually all of its market value within months of the unregistered sales., The court entered a final judgment against the Caledonian Entities imposing permanent injunctions against future violations of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and a penny stock bar permanently barring them from participating in an offering of a penny stock.  The judgment further found the Caledonian Entities liable on a joint and several basis in the amount of $25 million, but payment for this amount was waived based on liquidation proceedings filed in the U.S. and the Cayman Islands., With regard to Verdmont, the court entered a final judgment imposing a permanent injunction against future violations of Section 5 of the Securities Act and a permanent penny stock bar.  The final judgment also ordered Verdmont to pay $19.2 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest and a civil penalty of $19.2 million.  In a separate order, the court directed certain funds that were the subject of the SECs prior asset freeze to be turned over to the SEC., The court also entered final judgments against Clear Water and Legacy Global imposing permanent injunctions against future violations of Section 5 of the Securities Act and permanent penny stock bars and ordering monetary relief in disgorgement, interest and civil penalties of over $17.3 million and $14.9 million, respectively., The SECs investigation was conducted by Ernesto G.

According to the complaint, Bennett exaggerated the safety of the notes and success of her firm, touting it as a profitable business able to pay annual returns as high as 15 percent.  The complaint alleges that while Bennett said investor funds would be used for corporate purposes, she spent some on personal expenses and used other funds to repay earlier investors, a hallmark of a Ponzi scheme.  According to the complaint, Bennett took steps to conceal and continue the alleged scheme, including lying to regulators about the note sales, repaying investors with loans she obtained by inflating her net worth, and replacing existing convertible notes with sham promissory notes., In a parallel case, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the District of Maryland unsealed criminal charges against Bennett., The SEC encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people selling them investments by using the <a href=http://www.investor.gov/>SECs investor.gov website</a> to identify whether they are registered professionals and to search for any disciplinary history.

The SECs complaint, <a href=https://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2017-63.html>filed in March 2017</a>, alleges that Lek Securities and Samuel Lek aided and abetted manipulative trading schemes by one of Lek Securities customers, Ukraine-based trading firm Avalon FA Ltd, Avalons owner Nathan Fayyer, and its alleged undisclosed control person, Sergey Pustelnik., The Court denied the Lek defendants motion to dismiss in its entirety, rejecting their arguments that the trading schemes at issue in the Complaint were not manipulative.  The SECs complaint alleges two types of manipulative trading, layering and cross-market manipulation.  Layering involves the entry of non-bona fide orders (orders that the trader allegedly does not intend to execute and that have no legitimate economic reason) to trick others into trading at artificial prices.  The cross-market manipulation involves buying and selling stocks at a loss, allegedly for the purpose of moving the prices of corresponding options, so that Avalon could make a profit by trading those options at artificial prices., The Court found that the two alleged manipulative trading schemes-if proven-would violate Sections 10(b) and 9(a)(2) of the Exchange Act and Section 17(a)(1) of the Securities Act.  The Court also concluded that the SEC properly alleged, for the purpose of stating a claim, that Lek Securities and Samuel Lek aided and abetted Avalons manipulative trading schemes., The litigation is being led by David J. Gottesman, Olivia S. Choe, and Sarah S. Nilson. The SECs investigation was conducted by Ms. Nilson, Owen A.

23924,2017,SEC Files Charges in Oil Drilling Investment Scheme,"[The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) filed a civil injunctive action on August 11, 2017, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Georgia against two Tennessee men and an accomplice in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, for defrauding investors, whom they lured by false promises of high returns from an oil drilling investment opportunity., According to the Commissions complaint, David R. Greenlee and David A. Stewart Jr. orchestrated the $15 million scheme by recruiting and controlling a network of salesmen who offered and sold investors a stake in various companies purportedly using enhanced oil recovery techniques like fracking to extract and sell oil from wells in Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas.  Investors were allegedly promised profits of 15 to 50 percent per year for decades., The Commissions complaint alleges that Greenlee and Stewart used fake names like Dave Johnson when speaking to investors in order to hide their past criminal records, and they diverted nearly two-thirds of the money raised from investors to pay themselves and their salesmen as well as advertise for new investors.  According to the Commissions complaint, minimal funds were used for oil production at just a few of the wells in order to create the appearance of oil production and dupe investors who wanted to see activity in-person., The Commissions complaint further alleges that Richard Ric P. Underwood helped Greenlee and Stewart draft false offering brochures, and he oversaw a boiler room sales team of telemarketers in Florida as they solicited investors nationwide.  According to the Commissions complaint, Greenlee and Stewart operated their scheme through two Tennessee corporations, Southern Energy Group, Inc., which is now administratively dissolved, and Black Gold Resources, Inc., which later changed its name to Tennstar Energy, Inc., The Commissions complaint alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws in Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.  The SEC seeks the disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus pre-judgment interest, civil penalties, and permanent injunctions., The Commissions investigation was conducted by Brian M.

The SECs complaint, filed in federal court in Boston, Massachusetts, alleges that from 2010 to 2013, Mr. Navellier and his firm defrauded their clients and prospective clients, misleading them about the performance track record of the Vireo AlphaSector investment strategies that the firm offered under the Vireo brand name.  First, Mr. Navellier and his firm allegedly breached their fiduciary duty to clients and prospective clients by ignoring and concealing red flags that should have alerted them that the investment strategies had not performed as advertised.  Second, Navellier &amp; Associates allegedly distributed materially false advertisements and client communications about the performance track record of the investment strategies.  Third, as Mr. Navellier and his firm realized their misrepresentations could get them in legal trouble, they allegedly sold the Vireo line of business in August 2013 for $14 million, rather than correcting their prior misrepresentations to their clients or informing their clients about their conflicts of interest in selling the Vireo business., Navellier &amp; Associates advertisements claimed that client assets had been invested in the investment strategies from April 2001 to September 2008 and that the strategies had significantly outperformed the S&amp;P 500 Index from April 2001 to September 2008.  In fact, no client assets had tracked the strategy from April 2001 through September 2008, and even as a back-test the claimed performance was substantially overstated., The SECs complaint alleges that Navellier &amp; Associates violated Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-1(a)(5) and that Louis Navellier violated and, in the alternative, aided and abetted Navellier &amp; Associates violations of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Advisers Act., The SECs case is being handled by Rory Alex, William Donahue, and Marc Jones of the Boston Regional Office and Robert Baker of the Asset Management Unit., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2017/comp23925.pdf>SEC Complaint</a>,  , <i>https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2017/lr23925.htm</i><br/>]"

Kita, a CPA and former accountant at Celator Pharmaceuticals Inc., tipped two of his friends with confidential information about the clinical trial results for Celators cancer drug and its acquisition by Dublin-based Jazz Pharmaceuticals Plc almost three months later.  Celators stock rose more than 400 percent in March 2016 when it announced positive results for its drug to treat leukemia, and Jazz Pharmaceuticals offered to pay a hefty premium in May 2016 to acquire Celator., According to the SECs complaint, Daniel Perez and Richard Yu purchased Celator stock based on Kitas tips before the two announcements and agreed to share their trading profits with him.  The SEC alleges that Richard Yu passed Kitas tips to his father, Chiang Yu, who also traded in advance of both announcements.  To avoid detection, Kita allegedly communicated with Perez and Richard Yu through an encrypted smartphone application., In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the District of New Jersey today filed criminal charges against Kita, Perez, Richard Yu, and Chiang Yu., The SECs complaint charges Kita, Perez, Richard Yu, and Chiang Yu with violating antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and related SEC antifraud rules., The SECs continuing investigation is being conducted by David W.

He allegedly commingled the funds with his own money and used them for his own purposes, and in some instances he used customer funds to pay returns to earlier investors.  According to the SECs complaint, Vaccarelli asked one customer to sign an agreement that she would not provide certain information to FINRA or the SEC.  Vaccarelli allegedly sold more than $450,000 in securities that were held in trust for the care and maintenance of a beneficiary and used some of the proceeds to pay business and personal expenses., The SEC alleges that Vaccarelli defrauded clients of more than $1 million, and the agency is seeking an asset freeze against Vaccarelli, individually and doing business as Lux Financial Services, and his company, LWLVACC, LLC., The SECs complaint alleges that Vaccarelli violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 21F-17(a).

23928,2017,Former Registered Reps Settle Market Manipulation Charges in Attempted Nasdaq Listing,"[Three former registered representatives have agreed to settle SEC charges that they schemed to manipulate the stock of a microcap company in an attempt to get it listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange., The SEC alleges that Richard P. Cedrone, Steven R. Ferris, and George R. Thoreson coordinated manipulative trading activity including marking the close to enable a company called Abakan to meet specific requirements to list on Nasdaq, including the need for its share price to close at or above $2 for 90 consecutive trading days.  According to the SECs complaint, the men initially misunderstood the 90-day requirement to be 90 consecutive calendar days rather than trading days, and despite their manipulation efforts the company was ultimately unsuccessful at obtaining a Nasdaq listing., According to the SECs complaint, Cedrone and Ferris were investor relations consultants for Abakan and worked in concert with Thoreson to monitor Abakans bid-and-ask activity in real time.  Thoreson effected the vast majority of the trios trading in Abakan, ultimately amassing 629,675 shares in his personal accounts at a total cost of more than $1.3 million.  Thoreson made real-time admissions during the scheme, primarily via email to Ferris and Cedrone, saying he had just marked the close or engaged in other manipulative trading to keep Abakans share price above $2.  His admissions are corroborated by trading records., The SECs complaint further alleges that Ferris engaged in illegal unregistered public offerings of Abakan stock, using the proceeds to fund the companys operations and pay its bills., Without admitting or denying the SECs allegations, Cedrone, Ferris, and Thoreson consented to final judgments finding that they violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 9(a)(2) and 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5, that Ferris also violated Securities Act Section 5, and that Cedrone also violated Exchange Act Section 15(b)(6)(B)(i).  The settlements, which are subject to court approval, would prohibit them from placing orders to buy or sell securities during the last 60 minutes of any trading day.  Cedrone agreed to pay $5,013 in disgorgement plus $666.19 in interest and a $150,000 penalty.  The amount of the penalty assessed against Cedrone takes into account his violation of a <a href=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/34-41125.txt>prior Commission order</a>.

According to the SECs complaint, investors were falsely promised high returns from the price markups in ticket resales. But instead of purchasing tickets for resale, Carton and Meli allegedly misappropriated at least $3.6 million to repay earlier investors and cover such other expenses as Cartons gambling debts. Carton allegedly stole an additional $2 million by tricking a concert venue into forwarding an investors money into a bank account belonging to one of Cartons companies., According to the SECs complaint, one investor was provided documents falsely representing that large blocks of Adele tickets were being purchased at face value directly from Adeles management company when in fact no such agreement was in place.

According to the complaint, Van Den Heuvel told investors that he would use their funds to buy equipment, open a Green Box facility, and create a green solution for post-consumer waste.

Moses, raised approximately $1 million for a private fund they managed, WAKE Fund I, LP, by touting Mosess past experience as a trader or portfolio manager with large private fund advisers, the past investment performance obtained through his investment strategies, the safety of investors investments, and Mosess personal investment in the fund.  For example, the SEC alleges that Moses and MIC claimed that Moses was a Portfolio Manager in 2007 for a $750 million global macro fund, highlighted Moses twenty-four percent trading return achieved during the financial crisis in 2008, and repeatedly represented that the strategy Moses would employ in WAKE Fund was safe and involved limited downside risk.  The SEC alleges that, in reality, Moses had very limited fund portfolio management experience, lied about his investment returns, and employed a significantly risky investment strategy that he didnt disclose to investors, which resulted in the near-total loss of the funds assets., The SECs complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado, alleges that Moses and MIC violated Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.

The SECs complaint alleges that Aegerion told investors that the number of unfilled prescriptions for Juxtapid was not material and the vast majority of patients receiving prescriptions went ahead and ultimately purchased the drug.  The SEC alleges that Aegerions records reflect that it was actually around 50 percent of prescriptions that resulted in actual drug purchases., According to the SECs complaint, Juxtapid is used to treat a rare and potentially life-threatening genetic condition that causes extremely high cholesterol.  In 2013 and 2014, it was priced at approximately $250,000 to $300,000 annually per patient.  Following Juxtapids introduction in 2013, investors and investment analysts had little financial data to estimate Aegerions future revenues from sales of the drug., Aegerion allegedly provided details on the number of Juxtapid prescriptions during several subsequent earnings calls, but this data alone was insufficient for analysts and investors trying to forecast the companys future revenues because only prescriptions that were actually filled converted into sales.  According to the SECs complaint, it wasnt until October 2014 that Aegerion disclosed to investors that the conversion rate was actually in the range of 50 to 60 percent.  But Aegerion allegedly failed to reveal to investors even then that the conversion rate had hovered around 50 percent since 2013., The SECs complaint, filed in federal court in Boston, charges Aegerion with violating Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933.

He agreed to settle the charges and be barred from trading in penny stocks for the rest of his life., The SEC alleges that Jason Napodano, who headed a division called Zacks Small Cap Research within a larger investment research firm, misled investors in penny stocks by representing that he wasnt trading or holding positions in the companies he was writing about while secretly trading the same stocks based on nonpublic information about the publication date of his research.  In an effort to evade detection, Napodano allegedly limited his profits from each illegal trade by taking small positions and closing the positions shortly after his reports and articles were published., In addition to a permanent penny stock bar, Napodano agreed to pay full disgorgement of his insider trading profits totaling $143,865.48 plus prejudgment interest of $17,620.87 and a penalty of $143,865.48.  The settlement is subject to court approval., The SECs complaint also charges a pair of investment bankers who, along with Napodano, allegedly traded on nonpublic information that they and Napodano shared about certain smallcap issuers.  According to the SECs complaint, Bilal Basrai and Bryce Stirton worked at Chicago-based brokerage firm LBMZ Securities and together with Napodano breached the duties of trust and confidentiality owed to microcap issuers that retained Zacks Small Cap Research to provide sponsored research or LBMZ to act as a financial adviser., Basrai agreed to settle the charges by paying disgorgement of his insider trading profits of $39,668.37 plus prejudgment interest of $4,617.89 and a penalty of $39,668.37.

The offerings utilized the federal EB-5 program that provides a method for foreign investors to obtain visas by investing in projects that create or preserve at least 10 jobs for U.S. workers., But the SEC alleges that the Chens stole more than $12 million out of investor funds by issuing cashiers checks to Jean Chen, transferring the money to affiliated entities, and purchasing residential real estate completely unrelated to the two EB-5 projects.  The Chens allegedly misappropriated more than 91 percent of the money raised from investors in the interior design center project., The SECs complaint further alleges that the Chens and their companies provided investors a fake lease for the interior design center that changed the name of the real lessor to a Chen-controlled entity and overstated the true size of the leased space five-fold.  According to the complaint, investors then submitted it to the federal agency that administers the EB-5 program, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), as part of their applications.

The SEC alleges that Jayapalan tipped his wife, Rajni Nair, and his uncle and aunt, Kumar Ananda and Vijaya Ananda, about the pending acquisition.  Prior to the public announcement of SanDisks acquisition of Fusion-io, the SEC alleges that the Anandas bought large amounts of Fusion-io stock, ultimately spending $665,778 to purchase approximately 78,900 shares using eight different brokerage accounts, including approximately 1,000 shares purchased through an account Vijaya Ananda shared with Nair.  The SEC alleges that Kumar primarily financed these purchases with a combination of stock sales and margin loans, and did so at a time when his medical practice was in substantial decline, he owed nearly $100,000 in credit card debt, and after he had suffered what he described as a drastic reduction in his personal income between 2012 and 2014, as his salary dropped by approximately one-third.

IMMAs Form S-1 and its amendments allegedly falsely claimed that IMMAs chief executive officer, McDiarmids friend who had no corporate experience, ran the company, when in fact it was secretly run by McDiarmid and Telford.  The complaint also alleges that the S-1s also included lies that certain selling stockholders purchased their shares in IMMA through private placements, which were sham transactions.  The complaint also alleges that, after learning that the SEC had subpoenaed testimony from the sister of IMMAs CEO, who was one of the parties in the sham transactions, McDiarmid suggested a script for her testimony, which included false information about her relationship with Telford., The complaint further alleges that once the Form S-1 went effective, McDiarmid repeated these lies, along with others, to a market maker for IMMAs stock, who included them in its successful application to obtain clearance from FINRA to quote IMMAs stock, which was needed for the company to be publicly traded., According to the complaint, McDiarmid and Telford opened brokerage accounts in the names of nominees in order to sell their stock and, when they deposited IMMA shares into the accounts, they lied about how much stock they owned, how they obtained it, and the relationship of the nominees to them.  McDiarmid and Telford also prepared IMMAs periodic filings made with the SEC, which largely repeated the same lies in the Forms S-1.

23963,2017,SEC Halts Misappropriation of Investor Funds by Frack Master and his Entities,"[The Securities and Exchange Commission has obtained court-ordered emergency relief halting an ongoing fraud perpetrated by the self-proclaimed Frack Master and two others., The courts order, entered on September 25, 2017, by the Honorable Sidney A. Fitzwater of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, froze the assets of Christopher A. Faulkner, Breitling Energy Corporation (BECC), and Breitling Oil and Gas Corp. (BOG), appointed a temporary receiver over their assets, and preliminarily enjoined them from violating antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws., The SECs complaint, filed on June 24, 2016, charged 12 defendants and two relief defendants for their roles in an alleged $80 million securities-fraud scheme orchestrated by Faulkner.  The complaint alleged that, through his companies, Faulkner - while misrepresenting his education and experience - sold investors working-interest units in multiple oil-and-gas projects.  Faulkner allegedly oversold the available units for each project and inflated the estimated project costs.  According to the SECs complaint, Despite representing to investors that their investment proceeds would be segregated by project, Faulkner and his companies commingled and misappropriated investor money, spending tens of millions of dollars for Faulkners benefit, including lavish meals and entertainment, international travel, cars, jewelry, gentlemens clubs, and personal escorts.  In the alleged scheme, Faulkner signed untrue and misleading reports that BECC filed with the SEC.  Ultimately, the SEC alleges, investors in Faulkners companies received back only a fraction of the money they paid into the scheme., After filing the complaint, the SEC uncovered evidence that Faulkner, BECC, and BOG were continuing to victimize investors by misappropriating oil-and-gas production revenue owed to them.  Based on this evidence, the court imposed the asset freeze, receivership, and injunctive relief requested by the SEC.  In imposing these remedies, the court found that there is a reasonable likelihood that Faulkner, BECC, and BOG obtained money and property through false and misleading statements and omissions of material fact and engaged in a scheme to defraud investors, in violation of the securities laws.  The court stated that, [t]he SEC has demonstrated through its extensive filings that Faulkner has already obtained at least $23.8 million of investor proceeds through fraudulent cash disbursements and reimbursements.  Moreover, the fact that Faulkner continued to misappropriate investor assets even after the SEC filed this lawsuit gives the court little confidence that Faulkners asset management would improve without supervision, the court concluded., The SECs investigation has been conducted by Scott F. Mascianica and Ty Martinez and supervised by Jessica B. Magee and Eric Werner of the Fort Worth Regional Office.  B. David Fraser, Timothy S. McCole, and Mr. Mascianica are leading the SECs litigation., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/litreleases/2017/lr23963-memoradum-of-law.pdf>Memorandum of Law</a> and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2017/lr23963-order.pdf>Order</a>,  , <i>https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2017/lr23963.htm</i><br/>]"

Anderson and his company, The End of the Rainbow Partners, L.L.C. (Rainbow Partners), raised approximately $5.3 million from investors who were told that Anderson was a retired, successful hedge fund manager who intended to day trade their funds using a proprietary algorithm. Claiming he no longer needed income and instead wanted to help friends and charitable causes, Mr. Anderson falsely told investors that he would fund his wifes charitable organization for abused women and children, The End of the Rainbow Foundation, Inc. (Rainbow Foundation), with up to 20% of his trading profits, and divide the remaining profits among investors., According to the SECs complaint filed last week in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado, between March 2014 and February 2017 Rainbow Partners and Anderson misappropriated more than $2.3 million from investors by, among other things, transferring investor funds to Mr. Andersons wife, Carolyn Anderson, her purported charity, the Rainbow Foundation, a second company owned by Ms. Anderson, Seaoma Consulting Company (Seaoma), and another hedge fund managed by Mr. Anderson, Bighorn Wealth Fund, L.P.

23988,2017,Agency Obtains Court Order to Stop Ad Packs Ponzi Scheme,"[The Securities and Exchange Commission is warning investors to beware online paid-to-click scams that promise an easy payday by merely purchasing a membership or an advertising product up front and then clicking on a certain number of online ads each day., <a href=https://www.investor.gov/additional-resources/news-alerts/alerts-bulletins/investor-alert-beware-paid-click-ptc-scams>The SECs investor alert</a> explains that these online advertising programs may have little to no revenues besides membership fees or sales of ad packs and may be nothing more than a Ponzi scheme. The SEC filed an enforcement case that was unsealed last week in federal court in Florida, alleging that roughly 99 percent of the purported profits paid to earlier investors came directly from the buy-in fees collected from newer investors. Meanwhile, according to the SECs complaint, the alleged perpetrator siphoned several million dollars out of investor funds to purchase a luxury home, automobiles, and private plane charters while also using the money to fund his other businesses., According to the SECs investor alert, online advertising programs also can target those with something to advertise, promising to display a companys ads on their network or guaranteeing traffic to a website by simply paying a membership fee or buying ad packs., According to <a href=http://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2017/comp-pr2017-208.pdf>the SECs complaint</a> filed against Miami-based Pedro Fort Berbel and his company Fort Marketing Group, they operated fraudulent internet advertising businesses under such names as Fort Ad Pays, The Business Shop, and MLM Shop. They allegedly solicited investors through online posts and videos claiming they could share in the companies profits and earn investment returns as high as 120 percent by purchasing an ad pack for as little as a dollar and clicking on four banner ads per day. The SEC alleges that Berbel and Fort Marketing Group raised more than $38 million from at least 150,000 investors., The SECs complaint charges Berbel and Fort Marketing Group with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act. Theyre also charged with selling investments that are not registered with the SEC as required under the federal securities laws. The SEC encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people selling them investments. A quick search on the SECs investor.gov website shows that Berbel and Fort Marketing Group are not registered to sell investments., The SEC obtained a court-ordered asset freeze against Berbel and his companies., The SECs investigation was conducted by Sajjad Matin, Cecilia Danger, and Margaret Vizzi of the Miami Regional Office and supervised by Jessica Weissman. The SECs litigation will be led by Wilfredo Fernandez and Andrew Schiff. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Florida Office of Financial Regulation, Bureau of Financial Investigations.

Fuselier attempted to conceal defendant Integrated Freight Corporations poor financial condition by selling several of the companys heavily indebted and non-performing subsidiaries to a related third party for nominal consideration.

Allen, Susan Daub, and related entities Capital Financial Partners, LLC, Capital Financial Partners Enterprises, LLC, and Capital Financial Holdings, LLC, raised almost $32 million from investors who were promised profits from loans to professional athletes.  According to the complaint, defendants misled investors about the terms, circumstances, and even the existence of some of the loans.  Defendants allegedly used only a portion of the funds raised to make the promised loans and instead used investor funds to pay personal expenses, such as charges at casinos and nightclubs, to fund other business ventures, or to repay other investors.  The Commission obtained an asset freeze and other preliminary relief upon filing the complaint., Allen and Daub pled guilty to related criminal charges in November 2016.

The SEC also alleges that Town officials cooked the books of the Towns primary operating fund to falsely depict positive balances between $1.4 million and $4.2 million during a six-year period when the town had actually accumulated fund balance deficits as high as nearly $14 million.  Further because the stadium bonds issued by the RLDC were guaranteed by the town, certain officials also masked an operating revenue shortfall at the RLDC and failed to inform investors that the town would likely need to subsidize those bond payments and further deplete its general fund., The SEC continues its enforcement action against the remaining defendants:  Christopher St. Lawrence, Nachman Aaron Troodler, Michael Klein, and Nathan Oberman., For further information, see Litigation Release No. 23521.,  , <i>https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2017/lr23997.htm</i><br/>]"

They then encouraged investors to convert their promissory notes to common stock, provided forged leases to Digis independent auditor, and filed false financial statements with the Commission in an attempt to take the company public rather than pay off their outstanding debt to their investors., The SECs complaint charges MacCord, Doyle and Digi with violating the anti-fraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

24003,2017,Financial Adviser Settles Charges for Defrauding Private Equity Fund Investors,"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that former financial adviser James C. Tao has agreed to settle charges that he defrauded investors in Presidio Venture Capital, a private equity fund he created and managed, by making material misstatements in offering documents and misappropriating investor funds.  Tao and his former partner, Donna Boyd (f/k/a Donna Chen), also settled charges for violating broker-dealer registration requirements by soliciting sales of interests in the funds, which were securities not offered by the brokerage firm with which they were associated at the time., According to the SECs complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, while working as financial advisers associated with a registered investment adviser and broker-dealer, Tao and Boyd formed private equity fund PVC, LLC - which did business as Presidio Venture Capital - in 2013 primarily for the purpose of investing in technology start-ups in the Houston, Texas area.  The SECs complaint alleges that Tao and Boyd raised approximately $860,000 for the fund between January 2013 and July 2016 by soliciting investments from their advisory clients, some of whom were also brokerage clients, and from other personal and business contacts., The SECs complaint alleges that Tao falsely claimed investor funds would be held in escrow and returned unless $2.5 million was raised.  The complaint further alleges that while some of the money PVC raised was invested in arms-length transactions that fit the funds stated business model, Tao failed to timely or adequately disclose that the fund was also investing in companies he owned or in which he had a personal stake, which was a clear conflict of interest.  In addition, as alleged in the complaint, Tao used investor funds to apply for a loan to increase his interest in the fund, cover other expenses not in line with the use of funds disclosed in PVCs offering materials, and make a Ponzi-style payment by using new investor funds to buy out a disgruntled investor.  The complaint also alleges that Tao ignored fund redemption restrictions and bought out Boyd, who severed ties with the fund in 2013, and at least three other investors with cash from the sale of one of PVCs early investments., The SECs complaint charges Tao with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), (2) and (4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.

Berkey, of Centereach, New York, and Daniel T. Fischer, of Greenwich, Connecticut, conducted in-and-out trading that was almost certain to lose money for customers while yielding commissions for themselves.  According to the complaint, ten customers of Four Points Capital Partners LLC, where Berkey and Fischer previously worked, lost a total of $573,867, while Berkey and Fischer received approximately $106,000 and $175,000, respectively, in commissions., According to the SECs complaint, since the customers incurred significant costs with every transaction and the securities were held briefly, the price of the securities had to rise significantly for customers to realize even a minimal profit.

The complaint further alleges that Fischer engaged in unauthorized trading., The SECs complaint alleges that Berkey and Fischer violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

According to the complaint, Westport for several years purchased securities from underwriters at a discount to the public offering price and then, acting as a principal for its own account, re-sold those same securities to its advisory clients at higher prices without disclosing the mark-up.  Westport and McClure sometimes held the securities in client accounts for only a short period of time before re-selling the securities and then investing client funds in another offering with a mark-up.  The complaint further alleges that Westport and McClure defrauded a client by acting contrary to the clients express objectives and instead repeatedly investing the client in risky offerings that generated hidden mark-ups.

BRS and Davis allegedly covered their tracks using fake invoices in the names of two shell companies Davis controlled, the Blackstone Group, Inc. and Afcon Communications, Inc., purportedly for services they provided to BRS.  Davis also allegedly invented a fake company and used fictitious invoices in that companys name to cause BRS to send payments to an antiques broker for Daviss personal purchases.Â  The invoices listed a purported address for the company in Australia; however the address was for an Australian cemetery where an individual is buried with the name of the fake company., In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of Texas today unsealed criminal charges against Davis., The SECs complaint charges BRS and Davis with violating Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, BRS with violating Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Rule 10b-5 under the Exchange Act, and Davis with violating Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) under the Exchange Act and aiding and abetting BRS violations of Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Pauley of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York entered judgments on consent against Justin D. Meadlin and the firm he co-founded, Hyaline Capital Management, LLC (Hyaline).  In its complaint, the SEC alleged that Meadlin and Hyaline used false and misleading information to induce prospective investors and clients to invest money with them.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Meadlin and Hyaline consented to the entry of an Order enjoining them from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder, and, further, enjoining Hyaline from violating Advisers Act Rule 206(4)-1(a)(5) and Meadlin from aiding and abetting violations of Section 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-1(a)(5) thereunder.

Meadlin claimed the fund had as much as $25 million in assets, and he published consistently positive historical performance returns for it dating back to 2009 that were purportedly from a proprietary algorithm that he acquired.  According to the complaint, none of this was true: the fund did not exist, and never had, and Meadlin never acquired or created any proprietary algorithm.  Nor had they achieved the touted historical returns.

The SEC also alleges that Fox closed out the option positions after the acquisition was publicly announced, and the two defendants made $369,720 in illicit profits.  To further hide Browns role in the trading, Fox allegedly funneled Browns share of the trading profits by paying several of Browns personal expenses and by writing checks to Browns children and stepchildren.  Brown and his wife then endorsed those checks and used the funds., The SECs complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Arizona, charges Brown and Fox with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The SEC alleges that Fossum misappropriated hundreds of thousands of dollars of SMFG Fund assets by, among other things, living rent free in a home owned by an SMFG Fund and causing the SMFG Funds to pay other personal expenses, including for his extensive international travel and federal taxes.  According to the SECs complaint, Fossum also induced new investments in the Smart Money Secured Income Fund without disclosing its poor financial condition and repeatedly breached his fiduciary duties to the SMFG Funds by indiscriminately commingling fund assets to satisfy the funds liquidity needs., The complaint also alleges Fossum and a partner, Alonzo R. Cahoon, who both acted as investment advisers to the Turnkey Investment Fund, breached their fiduciary duties to the fund and misled investors by misrepresenting that they would receive only a one-time management fee of $2,990 per investment unit sold as compensation.  Instead, Fossum and Cahoon secretly pocketed $20,000 or more in compensation from each investment.  The SEC also alleges that both Fossum and Cahoon sold unregistered securities without a valid exemption from registration and acted as unregistered brokers in the Turnkey Investment Fund securities by soliciting prospective investors in the fund and earning transaction-based compensation as a result of sales made to investors., According to the SECs complaint, in June 2016, the SMFG Funds filed for bankruptcy and are currently being liquidated by a trustee., The SECs complaint alleges that Fossum violated Sections 5(a) and (c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers Act), along with additional alternative charges.

TBA has also agreed to be censured and to withdraw its registration with the SEC as an investment advisor., Separately, the SEC filed a complaint in federal court in Manhattan against one of the foundations trustees, attorney Robert Gaughran, and its accountant, Kevin Clune, alleging that they aided and abetted the fraud perpetrated by TBA and Rogicki, the foundations investment adviser, President, and a trustee., According to the SECs filings, between 2004 and 2016, Rogicki took advantage of his roles as investment adviser and trustee to the foundation by liquidating securities positions in the foundations advisory account with TBA and misappropriating a total of more than $9 million from the foundation for his own personal benefit.  The SECs complaint alleges that Gaughran and Clune aided and abetted TBAs and Rogickis fraudulent scheme.  While serving as a trustee of the foundation, Gaughran allegedly accepted outsized fees and ignored glaring signs of Rogickis theft that were apparent from the foundations brokerage statements and other documents that he regularly reviewed.  Gaughran also drafted the trust and estate papers that put Rogicki in charge of the charitable foundation and knew the size of the estate that should have flowed to the charitable foundation, but for Rogickis misappropriation of $9 million of its assets.  According to the SECs complaint, Clune, an accountant who performed tax work for both the estate that created the charitable foundation and the charitable foundation itself, ignored multiple and repeated red flags revealing Rogickis and TBAs fraudulent scheme.  In addition, both Gaughran and Clune were actively involved in concealing the theft by providing false information to an outside audit firm during a surprise examination of the charitable foundation that was conducted in 2014., On October 19, 2017, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action in federal district court against Rogicki.  In a parallel criminal action, Rogicki pleaded guilty to criminal charges brought against him by the Manhattan District Attorney on October 19, 2017.

The SEC also previously instituted administrative proceedings against former TBA CEO Brian J. Keenan on September 26, 2017, in connection with his misappropriation of assets from a separate client account.  The administrative proceedings against Keenan were settled on October 23, 2017., The SECs complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges Gaughran and Clune with aiding and abetting TBAs and Rogickis violations of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SECs complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and penalties against Gaughran and Clune., The SECs order instituting settled administrative proceedings against TBA finds that the adviser failed to detect and prevent two separate misappropriations by its former principals from client accounts for which TBAs former principals acted as trustee and over which TBA had custody.  TBA also failed to comply with the requirements of Rule 206(4)-2 under the Advisers Act by neglecting to obtain surprise examinations for several years for certain client accounts for which it had custody.  The SECs order also finds that TBA filed numerous Forms ADV containing false information.  Without admitting or denying the SECs findings, TBA consented to entry of a cease-and-desist order, a censure, and to pay disgorgement, interest, and a penalty of over $1.7 million.  TBA also agreed to file a Form ADV/W withdrawing its registration with the Commission at the completion of its wind-down., The SECs investigation was conducted by Katherine Bromberg, Jon Daniels, Neil Hendelman, Dugan Bliss, and Valerie A.
