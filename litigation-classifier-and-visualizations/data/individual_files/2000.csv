Gonzalo Silveira, Fernando Latorre, Joseph Domine, Gregory Jack, Timothy Madden, Ignacio Latorre, Jorge Clement and Diego Harte</i>, Civil Action No. 00-20029 (JW)(U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California) (San Jose Division), , The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that on January 7, 1999, it filed an insider trading action against eight individuals for illegal tipping and insider trading in the securities of Affymax, N.V., a drug discovery company located in Palo Alto, California, in advance of the January 26, 1995 announcement of a tender offer by the international pharmaceutical giant, Glaxo plc (now Glaxo Wellcome plc).  , The Commissions Complaint alleges that Gonzalo Silveira was the personal money manager for the CEO of Affymax prior to its acquisition by Glaxo.  Silveira misappropriated material, nonpublic information concerning the tender offer.  Although Silveira did not trade, he tipped his friend Fernando Latorre.  Fernando Latorre in turn tipped a co-worker, Timothy Madden, a friend, Joseph Domine, and a brother, Ignacio Latorre.  Madden and Domine realized profits of $24,000 and $9,692, respectively, by trading on the inside information.  Domine also tipped his friend Gregory Jack, who realized $13,807 in illegal trading profits.  Ignacio Latorre tipped two co-workers, Jorge Clement and Diego Harte.  Profits generated by Clements and Hartes improper trading amounted to at least $150,000., Defendants Silveira, age 42, Domine, age 31, Madden, age 31, and Jack, age 31, live in California; defendants Fernando Latorre, age 37, Ignacio Latorre, age 31, Clement, age 28, and Harte, age 34, live in Argentina.  All four domestic defendants agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint. Silveira, Domine, Madden and Jack consented to the entry of Final Judgments and Undertakings permanently enjoining them from violating anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws which prohibit insider trading (Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder).  Those defendants also consented to appear as witnesses at depositions and trial.  Silveira consented to pay a $200,000 penalty, Madden consented to disgorge his illegal profits, and Domine and Jack consented to disgorge their illegal profits plus prejudgment interest.  Total monetary settlements amount to approximately $250,000.  The four foreign defendants have not settled, and the Commissions litigation against them continues., This action concludes the Commissions investigation of trading in Affymax securities.

Milan Capital Group, Inc., Ira A. Monas and Rita A. Monas</i>, 00 Civ. 108 (DC) (S.D.N.Y.) (January 7, 2000), , Today, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced that the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a Temporary Restraining Order prohibiting a Melville, New York company, Milan Capital Group, Inc., from offering or selling securities while failing to be registered with the Commission as a broker-dealer.  The emergency federal court action also freezes more than $3.7 million held by Milan and provides other emergency relief.  In addition to Milan, the action names as relief defendants Milans president, Ira A. Monas  who is currently incarcerated in an upstate New York prison for grand larceny  and Milans secretary, Rita A. Monas. , The Commissions complaint alleges the following:  Since October 1999, Milan has offered and purportedly sold securities in several highly-publicized initial public offerings (IPOs) to dozens of investors in several states.  Milan has received funds from these investors based on representations that Milan would use the funds to purchase shares in IPOs.  Milan lacked access to, and failed to obtain, any IPO shares for these investors.  In addition, Milan commingled investors funds in its own bank account, using the funds to pay Milans operational expenses and disbursing funds to persons and entities other than the investors.  Milan is not, and has never been, registered with the Commission as a broker-dealer and, therefore, is prohibited by federal law from selling, offering to sell, or inducing the sale of securities.  By engaging in the above conduct, Milan violated the broker-dealer registration requirements of Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934., As relief, the Commission seeks (1) a permanent injunction against future violations of the broker-dealer registration provisions of the Exchange Act; (2) disgorgement of all proceeds Milan received from its activities as an unregistered broker-dealer, plus prejudgment interest; (3) a verified accounting of Milans receipt and disbursement of investor funds; and (4) the imposition of civil money penalties., The Commission is continuing its investigation in this matter., <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr16405.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Martineau, a former stock broker residing in Tewksbury, Massachusetts, charging Martineau with fraudulently inducing nine of his brokerage customers to invest at least $9.2 million in fraudulent investment schemes.  The United States Attorneys Office for the District of Massachusetts also today announced the filing of related criminal charges against Martineau. , Specifically, the Commission alleged that, during the period November 1989 through August 1998, Martineau induced several customers to purchase promissory notes by falsely claiming that the proceeds would be used to make secured loans.  He also fraudulently induced customers to sell their existing securities based on false promises that the proceeds would be invested in commercial paper.  The Commission further alleges that, in fact, Martineau used customer funds to finance his own unsuccessful options trading, for other personal uses and to make occasional ponzi-like payments to the investors.  , The Complaint alleges that Martineaus conduct violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Martineau has agreed, without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, to the entry of a permanent injunction.  No civil monetary penalties were imposed based on sworn financial statements demonstrating a financial inability to pay.  Additionally, Martineau has agreed to the entry of an administrative bar from associating with any broker or dealer.  , Also today, the United States Attorneys Office for the District of Massachusetts announced that an information has been filed against Martineau containing criminal wire and mail fraud charges based upon essentially the same conduct alleged in the Commissions complaint.

Berger, Manhattan Investment Fund Ltd., and Manhattan Capital Management, Inc.</i>, (Civ. Action No. 00 Civ. 0333 (DLC), Southern District of New York, January 18, 1999), The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that yesterday, January 18, 2000, it filed an emergency enforcement action charging Michael W. Berger, a hedge fund adviser, with securities fraud.  Also charged were Manhattan Investment Fund Ltd., a hedge fund organized and managed by Berger, and Manhattan Capital Management Inc., an investment adviser owned by Berger.  Berger is an Austrian citizen who lives in New York City, where Manhattan Capital is located.  Manhattan Investment Fund is a British Virgin Islands corporation.  The fund has approximately 280 investors., Also yesterday, the Honorable Denise L. Cote, United States District Judge entered an order freezing the assets of Manhattan Investment Fund and Manhattan Capital Management.  The Judges order also included a temporary restraining order barring further violations against Manhattan Investment Fund and  preliminary injunctions against Berger and Manhattan Capital Management.  Currently pending before the judge is the Commissions request for appointment of a receiver for Manhattan Investment Fund Ltd. and for Manhattan Capital Management.  Berger and Manhattan Capital consented to the relief imposed., The Commission charged that beginning in September 1996, Manhattan Investment Fund began to sustain market losses that ultimately totaled more than $300 million.  At the same time the fund was sustaining these huge losses, Berger was reporting to investors that the fund had  returns of between 12 and 27 percent annually.  By August 1999, Berger told investors that Manhattan Investment Fund had a net market value of more than $426 million in assets.  In fact, the fund was never that large, and by August, its net value had been  reduced to less than $28 million., The Complaint alleges the following: Berger organized Manhattan Investment Fund in April 1996.  Since then, he has raised more than $350 million from investors.  Bergers investment strategy for the fund was based on the proposition that the stock market generally, and stocks of Internet-related companies particularly, were overvalued, and that there would be a market correction in which the prices of many Internet-related stocks would decline sharply.  Berger sold these securities short, in order to profit from the anticipated decline.  However, because the prices of most internet-related stocks have instead increased dramatically, the Manhattan Investment Fund has consistently suffered losses.  Those losses now total in excess of $300 million.,  To hide the funds losses from investors, beginning in September 1996, Berger created phony account statements that materially overstated the performance and value of Manhattan Investment Fund.  The information contained in the false account statements was provided to  investors in the fund, and was shared with potential investors.  The false account statements  were provided to the funds administrator, and to the funds auditors.  Earlier this month, both the administrator and the auditors resigned., The complaint charges Berger, Manhattan Investment Fund and Manhattan Capital with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Berger and Manhattan Capital are also charged with violations of Section 206(1) and (2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940., In addition to the relief already ordered by the Court, the Commission seeks the following relief: (i) permanent injunctions barring future violations;(ii) disgorgement and prejudgment interest; and (iii) civil penalties., The Commissions investigation into these matters is continuing., <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr16412.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

(February 2, 2000)</b>, On February 2, 2000, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a settled insider trading case in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against Arthur Tab Williams, Jr., a former director of Southern National Corporation (SNC), a North Carolina bank holding company which has since changed its name to Branch Banking and Trust Company.  The complaint alleges that the defendant, while a director of SNC, purchased shares of Fidelity Financial Bankshares Corporation (Fidelity) based upon material, nonpublic information about a proposed merger between SNC and Fidelity and improperly benefited in the amount of $160,196., The Complaint alleges that on June 25, 1996, Williams attended a SNC board of directors meeting during which SNCs chairman informed the board that SNC was in negotiations with Fidelity concerning a business combination.  According to the Complaint, SNCs chairman described Fidelity as a $35 million thrift in Richmond, Virginia with a huge equity base.  SNCs chairman also informed the board that Fidelitys management expressed interest in SNCs proposal, and that SNC would continue to discuss a potential merger transaction with Fidelity.  In addition, the Complaint alleges that SNCs chairman told the board members, including Williams, that if Fidelitys management expressed serious interest in the proposed business combination, SNC would make an offer to acquire Fidelity at a premium., According to the Complaint, after the board meeting, Williams returned to his office, called his stock broker, and instructed him to buy as much Fidelity stock as was possible using the available funds in his brokerage account.  While still on the phone, the Complaint alleges, the broker calculated that Williams could buy 15,000 shares at the current market price.  Williams directed him to execute the order.  The next day, June 26, 1996, the broker purchased 15,000 shares of Fidelity common stock for Williams at $14 per share, at a total cost of $210,004.  On August 22, 1996, SNC issued a press release publicly announcing that the boards of both companies had agreed that SNC would purchase all outstanding shares of Fidelity common stock in a stock exchange deal valued at $59.4 million.  The announcement caused Fidelitys stock price to increase by $6.75, from $15.875 to $22.625, or 42.52 percent., The Complaint alleges that in March 1997, when SNC completed the acquisition of Fidelity, Williams exchanged his Fidelity shares for SNC shares and, as a result of the exchange, benefited in the amount of $160,196., Simultaneously with the filing of the Complaint, Williams consented, without admitting or denying the allegations of the Complaint, to a permanent injunction enjoining him from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and ordering him to pay a total of $373,295.53, comprised of $160,196 in disgorgement, $52,903.53 of prejudgment interest thereon, and an Insider Trading Sanctions Act penalty of $160,196., ]"

These trading programs supposedly enabled investors to obtain phenomenal returns, at no risk to principal, by participating in purported trading in high yield debentures between and among banks.  The Complaint alleges that the defendants did not engage in any trading, but instead used the money they procured from investors to pay for their lifestyles and personal expenses.  According to the Complaint, thousands of United States residents entrusted the defendants with investments of at least $1,500 each, and the enterprise took in over $12 million., The Complaint alleges that Walker, TACs original owner, developed the fraudulent IBC trading program that TAC sold to investors.  Under the IBC program, investors paid a minimum of $1,500 each to get access to purported debenture trading between and among banks.  The Complaint alleges that TAC represented that at the end of one year, the IBC trading program could generate as much as $20,000 from the original $1,500 investment -- an annual return of over 1,300%.  According to the Complaint, Southwood, TACs present owner, supervised TACs operations at its headquarters in the Bahamas and created a second fraudulent investment scheme which he named the Southwood Program.

Mobley, age 43, is a resident of Naples, Florida., The Commissions complaint charges the following:  Mobley falsely claimed that his funds averaged a return of 51 percent per year, net of his management fees of 30 percent; in reality, he lost an estimated $59 million of the more than $140 million given him to invest between 1993 and the present.   Each month, Mobley sent investors monthly account statements that grossly overstated their account balance and rate of return.  He failed to disclose to his investors that he had invested their money in a number of his own business ventures-including a mortgage company, a golf and country club development, a research and polling company, a cigar lounge, and a plan to build a stadium on a golf course-most of which failed, or that he had given $3.5 million of their money to various charities.

for Internet Price Manipulation Scheme</h3>, <h3>Additional Materials Available on This Topic</h3>]","[SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, Litigation Release No.  16461  /  March 2, 2000, <i>Securities and Exchange Commission v. Douglas W. Colt,</i> 1:00CV00423 (D.C.D.C.) (EGS) (filed March 2, 2000), , On March 2, 2000, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, alleging that Douglas Colt, a Washington, D.C. area law student, created the Fast-Trades.com website which he used to manipulate the price of four stocks during February and March 1999.  According to the complaint, through a scheme centered on recommending stocks on his website, Colt drove up the short-term price for each stock by as much as 700%.  By trading in advance of his stock recommendations, Colt generated over $345,000 in total profits for himself, his mother Joanne Colt, three of his law school classmates, and two of his friends.  At times, their profits exceeded 500% within an hour of the recommendation.  Within a few hours after the recommendations were disseminated to Fast-Trades subscribers, the stock price decreased significantly from its intraday high., The Complaint alleges that Colt targeted low priced, thinly traded stocks knowing that his trades and subscriber activity would artificially increase the price of the stocks selected.  For each of the four stocks selected, Colt and the other participants in the scheme collectively purchased a significant volume of the selected stock  in three cases more than 150% of the total average daily volume.  For all four stock selections, Fast-Trades purchases were made shortly before the website disseminated its recommendations to its subscribers.  , The Complaint further alleges that after making these purchases and before the recommendations to purchase the stock were e-mailed to the subscribers, Colt and the other participants entered sell limit orders or had orders entered on their behalf.  Colt expected that unwitting subscribers would buy the recommended stock.  Colt further expected that the purchases would drive the price higher still, triggering the sell limit orders.  This is precisely what happened.    , According to the Complaint, subscriber purchases were essential to the scheme.  Thus, the participants needed to maintain and expand Fast-Trades subscriber rolls.  To attract new subscribers, Colt and his three law school classmates  Kenneth Terrell, Jason Wyckoff and Adam Altman  promoted the website by collectively posting hundreds of false messages to various internet message boards.  These messages disguised the authors connection with the site and misrepresented the investment success they achieved from following Fast-Trades recommendations.  Partly through these postings, the subscriber base grew to more than 9,000 people over a two month period.    , In addition, the Complaint alleges that Colt posted a false track record on the Fast-Trades website touting the performance of several stocks he falsely claimed were Fast-Trades selections, and that the website contained a misleading disclaimer crafted by Colt, Terrell, Wyckoff and Altman that misrepresented their trading intentions to their subscribers.  The disclaimer stated that Colt and the Fast-Trades representatives  may trade Fast-Trades selections at any time.  In fact, for each of the four stocks, Colt had already purchased the selected stock <i>and</i> entered sell limit orders before Fast-Trades even distributed the selection to its subscribers.    , The Commissions Complaint seeks to permanently restrain and enjoin Colt from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and seeks civil monetary penalties.  The Complaint also seeks disgorgement of all illicit profits from the manipulative scheme alleged in the Complaint, with prejudgment interest.  , Simultaneous with the filing of the Complaint, Colt consented, without admitting or denying the allegations of the Complaint, to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from his violative conduct.  Based on his demonstrated financial inability to pay, the Commission waived payment of disgorgement and prejudgment interest and did not seek the imposition of a civil monetary penalty.  Also simultaneous with the filing of the Complaint, the Commission entered an administrative order related to the conduct described in the Complaint.  Without admitting or denying the Commissions findings, Kenneth Terrell, Jason Wyckoff, Adam Altman and Joanne Colt consented to an Order directing them to cease and desist from committing or causing any violation and any future violation of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering Terrell, Wyckoff and Joanne Colt to pay disgorgement of all illicit profits with prejudgment interest.  <i>See In the Matter of Kenneth Terrell, Jason Wyckoff, Adam Altman and Joanne Colt</i>, Securities Exchange Act Release No. 42483 (March 2, 2000).

Former CEO Donald McGhan </h3>]","[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission<i>SEC v. Donald K. McGhan</i>, Civ. Action No. 00CV00475 , Litigation Release No.  16466 / March 8, 2000<br/>, The Securities and Exchange Commission filed today a settled civil injunctive action against Donald K. McGhan, Inamed Corporations former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.  The complaint alleges that in 1996 and 1997, Inamed Corporation, a publicly owned breast implant manufacturer, made materially false and misleading statements and omissions in its financial statements and periodic reports filed with the Commission and in press releases distributed to the investing public.  As Inameds former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, McGhan was responsible for the companys public financial disclosures and either knew or was reckless in not knowing of the companys materially false and misleading statements and omissions during this period.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, McGhan consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the antifraud, record-keeping and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws [Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1, thereunder], and ordering him to pay a $50,000 civil penalty., The complaint alleges that Inamed failed to record a $1.4 million interest expense relating to a waiver of an indenture default and thus materially overstated income and shareholder equity for the quarter ended June 30, 1996.  McGhan signed the Form 10-Q and knew or was reckless in not knowing that it contained false and misleading financial statements.  For the quarter ended September 30, 1996, the complaint alleges that McGhan knowingly or recklessly caused Inamed to improperly reduce the allowance for product returns by nearly $1.9 million from the prior quarter, which resulted in material overstatements in Inameds pre-tax income and shareholder equity., The complaint also alleges that between May and September 1997, McGhan was unable to resolve Inameds several outstanding issues with its auditors.  On September 9, 1997, over five months after the required filing date, McGhan reviewed and authorized Inameds filing of its Annual Report on Form 10-K with unaudited financial statements.  Where the auditors report should have been located in the Form 10-K, Inamed simply inserted the notation To Come.  McGhan caused Inamed to make the filing without informing its auditors, whose work on the audit continued, and without a chief financial officer to review the financial statements.  Inamed again understated its allowance for product returns and incorrectly recorded a deferred tax asset of $2,022,382.  Moreover, Inamed failed properly to account for its intercompany transfers of inventory and the concomitant elimination of intercompany profit, resulting in approximately a $1.2 million overstatement of inventories and gross profit.  The cumulative effect of these misstatements was that Inamed reported a net loss of $7,071,660, or $0.91 per share, when it should have reported a net loss of at least $11,379,000, or $1.46 per share, a 60% understatement.  Thus, had Inamed correctly reported its losses, the companys losses on a per share basis would have increased substantially from the prior year, rather than remaining the same.  The complaint alleges that McGhan knew or was reckless in not knowing that Inameds unaudited financial statements in its 1996 Form 10-K were false and misleading.  Inamed also failed to disclose a related party transaction between the company and an entity controlled by McGhan.  , The complaint also alleges that in connection with a default of a covenant relating to approximately $6 million of convertible debentures issued in January 1997, Inamed, at the direction of McGhan, failed to disclose either the default or the additional costs associated with the default in its quarterly reports for the periods ended March 31, June 30 and September 30, 1997.  As a result Inamed failed to report interest expense of $192,067 for the period ended March 31, 1997, $736,000 for the six months ended June 30, 1997 and $1.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 1997.  The default costs alone caused Inameds income to be materially overstated in each of its 1997 Form 10-Qs., In a related cease-and-desist proceeding, In the Matter of  Inamed Corporation (<a href=../admin/34-41751.htm>Admin. Proc. No. 3-9976</a>, August 17, 1999), the Commission entered a settled order against Inamed Corporation ordering it to cease-and-desist from violations from Sections 10(b), 13(B)(2)(A) and 13(B)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder., <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr16466.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Todt, et al.</i>, 98 Civ. 3980 (JGK) (SDNY) , , On February 24, 2000, the Honorable John G. Koeltl of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York granted the Commissions motion for summary judgment against Daniel T. Todt and Rebecca L. Todt in an action involving the offer and attempt to sell forged and fictitious securities.  The Court entered final judgments against Daniel and Rebecca Todt on February 28, 2000, enjoining them from their violative conduct and ordering them to pay civil penalties of $200,000 and $100,000, respectively.  On March 7, 2000, the Court denied a motion by the Todts to alter or amend the final judgments.   , The Court found in its February 24 Opinion and Order that the Todts, husband and wife attorneys, attempted to obtain money on four occasions by using a fraudulent bank certificate purportedly issued by the Mitsubishi B.J. Bank, with a face value equivalent to nearly six billion dollars.  The Court found that these attempts to obtain money using the Mitsubishi certificate violated the antifraud provisions of both the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 despite the fact that the attempts were unsuccessful.   , The Court found that the Todts made repeated attempts to obtain funds using the Mitsubishi certificate even though they both knew it was a forgery, and persisted in their efforts to dispose of the Certificate for value even after entry of a preliminary injunction against them.  The Court found ample evidence of motive and opportunity to defraud and a strong basis for concluding that the Todts, unless enjoined from doing so, will again violate federal securities laws.  , The final judgments permanently enjoin Daniel and Rebecca Todt from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act.  The final judgments also impose the civil penalties noted above.  , The Todts were the only remaining defendants in this matter.

Conner, Deon Benson, Gordon K. Allen, Jr., Jon Geibel, and William H. Borders II, 00 Civ. 1963 (VM) (Southern District of New York), The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that it filed insider trading charges today against 19 defendants who, from 1997 through January 2000, engaged in a widespread insider trading scheme that produced over $8 million in illegal profits from trading in the securities of 23 public companies.  The source of the inside information was a part-time word processor who was assigned by the temporary agency where he worked to two Wall Street investment banking firms, Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. Inc., and Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation.  Also among the defendants are four principals or employees of broker dealers who traded on the inside information for their own accounts and/or the accounts of their clients.  The case was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York., The Complaint charges that the source of the information was defendant John Freeman, 34, of Brooklyn, New York.  From approximately October 1996 to January 2000, Freeman was employed as a graphic artist at Philip Morris Companies, Inc.  At the same time, Freeman also worked evenings at an agency that provides temporary word processing services.  From May 1997 to June 1998, Freeman was assigned by the agency to work at Goldman Sachs.  From October 1998 to January 2000, Freeman was assigned to work at CS First Boston.  As a temporary employee at the two firms, Freeman was able to gain access to material nonpublic information regarding numerous merger and acquisition transactions.  Freeman is charged with misappropriating confidential information concerning at least 23 different transactions, and tipping directly at least ten others about the transactions.  Some of those tipped by Freeman then tipped others about the transactions., The Commission alleges that, based on information provided by Freeman, each of the defendants purchased the common stock and/or options of some or all of the following public companies: Oregon Metallurgical Corp., Lukens, Inc., Sano Corp., USF&amp;G Corp., Regal Cinemas, Inc., Illinois Central Railroad Co., Coherent Communications Systems Corp., Baker Hughes, Inc., CIENA Corp., DSC Communications Corp., Camco International, Inc., Getchell Gold Corp., United States Satellite Broadcasting Co., SmarTalk Teleservices, Inc., Fingerhut Co., Mercantile Bancorporation, Inc., Wang Laboratories, Cogeneration Corp. of America, RailTex Inc., Medco Research, Inc., Splitrock Services, Inc., Cameron Ashley Building Products, Inc., and Jason, Inc.  At the time that Freeman tipped the other defendants about these companies, each of the companies was involved in a significant transaction that involved the merger or sale of the company., The Complaint alleges that Freeman was compensated by those that he tipped in a variety of ways.  In return for the information, many of the defendants agreed to pay Freeman for his tips.  Their payments took many forms.  In some instances, cash was enclosed in unsigned birthday cards sent to Freeman in envelopes bearing no return addresses.  In other instances, checks were sent to third parties who cashed them and funneled the money to Freeman.  One defendant disguised his payment as a loan to a friend of Freeman, who then repaid the loan to Freeman.  Another defendant paid Freeman in cases of wine., The Complaint includes the following allegations about Freeman and the other defendants:, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , 	Each of the defendants is charged with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.

Certain Unknown Purchasers of Common Stock of Financial  Security Assurance Holdings Ltd, No. 00-Civ-2029 (S.D.N.Y.)(March 16, 2000), , The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on March 16, 2000 the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a Temporary Restraining Order freezing the accounts of certain unknown purchasers of the common stock of Financial Security Assurance Holdings Ltd. (FSA), prohibiting the unknown persons from taking delivery of the stock or possession of the proceeds from the sale of the stock.  The Commission alleges that the unknown purchasers engaged in illegal insider trading just before the announcement on March 14, 2000 that Dexia, a municipal lending corporation based in Brussels, Belgium, intended to acquire FSA in a friendly merger.  FSA is a New York corporation that provides financial guaranty insurance on asset-backed and municipal obligations.  The securities of FSA trade on the NYSE.   , The Commission alleges that, within a 2 1/2 hour period beginning in the morning of March 9, 2000, a bank in Luxembourg operating as two banking entities, Banque Privee Edmond de Rothschild (Banque Privee) and Banque de Gestion Edmond de Rothschild (Banque Gestion), as well as three Israeli banks, Bank Leumi, Bank Hapoalim, and Israel Discount Bank, purchased approximately 53,500 shares of FSA common stock.  According to the Commission, the five foreign banking entities placed their trades on behalf of persons or entities presently unknown, using six U.S. broker-dealers. Moreover, according to the Commission, at least two of the foreign banks, Banque Gestion and Bank Hapoalim, placed limit orders before the market opened on March 9 for the  purchase of FSA stock at prices significantly higher than the previous days closing price., The Commissions complaint and its application for an emergency temporary restraining order state that shortly after noon on March 9, 2000, an extraordinary increase in purchases of the thinly traded stock of FSA caused the NYSE to halt FSAs trading, citing an order imbalance.  The NYSE thereafter extended the trading halt pending the release of news about FSA.  Later that afternoon, FSA publicly announced that it had been in discussions with an unnamed third party concerning the possible sale of FSA.  When trading in FSA resumed later on March 9, the stock re-opened at $59 1/2, a substantial increase from the $55 price at which FSA had traded before trading was halted.  , Three days later, on March 14, 2000, FSA and Dexia formally announced that they had signed a definitive agreement providing for Dexia to acquire FSA for $76 in cash, a deal valued at approximately $2.6 billion.  According to the Commission, sell orders have been placed with respect to some of the 53,500 shares that the five foreign banks purchased on March 9, and some of the trades are due to settle on Friday, March 17.  Significantly, according to the Commission, Banque Privee placed a limit order early on March 14, before the opening of trading and before the public announcement, to sell FSA at $69 per share, a price significantly higher than the previous days closing price of $57 11/16.  The Commissions filing states that the proceeds from the pending orders to sell FSA stock total about $1 million.    , In the pending lawsuit, the Commission alleges that the unknown defendants engaged in illegal insider trading in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5.  The complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, the disgorgement of all illegal profits, and the imposition of civil monetary penalties.  The Courts Temporary Restraining Order prohibits the removal of the FSA common stock, or the proceeds from the sales of the FSA common stock, from the U.S. brokerage accounts in which the securities or funds currently reside., The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the NYSE in this matter.]"

Rudnick (Rudnick), operator of an Internet website that provided real-time daytrading stock recommendations on a subscription basis, and Rudnicks company, DynamicDaytrader.com LLC (DynamicDaytrader).  The staff alleged that Rudnick, a resident of Cumberland Foreside, Maine, and DynamicDaytrader violated the general and investment adviser antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws by posting false and misleading statements on the website.  Rudnick and DynamicDaytrader have agreed, without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, to the entry of a permanent injunction, disgorgement of all ill-gotten gains, plus prejudgment interest, and to the imposition of a civil penalty against DynamicDaytrader.             , The Commissions complaint alleges that, during the period from January 1998 to February 2000, Rudnick and DynamicDaytrader operated an Internet website that provided, on a subscription basis, daytrading recommendations.  The main feature of the DynamicDaytrader website was a link to a  real-time window referred to as the Trading Floor.  Rudnick induced  subscribers to trade securities by falsely stating that, through the Trading Floor, they would be able to see the real-time actual trades of a successful daytrader and thus be able to profit or approximate the performance of the trader by merely mimicking his trades.  The complaint alleges that the trading recommendations posted on the Trading Floor were not real, but hypothetical, and the prices posted for those trades were not attainable by either Rudnick or his subscribers, thus making the claimed profits unattainable., The complaint further alleges that  Rudnick also falsely claimed that the head traders recommendations had generated high returns, including a claimed return of more than 747% for calendar year 1999.  According to the complaint, the stock prices that Rudnick used in making these performance claims generally were more favorable than those actually available in the marketplace.  Rudnick also made false statements about his personal daytrading experience and the DynamicDaytrader organization.  According to the Commissions complaint, the DynamicDaytrader website had generated subscription revenues of $40,107 from approximately 315 subscribers in at least 38 states and thirteen countries before suspending operations in February, 2000.  By virtue of his conduct Rudnick was an investment adviser.   , The complaint alleges that Rudnicks conduct violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  On a neither admit nor deny basis, Rudnick has consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of those provisions, holding Rudnick and DynamicDaytrader jointly and severally liable for disgorgement in the amount of $40,107, plus prejudgment interest, and imposing a civil monetary penalty against DynamicDaytrader in the amount of $15,000., <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr16475.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Furman, age 37, of Cooper City, Florida, and Stephen M. Hieber, age 34, of Danbury, Connecticut. Under the settlement, Furman, the former chief accounting officer of Micro Warehouse, Inc., consented to a permanent injunction against violating the securities laws, a bar from acting as an officer or director of a public company, and a bar from appearing as an accountant before the SEC. Hieber, a former senior accounting manager, consented to a permanent injunction against violating the securities laws, and payment of a penalty of $20,000. Micro Warehouse is a catalog seller of personal computers and related software and accessories, headquartered in Norwalk, Connecticut., According to the complaint, which was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut, Furman and Hieber created the illusion that each quarter the company´s financial results met or exceeded projections and analysts´ expectations. While the fraudulent scheme lasted, from January 1994 to June 1996, Furman and Hieber caused Micro Warehouse to over-state the profits that it reported to the public by $45 million. Furman and Hieber falsified the company´s books and records, primarily those relating to expenses and liabilities for accounts payable, and misled Micro Warehouse´s auditors and senior officers regarding the falsified books and records. As a result of the scheme, Micro Warehouse made at least thirteen false filings with the SEC on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and S-3, each of which materially misstated the company´s results of operations and financial condition. In 1994 Micro Warehouse over-stated income from operations by $12.2 million, or approximately 27 percent. In 1995 Micro Warehouse over-stated income from operations by $21.5 million, or approximately 29 percent. For the six months ended June 30, 1996, Micro Warehouse over-stated income from operations by $11.5 million, or approximately 100 percent., Under the settlements, which must be approved by the Court, Furman and Hieber each consent, without admitting or denying the complaint´s allegations, to final judgments which restrain and enjoin them from violating or aiding and abetting violations of the anti-fraud, reporting, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws [Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b), 13(b)(2) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, 13b2-1 and/or 13b2-2 promulgated thereunder.] Furman also consented to a bar from acting as an officer or director of a public company. No civil penalty was imposed against Furman based upon his demonstrated financial inability to pay. Hieber also consented to payment of a civil monetary penalty of $20,000., As part of his settlement, Furman also consented to a Commission Order which denies him the privilege of practicing before the Commission as an accountant. Pending approval of the settled injunctive action by the Court, the Commission will institute an administrative proceeding against Furman pursuant to the Commissions Rule of Practice 102(e). Furman is a certified public accountant licensed to practice in New York, and Furman will neither admit nor deny the findings in the Commissions Order., Micro Warehouse previously consented to the issuance of a Commission Order requiring that it cease and desist from committing or causing any violation and any future violations of the anti-fraud, reporting, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws.

The defendants further agreed to pay a civil penalty of $305,000, to disgorge $15,000 in subscription fees, and to pay $5,000 in prejudgment interest., The Complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado, alleges that the defendants mailed the Arrowhead Newsletter to as many as 60,000 investors a month.  The newsletter touted the stocks of a total of 50 small-cap issuers who paid consideration in stock and cash for this service.  Each of the 11 newsletters failed to disclose, or disclosed inadequately, that the Halls had received consideration in exchange for promoting the featured securities, under Section 17(b) of the Securities Act of 1933.  Further, the complaint alleges that the Halls violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by representing the Arrowhead Newsletter as an objective research report drafted by qualified analysts, when, in fact, the newsletter was simply a paid tout sheet., ]"

Rauscher Pierce Refsnes, Inc., Dain Rauscher Incorporated and James Feltham</i>, CIV98-0027 PHX ROS (D. Ariz.), <i>In The Matter Of Rauscher Pierce Refsnes, Inc., Dain Rauscher Incorporated and James R. Feltham</i>, Administrative Proceeding File No. 3-10182, The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that Dain Rauscher Incorporated (Dain Rauscher) has agreed to pay nearly $13 million in disgorgement, a civil penalty of $100,000, and to consent to the entry of a cease and desist order to settle charges arising out of the Commissions investigation into the practice in municipal bond transactions known as yield burning.  In addition, James R. Feltham (Feltham) has consented to the entry of cease and desist order to settle charges arising out of the same investigation., The Commission found that Dain Rauscher breached its fiduciary duties to its financial advisory client, the State of Arizona Department of Administration (DOA), in connection with DOAs issuance of the $129,640,000 of Series 1992B Refunding Certificates of Participation (the 1992B COPS).  As part of the 1992B COPs offering, Rauscher charged DOA an excessive undisclosed markup on the sale of certain United States Treasury securities to the DOA.  Rauscher breached its fiduciary duties to DOA by failing to inform its client, among other things, that it was taking a $707,037 profit on the sale of the escrow securities.  In addition, Rauscher issued a tax certification, which Feltham signed, in connection with the sale of the escrow securities which falsely stated that Rauschers sale prices for the escrow securities equaled their fair market value and that Rauschers sale of the securities was an arms length transaction without regard to any amount paid to reduce the yield on the securities.  In an earlier action, the Commission had filed suit against Rauscher, Dain Rauscher and Feltham in Federal Court in Arizona.  See SEC v. Rauscher Pierce Refsnes, Inc., Dain Rauscher Incorporated and James Feltham, CIV98-0027 PHX ROS (D. Ariz.).  In connection with the settlement, the Commission will request that the court dismiss the court proceedings against Dain Rauscher and Feltham., In addition to the 1992B COPS transaction, the Commission found that Dain Rauscher sold portfolios of U.S. Treasury securities for defeasance escrows at excessive, undisclosed markups to a number of other municipal bond issuers in connection with advance refundings.  At the time, as compared with the markups Dain Rauscher charged in these transactions, dealers generally charged materially lower markups on escrow securities when the prices were determined through competition or bona fide arms length negotiation., Under the SEC settlement, Dain Rauscher will pay approximately $13 million to the United States Treasury and to certain issuers of municipal bonds to settle claims related to yield burning in municipal bond transactions.  This payment includes:  disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $647,487 and a civil penalty of $100,000 in connection with the 1992B COPS transaction involved the Arizona Litigation; $10,586,081.59 to the United States Treasury, related to sales of defeasance escrow securities in connection with advance refunding transactions in positive arbitrage (other than the 1992B COPS transaction); and $1,607,623.38 to certain municipal issuers in connection with advance refundings in negative arbitrage.  , Without admitting or denying the findings in the Commissions order, Dain Rauscher agreed to be censured, cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 206 of the Advisers Act, and to make the payments described above.  Without admitting or denying the findings in the Commissions order, Feltham agreed to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act and Sections 206(2) and (3) of the Advisers Act., In a related civil matter, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York today announced that the United States had intervened in, and settled, a lawsuit alleging yield burning filed against Dain Rauscher and its predecessor, Rauscher Pierce Refsnes, Inc. (Rauscher) under the federal False Claims Act.  The SECs settlement with Dain Rauscher was one 10 actions that the Commission brought today against a total of 10 entities and one individual for fraud and other securities violations in connection with a series of refunding bond offerings., ]"

ENTERPRISES SOLUTIONS, INC., et al.,</i> Case No. 00 Civ. 2685 (Cedarbaum, J.) (U.S.D.C., S.D.N.Y.) , On April 6, 2000, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a securities fraud action against Enterprises Solutions, Inc. (ESI), Herbert S. Cannon, and Dr. John A. Solomon in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.  The Commission also obtained an immediate asset freeze preventing the removal of more than $2.3 million in assets from the securities accounts of two Gibraltar companies, Rowen House Limited and Montville Limited, which are named in the complaint as relief defendants.  According to the complaint, ESI is a Nevada corporation claiming to have its principal place of business at defendant Solomons home in Canton, Massachusetts, and defendant Cannon resides in Boca Raton, Florida.  ESI claims to be in the business of developing products and encryption technology for Internet security, and has reported $160,087 in total assets as of September 30, 1999 and $328 in total revenues since January 1, 1998., The Commissions complaint alleges that ESI was established, and has been secretly controlled, by defendant Cannon, a Florida stock promoter who has been convicted of felony fraud violations on two separate occasions, enjoined by federal courts in two prior securities fraud cases brought by the Commission, and barred by the Commission from the securities industry.  The complaint further alleges, among other things, that ESI, Cannon, and Solomon have fraudulently concealed from the investing public Cannons control of ESI, and that they have knowingly or recklessly made false and misleading claims about ESIs products and customers. During the relevant period, according to the complaint, defendant Cannon controlled the securities accounts of several offshore entitities, including relief defendants Rowen House and Montville, through which he sold hundreds of thousands of shares of ESI stock into the market, some during a recent surge in the price and trading volume of the stock.  After the price of ESIs stock rose from $3 per share in January 2000 to more than $20 per share on March 29, 2000, the Commission issued an order on March 30, 2000 temporarily suspending trading in ESIs stock until April 12, 2000.  See Release No. 34-42593., The Commissions complaint charges the defendants with securities fraud in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks injunctions, disgorgement, and civil penalties, along with a constructive trust upon any and all proceeds from ESI stock sales being held in the brokerage accounts of the relief defendants.  , The Commission acknowledges the assistance of NASD Regulation, Inc. in connection with this matter, and notes that its investigation is continuing., This enforcement action is part of the Commissions four-pronged approach to attacking microcap fraud; enforcement, inspections, investor education and regulation.

Brumfield et al.</i>, United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, 95 Civ. 9283 (JES), , On April 6, 2000, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against defendant Sharon Seiden, which permanently enjoins her from further violations of federal securities laws prohibiting insider trading in the context of tender offers.  Seiden was the last defendant remaining in the civil enforcement proceedings brought by the Commission against twenty people who allegedly traded securities while in possession of material, nonpublic information concerning AT&amp;Ts plans to acquire four companies between 1988 and 1991.  The Commission alleged that the defendants obtained the information, directly or indirectly, from Charles Brumfield, a former vice-president in AT&amp;Ts labor relations department., Seiden, 58, is a resident of Boonville, New York.  In November and December 1990, her boyfriend, Robert Flanagan, relayed to her material, nonpublic information concerning AT&amp;Ts planned tender offer for NCR Corp.  Flanagan had been tipped by Thomas Alger, who had received the information from Charles Brumfield.  Seiden bought approximately $16,000 worth of NCR call option contracts, and sold them after a takeover was publicly announced on December 2, 1990.  She made illegal profits of over $350,000 in about two weeks., On January 26, 1999, a jury found Seiden liable for insider trading in violation of Section 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 14e-3, which prohibit insider trading in connection with tender offers.  The jury also found her not liable for insider trading under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5.  The judgment entered against her yesterday permanently enjoins her from future violations of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14e-3.  The Commission withdrew its claims for disgorgement of Seidens illegal trading profits and a civil penalty based on her demonstrated inability to pay.  Seiden consented to the Courts entry of the permanent injunction and waived her right to appeal., The Commission obtained judgments against nineteen out of the twenty people it accused of participating in Charles Brumfields insider trading scheme.

America Online, Inc., Civ No. 1:00CV01088 (PLF), (D.D.C. May 15, 2000), <i>America Online, Inc. Pays $3.5 Million to Settle Financial Reporting Violations</i>, In connection with a cease-and-desist order issued by the Commission today in a settled administrative proceeding against America Online, Inc. (AOL), the Commission filed a related action for civil penalties against AOL in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.  In settlement of that matter, AOL has consented to the entry of an order requiring that it pay a civil penalty of $3,500,000., In the cease-and-desist order, In the Matter of America Online, Inc. [<b>34-42781</b>] the Commission found that AOL violated the reporting and books and records provisions of the federal securities laws in connection with its accounting for certain advertising costs during fiscal years 1995 and 1996.  During that period, AOL capitalized most of the costs of acquiring new subscribers -- including the costs associated with sending computer disks to potential customers -- and reported those costs as an asset on its balance sheet, instead of expensing them as incurred.  AOL reported profits for six of eight quarters in fiscal years 1995 and 1996, rather than the losses it would have reported had the costs been expensed as incurred.  The advertising costs improperly capitalized by AOL reached approximately $385 million by September 30, 1996, when AOL wrote them off in their entirety., Accounting rules do not allow a company to capitalize direct response advertising costs unless it can demonstrate from its past experience that future net revenues from customers obtained through the advertising will exceed the amount of capitalized costs.  <i>See</i> Accounting Standards Executive Committee <i>Statement of Position </i>93-7 (SOP 93-7).  The Commission found that AOL could not meet this requirement because the volatile and unstable nature of the Internet marketplace precluded reliable predictions of future net revenues.  Specifically, the Commission found that AOLs business was characterized, during the relevant period, by the following factors:, , , , , , , , , Due to these factors, according to the Commissions findings, AOL did not have sufficient reliable evidence that its capitalized advertising costs were recoverable to satisfy the requirements of SOP 93-7.  AOLs financial statements as filed with the Commission in quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and annual reports on Form 10-K, from the quarter that began July 1, 1994 through the quarter beginning July 1, 1996 were consequently rendered inaccurate by AOLs accounting treatment for direct response advertising costs.  Therefore the Commission found that AOL violated Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.  The Commission also found that AOL violated Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act during its fiscal years 1995 and 1996, and the quarter beginning July 1, 1996, by recording as an asset advertising costs that could not be capitalized in accordance with the requirements of SOP 93-7., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint and its findings in the Order Instituting Proceedings, AOL has agreed to settle the Commissions claims by: (1) consenting to the entry of an administrative order requiring that it cease and desist from violations of Exchange Act Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) and Exchange Act Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13, and (2) consenting to the entry of an order of the U.S. District Court requiring AOL to pay a civil penalty of $3,500,000. , ,  <a href=../admin/34-42781.htm>Administrative Proceeding 34-42781</a>, <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr16552.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

SG LIMITED, d/b/a STOCKGENERATION et al. (United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, C.A. No. 00 CV11141-JLT) (June 9, 2000)</i>, On June 29, 2000, after a hearing, the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts entered a Preliminary Injunction and Order for Other Relief in a case against  SG Limited and SG Perfect Limited, based on allegations that SG Limited operated a massive pyramid scheme involving the offering of investments in a so-called virtual company over the Internet.    The Courts Order, among other things, continues the previously ordered freeze of assets of SG and SG Perfect Limited  until the case is completed.  At the conclusion of the case, if defendant is found liable, the Commission has asked the court to order distribution of the frozen proceeds of the fraud to injured investors., The Commissions complaint, which was filed on June 9, alleges that SG Limited, based on the Caribbean island of Dominica, operates a website under the name StockGeneration, promising investors a risk-free, guaranteed return of 10% per month, or 215% per year on a compounded basis.  SG allegedly described itself as a virtual stock exchange offering investments in the stock of several virtual companies, including one referred to as the privileged company whose shares only rise and generate the guaranteed 10% monthly return.  The Commission alleged that the investment program, which raised hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of dollars was actually nothing more than a classic pyramid scheme.  The Commission further alleged that investors did not receive the guaranteed return and have not even been able to recover their initial investments.  According to the Commissions complaint, in fact, in recent weeks, SG informed investors that their purported guaranteed, risk-free investments had been reduced to only pennies on the dollar.  The Commission alleges that, even while unable to meet its obligations to existing investors, SG continues to offer its investment program on the StockGeneration website, still promising a risk-free guaranteed 10% monthly return., The Commissions complaint alleges that SG Limited has violated the general antifraud and securities registration provisions of the federal securities laws -- that is, Sections 5(a) and (c) and 17 (a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Commissions complaint also charged as a relief defendant an affiliated company, SG Perfect Limited, which was unjustly enriched through the receipt of over $1 million of the money raised from the StockGeneration scheme.  On June 9, 2000, the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts granted the Commissions motion for an <i>ex parte</i> order temporarily restraining the fraudulent activities, freezing the assets of SG and SG Perfect, Limited and the proceeds of the offering,  requiring that the funds be returned to the U.S. under control of the Court, and imposing other equitable relief.  After obtaining the emergency relief the Commission succeeded in freezing certain assets of the defendants overseas and in the United States.  In addition to the emergency relief it obtained, the Commission is seeking an order permanently enjoining SG from violating the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws, requiring SG and SG Perfect to disgorge funds received through their violations of the securities laws, and imposing civil monetary penalties on SG.  , The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Economic Crime Division of the Central Criminal Police of Estonia., Investors are advised to read the SECs Cyberspace Alert before purchasing any investment promoted on the Internet.

Guilbeau is the president and director of HTHolding Co., The complaint alleges that Guilbeau and HTHolding Co. schemed to defraud investors in the offer of stock, by among other things:, Designing the website www.houstontexans-nfl.com to mislead investors into believing that they were purchasing an interest in the recently-formed Houston NFL football franchise;, Using the name, Houston Texans NFL Football Team Holding Company and using the NFL Shield and other NFL trademarks on the website to create the impression that the purported team was an NFL-sanctioned franchise;, Creating the illusion that HTHolding Co. was a prosperous entity conducting legitimate business affairs by advising potential investors that its business address was 5300 N. Braeswood, Suite 282, Houston, Texas, when in reality this is merely a mail drop box and 282 is simply the number of the box; , Failing to disclose that HTHolding Co. has no affiliation with the NFL or the legitimate Houston NFL franchise; , Failing to disclose that HTHolding Co. does not ownan NFL football franchise; and,  Failing to disclose that the offering is not registered with the Commission., 	The Commission would like to acknowledge the significant assistance of the Houston FBI office in both bringing the Commissions action and in coordinating the execution of its search warrant.  The Commission would also like to acknowledge the assistance of the Texas State Securities Board in the investigation of this matter., The Complaint charges that Guilbeau and HTHolding violated the antifraud provisions found in Section 17(a), as well as the registration provisions found in Section 5(c), of the Securities Act of 1933, and seeks a temporary restraining order, preliminary and permanent injunctions, an asset freeze, accounting, disgorgement with prejudgment interest and civil penalties.  The complaint also seeks an order prohibiting the movement, alteration and destruction of books and records and an order expediting discovery. , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr16690.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Hyer, Walter Wilowatyj and Donald C. Yount, former officers of Versatility, Inc., formerly a Fairfax, Virginia telemarketing software and services company whose securities were listed on NASDAQ.  The Commissions complaint alleges that for fiscal 1997 and the first two quarters of fiscal 1998, Versatility materially overstated its revenues and earnings by improperly recognizing revenue on certain transactions without binding contracts and before reaching agreed-upon performance milestones.  The complaint alleges that Versatility overstated revenue by 49% and overstated net income by 125% for 1997, and, for the first and second quarters of 1998, overstated revenue by 52% and 32% and net income by 101% and 47% respectively.  On April 28, 1998, Versatility announced the restatement of its revenues and earnings for fiscal 1997 and 1998.  Versatility was later acquired by Oracle Corporation. , The complaint alleges that Charnock (the former CEO), Hyer (the former controller), Wilowatyj (the former senior vice president of sales) and Yount (the former CFO), participated in Versatilitys material misstatements, and alleges that Charnock, Hyer and Yount provided false or misleading management representation letters to Versatilitys auditors.

Herndon, Former CFO of Pier 1, With Fraudulently Concealing $20 Million Loss in 1995</h3>]","[<b>SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION</b><br/><b>Washington, D.C.</b>, <b>Litigation Release No.  16710 / September 19, 2000</b>, <b>Accounting and Auditing Release No.  1305 / September 19, 2000</b>, <b>Securities and Exchange Commission v. Robert G. Herndon, Civil Action No. 4-00-CV-1564-A (N.D. Tex.) (Sept. 19, 2000)</b>, The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed two settled enforcement actions involving Pier 1 Imports, Inc., an importer and retailer of home furnishings based in Fort Worth, Texas, and Robert G. Herndon, Pier 1s former Chief Financial Officer.  Both actions stem from Pier 1s relationship with money manager S. Jay Goldinger of Beverly Hills.  , The first of todays actions, filed in federal district court in Texas, charges Herndon with concealing a $20 million loss in Pier 1s investment funds in 1995 from the companys senior management and its outside auditors, and with circumventing and failing to implement internal controls to properly account for the investments.  Herndons conduct also caused Pier 1 to violate the books and records and internal accounting control provisions of the securities laws.  Herndon has agreed to settle the Commissions charges.  , The second action is an administrative proceeding against Pier 1 in which Pier 1 has consented to cease and desist from violating the reporting and record-keeping provisions of the securities laws.  , These charges stem from the Commissions investigation into a fraud by S. Jay Goldinger, once a well-known Beverly Hills-based money manager, upon his clients, which included Pier 1 and another publicly-traded company, Pairgain Technologies, Inc.  In November 1999 the Commission brought cases against Goldinger, Pairgains CEO and CFO, and Pairgain itself.  <i>SEC v. Goldinger</i>, Civil Action No. CV 99-11539-LGB (C.D. Cal.

Later, the Commission permanently barred Goldinger from associating with any securities broker or dealer.  <i>In the Matter of Goldinger</i>, Securities Exchange Act Release No. 42358 (Jan. 27, 2000)., The complaint filed today against Herndon alleges the following: from at least 1986 through most of 1995, Goldinger engaged in fraudulent trading that eventually left his clients with losses totaling $100 million.  One of his clients was Pier 1, which lost nearly $20 million.  As Pier 1s CFO, Herndon fraudulently concealed Pier 1s $20 million loss and various other facts about the companys investments with Goldinger from both Pier 1s senior management and its outside auditors.  Herndons fraudulent conduct caused material misrepresentations and omissions in reports filed by Pier 1 with the Commission., Without admitting or denying the complaints allegations, Herndon agreed to settle the charges against him by consenting to a final judgment.  The final judgment will enjoin Herndon from violating Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder; enjoin him from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder; prohibit him from serving as an officer or director of a public company; and order him to pay $75,000 as a civil money penalty.  , Herndon has also agreed to settle administrative proceedings under Rule 102(e) of the Commissions Rules of Practice, to be instituted after entry of the injunction, which will deny him the privilege of appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant., In the related administrative proceeding filed today, Pier 1, without admitting or denying the Commissions findings, consented to an order finding that the company violated the periodic reporting, books and records, and internal control provisions of the Exchange Act in connection with the losses in the Goldinger investments.  The order directed Pier 1 to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations or future violations of the following provisions: Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder.  <i>In the Matter of Pier 1 Imports, Inc.</i>, Exchange Act Release No. 34-43301, September 19, 2000., <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr16710.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

BRYCAR FINANCIAL CORPORATION AND BRYAN J. EGAN, DEFENDANTS, AND CAROL A. EGAN, RELIEF DEFENDANT, Civil Action No. CV-S-00-1125-LDG-LRL (D. Nev.)(LDG) (September 19, 2000), On September 19, 2000, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed an emergency action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada and on September 20, 2000 obtained a Temporary Restraining Order prohibiting a Las Vegas, Nevada company, BryCar Financial Corporation and its president, Bryan J. Egan (Egan), from engaging in fraudulent activities and offering or selling securities while failing to be registered with the Commission as a broker-dealer.  The action also freezes the assets of BryCar, Egan and relief defendant Carol A. Egan, the secretary of BryCar.  BryCar conducted many of the activities that are the subject of this action over its Internet websites.  , The Commissions complaint alleges that although neither defendant is registered to deal in securities, Egan purports to offer long- and short-term investment programs to consumers in several states through BryCar.  Under BryCars long-term program, investor funds are to be pooled for the purchase of securities from three sources:  initial public offerings, commonly known as IPOs; pre-IPO shares, and shares of private placements.  The defendants require a minimum investment of $2,500 for participation in this program.  Under BryCars short term program, investor funds are to be pooled and used for day trading, in a practice in which publicly-traded securities are held for a limited time in an attempt to profit on market swings.  The defendants require a minimum investment of $1,000 for investment in this program.  The Complaint alleges that throughout this year, the defendants have held seminars at Las Vegas hotels, during which prospective customers were given dinner and then exhorted by Egan to invest in the BryCar programs.   The Complaint alleges that Egans sales pitch contained numerous materially false and misleading statements concerning BryCar and its purported investment programs.  In at least one such presentation, according to the Complaint, Egan repeatedly told prospective customers that BryCar guaranteed its investments, that investors cannot lose money, and that BryCars investments are both risk free and  tax free.  According to the Complaint, however, securities transactions involve risk and are generally subject to taxation.  , The Complaint alleges that Egan disseminated, or caused dissemination of, promotional literature that also contained false claims of BryCars ability to provide risk-free, high-yield investments.  For example, one brochure described in the Complaint promises investors an average return of 500% in an 8 -12 week period, without the RISK to you ....  Similarly, Egans business card proclaims BryCars investment programs risk free., In addition, according to the Complaint, the defendants have operated a website at , on which the phony investment programs were promoted and which allowed customers to access equally fictitious account information.  In one BryCar posting, titled A word from our President, Egan describes BryCar as [a]n Investment Firm that provides Risk Free investing, high returns...., The Complaint also alleges that on numerous occasions, Egan and Carol Egan have looted investor funds from BryCars checking account to pay for consumer purchases, repeatedly transferred substantial sums from BryCars account into bank and trading accounts in Egans name, and made ATM withdrawals from BryCars account.  The Complaint alleges that on September 14, 2000, at or around 9:00 a.m. (PDST), Egan ordered BankAmerica to wire transfer $380,000 from BryCars account to a personal account maintained in his name at WingspanBank.com.  According to the Complaint, this transaction left BryCars account with a zero balance. , As relief, the Commission sought a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, an accounting and other emergency relief.  The Commission also seeks a permanent injunction against future violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 (Section 17(a)) and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5), and the broker-dealer registration provisions of the Exchange Act (Section 15(a)), disgorgement, plus prejudgment interest, and the imposition of civil money penalties., The Commission wishes to thank the Securities Division of the Nevada Secretary of State for its valuable assistance in this matter. , Investors are encouraged to report suspicious Internet offerings (or other suspicious offerings) via e-mail to enforcement@sec.gov.

SILVESTER, ET AL., Civil Action No. 3:00-CV-19411 DJS (D. Conn.) (U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut - Filed October 10, 2000), The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it filed a civil fraud action against Paul J. Silvester, the former Treasurer of the State of Connecticut, two private equity firms, three of their officers, and five others involved in a fraudulent scheme in connection with the investment of state pension fund money.  The Commission alleged that the defendants participated in a scheme where Silvester awarded investments of hundreds of millions of dollars of state pension fund money in exchange for lucrative fees paid by the private equity firms to Silvesters friends and political associates. According to the complaint, Silvester, who served as Treasurer from July 1997 until January 1999, solicited two private equity firms, Landmark Partners, Inc. and Triumph Capital Group, Inc., to pay substantial consulting or finders fees to Silvesters friends.  In order to secure the investment of pension fund money, Landmark and Triumph agreed to pay the requested fees.  Silvester then demanded and received kickbacks of the fees from his friends.  The Commission alleged that Silvester, Triumph, Landmark, and certain of the firms officers violated their fiduciary duties by failing to disclose the quid pro quo.  Landmark is headquartered in Simsbury, Connecticut.  Triumph is headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, and also maintains offices in Hartford, Connecticut, Palm Beach, Florida, and San Francisco and Los Angeles, California., The complaint alleges that, in return for investing $150 million of state pension funds with Landmark in 1998, Silvester solicited and Landmark agreed to pay $1.5 million in finders fees to Silvesters friend, Ben F. Andrews, Jr.  Andrews agreed to kick back part of the finders fee to Silvester using another friend of Silvester, Christopher A. Stack, as an intermediary.  Andrews arranged for Landmark to split the finders fee between him and Stack (who was paid through his consulting firm, KCATS, LLC), and Stack then funneled part of his Landmark fee to Silvester through an intermediary. Jerome L. Wilson, another Landmark consultant, acted as an intermediary in arranging for Landmark to hire and pay Andrews and Stack.  Stanley F. Alfeld, chairman of Landmark, agreed to hire Andrews. Wilson later notified Alfeld that Andrews would split his fee with KCATS, Stacks consulting firm.  At Alfelds request, Wilson also arranged for his employer to act as a conduit for payment from Landmark to Andrews and Stack., The complaint also alleges that, in return for investing $200 million with Triumph shortly after losing the November 1998 election, Silvester solicited and Frederick W. McCarthy and Charles B. Spadoni, Triumphs president and general counsel, respectively, agreed to provide $1 million consulting contracts to Silvesters friends, Stack and Lisa Thiesfield.  Stack then funneled part of his Triumph feeto Silvester through another intermediary.  Silvester also requested and expected to receive part of Thiesfields Triumph fee., According to the complaint, Silvester,<i> </i>Landmark, Alfeld, Wilson, Andrews, Stack, KCATS, Triumph, McCarthy, Spadoni, and Thiesfield, variously, violated and aided and abetted violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and/or Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The Commission seeks to enjoin each of the Defendants from continuing to violate or aid and abet violations of these laws.  The Commission also seeks disgorgement of monies fraudulently received by Defendants Silvester, Andrews, Stack, KCATS, and Thiesfield, plus prejudgment interest.  The Commission further seeks civil monetary penalties from each of the Defendants., Defendants Silvester, Stack and KCATS have agreed to settle the Commissions charges, without admitting or denying the allegations contained in the Commissions complaint, by entering consent agreements that enjoin them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, and the Advisers Act.  Silvester has agreed to pay $10,500, representing the proceeds he received from the conduct alleged in the complaint.  Stack and KCATS have agreed, jointly and severally, to pay $300,667, representing the proceeds they received and retained from the conduct alleged in the complaint.

The case involves violations of the books and records provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, resulting from presumed illicit payments to foreign officials by one of IBMs wholly-owned subsidiaries during 1994.  Without admitting or denying the Commissions findings, IBM consented to the entry of an Order that requires IBM to cease and desist from committing or causing any future violation of Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act.  In addition, the Commission announced the filing of a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against IBM seeking a civil money penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, IBM consented to the entry of a judgment ordering IBM to pay a $300,000 penalty., The Order finds that IBM violated Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act in connection with a $250 million contract to integrate and modernize the computer system of a commercial bank owned by the Argentine government.  According to the Order, certain former senior management of IBM-Argentina, S.A. (IBM-Argentina), a wholly-owned subsidiary of IBM, caused IBM-Argentina to enter into a subcontract with Capacitacion Y Computacion Rural, S.A. (CCR), and money paid to CCR by IBM-Argentina in connection with the subcontract was apparently subsequently paid by CCR to certain bank officials.  Specifically, the Order finds that, during 1994 and 1995, IBM-Argentina paid CCR approximately $22 million under the subcontract, of which at least $4.5 million was transferred to several bank directors by CCR.  , The Order further finds that, in connection with the subcontract, IBM-Argentinas former senior management overrode IBM procurement and contracting procedures, and hid the details of the subcontract from the technical and financial review personnel assigned to the contract.  In the Order, the Commission finds that IBM-Argentinas former senior management provided IBM-Argentinas procurement department with fabricated documentation, including a backdated authorization letter and a document that stated incomplete and inaccurate reasons for hiring CCR.  According to the Order, IBM-Argentina recorded the payments to CCR in its books and records as third-party subcontractor expenses.  This information was incorporated into IBMs 1994 Form 10-K, which was filed with the Commission on March 23, 1995., <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr16839.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Evelyn Litwok and Dalia Eilat</i>, Civil Action No. 00 Civ. 7626 (United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York), The Commission announced today that it charged Evelyn<b> </b>Litwok (Litwok), a former East Hampton investment adviser, with committing securities fraud in connection with the offer and sale of securities in three private investment funds, and with misappropriating more than $3 million of investor funds for her personal benefit.  Between 1994 and 1997, Litwok raised more than $8 million from approximately 35 individuals from the sale of limited partnership interests in Kohn Investment LP-1 , (LP-1), Kohn Capital LP-33 (LP-33), and a third private investment fund.  Litwok misappropriated approximately $3 million, of which approximately $1.3 million went to her personal friend, Dalia Eilat (Eilat), who is named in the Complaint as a relief defendant.  Litwok lost the remainder of investor funds through speculative trading in options.  Moreover, in selling the investments Litwok made material misrepresentations and omissions concerning, among other things, her prior history as a broker and investment adviser.  For example, Litwok failed to disclose substantial judgments entered against her for prior misconduct, including her misappropriation of investor funds.  As a result of Litwoks misconduct, numerous investors have lost collectively several million dollars while Litwok enriched herself., The defendant and relief defendant are as follows:, <b>Litwok</b>, age 49, currently resides in Freehold, New Jersey, and is currently working as an independent insurance sales agent.  From 1994 to 1998, the period of the conduct at issue, Litwok resided in East Hampton, New York.  Litwok was the principal of several corporations through which she conducted her investment advisory business, including Kohn Investment Management, Inc. (the general partner of LP-1), Kohn Capital Management, Inc.-33 (the general partner of LP-33), and Kohn Investment Management II, Inc. (a general partner of Kohn Investment Associates II, an entity that was never formed).  From 1984 to 1994, Litwok was associated with various broker-dealers as a registered representative and held Series 7, Series 63 and Series 15 licenses.  , <b>Eilat, </b>age 45, is an architect currently residing in New York, New York.  Eilat was the president and sole shareholder of Kohn Capital Management, Inc.-33, the general partner of LP-33.  During most of 1995 and 1996, Eilat lived in Litwoks house in East Hampton, New York.  Eilat received at least $1.19 million from LP-1 and at least $150,000 from LP-33.<b> </b>, The Complaint alleges as follows:, From June 1994 to June 1995, Litwok raised approximately $5 million from approximately 20 investors from the sale of limited partnership interests in LP-1, a private investment fund.  Litwok lost most of the money in LP-1 through speculative options trading and misappropriated the rest.  Litwok misappropriated approximately $2.3 million of LP-1s funds for her personal benefit, including approximately $1.19 million which went to Eilat and businesses controlled by Eilat. Nevertheless, Litwok continued to solicit new investors for LP-1 by falsely blaming LP-1s losses on the funds broker, and obtained another $525,000 from two investors in January 1997.  , From June 1996 to April 1997, Litwok raised approximately $2.7 million from approximately 15 investors from the sale of limited partnership interests in a second private investment fund, LP-33.  In offering and selling the investments in LP-33, Litwok made material misrepresentations and omissions of material fact about her prior history as a broker and an investment adviser.  In particular, Litwok told investors that she was a very successful broker and investment adviser, but failed to disclose judgments and arbitration awards entered against her for prior misconduct, including her misappropriation of investor funds from LP-1.  Litwok lost all of the funds in LP-33 through speculative options trading, but not before she misappropriated approximately $600,000 of the funds for her personal benefit, of which approximately $150,000 went to Eilats benefit.    , Finally, in October 1997, Litwok obtained $300,000 from another investor by materially misrepresenting that she would invest the money and that Litwok and the investor would share in the profits.  Again, Litwok misrepresented her history as a broker and an investment adviser.  Litwok misappropriated $72,000 of the investors money and lost the remainder through speculative trading.  , The Commission alleges that as a result of the foregoing Litwok violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10-b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  The Commission seeks a final judgment: (a) permanently enjoining Litwok from future violations of the federal securities laws; (b) ordering Litwok to disgorge ill-gotten gains, plus prejudgment interest; (c) imposing civil penalties against Litwok; (d) ordering Eilat to disgorge funds equal to the amount by which she was unjustly enriched, plus prejudgment interest; and (e) ordering Litwok and Eilat to provide verified written accountings., The litigation is pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York., <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr16843.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"
