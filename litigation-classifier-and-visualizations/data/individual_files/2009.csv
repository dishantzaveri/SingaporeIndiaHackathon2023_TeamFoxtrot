The Commissions action, filed on February 20, 2007, alleged that Braintree and Graham fraudulently offered and sold unregistered securities in the form of investment contracts and/or fractional interests in oil and gas leases and that Graham diverted almost $3 million for his own personal use. The final judgment enjoins Graham from violating of the antifraud, securities registration and broker-dealer registration provisions of the securities laws. In addition, Graham was ordered to pay over $3 million in disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, and a penalty of $120,000. The Commission obtained a default judgment against Braintree Energy, Inc., permanently enjoining it from violating the federal securities laws., According to the Commissions complaint, from at least 2000 through 2006, Graham and Braintree made numerous oral and written misrepresentations to more than 200 investors nationwide and in foreign countries regarding the expected rate of return, level of profits and risks associated with the investment. The Commission alleged that Graham and Braintree told potential investors that they could expect the return of their principal within months to a year and that Graham failed to disclose that he intended to and did take approximately 30% of investors funds for himself. The Commission alleged that Graham and Braintree, through their fraud, obtained at least $9 million of investor funds and diverted approximately $3 million for Grahams personal use. The Commission also alleged that Graham and others at his direction led investors to believe that investing in their offerings was not risky, falsely assuring some investors that Braintree had never offered interests in oil or gas wells that did not produce, and that investors monies were safer than if they had invested in certificates of deposit. The complaint alleged that, in fact, most investors have received no profits and most have not even recovered their initial investments., Without admitting or denying the substantive allegations in the Commissions complaint, Graham consented to the entry of a final judgment ordering him to pay $3,269,903.60. In addition, the final judgments against Graham and Braintree impose permanent injunctions prohibiting Graham and Braintree from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder., The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Ontario Securities Commission, the Massachusetts Securities Division and the Pennsylvania Securities Commission., For further information, please see: Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20011.htm>20011</a> (February 21, 2007).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr20841.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

James, a South Florida investment adviser.  The indictment charges James with two counts of mail fraud in connection with a multi-million dollar misappropriation and Ponzi scheme.  According to the indictment, between April 2001 and January 2008, James used his position as owner of James Asset Advisory, LLC (James Asset) to receive over $5.3 million from over 40 clients.  Those funds were supposed to be invested in various securities, bonds, and funds.  Instead of investing those funds, James used approximately $2.4 million of investor money for his own personal use and approximately $2.8 million of investor money to pay back other prior investors., In September 2008, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida against James and James Asset, for misappropriating client funds and operating a Ponzi scheme.  The Commissions complaint alleged that the Defendants received at least $5.2 million from 44 clients who were told by the Defendants that client monies would be invested in stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.  According to the complaint, the Defendants never invested any client funds in the stock market or other investments.  Instead, James misappropriated at least $2.4 million in client monies to fund his lavish lifestyle, including the purchase of a six-bedroom, 5,000 square foot home, a luxury condominium, a Porsche sports car, and season tickets to the Miami Heat games.  Moreover, like a classic Ponzi scheme, the Defendants transferred approximately $2.8 million from new clients to existing clients to repay principal or to create the illusion of profitable trading.  In addition, to facilitate and otherwise conceal their fraud, the complaint alleged that the Defendants provided clients with false account statements reflecting securities holdings and returns that did not exist.  On September 25, 2008, the Court entered an order, by consent, permanently enjoining James and James Asset from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

The complaint further alleged that Meletiou was responsible for the audits and reviews of the AremisSoft subsidiaries and that he attended meetings with senior AremisSoft executives in which the AremisSoft financial fraud was openly discussed., The complaint further alleged that Dhawan and Co., an Indian-based accounting firm, issued audit reports on nine AremisSoft subsidiaries in 2000 signed by its partner R.K.

Ficken of Boston, Massachusetts, a defendant in a civil injunctive action filed by the Commission on November 4, 2003. The Commission alleged that Ficken, a former registered representative of broker-dealer Prudential Securities, Inc., committed fraud in connection with his deceptive market timing trades in dozens of mutual funds. The final judgment enjoined Ficken from future violations of the federal securities laws and ordered him to pay $589,854 in disgorgement and pre-judgment interest. The First Circuits decision affirms this judgment. , The Commission filed its complaint against Ficken, four other former Prudential Securities registered representatives, and their former branch manager, on November 4, 2003, and amended its complaint on July 14, 2004. The amended complaint alleged that Ficken was part of a three-person group of registered representatives, known as the Druffner Group, that defrauded mutual fund companies and the funds shareholders by placing thousands of market timing trades worth more than $1 billion for five hedge fund customers from at least January 2001 through September 2003. According to the amended complaint, Ficken knew that the mutual fund companies monitored and attempted to restrict excessive trading in their mutual funds. The amended complaint alleged that, to evade those restrictions when placing market timing trades, Druffner Group members disguised their own identities by establishing multiple broker identification numbers and disguised their customers identities by opening numerous customer accounts for what were, in reality, only a handful of customers. , The final judgment affirmed by the First Circuit enjoins Ficken from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and orders him to pay disgorgement of $494,975, representing profits gained as a result of the conduct alleged in the amended complaint, together with prejudgment interest thereon in the amount of $94,879. , For further information, please see: Litigation Release Numbers <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20722.htm>20722</a> (September 17, 2008), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20284.htm>20284</a> (September 14, 2007), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18784.htm>18784</a> (July 15, 2004) and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18444.htm>18444</a> (November 4, 2003).

Sayre (Sayre), age 52, of Hollywood, California on a criminal securities fraud charge relating to his pump and dump stock manipulation. The sentence ordered Sayre to serve 57 months in prison to be followed by three years of supervised release. The sentence reflects a sentencing enhancement because the Court found that Sayre obstructed justice by lying under oath to the Commission during its investigation., Sayre was criminally indicted on February 25, 2005, by a federal grand jury convened by the United States Attorneys Office for the Central District of California. The indictment alleged that, in March 2000, Sayre made materially false and misleading statements in buy recommendations issued through his company, Independent Financial Reports, Inc. (IFR), about eConnect, whose stock at the time was quoted on the Over-The Counter Bulletin Board. The indictment also alleged that Sayre purchased eConnect shares before issuing the buy recommendations and sold them at dramatically higher prices once the recommendations drove up eConnects stock price. The indictment also alleged, however, that Sayre falsely stated that IFR held no eConnect stock and would not receive any benefit for the buy recommendations. According to court documents filed by the United States Attorneys Office, Sayre was arrested in Canada on February 3, 2006, after having fled from the United States in 2000, and extradited to Los Angeles on July 11, 2007. On July 25, 2008, Sayre was found guilty of securities fraud following a twelve-day jury trial., The Commission previously filed a civil injunctive action against Sayre and IFR on April 7, 2000, in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, alleging the same fraudulent scheme charged in the criminal action.

A viatical or life settlement is an investment in which the investor purchases a right to receive the proceeds on a terminally ill or elderly persons insurance policy when the insured dies.  According to the 25-count Indictment, Steinger and Steiner, two of the founding principals of MBC, and attorneys McNerney and Livoti, participated in a wide-scale fraud involving the sale of these investments, falsely promising investors safe and secure investments when they knew that MBC had, among other things, improperly acquired policies, pressured doctors to rubber-stamp false life expectancy figures, and mismanaged escrowed premium funds in a Ponzi scheme fashion.  The Indictment charges the defendants with conspiracy, mail fraud, wire fraud and money laundering in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341, 1343, 1349, and 1956(h); the criminal case has been filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida., The SEC halted MBCs on-going fraud through an emergency action filed in May 2004.

Pa.)</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on January 7, 2009, it filed an emergency action to halt an estimated $50 million Ponzi scheme conducted by Joseph S. Forte (“Forte”) and Joseph Forte, L.P. (“Forte LP”), of Broomall, Pennsylvania.  According to the Commission’s complaint, from at least February 1995 to the present, Forte has been operating a Ponzi scheme in which he fraudulently obtained approximately $50 million from as many as 80 investors through the sale of securities in the form of limited partnership interests in Forte L.P.  Forte was the general partner of Forte L.P.  The Honorable Paul S. Diamond, U.S. District Judge for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, has issued an order granting a preliminary injunction, freezing assets, compelling an accounting, and imposing other emergency relief.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission’s complaint, Forte and Forte LP consented to the entry of the order., The Commission’s complaint alleges that in late December 2008, Forte admitted to federal authorities that from at least 1995 through December 2008, he had been conducting a Ponzi scheme.  Forte, who has never been registered with the Commission in any capacity, told investors that he would invest the limited partnership funds in a securities futures trading account in the name of Forte LP that would trade in futures contracts, including S&amp;P 500 stock index futures (“trading program”).  The complaint also alleges that despite the impressive and consistent returns the defendants falsely reported to investors, Forte consistently lost money in the limited trading that he did.  Forte has admitted that he misrepresented and falsified Forte LP’s trading performance from the very first quarter.  From 1995 through September 30, 2008, the defendants reported to investors annual returns ranging from 18.52% to as high as 37.96%.  However, from January 1998 through October 2008, the Forte LP trading account had net trading losses of approximately $3.3 million., The complaint further alleges that in addition to misrepresenting to investors that the trading was highly successful and making huge profits, defendants Forte and Forte LP misrepresented the use of investor funds.  Although Forte claimed that he raised approximately $50 million from investors for the purpose of participating in the trading program, between January 1998 and October 2008 Forte deposited only $25.8 million in the trading account and during that same period withdrew $23.1 million.  Forte admitted that he took at least $10 to $12 million in so-called fees for his personal use based on the falsely inflated value of Forte LP, but Forte LP statements provided to investors reflect fees charged of $28.7 million between March 1995 and September 2008.  He also claimed that he used approximately $15 to $20 million of investor funds to repay other investors - the hallmark of a Ponzi scheme.  The complaint alleges that the defendants also lied to investors about the value of the partnership portfolio.  For example, in September 2008, the defendants reported to investors that the Forte LP portfolio had a value of over $150 million.  In fact, Forte LP’s trading account at that time had a balance of only $146,814., In addition to the emergency relief obtained, the Commission’s complaint seeks disgorgement of the defendants’ ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and permanent injunctions barring future violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws., The Commission’s investigation is continuing., The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

The default judgment finds Young liable for disgorgement in the amount of $282,103 representing profits from the conduct alleged in the complaint, prejudgment interest of $16,698, and a civil penalty of $282,102, for a total of $580,903.  , The Commission’s complaint alleged that McMillin and Young were part of a Ponzi scheme known as American Investors Network or AIN.  AIN solicited funds to finance an advertising program and promised to return monthly profits of $10,000 to $20,000 on each $2,000 investment.  The advertising interests were investment contracts which are securities under federal law.  Among other claims, the complaint alleged there was no advertising program and that investors who received “profit” distributions were paid with funds solicited from other investors.  The complaint also alleged that McMillin and Young acted as unregistered broker-dealers in connection with the offer and sale of securities. , The Court previously entered permanent injunctions restraining McMillin, Young, and Innovative Projects, Inc., from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and Rule 10b-5.

The Complaint alleged that Zeglis misappropriated material nonpublic information from his brother, a member of Georgia-Pacifics board of directors, and further alleged that on November 10, 2005, three days before a public announcement that Georgia-Pacific had agreed to be acquired by Koch Industries, Inc., Zeglis tipped Dixon and Gupta, both of whom purchased Georgia-Pacific securities. Gupta, in turn, tipped McKee, who also purchased Georgia-Pacific securities. Further, the Complaint alleged that on Sunday, November 13, 2005, Koch Industries, Inc.

In addition, the Complaint alleges that Ossie represents himself to be CREs president and chief executive officer., The Complaint alleges that, since at least early 2008, CRE and Ossie have raised at least $25 million from over 120 investors.  As alleged in the Complaint, CRE offers 30 Day Currency Trading Contracts, which promise a guaranteed ten percent (10%) return (the ROI) in thirty days.  The Complaint also alleges that CRE and Ossie claim that they generate profits sufficient to pay these guaranteed returns by trading United States and Japanese currency contracts as the exchange rate fluctuates.  Further, the Complaint alleges that CRE and Ossie told investors that the program involves very little risk because CRE has established a large, defensive reserve fund from which to pay back the 10% ROI, plus redeemed principal.  In fact, as alleged in the Complaint, CRE does not generate sufficient returns from currency trading to pay the promised returns.  The Complaint alleges that the defendants claim CRE and its program were audited by an outside accounting firm which concluded that the investment program was not a Ponzi scheme.  In fact, according to the complaint, CRE operated as a Ponzi scheme by paying all returns to investors from funds contributed by new investors., The Complaint also alleges that CRE planned to launch a $100 million stock offering in early 2009, pursuant to which CRE intended to sell 50 million shares at $2 per share.  In connection with that offering, the Complaint alleges that Ossie told potential investors that CRE business operations had been analyzed by an independent firm for estimation of stock value, and that the firm opined that CRE stock should be worth $40-$45 per share.  The complaint alleges that these projections were misleading because CRE was insolvent., The Complaint alleges that the defendants have violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder., On January 15, 2009, the defendants consented to the entry of an order granting the Commissions requests for (i) a temporary restraining order; (ii) an asset freeze; (iii) an accounting of all funds raised; (iv) the appointment of a receiver for defendant CRE; and (v) an order expediting discovery and preventing the destruction of documents.

Defendant Rod Cameron Stringer, of Lamesa, Texas, claims that his stock trading strategy has generated annual returns as high as 61%, and total returns in excess of 600%.  In truth, the Commissions complaint alleges that Stringer has been operating a fraudulent scheme since at least 2001, during which he has misappropriated millions of dollars of investor funds to support an extremely lavish lifestyle and to make Ponzi payments to earlier investors with new investor funds.   Many of Stringers investors are elderly., Specifically, the complaint alleges that defendant Stringer used less than 20% of the investors funds to engage in securities transactions, and those transactions have resulted in substantial losses, not gains, as reported to investors.  While Stringers alleged fraudulent scheme began as early as 2001, an expedited investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Commission focused on Stringers activities since January 2007.  Since that time, the complaint alleges that Stringer raised at least $8.5 million from approximately 12 -15 investors.  Contrary to Stringers representations, only approximately $1.5 million of this amount made its way into three securities brokerage accounts, each of which is maintained in Stringers personal name.   The exact disposition of the remaining funds is presently unknown, but it is clear that Stringer used substantial amounts of investor funds to, among other things, finance a horse racing partnership, purchase a luxury boat, build a swimming pool at his office, purchase several pieces of jewelry, pay off mortgages on at least two houses, and purchase several expensive cars and trucks.  Further, since January 2007, the complaint alleges that Stringer has used at least $2.4 million of the $8.5 million invested by his hedge fund clients to pay distributions and purported profits to other investors, The complaint alleges that Stringer violated the anti-fraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Approximately $30 million was raised from investors in the four offerings from early 2006 through January 2008. The complaint alleges that defendant Haugen served as vice president of marketing for Coadum Advisors, Inc. (Coadum), who along with Mansell Capital Partners III, LLC (Mansell) conducted the offerings. The complaint alleges that Haugen was the primary salesman of securities sold in the fraudulent offerings. The Haugen matter is a companion case to <u>SEC v. Coadum Advisors, Inc., et al.</u>, Civil Action File No. 1:08-CV-0011-ODE (N.D. Ga.), a civil action filed on an emergency basis in January 2008., The instant complaint alleges that as vice president of sales and marketing for Coadum, Haugen directly solicited and sold more than 50% of the Coadum securities in the offerings. The private placement memoranda for the four offerings (PPMs), all of which made similar representations, described an investment objective involving risk-controlled strategies consisting of purchasing AA or better rated securities at one price, and simultaneously selling the securities at a higher price, generating a profit on the price difference, which Coadum and Mansell referred to as commercial trading programs. The complaint also alleges that at least some investors were assured of from 3% to 6% (or in one investment 2.5 percent to 8 percent) return per month on their initial investments. The funds from the offerings were commingled in accounts controlled by Coadum or Mansell. Coadum and Mansell invested the majority of the funds through a Malta based investment platform which in turn invested the funds in related entities which never began operation or provided any returns. In the meantime, Coadum and Mansell falsely represented in monthly account statements to investors that the investors had been earning approximately four percent per month and that all or most of the investors principal was in escrow. The complaint alleges that contrary to representations to investors, Coadum and Mansell borrowed approximately $3.4 million of, or against, the investors funds and disbursed to apparently related parties approximately an additional $5 million. Haugen told investors, falsely, that their investment principal was risk free, insured and never left the escrow account or was otherwise guaranteed against loss. In fact, Haugen knew that investors funds were being invested in off-shore trading programs. Trading profits were purportedly earned in a non-recourse margin account. Although the PPMs represented that no commissions would be paid on the investments, and that the promoters would be compensated based on a percentage of earnings, Haugen received substantial commissions from investor funds prior to earnings on those funds, which never occurred.

According to the SECs complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, GM violated the issuer reporting, books-and-records, and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws., With regard to GMs pension plans, the complaint alleges that GM made material misstatements or omissions in its 2002 Form 10-K concerning the disclosure of two critical pension accounting estimates - its pension discount rate for 2002 and its expected return on pension assets for 2003., According to the complaint, GM had stated publicly in an August 2002 pension conference call with analysts that it used a duration matched approach to select its discount rate, but failed to disclose in its 2002 Form 10-K that its use of a 6.75% discount rate was developed from a non-duration matched approach, which was materially higher than the rate developed from a duration matched model. In addition, the complaint alleges that with respect to the discount rate, GM maintained inadequate internal controls to provide reasonable assurance that transactions would be recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles, including a process for reviewing and adopting discount rate recommendations to provide reasonable assurance that the recommendation was developed in a reasoned and unbiased manner., The complaint further alleges that since at least the mid-1980s, GMs expected return assumption had never been higher than its most recent 10 year average return. In its 2001 Form 10-K and during the August 2002 pension call, GM referred to its rolling 10 year historical average return of 10% or better as support for the reasonableness of its 10% expected return assumption. In its 2002 Form 10-K, GM did not state that its most recent 10 year average return was below its new assumption set at year-end. According to the complaint, if GM had used an expected return consistent with its 10 year historical average, it would have reduced its 2003 pre-tax earnings by $680 million., The complaint also alleges that in that same 2002 Form 10-K and in three 10-Q filings, GM failed to disclose material information about the timing and amount of its projected cash contributions to its pension plans to avoid variable rate premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) and the impact such contributions might have on its liquidity and capital resources., With regard to GMs other transactions, the SECs complaint alleges that GM made material misstatements that included improperly accounting for a $97 million transaction involving the sale and repurchase of precious metals inventory in its 2000 Form 10-K; prematurely recognizing in its 2001 Form 10-K and Q3 2001 Form 10-Q a $100 million signing bonus it received for entering into a railroad shipping contract; and improperly accounting for two types of derivatives contracts - a Canadian dollar mirror hedge strategy and normal purchase normal sale arrangements of commodities - in its 2004 Form10-K. The complaint also alleges that GM maintained inadequate internal controls in these areas and maintained inaccurate books and records in connection with these transactions., GM simultaneously settled the charges, without admitting or denying the allegations, by consenting to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it from violating Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder.

The Commissions complaint alleges that from at least 1999 through mid-2003, contrary to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, Cablevision recognized certain costs as current expenses when, in fact, the expenses should not have been recognized in those periods. These improper prepays, as the practice was referred to, occurred because employees prepared and submitted inaccurate invoices and other documents in order to accrue expenses earlier than when they in fact should have been accrued. These improperly recognized expenses were reflected in Cablevisions books, records and accounts and caused Cablevision to overstate expenses in earlier fiscal periods and understate expenses in later periods. As a result, Cablevisions reports to the public and the Commission for the period 1999 through mid-2003 were inaccurate and caused Cablevision to restate its financial statements filed with the Commission for the period 2000 through the first nine months of 2003., The Commissions complaint alleges that McEnroe, OLoughlin and von Ruden, while serving as officers and managers of significant business units of Cablevision, directed or were aware of improper prepays and signed inaccurate payment authorization forms that caused improper prepays, and that they thereby violated Section 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, McEnroe, OLoughlin and von Ruden consented to final judgments ordering them to pay civil penalties of $30,000, $15,000, and $15,000, respectively., In a related settled cease-and-desist proceeding against them, and also without admitting or denying the Commissions factual findings in its Order Instituting Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making Findings and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist Order, McEnroe, OLoughlin and von Ruden each also consented to an administrative order to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Exchange Act Section 13(b)(5) and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder., Separately, the Commission today announced that it instituted settled cease-and-desist proceedings against Cablevision for improper expense recognition.

On December 18, 2008, Judge Tarnow entered final judgment against Cucuz that imposed a $10,000 civil penalty and enjoined him from future violations of the applicable antifraud provision of the Securities Act of 1933., Previously, on August 20, 2008, a jury found that Shovers violated: (i) the antifraud provisions of both the Securities Act (Section 17(a)(3)) and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder); (ii) the internal controls and books and records provisions of the Exchange Act (Section 13(b)(5) and Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1); and (iii) the lying-to-auditor provision of the Exchange Act (Rule 13b2-2).

That same day, the District Court granted the Commissions request for a temporary restraining order, asset freeze, and other relief. The defendant consented to the emergency relief requested by the Commission., The Commissions filing alleges that, from early 2007 through the present, while working at an insurance and financial services agency in Providence and acting as an investment adviser, Rennie defrauded numerous clients in Massachusetts and New Hampshire of at least $2 million. According to the Commissions complaint, Rennie told his clients that their money would be invested in risk-free federal housing certificates that paid up to 12% per year, tax free, and were offered by a real estate investment company based in Boston. In fact, however, the complaint alleges that the investments were completely fictitious and that Rennie had no relationship with the real estate investment company whose name he used. According to the Commissions filings, Rennie defrauded clients who were elderly, including an 89 year old man. The filings allege that Rennie induced some clients to cash out their investments in annuities, incurring substantial surrender charges, in order to invest in his fraudulent program. According to the complaint, Rennie used investor proceeds to pay personal expenses, including a gym membership and liquor, grocery, shoe and department store purchases, and withdrew thousands of dollars in cash from the account where investor funds were sent., In addition to restraining the defendants from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933; Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the District Courts order, entered by the Honorable Douglas P.

On March 28, 2007, the Commission charged Mintz and Rogers with, among other things, participating in a fraudulent scheme not to disclose Enrons related-party transactions with partnerships controlled by its Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Fastow, and compensation Fastow had received through those transactions. As part of the alleged scheme, Rogers further failed to disclose Enrons related-party transactions involving insider stock sales by its Chairman, Kenneth Lay., The final judgments permanently enjoin Mintz and Rogers from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Sections 10(b) and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Rules 10b-5 and 14a-9 thereunder, as well as from aiding and abetting violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder.

In addition, Rogers is permanently enjoined from aiding and abetting violations of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 16a-2 and 16a-3 thereunder., The final judgments also order Mintz and Rogers each to pay $1 in disgorgement and a $25,000 civil money penalty. These amounts, totaling $50,002, will be deposited into the Court Registry Investment System for distribution to injured Enron investors under the Fair Fund provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002., Mintz and Rogers further consented to the entry of an Administrative Order, pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3)(i) of the Commissions Rules of Practice, suspending each attorney from appearing or practicing before the Commission for a period of two years., In settlement of this action, Mintz and Rogers neither admitted nor denied the allegations of the Commissions complaint. Among other things, the complaint alleged the following: In 1999, Enron sold an interest in a troubled power project in Cuiaba, Brazil to a related party called LJM1, a partnership controlled by Fastow, to deconsolidate the project and recognize related earnings. Under accounting rules, deconsolidation and earnings recognition were inappropriate because Enron did not transfer the risks and rewards of ownership in light of a secret side agreement promising that LJM1 would not lose money on Cuiaba. Satisfying the side agreement, Mintz helped Enron repurchase Cuiaba from LJM1 in 2001. Mintz then delayed signing and closing of the Cuiaba buyback in an effort to avoid reporting related-party transactions in Enrons 2000 Proxy Statement and 2001 Second Quarter Form 10-Q. Moreover, Mintz and Rogers failed to disclose in Enrons 2000 Proxy Statement millions of dollars Fastow received through related-party transactions between LJM and Enron. Rogers further failed to disclose in Enrons 2000 Proxy Statement at least $16 million in insider stock sales by Chairman Kenneth Lay to repay his Enron line of credit during 2000, and aided and abetted Lays failure to disclose in SEC Form 4 filings an additional $70 million in insider stock sales by Lay during 2001., See Rule 102(e) Orders suspending <a href=/litigation/admin/2009/34-59296.pdf>Mintz</a> and <a href=/litigation/admin/2009/34-59297.pdf>Rogers</a>., For more information, see Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20058.htm>20058</a> (March 28, 2007),  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr20866.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The Complaint alleged that Luckett took thousands of dollars from at least one Transnational bank account into which he had deposited investor funds and used the money to pay, among other things, rent on a luxury condominium in Boston and the lease on a Toyota automobile.

Diller Stone earlier agreed to a partial settlement of the Commissions charges in which, without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, she consented to imposition of an injunction permanently enjoining her from violating the antifraud, registration, and other provisions of the federal securities laws. , This judgment follows the Courts entry of a default judgment on November 25, 2008 against Diller Stones husband, Jeffery Steven Stone, a convicted felon, in which the Court found that Stone had violated the antifraud, registration, and other provisions of the federal securities laws.

They then hired stock promoters to hype the stock in a spam email campaign that falsely portrayed WebSky — a start-up company with virtually no revenues or profits — as having a successful joint venture in Argentina that would result in over $40 million in annual revenues. After artificially inflating WebSkys stock price, Stone and Diller Stone dumped their shares into the unsuspecting market at a profit.

On January 27, 2009, the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alabama entered judgment against defendant Milton J. Vaughn, after granting the Commissions motion for summary judgment, requiring him to pay over $3.3 million in disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and civil penalties.  The Court also entered a default judgment the same day against defendant Armtrust requiring that it pay over $2.4 million in disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In addition, on November 3, 2008, the Court entered a judgment by consent against the estate of defendant Frank R. Johnson, who passed away in 2006.  The judgment against Johnsons estate holds it liable for disgorgement of over $1.5 million of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, but waives payment of all except $31,855, which represents the only assets remaining in the estate.  Finally, also on November 3, 2008, the Court granted the Commissions motion to dismiss the charges against a fourth defendant, Carlos F. Alfaro.  The Courts recent actions conclude the Commissions case against all defendants in this case., According to the Commissions Complaint, filed on December 16, 2002, from at least 1999 through 2000, Vaughn and Johnson, operating through Armtrust, an offshore entity they created, defrauded several hundred investors by luring them into participating in a fraudulent Prime Bank trading scheme that sold interests in fictitious, high yield offshore trading programs.  The Commissions Complaint alleges that Armtrust purported to offer two things: (1) Arecovery services@ in which Armtrust would attempt to recover lost or stolen funds for people who had invested in other Prime Bank trading programs, and (2) investments in Armtrust=s own supposed high yield, offshore trading programs.  The Complaint alleges that Armtrust=s strategy was to lure victims of prior Prime Bank schemes by giving them hope of recouping the funds they lost in past scams and, then, induce them into investing in Armtrust=s own scheme.  According to the Complaint, Armtrust falsely led investors to believe they could earn between eight and 15 times their original investment in a matter of months and also guaranteed that the investors= principal was Afully secured and never at risk.  The Complaint alleged, however, that Armtrust=s trading programs never really existed, and when investors attempted to recoup their investments, Armtrust refused to provide the purported profits., The Courts judgments provide that:, Armtrust is:  permanently enjoined from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act); ordered to pay a civil monetary penalty of $300,000; and ordered to pay disgorgement of $1,210,000 in ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $960,150.78., Vaughn is:  permanently enjoined from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act; ordered to pay a civil monetary penalty of $1,210,000; and ordered to pay disgorgement of $1,210,000 in ill-gotten gains plus $960,150.78 in prejudgment interest., The Estate of Frank R. Johnson is held liable for disgorgement of $900,000 in ill-gotten gains plus $657,786 in prejudgment interest, except that payment of all of this amount except for $31,855 is waived due to a demonstrated inability to pay., In addition to the Commissions charges, the Alabama Securities Commission brought related criminal charges against Vaughn, Johnson, and Alfaro in December 2004 and January 2005.

The High Court of Justice in London had previously issued the order freezing assets held in the United Kingdom by Manterfield on May 16, 2008. Manterfield is a defendant in a pending Commission enforcement action filed in April 2007 in the United States in which the Commission obtained emergency relief, including an asset freeze, against Manterfield and others for their roles in an alleged hedge fund fraud. Among other things, the Commission alleged that Manterfield misappropriated millions of dollars from hedge fund investors., On February 29, 2008, the Commission filed a limited notice application with the High Court of Justice, Queens Bench Division seeking an emergency order freezing approximately $1 million in assets held by Manterfield in the United Kingdom. The Commission filed the application after learning that a separate freeze order previously obtained by British authorities against Manterfields assets might be lifted. After a hearing on the Commissions application on February 29, 2008, the High Court of Justice issued an order freezing the assets until March 6, 2008. Manterfield consented to continue the freeze until the court held an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the freeze should be extended. An evidentiary hearing was held in the High Court of Justice on April 30, 2008 and May 1, 2008. On May 16, 2008, the High Court of Justice issued an order continuing the freeze of Manterfields assets until the resolution of the Commissions pending enforcement action in the United States. Manterfield appealed the order to the Supreme Court of Judicature Court of Appeal. On November 26, 2008, the Court of Appeal held a hearing and, on January 28, 2009, the three-judge panel unanimously dismissed Manterfields appeal., The Commission filed its U.S. enforcement action on April 12, 2007 in the U.S. District Court in Massachusetts against Manterfield, Evan Andersen, of Boston, Massachusetts, and Lydia Capital, LLC, a registered investment adviser based in Boston, Massachusetts. On April 12, 2007, the U.S. District Court issued a temporary restraining order that, among other things, froze the three defendants assets. On May 3, 2007, following a hearing before the Court on May 2, 2007, the Court issued a consented-to preliminary injunction and ordered a continuation of an asset freeze of the defendants assets. Andersen has settled the Commissions action against him, and the action is still pending against Manterfield and Lydia., The Commissions Amended Complaint alleges that, between June 2006 and April 2007, Manterfield and Andersen, acting through Lydia, engaged in a scheme to defraud more than 60 investors, who invested approximately $34 million in Lydia Capital Alternative Investment Fund LP, a hedge fund managed by Lydia. The Amended Complaint alleges that defendants told investors that they intended to use the Funds assets to acquire a portfolio of life insurance polices in the life settlement market. According to the Amended Complaint, Manterfield, Andersen, and Lydia made a series of material misrepresentations and omissions, including: (1) materially overstating, and in some instances completely fabricating the Funds performance; (2) inventing business partners, offices, and investors in an attempt to legitimatize the firm and concealing the truth as to why key vendors and banks ceased relationships with the defendants; (3) lying about Manterfields significant criminal history, and failing to disclose a February 2007 criminal asset freeze against Manterfield in England; (4) lying about how the Fund planned to address certain material risks and failing to disclose others; and (5) misstating the nature of the Funds assets and its investment process.

Gerard E. Lynch of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York issued an opinion and order that, among other things, held defendant James N. Stanard liable for securities fraud in the Commissions civil enforcement action against him. Stanard is the former chief executive officer of reinsurer RenaissanceRe Holdings Ltd. (RenRe). The court also held Stanard liable for making false or misleading statements to auditors, providing false officer certifications, and violating and aiding and abetting violations of reporting, books-and-records, and internal controls provisions of the securities laws., The Commission charged Stanard and the other defendants with fraud in connection with a sham transaction whose purpose and effect was to fraudulently defer more than $26 million of RenRes earnings from 2001 to later periods. With Stanards knowledge, RenRe fraudulently accounted for the sham transaction as reinsurance, when in fact, as Stanard knew, the transaction transferred no risk and could not properly be accounted for as reinsurance. As a result of RenRes fraudulent accounting treatment, RenRe materially understated income in 2001 and materially overstated income in 2002., In the courts January 27, 2009 opinion and order, Judge Lynch ruled in favor of the Commission on all of its claims, finding that Stanard wanted to engage in a transaction that would have a particular balance sheet effect, without economic reality; that he knew the transaction was being structured in a way  that would obscure its significance from the auditors; that he knew the facts, and he knew the [applicable accounting] rule, and he knew that the facts did not square with the rule; and that [a]ccordingly, he acted with knowledge that RenRes earnings would be falsely stated. The court further found that Stanard damaged his credibility by claiming repeatedly at trial that this was intended as a reinsurance transaction, when in fact it was intended only to have an accounting effect, and not to constitute true insurance against risk., The court found that Stanard violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 and that Stanard aided and abetted violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13. The court permanently enjoined Stanard from violating or aiding and abetting violations of all these provisions of the securities laws and imposed a civil penalty of $100,000 but denied the Commissions request for an officer and director bar.

The final judgment against Morano, of Pennington, New Jersey, permanently enjoins Morano from violating the antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a $55,000 civil penalty. More recently, on January 15, 2009, the Court determined not to enter an order barring Morano from serving as an officer or director of a publicly traded company., The Commissions complaint, filed on April 26, 2006, alleged that from at least late 2001 through early 2003, Morano and other defendants engaged in a fraudulent scheme to inflate revenue and misrepresent other important financial metrics so as to deceive investors as to the companys true financial condition. According to the complaint, the scheme involved the improper recognition of a series of sales transactions that resulted in Lumenis publication of materially false and misleading financial statements in six consecutive financial reporting periods, starting with those for the year ended December 31, 2001. The complaint alleged that Morano allowed Lumenis to recognize revenue and profits from a number of the improper transactions while knowingly or recklessly disregarding the various conditions that should have precluded recognition., The final judgment enjoined Morano from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder, and from aiding and abetting future violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder. The final judgment also imposed a civil penalty against Morano in the amount of $55,000. Morano consented to the entry of the final judgment without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint. In addition, on September 29, 2008, the Commission issued an Order suspending Morano from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant for five years based on the Courts entry of an order enjoining Morano from violating federal securities laws., Morano was the last remaining defendant in this matter, and the settlement with him concludes the Commissions case.

(Forest), Chaim Justman (Justman), William J. Reilly (Reilly), and Pinchus Gold (Gold) defrauded investors, and reaped approximately $800,000 in unlawful profits by fraudulently procuring unlegended, purportedly free-trading shares of Forest stock, and then selling these shares to the investing public after Forests false and misleading material misrepresentations and omissions about its business operations artificially increased demand for that stock., According to the Complaint, Forest is and was a public shell company that at all relevant times had no income or assets.  From June through October 2006, Reilly, Justman and Gold acted together to make material misrepresentations to Forests transfer agent that provided false justification for the transfer agent to issue millions of restricted shares to Justman, Reilly, Gold, their nominees and others without the required restrictive legend.  Justman, Reilly, Gold and their nominees were thus free to, and did, place these unlegended shares in brokerage accounts they controlled, and sold many of these shares in the open market, falsely holding them out to the public as free-trading shares, when in fact the shares were restricted stock.  A registration statement was never in effect for these transactions in Forests stock, The Complaint further alleges that Justman, Reilly and Gold sold more than a million shares of the improperly  unlegended shares to the investing public, after Forest, Justman, and Reilly began issuing a series of false statements to the investing public regarding Forests assets and commercial prospects.  For example, Forest, through Justman and Reilly, misrepresented in a filing with the Commission and in press releases that Forest, based on a share exchange agreement that it had purportedly entered into with a company called Opus Management Group, Ltd., held valuable timber properties in Central and South America.  These statements were false because Forest had not entered into any signed agreement with Opus, and because Opus had not direct or indirect ownership of timber properties., The Commissions complaint charges Forest, Justman, Reilly, and Gold with violations of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. §§ 77e(a) and 77e(c), and with violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. § 77j(b), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr20878.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The SEC alleges that, in fact, investors paid commissions exceeding 60 percent of the amount invested, and the fraudulent scheme raised at least $44.2 million from 1,400 investors since March 2007., The SECs complaint alleges that four Chicago residents and their entities have worked in concert with sales agents based in Europe who make fraudulent cold calls to solicit investors.  The SEC charged Chicago residents Stefan H. Benger, Jason B. Meyers, Frank I. Reinschreiber, and Philip T. Powers as well as four entities through which they operated the boiler room scheme: SHB Capital Inc., International Capital Financial Resources LLC, Global Financial Management LLC, and Handler, Thayer &amp; Duggan, LLC.  Handler Thayer is a Chicago law firm that employs Powers., The SEC alleges that the multi-faceted boiler room scheme victimized residents of the United Kingdom, Germany, and other European countries.  According to the SECs complaint, Benger, Meyers, SHB Capital, and International Capital acted as distribution agents for at least eight different U.S. penny stock issuers, agreeing to solicit foreign investors in exchange for commissions that collectively exceed 60 percent of the investor proceeds.  The SEC alleges that Benger, Meyers, SHB Capital, and International Capital, in turn, retained foreign sales agents to solicit investors.  The foreign sales agents worked for boiler room operations and made cold calls to investors utilizing high pressure sales tactics.  The SEC alleges that in connection with these sales, investors were not informed of the exorbitant commissions being collected or were told that no commissions would be charged.  The SEC further alleges that Powers, Reinschreiber and Global Financial provided knowing and substantial assistance to the scheme by acting as escrow agents in exchange for a share of the commissions.  The escrow agents took custody of approximately $44.2 million in investor funds, disbursed nearly $29 million in investor funds as undisclosed commissions and the remainder to the stock issuers.  The SEC also alleges that Handler Thayer acted as an unregistered broker-dealer in connection with its activities as an escrow agent., The SEC filed its emergency action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois alleging that: Benger, Meyers, SHB Capital and International Capital violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; Powers, Reinschreiber and Global Financial aided and abetted violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and violated Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act; and Handler Thayer violated Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act.

Turkcan (Turkcan), the former President of First Bank Mortgage (FBM), defrauded investors by engaging in a scheme to misstate the net income of FBM and its parent First Banks, Inc. from at least 1990 through April 2008., The Commission alleges that Turkcan, a resident of Kirkwood, Missouri, carried out his scheme by secretly obtaining money from third-party brokerage firms through the surreptitious use of repurchase transactions, which are essentially collateralized loans, and improperly disguising the money obtained from those transactions as gains from trading mortgage-backed securities. According to the complaint, Turkcan circumvented First Banks, Inc.s internal controls and concealed his scheme by lying to his staff and his superiors, falsifying and fabricating documents, and providing false and misleading information to First Banks, Inc. and its outside auditor. Specifically, the complaint alleges that Turkcan fabricated trade tickets and confirmations and prepared a handwritten report each month that included fictitious trading gains, which he provided to his staff for entry into FBMs accounting system. The complaint also alleges that Turkcan created a register that included the fictitious trading gains and provided it to First Banks, Inc.s outside auditor in connection with its annual audits of First Bank, Inc.s consolidated financial statements., The Commission further alleges that as a result of Turkcans scheme, First Banks, Inc. incurred an undisclosed obligation of approximately $35 million and materially misstated its net income in filings with the Commission.

The Commission alleges that Prendergast, who has previously been convicted of criminal securities fraud in Colorado and is currently on court-supervised release, purported to raise $2.5 million from investors, several of whom are senior citizens. On February 4, 2009 the Court entered an order granting a temporary restraining order against the defendants, requiring accountings, and freezing the defendants assets derived from investor funds obtained in the fraudulent scheme., According to the Commissions complaint, filed February 4, 2009 in federal district court in Denver, Colorado, the representations to investors had all the hallmarks of a fraudulent prime bank scheme. According to the complaint, Prendergast solicited seniors and induced them to pull equity out of their homes, sell off other investments, and liquidate their retirement accounts in order to invest in the fraudulent scheme. Prendergast allegedly represented to investors that monies invested in Enterprises would be pooled with other investors funds to create a $2.5 million fund, and that the pooled funds would then be invested in WEC, which is run by Smith and Enwia. The complaint alleges Prendergast told investors that the Enterprises investment was a once in a lifetime opportunity, and that the funds wired from Enterprises to WEC would be traded in investment grade securities through international banks. The Commission further alleges that Prendergast represented to investors that the Enterprises investment will generate guaranteed returns of four to 20 percent per month, depending on the amount invested, for a total return of 48 to 240 percent per year from the trades conducted by WEC. Investors in Enterprises were also warned to keep information about the investment strictly confidential since WECs transactions were sensitive in nature.

Edwards &amp; Sons, Inc., whose broker-dealer operations were consolidated into Wachovia on Jan. 1, 2008, misrepresented to customers that ARS were safe, highly liquid investments that were comparable to cash or money market instruments. According to the SECs complaint, Wachovia reinforced the perception of liquidity by routinely purchasing ARS from A.G. Edwards customers between auctions, without telling customers that Wachovias willingness to do so depended upon the continued success of the auctions., The SECs complaint alleges that Wachovia became aware of mounting evidence in late 2007 and early 2008 that put the firm on notice that the risk of auction failures had materially increased. Wachovia, nevertheless, continued to market ARS to its customers as highly liquid investments. On Feb. 14, 2008, Wachovia followed the lead of other broker-dealers and decided to stop supporting auctions. Without broker-dealer support, ARS auctions failed and thousands of Wachovias customers were left holding billions of dollars in illiquid ARS, without any practical means of redeeming, selling or deriving value from them., Without admitting or denying the SECs allegations, Wachovia agreed to be permanently enjoined from violations of Section 15(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the broker-dealer fraud provision, and to comply with a number of undertakings, some of which are set forth below. After Wachovia has completed its obligations under the settlement agreement, the SEC will decide whether to seek a financial penalty., The settlement, which is subject to court approval, provides, among other things, that:, Wachovia Capital Markets LLC, an affiliate of Wachovia, has voluntarily agreed to provide identical remedial relief to Wachovia Capital customers who purchased ARS in Wachovia Capital accounts., The SEC notes the substantial assistance and cooperation from the Missouri Secretary of State, the North American Securities Administrators Association, the Office of the New York Attorney General, and FINRA., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2009/comp20885.pdf>SEC Complaint</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr20885.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Ross Owen Haugen</i>, Civil Action No. 1:09-CV-0129 (ND Ga.)</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) announced today that the Honorable Orinda D. Evans, United States District Judge for the Northern District of Georgia, entered an order permanently enjoining Ross Owen Haugen (Haugen). The order restrained and enjoined Haugen from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Haugen was also ordered to pay disgorgement, pre-judgment interest and a civil penalty in amounts to be resolved upon motion of the Commission at a later date, and directed that for purposes of that motion, the allegations of the Commissions Complaint shall be deemed true. Haugen consented to the entry of the order without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions Complaint., The Complaint, filed on January 16, 2009, alleged fraud against Haugen in connection with sales of securities interests in four offerings identified as Coadum Capital Fund 1, LLC (Coadum 1), Coadum Capital Fund II, LP (Coadum II), Coadum Capital Fund III, LP (Coadum III) and Mansell Acquisition Company LP (MAC). Approximately $30 million was raised from investors in the four offerings from early 2006 through January 2008. The Complaint alleged that Haugen served as vice president of sales and marketing for Coadum Advisors, Inc. (Coadum), and conducted the offerings along with Mansell Capital Partners III, LLC (Mansell). The Complaint alleged that Haugen directly solicited and sold more than 50% of the Coadum securities in the offerings. The private placement memoranda for the four offerings (PPMs), all of which made similar representations, described an investment objective involving risk-controlled strategies consisting of purchasing AA or better rated securities at one price, and simultaneously selling the securities at a higher price, generating a profit on the price difference, which Coadum and Mansell referred to as commercial trading programs. Coadum and Mansell invested the majority of the funds through a Malta based investment platform which in turn invested the funds in related entities which never began operation or provided any returns. Further, Coadum and Mansell falsely represented in monthly account statements to investors that the investors had been earning approximately four percent per month and that all or most of the investors principal was in escrow. Haugen told investors, falsely, that their investment principal was risk free, insured and never left the escrow account or was otherwise guaranteed against loss. In fact, Haugen knew that investors funds were being invested in off-shore trading programs. Although the PPMs represented that no commissions would be paid on the investments, and that the promoters would be compensated based on a percentage of earnings, Haugen received substantial commissions from investor funds prior to earnings on those funds, which never occurred., The Haugen matter is a companion case to <i>SEC v.

Graham II (“Graham”) and FLOWorks, Inc. (“FLOWorks”) and relief defendant Linworth LLC (“Linworth”) alleging fraud in connection with the securities of Stanford Square Investors LLC (“SSI”).  Graham, a resident of Las Vegas, Nevada, controls FLOWorks and Linworth.  FLOWorks is the manager of SSI, a Nevada limited liability company with approximately 100 investors., The Commission’s complaint alleges that in June 2005, SSI sold its primary asset, a commercial office building in Palo Alto, California.  Although SSI’s operating agreement provided that the company would terminate upon the sale of substantially all of its assets, in July 2005 Graham and FLOWorks, without the approval of the SSI members, caused SSI to purchase an interest in a commercial property in Eugene, Oregon.  According to the complaint, Graham’s communications to the SSI investors after the purchase misstated and omitted important information about the nature and tax-free status of the Eugene property transaction, the value of the property, liabilities to be assumed by SSI, and Graham’s personal interest in the property’s proposed tenant.  The Commission contends that these misstatements and omissions were made in connection with an offer by the purported seller of the Eugene property to purchase the membership interest of any investor that did not wish to participate in the new property venture.  With respect to those members that elected to sell, the purported buyer has failed to complete these transactions.  The Commission asserts that the actions of Graham and FLOWorks have resulted in substantial harm to SSI investors, including millions of dollars in unreported taxable gains, as well as undisclosed liabilities secured by liens on the Eugene property amounting to several million dollars.  The Commission contends that Graham misled the SSI investors in order to continue to take substantial fees from SSI and to further his personal financial interests in the new venture. , The Commission’s complaint alleges that Graham and FLOWorks violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Madoff consented to the partial judgment without admitting or denying the allegations of the SECs complaint, filed on December 11, 2008.  If the partial judgment is entered by the Court, the permanent injunction will continue to restrain Madoff from violating certain antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. Also, the proposed partial judgment would continue against Madoff the relief imposed in the December 18, 2008 Order, including the order freezing assets.  The proposed partial judgment would leave the issues of the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest and civil penalty to be imposed against Madoff to be decided at a later time.  For purposes of determining Madoffs obligation to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest and/or a civil penalty, the proposed partial judgment deems the facts of the complaint are established and cannot be contested by Madoff., The SECs complaint, filed on December 11, 2008, in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that Madoff and Defendant Bernard L.

Madoff told these employees that he was finished, that he had absolutely nothing, that its all just one big lie, and that it was basically, a giant Ponzi scheme.

Jolly raised funds by offering and selling Quest securities through Quests website, EarnByLoaning.com. As set forth in the complaint, Jolly claimed to be active in the investment community and financial markets and falsely assured investors that Quest had a reserve fund to ensure that they would be repaid., In reality, the Commission alleges, Jolly invested only about one-third of the investor funds he received, on which he suffered hundreds of thousands of dollars in trading losses. The complaint also alleges that defendants operated a Ponzi scheme and repaid purported profits to investors from funds provided by later investors, not from earnings on Quests investment activities.

Faria is a former officer of MetLife, Inc. and its insurance company subsidiary New England Financial (NEF).  The Commissions action charged that Faria and two other defendants engaged in a scheme to improperly hide NEF expenses that led directly to the publication of materially false financial statements by MetLife and NEF.  Faria, who was the former president of the NEF distribution channel and a senior vice president of MetLife, settled the matter without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations.  He consented to the entry of a final judgment enjoining him from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering him to pay a total of over $97,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest and civil penalties, and barring him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years., The Commissions complaint, filed on April 13, 2006, alleges that over a period of years, Faria and two other defendants engaged in a scheme to hide certain NEF expenses in an effort to make NEF appear more efficient than it actually was.  The complaint alleges that defendants hid certain non-commission expenses by reclassifying them as commission expenses in NEFs internal books and records.  The complaint alleged that Faria was aware of and authorized the improper reclassifications.  All told, the complaint alleges that the scheme resulted in the improper reclassification of over $100 million in NEF expenses, the direct result of which was the publication of materially false overstatements of MetLife and NEF net income in financial statements filed with the Commission from 2000 to 2003., The complaint alleged that through his fraudulent conduct, Faria violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder, and Section 34(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (Investment Company Act), as well as aided and abetted uncharged MetLife violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13 thereunder.

Those provisions are part of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act books and records and internal controls provisions. The Commissions complaint alleges that ITTs violations of the provisions resulted from payments to Chinese government officials by ITTs wholly-owned Chinese subsidiary, Nanjing Goulds Pumps Ltd. (NGP). From 2001 through 2005, NGPs illicit payments to employees of numerous Chinese state-owned entities (SOEs) totaled approximately $200,000. The customers associated with those illicit payments generated over $4 million in sales to NGP, from which ITT realized improper profits of more than $1 million., According to the Commissions Complaint:, ITTs subsidiary, NGP, is based in Nanjing, China and is part of ITTs Fluid Technology division. NGP distributes a variety of water pump products that are sold to power plants, building developers, and general contractors throughout China. During the years 2001 through 2005, NGP directly through certain employees, or indirectly through third-party agents, made illicit payments to SOEs to influence the purchase of NGP water pumps for large infrastructure projects in China. The projects were developed, constructed, and owned by SOEs (project SOEs). NGP made the payments to employees of Design Institutes, some of which were SOEs, that assisted in the design of the projects to ensure that the Design Institutes recommended NGP water pumps to the project SOEs. In at least one instance, a third-party agent made a payment directly to employees of a project SOE. The payments made by NGP were disguised as increased commissions in NGPs books and records. The improper NGP entries were consolidated and included in ITTs financial statements contained in its filings with the Commission for the companys fiscal years 2001 through 2005., ITT did not make or keep books, records, and accounts which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflected the illicit payments by NGP employees and the related disposition of its assets. ITT also failed to devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that: (i) transactions were executed in accordance with managements general or specific authorization; (ii) transactions were recorded as necessary to maintain accountability for its assets; and (iii) access to its assets was permitted only in accordance with managements general or specific authorization., ITT, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of Section 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of the Exchange Act; ordering the company to pay disgorgement of $1,041,112, together with prejudgment interest thereon of $387,538.11; and imposing a $250,000 civil penalty, pursuant to Section 21(d)(3) of the Exchange Act.

The SEC also charged that KBR and Halliburton, KBRs former parent company, engaged in books and records violations and internal controls violations related to the bribery., KBR and Halliburton have agreed to pay $177 million in disgorgement to settle the SECs charges. Kellogg Brown &amp; Root LLC has agreed to pay a $402 million fine to settle parallel criminal charges brought today by the U.S. Department of Justice. The sanctions represent the largest combined settlement ever paid by U.S. companies since the FCPAs inception., Kellogg Brown &amp; Root LLCs predecessor entities (Kellogg, Brown &amp; Root, Inc. and The M.W. Kellogg Company) were members of a four-company joint venture that won the construction contracts worth more than $6 billion. In September 1998, Halliburton acquired Dresser Industries, Inc., the parent company of The M.W. Kellogg Company., The SEC alleges that beginning as early as 1994, members of the joint venture determined that it was necessary to pay bribes to officials within the Nigerian government in order to obtain the construction contracts. The former CEO of the predecessor entities, Albert Jack Stanley, and others involved in the joint venture met with high-ranking Nigerian government officials and their representatives on at least four occasions to arrange the bribe payments. To conceal the illicit payments, the joint venture entered into sham contracts with two agents, one based in the United Kingdom and one based in Japan, to funnel money to Nigerian officials., The SECs complaint alleges that the internal controls of Halliburton, the parent company of the KBR predecessor entities from 1998 to 2006, failed to detect or prevent the bribery, and that Halliburton records were falsified as a result of the bribery scheme. In September 2008, Stanley pleaded guilty to bribery and related charges and entered into a settlement with the SEC., The SEC alleges that officials of the joint venture formed a cultural committee to decide how to carry out the bribery scheme. The committee decided to use the United Kingdom agent to make payments to high-ranking Nigerian officials and to use the Japanese agent to make payments to lower-ranking Nigerian officials. As the joint venture was paid for work on the construction project, the joint venture in turn made payments to the Japanese agent and to the Swiss and Monaco bank accounts of the United Kingdom agent. The total payments to the two agents exceeded $180 million. After receiving the money, the United Kingdom agent made substantial payments to accounts controlled by Nigerian government officials, and beginning in 2002 paid $5 million in cash to a Nigerian political party., The SECs complaint further alleges that, after the Dresser acquisition, Halliburton failed to devise and maintain adequate internal controls to govern the use of foreign sales agents and failed to maintain and enforce the internal controls it had. Halliburtons due diligence investigation of the United Kingdom agent failed to detect or prevent the bribery scheme. Halliburton conducted no due diligence on the Japanese agent. As a result of the scheme, numerous Halliburton records contained false information relating to the payments to the agents., Without admitting or denying the SECs allegations, KBR and Halliburton have consented to the entry of a court order that (i) permanently enjoins KBR from violating the anti-bribery and records falsification provisions in Sections 30A, 13(b)(5) and Rule 13b2-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and from aiding and abetting violations of the record-keeping and internal control provisions in Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act; (ii) permanently enjoins Halliburton from violating the record-keeping and internal control provisions of the Exchange Act; (iii) orders the companies to disgorge $177 million in ill-gotten profits derived from the scheme; (iv) imposes an independent monitor for KBR for a period of three years to review its FCPA compliance program, and (v) imposes an independent consultant for Halliburton to review its policies and procedures as they relate to compliance with the FCPA. The proposed settlements are subject to the courts approval., In the related criminal proceeding announced today, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a criminal action against Kellogg Brown &amp; Root LLC, charging one count of conspiring to violate the FCPA and four counts of violating the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA. Kellogg Brown &amp; Root LLC has pled guilty to each of these counts. Under its plea agreement, Kellogg Brown &amp; Root LLC is required to pay a criminal fine of $402 million and to retain a monitor to review and evaluate KBRs policies and procedures as they relate to compliance with the FCPA., The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the U.S. Department of Justice, Fraud Section; the Federal Bureau of Investigation; and foreign authorities in Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas.

In addition, both Meridian and Dike were permanently enjoined from future violations of Section 302(b) of Regulation S-T, and Dike was further permanently enjoined from future violations of Exchange Rule 13a-14.  Dike was also ordered to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $25,000, and is prohibited for five years from the date of the judgment from acting as an officer or director of a public company.  Nguyen was ordered to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $15,000 and, in a separate administrative proceeding, was suspended from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant, with the right to request reinstatement after three years., Meridian, which was located in Culver City, California, owned interests in companies that engage in e-commerce in the medical industry, and provided management services to those companies.  The Commissions complaint, filed on September 28, 2007, alleged that the financial statements filed with Meridians 2004 second and third quarter reports caused Meridian to materially overstate it assets and represent it had significant gains, when, in fact, it should have reported losses.  Meridian also backdated officer certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Commission alleged., The Commissions complaint alleged that during the second and third quarters of its 2004 fiscal year, Meridian improperly recognized a $30 million default judgment and interest as assets and income when it had no reasonable basis to believe the judgment was collectible.  As a result, Meridian turned quarterly losses of seven cents per share into earnings of $2.12 per share.  Similarly, Meridian recognized additional interest on the default judgment during the third quarter of 2004. The complaint alleged that this improper recognition again turned quarterly losses into quarterly gains., In addition to Meridian, the complaint alleged that Dike, Meridians chairman and chief executive officer, and Nguyen, a CPA, and Meridians former principal financial officer and interim chief financial officer,  prepared Meridians misleading financial statements by booking the $30 million default judgment when neither had any reasonable basis to believe the judgment was collectible.  The complaint further alleged that when Dike filed Meridians second and third quarter reports, he included Nguyens name on the Sarbanes-Oxley Act certifications filed with the reports even though he knew Nguyen had not signed them.  While Nguyen is alleged to have signed the certifications included with Meridians second quarter report after it had been filed, she never signed the certifications included with Meridians third quarter report.  Meridian also provided the Commission staff with backdated certifications filed with its 2004 annual report., On, October 30, 2009, Meridian filed with the Commission a certification and notice of termination of its registration under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act., See also:  <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20318.htm>LR-20318</a> (October 1, 2007); SEA Release 34-59317 (January 29, 2009); AAER 2928 (January 29, 2009).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr20898.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

In order to do so, Georgiou used many nominee accounts that he either directly or indirectly controlled at offshore broker-dealers and banks, and used a variety of manipulative techniques, including matched orders and wash sales. Ultimately, Georgiou realized at least $20.9 million in ill-gotten gains from his manipulation schemes., In addition to the enforcement action, the Commission today entered an order suspending trading in the securities of the four manipulated stocks for a ten day period commencing 9:30 a.m. February 12, 2009. The U. S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania today separately announced criminal charges against Georgiou involving the same conduct., The Commissions complaint alleges that Avicena Group is headquartered in Palo Alto, California, and that the other three companies are headquartered in Canada. Each of the manipulation schemes followed a similar pattern. Georgiou controlled all or a large percentage of the unrestricted, publicly-traded stock of each company. He had influence with management, access to confidential shareholder lists, and was able to coordinate the release of company news with his illegal trading. In recorded conversations and through his own e-mails, Georgiou admitted his intent to manipulate each of the stocks, and gave directions to his nominees., The complaint further alleges that Georgiou used many nominee accounts at offshore broker-dealers in Canada, the Bahamas, Turks and Caicos, and other locations. Georgiou asserted direct control over some accounts by issuing trading and wiring instructions directly to broker-dealers, and indirect control over others by communicating trading instructions to nominees who, in turn, executed Georgious trading instructions. Through these accounts, Georgiou used a variety of manipulative techniques in each scheme, including controlling the trading volume through promises of profits to nominees, executing or directing matched orders, wash sales, or other prearranged trades, marking-the-close, and paying illegal kickbacks in exchange for purchases., The complaint alleges that Georgious manipulation of Hydrogen Hybrid Technologies was in the nature of a pump and dump scheme, in which Georgiou arranged and paid for the publication of a promotional mailer sent to seven million addresses across the U.S. Georgiou coordinated manipulative trading with the publication of the mailer, and ultimately received more than $3.8 million when he dumped his shares into the artificially inflated market. The complaint also alleges that part of Georgious manipulation of Northern Ethanol stock involved the payment of an illegal kickback to a person Georgiou believed was a corrupt registered representative, but who was in reality an undercover FBI agent., The complaint alleges that Georgiou also defrauded two offshore broker-dealers by obtaining margin loans, using the manipulated stocks as collateral, that further funded his manipulations and allowed him to withdraw cash that he wired to offshore bank accounts. Georgious total ill-gotten gains from his stock purchases in, and cash withdrawals from, the fraudulently obtained margin accounts was at least $17.1 million. , The complaint alleges violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, together with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and a penny stock bar against Georgiou., The Commission acknowledges and appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in connection with this matter., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2009/comp20899.pdf>SEC Complaint</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr20899.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The court’s order also extends to SIB chief financial officer James Davis, and Laura Pendergest-Holt, chief investment officer of Stanford Financial Group.  The temporary restraining order restrains the defendants from violating certain antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, as well as provisions of the Investment Company and Investment Adviser Acts.  Also, Judge O’Connor froze all assets of the defendants until further notice, ordered that assets outside the U.S. be returned to the court’s jurisdiction, appointed a receiver to marshal the defendants’ assets and granted other relief. , The SECs complaint, filed in federal court in Dallas, alleges that the defendants have committed an $8 billion fraud and violated or aided and abetted violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Advisers Act of 1940, and Section 7(d) of the Investment Company Act of 1940.  The complaint alleges that acting through a network of SGC financial advisers, SIB has sold approximately $8 billion of so-called “certificates of deposit” to investors by promising improbable and unsubstantiated high interest rates, supposedly earned through its unique investment strategy, which has purportedly allowed the bank to achieve double-digit returns on its investments over the past 15 years.  According to the Complaint, the defendants have misrepresented to CD purchasers that their deposits are safe, falsely claiming that the bank re-invests client funds primarily in “liquid” financial instruments (the “portfolio”); monitors the portfolio through a team of 20-plus analysts; and is subject to yearly audits by Antiguan regulators.  Recently, as the market absorbed the news of Bernard Madoff’s massive Ponzi scheme, SIB attempted to calm its own investors by falsely claiming the bank has no “direct or indirect” exposure to the Madoff scheme.  , The Commission continues to seek, among other things, a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus pre-judgment interest, and civil money penalties., The Commission acknowledges the assistance and cooperation of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in connection with this matter., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2009/comp20901.pdf>SEC Complaint</a><br/><img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2009/stanford-first-amended-022709.pdf>SEC First Amended Complaint in this matter</a><br/><img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr20901-memo.pdf>Memorandum of Law</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr20901.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The complaint alleges that the defendants made false and misleading disclosures about how RIM priced and accounted for options, and that the illicit backdating provided the executives and other employees with millions of dollars in undisclosed compensation. In addition, according to the complaint, the backdating violated the terms of RIMs stock option plan and a listing requirement of the Toronto Stock Exchange. RIMs stock is listed on both the NASDAQ Stock Market and the Toronto Stock Exchange., As alleged in the complaint, Kavelman, Loberto, Balsillie and Lazaridis backdated option agreements and offer letters, which concealed the fact that the options were granted in-the-money. The complaint also alleges that Kavelman and Loberto took steps to hide the backdating from regulators, RIMs independent auditor and outside lawyer. The complaint further alleges that after all four executives were aware of backdating issues that had come to light at other companies, they attended RIMs July 2006 annual shareholder meeting where Kavelman misled investors by denying that RIM was backdating options., The SECs complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, contains the following additional allegations:, From 1998 through 2006, RIM, Kavelman, Loberto, Balsillie and Lazaridis backdated approximately 1,400 stock option grants for a total of nearly seven million shares, including new hire, group, promotional and periodic grants., Balsillie initially ran RIMs stock option program and directed others to backdate his own and other employees options. Kavelman assumed increasing responsibility for the option program and approved backdating many grants. Loberto helped carry out the backdating and selected prior dates with low prices for a number of grants. Lazaridis requested that options for certain new hires and employees be backdated., At times, when RIMs stock price dropped after employees had received options, the four executives re-priced the same options at substantially lower backdated prices., To one new hire, Kavelman expressed a concern about an optics issue with the regulators if the new hires start date did not match the grant date for his options. Nevertheless, Kavelman and Balsillie agreed to backdate the options to the lowest price before the new hires start date., Kavelman and Loberto usually picked low strike prices within reporting periods and in some instances avoided the lowest price so regulators would not detect the backdating. In addition, Kavelman asked a manager not to document improper pricing in e-mails. Kavelman wrote, FYI, it is a major breach of protocol to be discussing (and documenting via email) using option pricing other than that allowable by the Ontario Securities Commission and the SEC in the US., Kavelman and Loberto received numerous documents from RIMs outside lawyer, RIMs auditor, the securities industry and RIMs own finance department explaining the accounting for options and options pricing, but they ignored all of the information and advice they received., The defendants misconduct caused RIM, from fiscal year 1999 to the first quarter of fiscal year 2007: (i) to falsely disclose in its annual and other reports, management information circulars and registration statements that RIMs options were granted at exercise prices equal to the fair market value of RIMs common stock at the date of the grants; and (ii) to file materially false and misleading financial statements that understated RIMs compensation expenses and overstated its quarterly and annual net income or understated its net losses., All defendants have agreed to settle this matter, without admitting or denying the allegations in the SECs complaint, on the following terms:, RIM consented to the entry of an order permanently enjoining it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, and the reporting, books and records and internal controls provisions of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-16. The settlement with RIM takes into account RIMs cooperation during the SECs investigation., Kavelman and Loberto consented to an order permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, the internal controls and books and records provisions of Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1, the misrepresentations to auditors provision of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-2; and from aiding and abetting RIMs violations of the reporting, books and records and internal controls provisions. Kavelman also consented to an order permanently enjoining him from violating the certification provision of Exchange Act Rule 13a-14. Kavelman and Loberto agreed to be barred for a period of five years from serving as officers or directors of any issuer that has a class of securities registered with the SEC or that is required to file reports with the SEC. In addition, Kavelman and Loberto agreed to resolve an anticipated administrative proceeding by consenting to an SEC order prohibiting them from appearing or practicing before the SEC as accountants for five years., Balsillie and Lazaridis consented to the entry of an order permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act, and the internal controls and books and records provisions of Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1; and from aiding and abetting RIMs violations of the reporting, books and records and internal controls provisions., The individual defendants will pay civil penalties in the following amounts: $500,000 for Kavelman; $425,000 for Loberto; $350,000 for Balsillie; and $150,000 for Lazaridis. The individual defendants also agreed to disgorge the in-the-money value of backdated options they had exercised ($132,914.60 for Kavelman, $47,950.56 for Loberto, $334,250 for Balsillie and $328,300 for Lazaridis) plus interest. Their disgorgement will be deemed satisfied by their previous payment of these amounts to RIM., The settlements in the civil injunctive action are subject to the approval of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia., On February 5, 2009, the Ontario Securities Commission brought a related settled action against RIM, Balsillie, Lazaridis, Kavelman, Loberto and certain other directors which included the total payment in Canadian dollars of $76.85 million and other sanctions.

Howling, its former chief financial officer. In a Memorandum Order, the court stated it has considered defendants contentions and concluded they are without merit. Former Biovail chief executive officer Eugene Melnyk is a defendant in the action but did not file a motion to dismiss., The Commissions amended complaint alleges that in October 2003 Melnyk, Crombie, and Howling schemed to deceive investors and analysts by falsely attributing nearly half of Biovails failure to meet its third quarter 2003 earnings guidance to a truck accident involving a shipment of one of Biovails products. In this way they intentionally misstated both the effect of the accident on Biovails third quarter earnings as well as the value of the product involved in the truck accident. The accident, in fact, had no effect on third quarter earnings., The Commissions amended complaint also alleges three accounting schemes that affected reporting periods from 2001 to 2003., Biovail previously resolved these claims against it by consenting to a judgment that, among other things, permanently enjoined it from violating the antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws, imposed a $10 million civil penalty, and ordered it to pay disgorgement of $1. Earlier this month, the Court entered a stipulated judgment against Melnyk on the Commissions claim that he violated stock accumulation disclosure provisions by failing to include in his Schedule 13D filings Biovail shares held by several off-shore trusts that Melnyk controlled. That judgment permanently enjoins Melnyk from future violations of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13d-1 and 13d-2 and imposes a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,001., The litigation remains pending against Crombie, Miszuk, and Howling on the claims alleged against each of them and against Melnyk on the securities fraud claim., For further information, see Litigation Releases No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20506.htm>20506</a> (March 24, 2008) and No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr20880.htm>20880</a> (February 4, 2009).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr20903.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Walters, formerly of Lone Tree, Colorado for operating a Ponzi scheme promising annual returns ranging from 20% to 40%., According to the Complaint, from 2003 through 2006, Walters raised approximately $16.8 million from more than 80 investors under the false pretense that he would invest their funds in day trading in the securities markets.  As set forth in the Complaint, Walters lured investors with the promise of high returns which he falsely claimed he could achieve based on his personal expertise and prior success in day trading.  In reality, the Commission alleges, Walters deposited only a small fraction of investor funds into brokerage accounts, conducted very little trading in these accounts, and sustained heavy losses on the trading he did conduct.  The Commission further alleges that Walters used approximately $11.4 million of investor funds to pay off prior investors in a classic Ponzi scheme pattern, using the rest largely to support his lavish lifestyle, with expensive cars and homes in Colorado and Hawaii., The Commissions Complaint, filed in federal district court for the District of Colorado, charges Walters with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 15(a) and 10(b) of the Securities Exchange of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

UBS agreed to settle the SECs charges by consenting to the issuance of a final judgment that permanently enjoins UBS and orders it to disgorge $200 million., As alleged in the SECs complaint, from at least 1999 through 2008, UBS acted as an unregistered broker-dealer and investment adviser to thousands of U.S. persons and offshore entities with United States citizens as beneficial owners.  UBS had at least 11,000 to 14,000 of such clients and held billions of dollars of assets for them.  The U.S. cross-border business provided UBS with revenues of $120 to $140 million per year., The SEC also alleges that UBS conducted that cross-border business largely through client advisers located primarily in Switzerland, who were not associated with a registered broker-dealer or investment adviser.  These client advisers traveled to the U.S., on average, two to three times per year on trips that generally varied in duration from one to three weeks.  In many instances, the client advisers attended exclusive events such as art shows, yachting events, and sporting events that were often sponsored by UBS, for the purpose of soliciting and communicating with United States cross-border clients.  UBS also used other U.S. jurisdictional means such as telephones, facsimiles, mail and e-mail to provide securities services to its U.S. cross-border clients., The SEC further alleges that UBS was aware that it was required to be registered with the SEC.  UBS took action to conceal its use of U.S. jurisdictional means to provide securities services.  Among other things, client advisers typically traveled to the U.S. with encrypted laptop computers that they used to provide account-related information, to show marketing materials for securities products, and occasionally to communicate orders for securities transactions to UBS in Switzerland.  Client advisers also received training on how to avoid detection by U.S. authorities of their activities in the U.S., As charged in the SECs complaint, as a result of its conduct, UBS violated Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Section 203(a) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  To settle these charges, UBS has consented to the entry of a final judgment that (1) permanently enjoins UBS from further violation of those provisions; (2) orders it to pay $200 million in disgorgement, to be paid together with an additional $180 million in disgorgement that will be paid as part of a settlement of a related criminal investigation; and (3) orders UBS to comply with its undertakings to terminate its U.S. cross-border business and to retain an independent consultant to conduct an examination of UBSs termination of the business., In connection with a related criminal investigation, UBS has entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the Department of Justice pursuant to which UBS will pay an additional $180 million in disgorgement, as well as $400 million in tax-related payments., The SECs investigation is ongoing., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2009/comp20905.pdf>SEC Complaint</a>,  ]"

The Complaint alleges that BCI and Cooper raised $4.4 million from 125 investors since at least September 2007 and specifically targeted members of the Deaf community in the United States and Japan., The Complaint, filed in federal court in Honolulu, Hawaii, alleges that BCI and Cooper represented to the investors that their funds would be invested in the foreign exchange (Forex) markets, that investors would receive returns of up to 25% compounded monthly from such trading, and that their investments were safe.  According to the Complaint, BCI and Cooper actually used only a net $800,000 (cash deposits minus cash withdrawals) of investor funds for Forex trading, and they lost more than $750,000 from their Forex trading.  The Complaint further alleges that BCI and Cooper failed to generate sufficient funds from their Forex trading to pay the promised returns and operated as a Ponzi scheme by paying returns to existing investors from funds contributed by new investors.  The Complaint also alleges that Cooper misappropriated at least $1.4 million in investor funds to pay for a new home and other personal expenses., The Complaint alleges that the defendants have violated the registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

(LISI), a registered broker-dealer, and Bank Leumi USA (BLUSA) (collectively Leumi), and Frank Lu, a former salesperson at Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc. (OPCO), a registered broker-dealer and investment adviser, for engaging in a fraudulent trading scheme. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, except as to jurisdiction, both Machado and Lu have agreed to settle the action on the terms described below., As alleged in the Complaint, from May 2003 through mid-August 2004, Machado and Lu engaged in a scheme to direct Leumis securities order flow to OPCO in exchange for secret gratuities and entertainment that Lu provided to Machado. The Complaint also alleges that as part of the scheme, and in violation of Machados duties to Leumis customers, Machado routinely directed a substantial flow of orders to OPCO for execution at prices that were favorable to OPCO and detrimental to Leumis own customers. The Complaint further alleges that as a result of Machados and Lus conduct, Leumi and its customers were harmed by approximately $1.1 million., According to the allegations in the Complaint, in mid-2003, Machado and Lu agreed that Machado would direct orders to Lu for execution at prices favorable to OPCO, and Lu, in exchange, would provide Machado with frequent and costly gratuities and entertainment. As part of their fraudulent arrangement, the Complaint alleges that Machado and Lu also harmed Leumis customers by unnecessarily using OPCO as a middleman to execute trades with other firms, when Machado could have executed those trades directly with the same firms at prices that were more favorable to Leumis customers. By engaging in this conduct, the Complaint alleges that Machado and Lu ensured that OPCO realized a quick profit on Leumis trading with little or no risk., The SECs Complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges Machado and Lu with having violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5. Further, Lu is charged with aiding and abetting Machados violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Machado is charged with aiding and abetting LISIs violations of Section 17(a)(1) of the Exchange Act and Rule 17a-3 thereunder (broker-dealer books and records provisions)., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, Machado has consented to the entry of a final judgment that (i) permanently enjoins him from committing, or aiding and abetting, future violations of the above-referenced provisions, and (ii) based on Machados financial condition, waives the payment of disgorgement and prejudgment interest and does not impose a civil penalty. As part of his settlement, Machado has also agreed to the issuance of an administrative order that bars him from association with any broker or dealer., Lu has consented to the entry of a final judgment that (i) permanently enjoins him from committing future violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws referenced above, and (ii) based on Lus financial condition, orders him to pay partial disgorgement of $100,000, and does not impose a civil penalty. As part of his settlement, Lu has also agreed to the issuance of an administrative order that bars him from association with any broker, dealer, or investment adviser. <br/>The proposed relief in the settled actions with Machado and Lu is subject to court approval., In related administrative proceedings, LISI and OPCO consented to the issuance of Commission Orders, without admitting or denying the findings in the Orders, except as to jurisdiction. In the LISI Order, the Commission found that from May 2003 to August 2004, LISI failed reasonably to supervise Machado with a view to preventing and detecting Machados violations of the federal securities laws. The Commission further found that Machado frequently improperly changed and falsified trade tickets in an effort to conceal the fraudulent scheme and that, during this period, LISI did not implement reasonable procedures to prevent and detect unauthorized changes to trade tickets by its personnel. The Commission also found that if LISI had implemented reasonable procedures concerning changes to trade tickets, Machados supervisor could have detected Machados falsification of the trade tickets and uncovered Machados fraudulent scheme. Accordingly, the Commission found that LISI had violated Exchange Act Section 17(a) and Rule 17a-3 thereunder because false information was entered into LISIs books and records by Machado. Accordingly, in the Order, the Commission (i) censures LISI, (ii) orders LISI to cease and desist from committing or causing violations of Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 17a-3 thereunder; and (iii) requires LISI to comply with certain undertakings. In determining to accept LISIs offer of settlement, the Commission considered remedial acts promptly undertaken by LISI, including full reimbursement by LISI and BLUSA of their customers losses, totalling approximately $1.2 million, and its cooperation with the Commissions investigation., In the OPCO Order, the Commission found that from May 2003 to August 2004, OPCO failed reasonably to supervise Lu with a view to preventing and detecting Lus violations of the federal securities laws. The Commission found that, during this period, Lu and Machado had conducted their trading and most of their communications by e-mail on the Bloomberg Mail messaging system that was used by OPCO and that several Bloomberg e-mail exchanges between Lu and Machado presented red flags indicating that Machado was directing order flow to Lu, and in turn, Lu was providing secret gratuities to Machado. The Commission also found that because of a deficiency in OPCOs e-mail review procedures, none of Lus Bloomberg e-mails was reviewed by OPCO staff, as required by OPCOs electronic communications policy. The Commission found that, as a result of this deficiency, for over four years, OPCOs computer system did not retrieve from Bloomberg, or load into OPCOs database for supervisory review, the Bloomberg e-mail messages for approximately 370 OPCO employees, including Lu. The Commission further found that if OPCO had monitored Lus Bloomberg e-mail communications, OPCO supervisors could have prevented Lus misconduct or detected it at an earlier time. Accordingly, in the Order, the Commission (i) censures OPCO; (ii) orders OPCO to pay a civil penalty of $850,000; and (iii) requires OPCO to comply with certain undertakings., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2009/comp20909.pdf>SEC Complaint</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr20909.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The Complaint alleged that, among other deceptive practices, when mutual funds succeeded in identifying and attempted to block the defendants trading activity under one customer account or broker identification number, the defendants often simply switched to a different customer account for the same customer or a different broker identification number and continued placing market timing trades., The final judgments imposed permanent injunctions prohibiting Silver and Corbett from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Nicholson.  The SEC alleges that they solicited investors with false claims of an almost unbroken eight-year string of monthly investment successes.  Neither the firm nor its principal is registered with the SEC.  The U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York today announced parallel criminal charges against Nicholson., The SECs complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, alleges that since at least January 2008, Nicholson and Westgate defrauded current and prospective investors in 11 hedge funds they managed by misrepresenting the value of the hedge funds to investors, and soliciting new investors with sales materials that claimed a nearly impossible record of investment success.  According to the SECs complaint, at least one Westgate fund claimed positive returns in 98 of 99 consecutive months., The SEC alleges Nicholson sought to further his fraud by creating a fictitious accounting firm and providing some of his investors with bogus audited financial statements.  Nicholson apparently concocted this imposter firm under the name of an actual accountant while using his own telephone number and drivers license to set up a virtual office., According to the SECs complaint, by late 2008, the funds had sustained such losses that Nicholson and Westgate could no longer honor redemption requests.  They hid the losses from investors with misrepresentations and false sales brochures.  Nicholson further attempted to hide losses in the Westgate fund family by other devices.  He closed one fund that was heavily invested in the bankrupt Lehman Brothers and folded its assets into another Westgate fund.  He issued bad checks to some investors seeking to cash out, and ultimately suspended all investor redemptions due to what he called investors irrational behavior., The SEC alleges that Westgate and Nicholson have violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC is seeking an emergency court order freezing the assets of Nicholson, Westgate, and the hedge funds; preventing the destruction of documents; granting expedited discovery; and requiring Nicholson and Westgate to provide accountings.  Additionally, the SEC seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions, disgorgement, and financial penalties against both defendants., Nicholson was barred from the brokerage industry in 2001 for failing to reply or supplying false information in response to inquiries from the National Association of Securities Dealers (now known as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority)., The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York and the Rockland County, N.Y., District Attorney in this matter., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2009/comp20911.pdf>SEC Complaint</a>,  ]"

Instead, Greenwood and Walsh essentially treated their clients investments as their personal piggy bank to purchase multi-million dollar homes, a horse farm and horses, luxury cars, and rare collectibles such as Steiff teddy bears. The SEC has obtained an emergency court order freezing the assets of Greenwood and Walsh as well as their companies: WG Trading Investors, L.P. (WGTI), which is an unregistered investment vehicle; WG Trading Company, Limited Partnership (WGTC), which is a registered broker-dealer located in Greenwich, Conn.; and Westridge Capital Management, Inc. (Westridge), which is a registered investment adviser located in Santa Barbara, Calif., According to the SECs complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, the SEC alleges that Greenwood and Walsh have been orchestrating the fraudulent investment scheme through their affiliated entities since at least 1996. The SEC alleges that they solicited a number of institutional investors, including educational institutions and public pension and retirement plans, by promising to invest their money in an enhanced equity index strategy that involves purchasing and selling equity index futures and engaging in equity index arbitrage trading. However, Greenwood and Walsh have been misappropriating hundreds of millions of dollars of investor funds for their personal use instead of investing the money in the enhanced equity index strategy. In fact, Greenwood and Walsh misappropriated as much as $554 million of the $667 million that Westridge clients invested in WGTI. Greenwood and Walsh have provided some of the investors money to their spouse and ex-spouse, respectively, who are also named as relief defendants in the SECs complaint., The SECs complaint charges violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

Instead, Bloom misappropriated more than $13.2 million of investor funds to furnish a lavish lifestyle that included the purchase of luxury homes, cars and boats for himself and his wife, who is named as a relief defendant. The remaining funds were invested in a single fund which itself turned out to be fraudulent. , The SEC alleges that the defendants solicited investments in North Hills, L.P.

Bloom and North Hills represented that the Funds assets would be allocated across multiple funds and fund managers to ensure diversification and moderate risk. They sent investors false monthly account statements that portrayed their investments as profitable when, in reality, Bloom was systematically looting the Funds trading account by making loans to himself and by investing in contravention of the Funds stated investment strategy in an investment known as the Philadelphia Alternative Asset Fund (PAAF). Bloom received undisclosed commissions from PAAF in excess of $355,000 over a 16-month period. PAAF itself was uncovered as a fraudulent scheme in June 2005. , According to the SECs complaint, beginning in November 2007, one of the Funds largest investors, a charitable trust (the Trust) that funds childrens schools began to serve Bloom with redemption requests, which Bloom repeatedly evaded.

The Commissions action charged Zappala with, among other things, securities fraud in connection with her participation in a revenue inflation scheme with two other senior officers of Aspen, a Cambridge, Massachusetts software company. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, Zappala consented to the entry of a final judgment enjoining her from violating the anti-fraud and other provisions of the securities laws and ordering her to pay a total of $145,000 in disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties., According to the Commissions complaint, Zappala and two other defendants caused Aspen to report inflated revenue in the companys publicly-filed financial statements and in press releases on at least six software transactions during fiscal years 1999 through 2002. The Complaint alleged that the three defendants caused Aspen to recognize revenue during the relevant period despite knowing that Aspen was prohibited from doing so under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles because contracts were not signed within the appropriate quarter and/or the earnings process was incomplete due to contingency arrangements which changed the terms of the customers payment commitments under the contracts. The Complaint alleged that, as a result of the fraudulent scheme, Aspen overstated license revenue for its fiscal year ended June 30, 2000 by 5.5% and for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2001 by 9.3%. The Complaint further alleged that, as a result of prematurely recognized revenue from those earlier periods, license revenue for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2002, 2003, and 2004 was understated by 1.8%, 13.9%, and 4.0% respectively., The final judgment imposed permanent injunctions prohibiting Zappala from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2; and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13.

The SEC alleges that Sunwest, which operates hundreds of retirement homes across the United States, lied to investors about its operations and concealed the risks of the investments, exposing investors to massive losses when the economic downturn triggered Sunwests collapse., According to the SECs complaint, Sunwest raised at least $300 million from more than 1,300 investors nationwide by promising a steady income stream and touting its success in running the properties. The complaint, filed today in federal district court in Eugene, Ore., charges Sunwest, its former President and CEO Jon M. Harder of Salem, Ore., and several related entities with securities fraud. According to the complaint, Sunwest, which operates more than 200 retirement homes at one point valued at $2 billion, told investors that they would be investing in a particular property. Investors were told that the property would generate sufficient profits to pay annual returns of around 10 percent, and that Sunwest had a track record of never missing a payment. Between 2006 and 2008, Sunwest raised more than $300 million from investors, which was used for the down payments on approximately 100 retirement homes, with the balance financed by institutional lenders and banks., The SEC alleges that at least half of the properties had lost money, and Sunwest concealed this information from investors by commingling all of its finances and making investor payments from this pot of cash. The SEC further alleges that investor returns came not just from these commingled assets, but from mortgage refinancings as well as loans from Harder. According to the SECs complaint, Sunwest concealed its precarious financial position and the risks it posed to investors by failing to disclose that Sunwest was being run as a single massive enterprise with its fortunes tied to the success of hundreds of properties and contingent on future financing ability. When the recent credit crisis derailed Sunwests ability to continue to refinance the properties, payments to investors ceased and many of them stood to lose their entire investments., The SEC further alleges that, even after Sunwest encountered difficulties refinancing properties and lenders began foreclosing, the defendants continued raising money from investors. Sunwest obtained millions more in investments up through June 2008, continuing to misrepresent that the money was designated for a specific property when, according to the SEC, it was being used to prop up the failing business., The Commissions complaint charges all of the Defendants with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, including Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The Commissions complaint also alleged that Hochberg obtained $150,000 from an elderly widow on fixed income for a purported investment in Massachusetts municipal bonds. According to the Commissions complaint, in both schemes, Hochberg, an accountant turned business consultant and unregistered investment adviser, never invested any funds and used most of the investor funds to pay his debts, to make payments to past investors or others who were threatening to sue or had sued him, and to pay various personal expenses, including payments to lawyers, credit card companies, and car payments., In a related criminal matter, on June 13, 2008, Hochberg pled guilty to eight counts of wire fraud and nine counts of securities fraud in a plea agreement with the U.S. Attorneys Office in Boston, Massachusetts. On October 16, 2008, the federal court in Massachusetts sentenced Hochberg to serve 63 months imprisonment followed by three years of supervised release, and to pay restitution in the amount of $1,791,500., On June 30, 2008, in a separate administrative action, the Commission issued, based on Hochbergs criminal plea, an order by consent barring Hochberg from association with any investment adviser. Also, on November 25, 2008, based on Hochbergs felony conviction, the Commission issued an Order of Forthwith Suspension Pursuant to Rule 102(e)(2) of the Commissions Rules of Practice, suspending Hochberg from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant., For further information, please see Litigation Release Nos. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20591.htm>20591</a> (May 21, 2008), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20619.htm>20619</a> (June 16, 2008), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20786.htm>20786</a> (October 20, 2008), Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Release No. <a href=/litigation/admin/2008/34-59018.pdf>59018</a> (November 25, 2008), and Investment Advisors Act of 1940 Release No. <a href=/litigation/admin/2008/ia-2749.pdf>2749</a> (June 30, 2008).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr20921.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The defendants are Automated Trading Desk Specialists, LLC (ATD); E*Trade Capital Markets LLC (E*Trade); Melvin Securities, L.L.C. (Melvin); Melvin &amp; Company LLC (Melvin Co); Sydan, LP (Sydan); and TradeLink, LLC (TradeLink) (collectively, the Defendants)., In its complaints, the Commission alleges that the Defendants failed to meet their basic obligation as specialists to serve public customer orders over their own proprietary interests while executing trades on the CHX. As specialists operating on the CHX, each of the Defendants had a general duty to match executable public customer or agency buy and sell orders and not to fill customer orders through trades from the specialist firms own accounts when those customer orders could be matched with other customer orders. However, from 1999 through 2005, each Defendant violated this obligation by filling orders through proprietary trades rather than through other customer orders, thereby causing upwards of $35 million in customer harm., The Commissions complaints allege that the violative conduct engaged in by the Defendants took three basic forms:, <i>Trading Ahead.</i> In certain instances, specialists filled one agency order through a proprietary trade for their firms account while a matchable agency order was present on the opposite side of the market, thereby improperly trading ahead of such opposite-side executable agency order. The customer order that was traded ahead of was then disadvantaged when it was subsequently executed at a price that was inferior to the price received by the firms proprietary account. For example, if a specialist has present on his book, at the same time, a marketable customer order to buy 1,000 shares of a security and a marketable customer order to sell 1,000 shares of the same security, the specialist would be obligated to pair off those matchable orders. Trading ahead would occur if the specialist filled the sell order from the firms proprietary account at $25.00 per share, and then subsequently executed the buy order at the inferior price of $25.05 per share. In this example, the buy order received a price inferior to that which it was entitled ($25.00) and the customer was disadvantaged by $50.00 (1,000 shares x $0.05 per share)., <i>Interpositioning.</i> In certain instances, after trading ahead, specialists also traded proprietarily with the matchable opposite-side agency order that had been traded ahead of, thereby interpositioning themselves between the two agency orders that should have been paired off in the first instance. By participating on both sides of trades, the specialist captured the spread between the purchase and sale prices, thereby disadvantaging the other parties to the transactions. Alternatively, specialists sometimes sold shares of a security into a customer buy order, and then filled the customer sell order by buying for the firms proprietary account at a lower price. In either case, the specialists participated on both sides of trades, capturing the spread between the purchase and sale prices, and disadvantaging the other parties to the transaction., <i>Trading Ahead of Unexecuted Open or Cancelled Orders.</i> In certain instances, specialists traded ahead of opposite-side executable agency orders, as described above, but in these instances, the unexecuted orders were left open until the end of the trading day, or were cancelled by the customer prior to the close of the trading day before receiving an execution., The complaints further allege that, during the relevant period, each of the Defendants failed to make or keep current a blotter containing an itemized daily record of all purchases and sales of securities effected by it for its proprietary accounts. Specifically, the complaints allege that the Defendants sometimes received orders to buy or sell securities that are dually listed on the CHX and on a different exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). In order to fill these orders, the specialist would sometimes place a corresponding order (lay-off trade) on the NYSE for the firms proprietary account. With respect to lay-off trades, the Defendants failed to make or keep current records showing the account for which each such transaction was effected, the name and amount of the securities, the unit and aggregate purchase or sale price, and the trade date., The Commissions complaints allege that by engaging in the conduct described above, the Defendants violated CHX Article 9, Rule 17, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17a-3(a)(1) thereunder., Without admitting or denying the allegations set forth in the complaints, the Defendants have consented to the entry of orders permanently enjoining them from engaging in the violations set forth above, and have agreed to disgorge ill-gotten gains totaling in the aggregate over $35.7 million and pay civil penalties totaling more than $6.7 million. The orders are subject to the approval of the Court., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2009/comp20922-atds.pdf>SEC Complaint v.

Livengood (“Livengood”), John W. Tate (“Tate”) and Randy S. Casstevens (“Casstevens”).  The Complaint alleges that Livengood is a resident of Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and was the Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Krispy Kreme Doughnuts, Inc. (“Krispy Kreme”or “the Company”).  The Complaint further alleges that Tate is a resident of Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and was the Chief Operating Officer of Krispy Kreme.<br/>The Complaint also alleges that Casstevens is a resident of Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and was the Chief Financial Officer of Krispy Kreme.  According to the Complaint, Krispy Kreme is a public issuer and a nationwide doughnut retailer and franchisor based in North Carolina. , The Complaint alleges that between February 2003 and May 2004, the Company  inflated its quarterly and annual earnings and omitted to disclose the impact of certain adjustments on its ability to achieve what had become a prime benchmark of its historical performance, i.e., reporting quarterly earnings per share (“EPS”) that exceeded its previously announced EPS guidance by one cent.  According to the Complaint, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 and the first three quarters of fiscal 2004, the Company under accrued or reversed previously accrued incentive compensation expense pursuant to Krispy Kreme’s Senior Executive Incentive Compensation Plan.  The respective under accrual and reversals, which were inconsistent with the formal incentive plan, were performed to inflate the Company’s earnings so as to meet the benchmark of exceeding the Company’s guidance by one cent. The Complaint alleges that the defendants understood the existence and significance of the under accrual and the reversals to the Company’s earnings, yet failed to disclose either to the public.  In addition, the defendants described favorably the Company’s performance in earnings releases and analyst calls and did not disclose the under accrual and reversals or their impact on Company earnings.  Further, the Complaint alleges that Livengood and Casstevens also signed and certified Krispy Kreme filings that misstated the Company’s financial performance.  The Complaint also alleges that Tate caused Krispy Kreme to engage in a bogus round-trip transaction to falsely increase its quarterly earnings in the second quarter of fiscal 2004. Finally, the Complaint alleges that each of the defendants sold stock following the Company’s earnings announcement for the second quarter of fiscal 2004.  ,  The Complaint charges Livengood with violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) and Rule 13a-14, promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), and aiding and abetting violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder.  The Complaint further charges Tate with violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act and Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1, promulgated under the Exchange Act, and aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13.  The Complaint also charges Casstevens with violations of Section 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act and Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-14 and 13b2-1, promulgated under the Exchange Act, and aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13.  On the same day the Complaint was filed, the defendants consented to orders permanently enjoining the defendants from future violations, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and the imposition of civil penalties against defendants.

(AEI), and their principal, Bruce Friedman. The SEC alleges that DLG, AEI, and Friedman are perpetrating an ongoing $216 million real estate investment fraud. The court entered an order halting the alleged fraud and freezing the assets of DLG, AEI, and Friedman., The SECs complaint alleges that DLG, AEI, and Friedman raised at least $216 million from hundreds of investors nationwide, many of whom are senior citizens, by promising guaranteed high returns through real estate-related investments. Instead, the complaint alleges, Friedman diverted substantial investor money to ventures unrelated to real estate, and also misappropriated at least $17 million to support his lavish lifestyle, including purchases of a luxury home, cars, vacations, jewelry, and designer clothing for himself and an alleged girlfriend, who is named as a relief defendant., The SECs complaint charges Friedman and his companies with selling securities in the form of one- or five-year Secured Investment Notes, representing that DLG pools investor money and invests it 70 to 80 percent in real estate property and 20 to 30 percent in mortgage lending. Once investors invested in the Notes, defendants continued to represent to them that their money was being used as represented, that DLGs investments were profitable, that their money was safe, and that returns of either 9 percent or 12 percent were guaranteed. In fact, as alleged in the complaint, Friedman and his companies did not invest DLG investor proceeds as represented. Instead, they diverted a substantial amount of investor money to undisclosed business ventures unrelated to real property or mortgage lending, including Friedmans charitable foundation and businesses operated by affiliates and Friedmans family members and friends. Friedman and his companies only recently changed their written disclosure to mention these additional business ventures to DLG investors, even though DLG investors had financed them for years. Friedman also misappropriated substantial investor money for his own personal purposes., In its lawsuit, the SEC obtained an order (1) freezing the assets of DLG, AEI, Friedman, and the relief defendant, Tina Placourakis; (2) appointing a temporary receiver over DLG, AEI and their affiliates; (3) preventing the destruction of documents; (4) granting expedited discovery; (5) requiring accountings from DLG, AEI and Friedman; and (6) temporarily enjoining DLG, AEI, and Friedman from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC also seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions, disgorgement, and civil penalties against DLG, AEI and Friedman and disgorgement from Placourakis. A hearing on whether a preliminary injunction should be issued against the defendants and whether a permanent receiver should be appointed is scheduled for March 10, 2009 at 10:00 a.m., The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the Arkansas Securities Department, the California Department of Corporations, the Michigan Office of Financial and Insurance Regulation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr20926.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

(now known as Mednax Services, Inc.) with backdating stock options grants to executives and employees and with reporting false financial information to shareholders.  Pediatrix Medical Group, Inc. (Pediatrix), is a physician services provider headquartered in Sunrise, Florida.  The Commissions complaint alleges that from approximately 1997 through 2000, Pediatrix, by the actions of a now-deceased former senior financial officer, granted options at below-market prices (in-the-money options).  Pediatrix has agreed to settle the Commissions charges without admitting or denying the allegations., The Commissions complaint, filed in federal court in Miami, alleges that on numerous occasions, Pediatrix used hindsight to select favorable exercise prices for employee and officer stock option grants without accurately reporting the financial impact of the grants to investors.  According to well-established accounting standards, Pediatrix was required to record an expense for in-the-money options.  Pediatrix allegedly avoided those expenses by retrospectively picking dates on which Pediatrixs stock was trading at lower prices and dating and pricing grants of stock options as if they had been granted on those earlier dates., According to the Commissions complaint, Pediatrixs intentional backdating of stock option grants resulted in material misstatements and omissions in certain of the Forms 10-Q, 10-K, registration statements, and proxy statements that the company filed with the Commission.  More specifically, the complaint alleges that Pediatrix failed to recognize a total of $8.8 million in compensation expense for the in-the-money value of the backdated stock options, resulting in an overstatement of Pediatrixs pretax income by approximately 6.74 percent in the relevant time period.  Moreover, the complaint alleges that Pediatrixs filings contained material misstatements with respect to how it priced and accounted for its stock options., Without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, Pediatrix consented to be enjoined from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 14(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, and 14a-9 thereunder.

The Commission had charged Kwak, a former registered representative of a broker-dealer in Rancho Bernardo, California, with violating the federal securities laws by participating in a scheme to manipulate the stock price of Competitive Technologies, Inc., (CTT), a technology development company located in Fairfield, Connecticut. The verdict followed a one-week trial in Bridgeport, Connecticut before the Honorable Janet Hall, United States District Court Judge for the District of Connecticut., The Commissions complaint, filed against a total of eight defendants on August 11, 2004, alleged that the defendants participated in a scheme to manipulate and inflate the price of CTT stock from at least July 1998 to June 2001.  The complaint alleged that the defendants (which included CTT itself and its former CEO, plus six former registered representatives of broker-dealers) raised and maintained the price of CTTs stock and created a false or misleading appearance with respect to the market for CTT stock through manipulative practices such as placing buy orders at or near the close of the market in order to inflate the reported closing price (marking the close), placing successive buy orders in small amounts at increasing prices (painting the tape), and using accounts they controlled or serviced to place pre-arranged buy and sell orders in virtually identical amounts (placing matched trades)., A previous trial in November 2007 resulted in a verdict in the Commissions favor against one scheme participant, Sheldon A. Strauss, a former registered representative from Cleveland, Ohio, and a hung jury against Kwak and one other defendant, Stephen J. Wilson.

Lawton (Lawton), who runs Crossroad., The Commissions complaint, filed on February 18, 2009, alleges that Paramount is a hedge fund in which approximately 50 to 60 investors, many of whom live in Minnesota, have invested as much as $9 million.  The complaint alleges that Lawton, a resident of San Francisco, California, and Crossroad have engaged in a fraud in which they misrepresented Paramounts assets and returns to investors.  The complaint alleges that the defendants represented to investors that Paramount has produced annual returns of 65% to 19% since 2001.  The complaint alleges that in January 2009, defendants sent account statements to investors that reflected investments totaling about $17 million as of December 31, 2008.  The complaint alleges that, in fact, Paramount only had $5.3 million of assets in its accounts at that time.  The complaint alleges that as of February 13, Paramounts assets amounted to less than $2 million, and that defendants withdrew $900,000 in January.   The complaint further alleges that when the Commission requested documents from the defendants to verify defendants claims about Paramounts assets, the defendants provided account statements showing a false $12 million account balance in a brokerage account that had long been closed., In the Order, the Honorable Judge Ann Montgomery preliminarily enjoins Paramount, Crossroad, and Lawton from violating the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 [Section 17(a)] and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder], and Crossroad and Lawton with respect to violations of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 [Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder] and aiding and abetting of Crossroads violations of those provisions by Lawton.

As alleged in the Complaint, CRE offers 30 Day Currency Trading Contracts, which promise a guaranteed ten percent (10%) return (the ROI) in thirty days. The Complaint also alleged that CRE and Ossie claim that they generate profits sufficient to pay these guaranteed returns by trading United States and Japanese currency contracts as the exchange rate fluctuates. Further, the Complaint alleged that CRE and Ossie told investors that the program involves very little risk because CRE has established a large, defensive reserve fund from which to pay back the 10% ROI, plus redeemed principal. In fact, as alleged in the Complaint, CRE does not generate sufficient returns from currency trading to pay the promised returns. The Complaint alleged that the defendants claim CRE and its program were audited by an outside accounting firm which concluded that the investment program was not a Ponzi scheme. In fact, according to the Complaint, CRE operated as a Ponzi scheme by paying all returns to investors from funds contributed by new investors., See also: LR <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr20853.htm>20853</a> (January 15, 2009).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr20932.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The Commission previously filed similar charges against eight other individuals in connection with the NewAlliance IPO. The most recent charges arise out of a scheme by Richetelli in which he illegally funded the purchase of NewAlliance stock during its IPO in violation of the federal securities laws. The SECs action was brought in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut., According to the Commissions complaint, the action arises out of the April 2004 conversion of New Haven Savings Bank (NHSB) from a mutual form of organization to a stock form of organization. Because mutual banks are owned by their depositors, the depositors are given first priority in receiving the shares arising out of the conversions initial public offering. The Commissions complaint alleges that Richetelli entered into illegal arrangements with six NHSB depositors (which were hidden from NHSB) pursuant to which he funded their purchase of shares of NewAlliance stock in exchange for 90% of the profits earned on the sales of such shares. The complaint further alleges that Richetelli also illegally funded the purchase of additional shares of the stock using his mothers NHSB account, retaining 100% of the profits derived from the sales of those shares. The complaint further alleges that, through his scheme and at the expense of other NHSB bank depositors, Richetelli illegally obtained hundreds of thousands in proceeds from the sale of New Alliance stock that had been purchased in the IPO., In its complaint, the Commission alleges that Richetelli violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty., Todays actions are the result of ongoing investigations by the SEC, the U.S. Attorney for the District of Connecticut, and the New Haven Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

The Complaint alleges that Martin is a resident of Mooresville, North Carolina, and has served as president of DM Enterprises and as the managing member of DM Ventures. The Complaint further alleges that DM Enterprises is a North Carolina corporation formed in 1985 that has its principal place of business in Mooresville, North Carolina. The Complaint also alleges that DM Ventures is an entity that was formerly registered in the State of Nevada as a limited liability company with its principal place of business in Mooresville, NC., The Complaint alleges that since at least 1998, Martin, operating through DM Enterprises and DM Ventures, has raised more than $10 million from over 150 investors in North Carolina and in several other states through a variety of false and misleading statements. The Complaint alleges that Martin told most of his investors that he was going to invest their funds in private companies that he would take public, and told other investors that their money would be used to provide working capital to companies in financial trouble. According to the Complaint, Martin told investors that they would not lose their principal investment and that they would receive anywhere from a 15% to 50% rate of return on their investment. Further, the Complaint alleges that Martin personally guaranteed the promissory notes he gave investors and, in several instances, told investors that their principal was insured. The Complaint alleges that Martin did not invest the money in companies as he claimed, but instead pooled investor funds in the bank accounts of DM Enterprises and DM Ventures, and used those funds as they were received from later investors to pay Ponzi returns to earlier investors., The Complaint alleges that the defendants have violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The Complaint further alleges that Jenkins tried to perpetuate her scheme by lying to the Commission staff about the existence of the invented client and furnishing the staff with bogus documents in 2008, including fake custodial statements that she created on her laptop., According to the Complaint, Jenkins repeatedly claimed that the so-called confidential client accounts that she invented and claimed to manage contained more than $1 billion in assets. Even as Locke began to take on genuine clients in late 2006, the assets under management of its real clients never amounted to more than a very small portion of the billion-plus dollars that Jenkins claimed to manage.

In all, the complaint charges eight individuals and three entities with violating the federal securities laws through their participation in the schemes and through related conduct in the stocks of biotech startup Xpention Genetics, Inc. (Xpention) (now known as Cancer Detection Corp.) and surveillance startup HS3 Technologies, Inc. (HS3). The complaint alleges that the defendants collectively reaped at least $5.9 million in illegal profits., In addition to Regency, Gelbard, and Lamkin, the named defendants are Canadian resident Joseph S.

Gountis., The SECs complaint makes the following allegations:, After agreeing to take their clients Xpention and HS3 public, Regency, Gelbard, Lamkin, and Koslosky acquired control of two shell companies and, in reverse mergers, combined one with Xpention and the other with HS3. At the same time, <b>Regency, Gelbard, Lamkin, Koslosky, John Coutris, Michael Coutris, and J. Coutris Partners</b> sold Xpention and HS3 stock in unregistered distributions to a network of investors they had recruited. <b>Regency, Gelbard, Lamkin, and Koslosky</b> acted as dealers in these transactions but failed to register as dealers with the Commission, while <b>John Coutris, Michael Coutris, and J. Coutris Partners</b> acted as brokers but failed to register as brokers with the Commission., <b>Regency, Gelbard, and Lamkin</b> orchestrated the drafting, publication, and dissemination of numerous fraudulent promotions to inflate the share price of each stock and enable themselves and others to sell shares later at a profit. <b>Fernando and Wellington</b>, working with Regency, Gelbard, and Lamkin, arranged for the publication and funding of the fraudulent promotions and also sold shares., The promotional materials: a) made false claims about Xpention and HS3s businesses, technologies, and prospects; b) contained extravagant price predictions for Xpention and HS3 stock that had no basis in fact; c) misrepresented who had paid for their preparation and distribution; and d) omitted information that the defendants intended to sell shares into the promotions., <b>Regency, Gelbard, Lamkin, and Koslosky</b> sought to hide their ownership interest in Xpention and HS3 by transferring paper ownership of certain restricted shares to <b>James Coutris and Gountis</b> but retaining a hidden interest.

Gountis, who — on paper — once owned fully two-thirds of HS3s outstanding shares, failed to file any required disclosure forms regarding his HS3 stock, as did Regency, Gelbard, Lamkin, and Koslosky., Through their conduct, Regency, Gelbard, Lamkin, Fernando, and Wellington violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, while James Coutris violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5., Regency, Gelbard, Lamkin, Koslosky, John Coutris, Michael Coutris, and J.

The judgments permanently enjoin iBIZ Technology, Schilling and Perkins from violating, or aiding and abetting violations of, the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), the anti-fraud provisions of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, and the periodic reporting requirements of Section 13(a) and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13; and additionally as to the company and Schilling, violations, or aiding and abetting violations, of the proxy provisions of Sections 14(a), and 14(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 14a-3, 14a-9, 14c-2 and 14c-6 thereunder. The defendants, in consenting to the orders of permanent injunction, neither admitted nor denied the allegations of the Commissions complaint., The judgment as to Schilling also ordered him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest totaling $1,065,432, but waived payment of that amount and a civil penalty based on his sworn statement of financial condition. The judgment as to Perkins also ordered him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest totaling $1,180,476, but waived payment of that amount and a civil penalty based on his sworn statement of financial condition. Further, Schilling was permanently barred, and Perkins was barred for ten years, from serving as officers or directors of a public company. Both men were barred from participating in the offering of penny stocks which trade at a price of less than five dollars per share. No disgorgement or civil penalties were ordered against the company, which is now defunct., The judgment entered against consultant Jerrold McRoberts prohibits him from violating the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act and also orders him to pay $25,000 in disgorgement, but imposes no civil penalty based on his sworn statement of financial condition. McRoberts was also barred from participating in the offering of penny stocks for two years. A default judgment was previously entered on June 6, 2008 against consultant Jeffrey Firestone, which prohibits him from violating the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act and also orders him to pay $2,018,685 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest on that amount, and a civil penalty of $120,000., In its complaint, the SEC alleged that iBIZ Technology, Schilling, and Perkins made false and misleading statements in press releases, online interviews, investor correspondence, proxy solicitations, and Commission filings regarding the companys involvement with a development-stage product called the Virtual Keyboard. While these statements were being disseminated, Schilling and Perkins sold over $1 million of their own iBIZ Technology shares into a falsely inflated market. In addition, the SEC alleged in its complaint that the inflated stock price allowed iBIZ Technology to retire approximately $2.8 million of convertible debt that it otherwise lacked the resources to repay. The complaint also alleged that all of the defendants engaged in a scheme to raise money for themselves by improperly using Form S-8 registrations statements. The complaint also alleged that iBIZ Technology, Schilling and Perkins illegally distributed shares through its consultants, Jeffery Firestone, Jerrold B. McRoberts, and Doyle Scott Elliott, who then sold the shares into the public market., On February 27, 2009, after a four day trial, a federal jury returned a verdict for defendant Doyle Scott Elliott, finding that he did not violate the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act., In an earlier related action, on February 16, 2006, the SEC revoked the registration of the common stock of iBIZ Technology Corporation pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Exchange Act.

Colo.)</h2>, <h2>SEC PREVAILS IN BENCH TRIAL OF JONATHAN CURSHEN, A PROMOTER IN AN INTERNET PUMP AND DUMP SCHEME WHILE COMPLAINT AGAINST TIMOTHY MILES, A PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDER DISMISSED</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on March 6, 2009, the United States District Court for the District of Colorado, entered a final judgment against Jonathan Curshen, finding him liable for securities fraud for acting as a promoter in an internet pump and dump scheme. Based on the Commissions evidence at the bench trial held on April 30 and May 1, 2007, the Court concluded that in early 2000, Curshen knowingly or recklessly posted on various Internet sites baseless projections and other financial information about Freedom Golf Corporation, a now-defunct Denver-based golf club manufacturer. The Court further found that Curshen knowingly failed to disclose that he was being paid to promote Freedom Golf and was selling the companys stock at the same time he was touting the company., According to the Courts findings, Timothy Miles, a principal shareholder of Freedom Golf, arranged for the company to hire Carter Allen Jones and Curshen to promote Freedom Golf. Jones prepared an investor report touting Freedom Golf based on information provided by the companys president. The report contained factually baseless profit and revenue projections for Freedom Golf, which was in dire financial condition at the time. Curshen posted a link to the report on Internet websites, despite knowing of the companys poor financial condition. Furthermore, the Court found Curshen posted numerous messages touting Freedom Golf on various Internet web sites without disclosing his receipt and sale of Freedom Golf stock in exchange for promoting the company., The Courts final judgment enjoins Curshen from violating Sections 17(a) and 17(b) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5, and bars him from participating in any penny stock offering. The final judgment also orders Curshen to pay disgorgement of $66,235, representing profits gained from his participation in the illegal scheme. The Court reserved jurisdiction as to prejudgment interest and a civil penalty., On March 2, in a separate order, the Court entered an amended judgment dismissing the complaint against Miles, finding him not liable for securities fraud after a bench trial held on June 20 and 21, 2005. The Court dismissed the complaint against Miles with prejudice after concluding the Commission failed to prove that false statements Miles made were material to investors., According to the Courts findings concerning Miles, Miles arranged to have false information submitted on a Form 211 to the NASD (now FINRA) to arrange for Freedom Golfs predecessor, Auric Enterprises, quoted on the Over-The-Counter Bulletin Board. The false information concerned Miles relationships to many of Aurics shareholders, among other things. The Judge, however, rejected the Commissions argument that the false information would have been material to a reasonable investor., Previously, Carter Allen Jones, another promoter, and his company, C. Jones &amp; Co. were permanently enjoined by default against future violations of Sections 17(a) and 17(b) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Jones was ordered to pay disgorgement and a civil penalty. Based on the Commissions motion, the Court dismissed its claims of disgorgement and penalties against C. Jones &amp; Co., because it was defunct. In addition, Freedom Golfs president, Gaylen Johnson, previously consented to a permanent injunction against future violations of Sections 10(b) and 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 13a-1 and 13a-13. Johnson was also barred from participating in any offering of a penny stock. Based on his financial condition, the Commission did not seek a civil penalty., For more information on earlier actions in this case, see <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18092.htm>LR-18092</a> (April 16, 2003) and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr19612.htm>LR-19612</a> (March 16, 2006).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr20940.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Donnelly (Donnelly), a resident of Charlottesville, Virginia, and his firms, Tower Analysis, Inc., Nasco Tang Corp., and Nadia Capital Corp., alleging that they are conducting a multi-million dollar Ponzi scheme. The Commission also filed an application for an <i>ex parte</i> temporary restraining order, asset freeze, and other emergency relief against Donnelly and his entities., According to the Commissions complaint, from at least 1998, Donnelly fraudulently obtained at least $11 million from as many as 31 investors through the sale of securities in the form of limited partnership interests in three investment funds. The SEC alleges that Donnelly orchestrated the scheme through three entities, Tower Analysis Inc., Nasco Tang Corp., and Nadia Capital Corp. The complaint alleges that Donnelly told investors that he would pool their funds to invest in, among other things, stock and bond index derivatives. According to the complaint, despite representations to investors that he had generated annual returns of as much as 22%, Donnelly has done almost no securities trading, and none since 2002. The complaint alleges that instead of using investor funds to execute trades, Donnelly used investor funds to repay other investors, and paid himself approximately $1 million in salary and fees during the last three years alone. The complaint also alleges that Donnelly has been soliciting investors for a new fund called Nadia Capital Partners, LP based on misrepresentations about his past trading results., On the Commissions application, the court today entered a temporary restraining order enjoining Donnelly, Tower Analysis, Nasco Tang, and Nadia Capital from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

(Peregrine). On March 4, 2009, United States District Judge John A. Houston entered an Amended Final Judgment by consent against Michael D. Whitt, the former president of Barnhill Associates, Inc. (Barnhill), a reseller of Peregrines software. The Courts Judgment enjoined Whitt from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered Whitt to pay a civil penalty of $60,000. On January 5, 2009, Judge Houston entered a Final Judgment by consent against former Peregrine Director of Strategic Alliances Peter J. OBrien, enjoining him from violating the anti-fraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws, and ordering him to disgorge $124,792 in ill-gotten gains from unlawful sales of Peregrine stock and from a bonus he received from Peregrine during the fraud. Whitt and OBrien settled the Commissions claims without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint., According to the Commissions complaint, beginning in 1999, Whitt caused Barnhill to enter into a series of sham transactions with Peregrine, which Peregrine used to artificially inflate its revenue. For several fiscal quarters, Whitt signed contracts-some of which were backdated to the prior quarter-that appeared to bind Barnhill to purchase Peregrine software licenses when, in fact, Barnhill had no obligation to pay Peregrine. Peregrine improperly recorded revenue on the sham contracts in contravention of U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)., With respect to OBrien, the Commissions complaint alleged that in December 2000, OBrien and another Peregrine executive persuaded an executive at a re-seller to sign two contingent sales agreements with Peregrine. The agreements related to software licenses that Peregrine was trying unsuccessfully to sell to two customers. OBrien understood that Peregrine would only seek payment from the re-seller if the two Peregrine customers bought the licenses from the re-seller. Despite the contingent nature of the sale to the re-seller, Peregrine nevertheless recorded revenue on the two agreements in contravention of GAAP. Additionally, the complaint alleged that OBrien was involved in a September 2001 contingent sale to a re-seller, for which Peregrine improperly recorded revenue. While participating in the fraud, OBrien sold Peregrine stock., In September 2006, Whitt entered a guilty plea in a related criminal case brought by the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of California. He pleaded guilty to obstructing justice by making false statements to Commission attorneys investigating the Peregrine fraud. Whitt was sentenced to six months of incarceration followed by six months of residency in a community confinement center, and he was ordered to pay $1 million in restitution., In October 2004, OBrien entered a guilty plea in the related criminal case. He pleaded guilty to obstructing justice by withholding relevant information and providing inaccurate information about his and others knowledge and conduct to government investigators. OBrien was sentenced to one year of probation., In addition to the disgorgement order in the SEC action, OBrien agreed to be enjoined from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, and 13b2-1; and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13., The Commission also announced that, on January 7, 2009, Judge Houston issued an order granting the parties Joint Motion of Dismissal for Defendant Joseph G. Reichner.

Vassallo agreed to a court order freezing his assets.  The SEC is seeking an emergency court order to also freeze the assets of Vassallos company, Equity Investment Management and Trading, Inc. (EIMT)., According to the SECs complaint, Vassallo and Kenitzer raised more than $40 million from about 150 investors from approximately May 2004 to November 2008.  Vassallo told investors, many of whom he met through his church, that he had a proprietary computer software program that allowed him to buy and sell stock options and generate returns of 3.5 percent per month with little risk of loss.  The SEC alleges that Vassallo and Kenitzer instead used investors money for unauthorized purposes, including a variety of other schemes never disclosed to investors., The SECs complaint, filed in federal court in Sacramento, alleges that Vassallo told investors that their money was being invested in securities pursuant to a proprietary trading strategy that promised high returns with minimal risk.  From September 2007 through approximately November 2008, Kenitzer, who participated in EIMTs day-to-day operations, posted false trading results on the companys Web site and distributed phony investment reports to investors that led them to believe EIMT was achieving consistent, positive returns.  According to the SECs complaint, EIMT actually had not conducted any stock trades since at least September 2007, when its brokerage firm terminated Vassallos trading privileges.  The SEC alleges that Vassallo and Kenitzer kept the scheme going by using money raised from new investors to pay earlier investors, a classic hallmark of a Ponzi scheme., The SECs complaint charges Vassallo, Kenitzer and EIMT with violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, including Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

As a result of his plea, Richman now faces up to ten (10) years imprisonment, followed by three (3) years of supervised release, and a $250,000 fine., For further information, see Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20744.htm>20744</a> (September 25, 2008), Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20672.htm>20672</a> (August 7, 2008) (SEC Settles Civil Injunctive Action with Former Executive of Massachusetts Public Company), Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20010.htm>20010</a> (February 21, 2007) (SEC Settles Civil Injunctive Action Against Former CEO of Biopure Corporation), Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19825.htm>19825</a> (September 12, 2006) (SEC Settles Civil Injunctive Action Against Biopure Corporation and Its General Counsel), Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19651.htm>19651</a> (April 11, 2006) (SEC Settles with Former Biopure Executive) and Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr19376.htm>19376</a> (September 14, 2005) (Biopure and Others Charged by the Commission).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr20947.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Brian Travis, et al.</i>, Civil Action 09 CV 2288 (PKC) (SDNY)</h2>, <h2>Securities and Exchange Commission Charges Hedge Fund Employees and Brokers with Bribery Scheme</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) announced today that it filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that two brokers, David Harrison Baker (Baker) and Daniel Schreiber (Schreiber), and the broker-dealer with which Schreiber was associated, Granite Financial Group, LLC (Granite), paid bribes to Brian Travis (Travis) and Nicholas Peter Vulpis, Jr. (Vulpis), two employees of a hedge fund investment adviser in exchange for Travis and Vulpis routing hedge fund trades, and the associated commissions, to Baker, Schreiber and Granite., According to the Complaint, from March 2003 to October 2005, two employees of the investment adviser JLF Asset Management LLC (JLF), Travis and Vulpis, solicited and accepted bribes from brokers. The bribes took the form of payments for expensive travel and various personal services. In exchange for those bribes, Travis and Vulpis directed trades to those brokers. Their conduct defrauded JLFs hedge fund clients, whose trades — unbeknownst to the clients — were being steered to brokers for the purpose of enriching the defendants. The brokers offering these bribes included Baker and Schreiber., The Complaint also alleges that among the benefits Travis and Vulpis extracted from these brokers were international air travel (including for family members), hotel arrangements, the cost of building a special crate to transport Travis Great Dane, fully-paid vacations, daily car service, computer equipment, and monthly rent payments for a personal residence. Collectively, Travis and Vulpis received at least $312,000 in such personal benefits. Baker, Schreiber, and Granite benefited handsomely from this scheme as well: in exchange for bribes, Travis and Vulpis directed a substantial amount of trades to each of them, which, in turn, meant that each received substantial commissions. Indeed, during the relevant period, Baker, Schreiber and Granite received a total of approximately $10,702,105 in commissions from trades that Travis and Vulpis directed to them., The Complaint further alleges that Travis and Vulpis concealed their bribery scheme, and the material conflicts of interest it created, from JLFs hedge fund clients. For example, Travis and Vulpis used a net commission structure with Baker, Schreiber, Granite and others, to obscure the amount of trades they were directing and commissions they were paying to, among others, Baker, Schreiber, and Granite. As a result, JLF did not disclose to its funds its material conflicts of interest which were the direct result of Travis and Vulpis corrupt dealings with the other defendants., The Commissions complaint charges Travis, Vulpis, Baker, Schreiber and Granite with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. §§ 77q(a), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. § 77j(b), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5, and with aiding and abetting JLFs violations of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, 15 U.S.C. §§ 80b-6(1) and 80b-6(2).

Brooks</i>, United States District Court for the Central District of California, Civil Action No. SACV 09-0315 (AG)</h2>, <h2>SEC Charges Quest Software and Three Executives With Stock Option Backdating</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Central District of California against Quest Software, Inc., an Aliso Viejo, California-based software manufacturer, and three current or former officers: Vincent C. Smith, John J. Laskey, and Kevin E. Brooks., The SECs complaint alleges that Quest, its executive chairman Smith, its former chief financial officer Laskey, and its former controller and principal accounting officer Brooks, improperly granted undisclosed in-the-money stock options to executives and employees by backdating millions of options from 1999 through 2002.  As a result of this misconduct, in September 2007, Quest reported a $113.6 million restatement of its operating income., According to the SECs complaint, Quest failed to accurately describe its stock option practices in its public filings and failed to properly account for the backdated options in its financial statements, resulting in false and misleading disclosures to Quests shareholders in filings with the SEC from 1999 through 2005., The complaint further alleges that Quest backdated 28 separate grants involving over 11 million shares of common stock.  Quests failure to properly record compensation expenses in connection with the backdated options resulted in the overstatement of Quests operating income by 4 percent to 963.1 percent, and the understatement of its operating loss by 26.12 percent to 154 percent from 1999 through 2005., Specifically, the SECs complaint alleges that Smith and Laskey approved a policy by which Quest would pool stock option grants each month and backdate the grants to coincide with the lowest stock price of the month.  The complaint alleges that the backdated grant dates bore no relation to when the grant was actually approved, resulting in artificially low exercise prices for the stock options.  According to the complaint, although he knew about the use of hindsight to date stock option grants, Brooks failed to ensure the accuracy of Quests financial statements and disclosures.  The complaint also alleges that Smith, Laskey, and Brooks took steps to prevent Quests independent auditors from discovering the backdating, including the use of false written consents by Quests board of directors., All defendants have agreed to settle this matter, without admitting or denying the allegations in the SECs complaint, on the following terms:, Quest consented to an order permanently enjoining it from violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, and 14a-9 thereunder., Smith consented to an order permanently enjoining him from violating Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act, and Sections 13(b)(5), 14(a), and 16(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-14, 13b2-1, 13b2-2, 14a-9, and 16a-3 thereunder, and from aiding and abetting Quests violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder.  Smith also agreed to pay a $150,000 civil penalty., Laskey and Brooks, a certified public accountant, consented to orders permanently enjoining them from violating Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act, and Sections 13(b)(5) and 16(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13b2-1, 13b2-2, and 16a-3 thereunder, and from aiding and abetting Quests violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder.  Laskey and Brooks agreed to pay civil penalties of $50,000 and $60,000 respectively.  Brooks also agreed to pay disgorgement of $34,775, representing half of the in-the-money value of backdated options he had exercised (the other half had previously been repaid to the company), and prejudgment interest of $5,808.29.  In addition, Brooks agreed to a five-year suspension from appearing or practicing as an accountant before the SEC., All settlements in the civil injunctive action are subject to the approval of the United States District for the Central District of California., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2009/comp20950.pdf>SEC Complaint</a>,  ]"

The Defendants consented to the entry of the orders without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions complaints., The complaints, filed on March 4, 2009, charge each Defendant with engaging in unlawful proprietary trading on the CHX. In the complaints, the Commission alleges that the Defendants failed to meet their basic obligation as specialists to serve public customer orders over their own proprietary interests while executing trades on the CHX. As specialists operating on the CHX, each of the Defendants had a general duty to match executable public customer or agency buy and sell orders and not to fill customer orders through trades from the specialist firms own accounts when those customer orders could be matched with other customer orders. However, from 1999 through 2005, each Defendant violated this obligation by filling orders through proprietary trades rather than through other customer orders.

Tecumseh and Tradevest conducted the fraud largely through the efforts of defendant John L. Milling, a securities lawyer and Tecumsehs senior official.

Through the unregistered fraudulent offerings, the defendants together raised approximately $10 million from about 500 investors nationwide. The complaint also names as relief defendants three Tecumseh affiliates: Alpha Fund, Alpha LLC, and Stracq, Inc., The complaint alleges that Tecumseh, Tradevest, and Milling induced investors to acquire securities of Tecumseh and Tradevest by means of a host of material misrepresentations. Through offering memoranda and other materials, these defendants (a) touted false and misleading profit projections; (b) promised some investors returns on investment or dividends without disclosing that Tecumseh and Cantor had no earnings to distribute and that any such payments necessarily would come from capital, including funds raised from other investors; and (c) made materially misleading statements concerning NASD approval for Tecumsehs acquisition of Cantor. The complaint also alleges that Tecumseh, Tradevest, and Milling knew or acted in reckless disregard of the fact that their representations to investors concerning these matters were materially false and misleading., Previously, relief defendant Stracq consented to a final consent judgment ordering it to disgorge ill-gotten gains of $660,000.

Civ. 09 CV 2467)</h2>, <h2>SEC CHARGES MADOFF AUDITORS WITH FRAUD</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged the auditors of Bernard Madoffs broker-dealer firm with committing securities fraud by falsely representing that they had conducted legitimate audits, when in fact they had not. , In its complaint filed today in federal court in Manhattan, the SEC alleges that from 1991 through 2008, certified public accountant David G. Friehling and his firm, Friehling &amp; Horowitz, CPAs, P.C. (F&amp;H), purported to audit financial statements and disclosures of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC (BMIS). The SEC previously charged Madoff and BMIS with committing securities fraud through a multi-billion dollar Ponzi scheme perpetrated on advisory and brokerage customers of his firm. , The SECs complaint alleges that Friehling enabled Madoffs Ponzi scheme by falsely stating, in annual audit reports, that F&amp;H audited BMIS financial statements pursuant to Generally Accepted Auditing Standards (GAAS), including the requirements to maintain auditor independence and perform audit procedures regarding custody of securities. , F&amp;H also made representations that BMIS financial statements were presented in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and that Friehling reviewed internal controls at BMIS, including controls over the custody of assets, and found no material inadequacies. According to the SECs complaint, Friehling knew that BMIS regularly distributed the annual audit reports to Madoff customers and that the reports were filed with the SEC and other regulators., The SECs complaint alleges that all of these statements were materially false because Friehling and F&amp;H did not perform a meaningful audit of BMIS, and did not perform procedures to confirm that the securities BMIS purportedly held on behalf of its customers even existed. , Instead, the SEC alleges that Friehling merely pretended to conduct minimal audit procedures of certain accounts to make it seem like he was conducting an audit, and then failed to document his purported findings and conclusions as required under GAAS. If properly stated, those financial statements, along with BMIS related disclosures regarding reserve requirements, would have shown that BMIS owed tens of billions of dollars in additional liabilities to its customers and was therefore insolvent. , According to the SECs complaint, Friehling similarly did not conduct any audit procedures with respect to BMIS internal controls, and had no basis to represent that BMIS had no material inadequacies. Afraid that his work for BMIS would be subject to peer review, as required of accountants who conduct audits, Friehling lied to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for years and denied that he conducted any audit work. , The SEC further alleges that Friehling and F&amp;H obtained ill-gotten gains through compensation from Madoff and BMIS, and also from withdrawing returns from accounts held at BMIS in the name of Friehling and his family members., The SECs complaint specifically alleges that Friehling and F&amp;H violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, violated and aided and abetted violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and aided and abetted violations of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Advisers Act, Section 15(c) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-3 thereunder, and Section 17 of the Exchange Act and Rule 17a-5 thereunder. Among other things, the SECs complaint seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties and a court order requiring both Friehling and F&amp;H to disgorge their ill-gotten gains. , The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

(Global), an internet service provider and purported anti-terrorism company based in Tampa, Florida, and its principals Brent C. Kovar, Glenn A. Kovar, and James S. Kent, who allegedly defrauded investors through an unregistered fraudulent offering of Global stock and orchestrated a pump-and-dump scheme of SkyWay Communications Holding Corp. (SkyWay). The Commission also charged Kenneth Bruce Baker and Kenneth R. Kramer, alleged unregistered broker-dealers, who found investors for SkyWay and sold SkyWay stock., The Commissions complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, alleges that from at least February 2002 until December 2005, Global, Brent Kovar (Globals senior vice president and president), Kent (Globals director of business operations and CEO), and Glenn Kovar (Globals manager and member) raised approximately $1.38 million from 18 investors by offering and selling unregistered shares of Globals stock. In connection with the offer and sale of Globals securities, Global, Brent Kovar, Kent, and Glenn Kovar made numerous material misrepresentations and omissions to investors through marketing and offering materials, including, among other things, that Global possessed a nationwide network of broadcasting towers and anti-terrorism technology that would allow the government to monitor and, if necessary, take control of an airplane. These claims were patently false because Global had no towers and no technology to monitor and take control of airplanes., The complaint further alleges that after a Global subsidiary merged with a public shell to become SkyWay (in June 2003) and Global transferred its purported technology and assets to SkyWay, Brent Kovar and Kent, with Glenn Kovars assistance, carried out a pump-and-dump scheme of SkyWay stock. From August 2003 to May 2005, Brent Kovar (SkyWays President) and Kent (SkyWays CEO and CFO), issued false press releases to increase SkyWays stock price and trading volume. The press releases stated, among other things, that SkyWay had a nationwide network of broadcasting towers, and the same purported anti-terrorism technology that Global had claimed to have. The press releases also claimed SkyWay had technology for providing Internet services on airplanes. During the same period, Global, Brent and Glenn Kovar, and Kent dumped 76.65 million shares of their SkyWay stock on the unsuspecting public and made more than $12 million in profits. Brent Kovar and Kent also engaged in other misconduct in connection with the SkyWay pump-and-dump scheme by improperly issuing S-8 stock to promoters Baker and Kramer in exchange for finding investors and selling SkyWay stock., The Commissions complaint charges Global, Brent Kovar, Kent, and Glenn Kovar with violating the registration and anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically, Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and further charges Glenn Kovar with aiding and abetting SkyWays violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5. The Complaint further charges Brent Kovar and Kent with aiding and abetting SkyWays violations of disclosure provisions under Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-11; and charges Baker and Kramer with violating the broker-dealer registration provisions under Section 15(b) of the Exchange Act. The Commissions complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief against all defendants, enjoining them from future violations of the provisions charged, and an order requiring them to disgorge their ill-gotten gains, with prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties against each of them; imposing a penny stock bar against the individual defendants, and an officer and director bar against Brent Kovar and Kent., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2009/comp20960.pdf>SEC Complaint</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr20960.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Uselton</i>, Case No. 07-2211 (S.D. Tex. filed July 9, 2007)</h2>, <h2>SEC Settles E-Mail Spam Campaign Case Against Two Texas Individuals</h2>]","[Two Texas men, who perpetrated a massive e-mail spam campaign to drive up the demand for low value stocks they owned, will pay nearly $4 million in penalties and fines and will no longer be able to trade penny stocks under an agreement reached with the Securities and Exchange Commission., The agreement, which was entered today in the form of two final judgments by Judge Kenneth Hoyt of the U.S District Court in Houston, prohibits Darrel T. Uselton and his uncle, Jack E. Uselton, from violating antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and trading in penny stock. Darrel Uselton also agreed to pay $2,838,866.72 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest and another $1 million in civil penalties., According to the SEC initial complaint, the Useltons generated proceeds of more than $4 million by obtaining stock from at least 13 penny stock companies from May, 2005 through December, 2006. The duo would then, according to the SEC, sell those shares into an artificially active, and often-times rising, market that they created through manipulative trading, spam e-mails, direct mailers, and internet-based promotional activities., The SEC determined that each of the market manipulations followed a similar pattern. Specifically, the Useltons and the companies they controlled received unrestricted shares from the penny stock companies for little or no money in return for purported financing or promotional activities. The Useltons then transferred those unrestricted shares into brokerage accounts they controlled. They then encouraged many of the penny stock companies to issue positive press releases. At the same time, the Useltons orchestrated spam e-mail campaigns using technology that would enable them to essentially instruct millions of computers to distribute their email so that it would appear as though the email was coming from a person whom the recipient might have known., Darrel Uselton and Jack Uselton, without admitting or denying the allegations, settled the action by consenting to entry of a court order that: (i) permanently bars them from Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and (ii) prohibits them from participating in an offering of penny stock pursuant to Section 21(d)(6) of the Exchange Act., In addition, Darrel Uselton consented to entry of a court order that orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $2,838,866.72, which will be deemed satisfied upon entry of an order requiring him to pay that amount in restitution to the State of Texas. It also requires him to pay a civil monetary penalty of $1 million., In a related enforcement action, the Useltons are in the process of settling criminal charges originally filed by the Attorney Generals Office for Texas and the Harris County District Attorneys Office (Houston, Texas) in July 2007 and have agreed to forego any right to $2,838,866.72 that previously was seized by the Texas criminal authorities from bank and brokerage accounts controlled by Darrel Uselton., The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Attorney Generals Office for Texas and New York, The Harris County (Houston, Texas) District Attorneys Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Texas State Securities Board, the United States Attorneys Office District of Colorado, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the State of Oklahoma Department of Securities, and the National Cyber-Forensics &amp; Training Alliance., For additional information regarding prior Commission action in this investigation, see Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20187.htm>20187</a> (July 9, 2007),  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr20961.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

As laid out in the complaint, Loglisci ensured that investment managers who made the requisite payments to Morris — and other recipients designated by Morris and Loglisci — were rewarded with lucrative investment management contracts, while investment managers who declined to make such payments were denied fund business., The SEC alleges that Loglisci repeatedly directed investment managers, who solicited him for investment business, to Morris or certain other individuals and signaled to the investment managers that they first needed to hire Morris as a finder or placement agent. Neither Morris nor anyone else who received the payments at issue allegedly performed legitimate placement or finder services for the investment management firms who made the payments., In some cases, the investment managers had already allegedly hired a finder or placement agent of their own and were already negotiating an investment with Loglisci when they were told that they also needed to hire Morris or another individual. Once the sham finder fee was agreed upon, Loglisci approved the proposed deal with the investment management firm., The SEC further asserts that Loglisci and Morris took steps to conceal these improper payments and <i>quid pro quo</i> arrangements from relevant members of the Comptrollers investment staff and the funds Investment Advisory Committee. In some instances, the two men even arranged for investment managers to make payments to another individual who would then covertly funnel a portion of these sham fees to Morris, sometimes even without the knowledge of the investment managers. In addition, Morris allegedly paid the girlfriend of a high-ranking member of the Comptrollers staff nearly $100,000 in cash to ensure that the staff member would not ask questions or otherwise reveal the scheme to others., The Complaint further alleges that Loglisci also personally benefited from his role in the scheme. In addition to receiving Morriss support for promotion to Deputy Comptroller, Loglisci obtained funding from Morris and the principal of a private equity firm for a low budget film that Loglisci and his brothers produced., The SECs complaint, which also charges three entities owned and controlled by Morris, alleges violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The complaint seeks permanent injunctions against future violations of the federal securities laws, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties., The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the New York Attorney Generals Office, which today filed related criminal charges against Morris and Loglisci.

The Commissions complaint alleges that during this period certain of these executives, including Abrams, backdated stock option exercises, made fraudulent disclosures concerning Mercurys backlog of sales revenues to manage its reported earnings, and structured fraudulent loans for option exercises by overseas employees to avoid recording expenses., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, Abrams consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining her from violating and/or aiding and abetting violations of the antifraud, financial reporting, record-keeping, internal controls, false statements to auditors, securities ownership reporting and proxy provisions of the federal securities laws, and barring her from serving as an officer or director of a public company. Abrams will pay $2,287,914 in disgorgement, of which $1,498,822 represents the in-the-money benefit from her exercise of backdated option grants, and a $425,000 civil penalty. Under the terms of the settlement, Abrams disgorgement of her in-the-money benefit—$1,498,822—would be deemed satisfied by her previous voluntary payment of that amount to Mercury.

(Afinsa). Escala is a network of companies in the collectibles market specializing in stamps, among other things. Afinsa was a privately held Spanish company that sold investments in portfolios of stamps in Europe. According to the complaint, the fraudulent related-party transactions ceased after May 2006, when Spanish authorities raided Afinsas offices and charged Afinsa and certain individuals with engaging in a massive unlawful pyramid scheme., The SEC complaint alleges a fraudulent business scheme based upon the secret and dramatic manipulation of collectible stamp values, in which Escala, Manning, and Crawford violated the antifraud and reporting provisions of the federal securities laws by:, failing to disclose the related party status of Barrett &amp; Worthen, Inc., resulting in control of the Brookman Catalogue, and failing to disclose the revenues obtained by virtue of Afinsa and Mannings control of the prices in the Brookman Catalogue;, falsely representing that Escala sold Afinsa several large stamp archives at prices determined by reference to independent stamp catalogues and appraisals when in fact Manning set the catalogue prices and influenced and edited the appraisals; and, falsely reporting a payment for business combination-related expenses as the sale of certain antiques. The complaint alleges that Escala and Manning also violated the antifraud provisions by selling back to Afinsa in a round-trip transaction inventory acquired from Afinsa in direct contravention of Escalas public promise not to do so., The complaint alleges that these false and misleading disclosures and omissions were material in that the related-party transactions contributed over $80 million to Escalas revenues and allowed Escala to meet its forecasts for either revenue or pre-tax net income for the third quarter and for year-end of fiscal year 2004, and for the first quarter and year-end in fiscal 2005.

According to the criminal complaint, Vassallo took in $40 million from 150 investors to operate a hedge fund investment program as a massive Ponzi scheme. Vassallo is alleged to have deceived investors about their rates of return, fabricated performance reports, and used investor funds for unauthorized purposes, including to make purported dividend payments to other investors., The Securities and Exchange Commission earlier filed a civil injunctive action against Vassallo, Kenneth Kenitzer, 66, of Pleasanton, California, and their company Equity Investment Management and Trading, Inc.

(IRH), Ottoniel Medrano (a prison guard at California City Correctional Center), and Leticia Isabel Medrano have raised hundreds of thousands of dollars from investors in several states since October 2008. The defendants defrauded investors by falsely claiming, among other things, that Warren Buffett is IRHs Honorary Chairman, that Berkshire Hathaway and Credit Suisse are involved in the investment, and that IRH has $4.8 billion in total assets and owns various properties throughout Asia. After obtaining money from investors, the Medranos transferred funds to offshore bank accounts., The SECs complaint, filed in federal district court in Los Angeles, CA, charges IRH and the Medranos with raising at least $485,000 and likely more than $700,000 in selling preferred stock in IRH. The rate at which the defendants have raised funds has increased substantially over the last two months, averaging about $250,000 per month. According to IRHs offering materials, defendants intended to raise up to $6 billion in the offering., In its lawsuit, the SEC obtained an order (1) freezing the assets of IRH and the Medranos; (2) requiring the repatriation of assets; (3) requiring accountings; (4) prohibiting the destruction of documents; (5) granting expedited discovery; and (6) temporarily enjoining IRH and the Medranos from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

In fact, according to the SEC’s complaint, the defendants did not use investor funds for the oil and gas business but rather to pay Ejedawe’s personal expenses, including cash withdrawals, his apartment rent, and donations to his church.  According to the complaint, Ejedawe is the subject of at least seven separate cease-and-desist or desist-and refrain orders relating to his unregistered offerings of securities, including orders from California, Alabama, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Kansas, and Washington.  Defendants both misrepresented and failed to disclose these state orders to prospective investors., The SEC’s complaint, filed in federal district court in Los Angeles, alleges that since December 2006, the defendants solicited investors by cold-calling them from a boiler room in Los Angeles, California.  Defendants are alleged to have falsely represented to investors that their money would be invested in either working interests in oil and gas leases or interests in oil and gas drilling equipment and to have promised monthly payments of $4,000 to $5,000 for each $50,000 invested.  Contrary to these representations, defendants used investor funds to pay undisclosed commissions to sales representatives, to pay for Ejedawe’s personal expenses, and to make some small payments to complaining investors.  , Yesterday, the SEC obtained an order (1) freezing the assets of Innova Energy, Innova Leasing and Management, and Ejedawe; (2) requiring accountings; (3) prohibiting the destruction of documents; and (4) granting expedited discovery; and (5) temporarily enjoining the Innova entities and Ejedawe from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Cal. filed March 24, 2009)</h2>, <h2>SEC Charges Former Managing Director at Brokerage Merriman Curhan Ford &amp; Co. with Defrauding Customers and Helping Bilk Lenders out of $45 Million</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission filed today a civil injunctive action in federal district court in San Francisco against David Scott Cacchione, a former Managing Director at San Francisco-based brokerage firm Merriman Curhan Ford &amp; Co. (Merriman), alleging that he helped a friend bilk banks and private lenders out of approximately $45 million in 2007 and 2008.  The SEC alleges that Cacchione provided Silicon Valley venture capitalist William J. Boots Del Biaggio III with Merriman customer account statements, which Del Biaggio doctored and used as collateral to obtain fraudulent loans.  In the action, the SEC also charged Cacchione with defrauding his own customers by purchasing risky penny stocks in their accounts without their permission., According to the SEC complaint, Cacchione engaged in two distinct securities fraud schemes.  First, the complaint alleges that Cacchione helped concoct a fraudulent financing scheme with Del Biaggio, a friend and customer who had previously loaned Cacchione over $2 million.  The SEC alleges that, beginning in August 2007, Cacchione emailed account statements of several unknowing Merriman customers to Del Biaggio, who falsified the account statements to make it appear that he owned the assets in the accounts.  Using the doctored statements, the SEC contends that Del Biaggio was able to obtain $45 million in personal loans from banks and private lenders (part of which he used to purchase an interest in a professional hockey team).  According to the SEC, Cacchione furthered the deception by signing documents falsely confirming that Del Biaggio owned the assets in the innocent customers accounts., In the second scheme, according to the SECs complaint, Cacchione bought highly risky, thinly-traded stocks in several of his customers brokerage accounts without his customers permission, and then pocketed more than $30,000 in commissions from the trades.  The SEC alleges that between 2006 and 2007, Cacchione made at least twenty unauthorized trades in the account of a local childrens charity and also traded without permission in the account of an elderly customer., Cacchione, without admitting or denying the complaints allegations, has agreed to a permanent injunction from violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In addition, Cacchione has consented to the institution of public administrative proceedings against him in which he will be barred permanently, pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Exchange Act, from working as a registered representative at a brokerage firm.  Finally, Cacchione also has agreed that, at a later date, the court in this matter shall determine the amount of ill-gotten gains (disgorgement) and civil monetary penalties that Cacchione will be required to pay., The SEC sued Del Biaggio in December 2008 in an action titled <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20820.htm><i>Securities &amp; Exchange Commission v.

A final judgment, by consent, was entered where Del Biaggio was permanently enjoined from further violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  In a separate settled administrative proceeding, the SEC permanently barred Del Biaggio from serving as an investment adviser.  Also in December 2008, the U.S. Attorneys Office filed criminal charges against Del Biaggio.  Del Biaggio pled guilty to the criminal charges in February 2009 and is expected to be sentenced on June 10, 2009., Separately today, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Northern District of California (USAO) also filed criminal charges against Cacchione arising from some of the same conduct that is alleged in the Commissions complaint., The Commissions investigation is continuing.

The SEC alleges that Donnelly orchestrated the scheme through three entities, Tower Analysis Inc., Nasco Tang Corp., and Nadia Capital Corp. The complaint alleges that Donnelly told investors that he would pool their funds to invest in, among other things, stock and bond index derivatives. According to the complaint, despite representations to investors that he had generated annual returns of as much as 22%, Donnelly has done almost no securities trading. The complaint alleges that instead of using investor funds to execute trades, Donnelly used investor funds to repay other investors, and paid himself approximately $1 million in salary and fees during the last three years alone. The complaint also alleges that Donnelly has been soliciting investors for a new fund called Nadia Capital Partners, LP based on misrepresentations about his past trading results., The preliminary injunction enjoins Donnelly and the other defendants from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Additionally, the TRO freezes Nutmegs assets., According to the complaint, Nutmeg and the Gouldings misappropriated over $4 million in client assets by transferring them to third parties.

The Commissions complaint alleges that Defendants William J. Wise, 58, of Raleigh, North Carolina and the Caribbean, and Kristi M. Hoegel, 34, of Napa, California, orchestrated the scheme through companies they control, including co-defendants Millennium Bank of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, its Geneva, Switzerland-based parent, United Trust of Switzerland S.A., and its U.S.-based affiliates, UT of S, LLC and Millennium Financial Group. U.S. District Judge Reed OConnor granted a temporary restraining order, asset freeze, and other emergency relief against Defendants, including the appointment of a receiver to take control of their assets., The complaint alleges that from July 2004 to the present, Millennium Bank, acting through Wise, Kristi Hoegel, Jacqueline S. Hoegel, 52, of American Canyon, California, Brijesh Chopra, 41, residence unknown, and Philippe Angeloni, 63, of Raleigh, North Carolina, raised <em>at least</em> $68 million from over 375 investors. According to the Commissions complaint, the Defendants solicited the funds for purported investment in self-styled CDs which promised returns up to 321% higher than the national overnight average rates offered on traditional bank-issued CDs., The solicitations by the Defendants, which were distributed on the banks website, www.mlnbank.com, and in advertisements in luxury lifestyle magazines, were replete with extensive and fundamental misrepresentations about Millennium Bank and its CDs, according to the Commissions complaint. For example, Millennium Bank mass marketed its CDs as safe and secure with guaranteed rates of return. Millennium Bank also claimed to be the benefactor of Swiss banking . . . as well as the vast global investment network that United Trust of Switzerland S.A. has built over the last 75 years. According to the complaint, however, these assurances were false, because neither Millennium Bank nor UT of S, LLC actually invested any of the money it received from investors. Moreover, United Trust of Switzerland S.A. is not a bank. In reality, investor funds were diverted to the Defendants and used for a variety of illegitimate purposes., The complaint alleges that, in order to create the appearance of a legitimate offshore investment, Defendants instructed investors purchasing the so-called CDs to mail/Federal Express their checks to the offshore bank. Once received, the checks were packaged and mailed to UT of S, LLCs office in Napa, California, where they were electronically deposited by a remote deposit machine into a UT of S, LLC operating account. The account, which is held at a major U.S. financial institution, also received tens of millions of dollars in investor funds via wire transfer., Furthermore, according to the complaint, bank records establish that a vast majority of the $68 million raised from investors was misappropriated by the Defendants, who enriched themselves and paid their personal expenses, while making small Ponzi payments to investors—satisfying investors liquidation requests with recent deposits of new investors., The complaint alleges that the Defendants violated the anti-fraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that the Defendants violated the offering registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act. In addition to the emergency relief granted by the Court, the Commission seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties against the Defendants., The Commissions complaint further alleges that the Defendants funneled some of the $68 million to relatives and other associated persons and entities: Lynn P. Wise, 52, of Raleigh, North Carolina, Daryl C. Hoegel, 54, of American Canyon, California, Ryan D. Hoegel, 29, of Lincoln, California, Laurie H.

Pursuant to the scheme, Shuster and Renteria called Pajcin and Plotkin, and read them key portions of the Inside Wall Street column — a widely-read column that generally moves the price of the securities of companies mentioned in it — prior to the time the column was made available to the public. As a result of the information provided, Pajcin and Plotkin traded in, and/or tipped others with material non-public information concerning at least 10 companies, resulting in collective ill-gotten gains of approximately $280,000. Pajcin and Plotkin paid Renteria approximately $5,000 and paid Shuster approximately $20,000 for the information.

Pajcin executed trades from this account based on material non-public information he received stemming from <i>BusinessWeek</i>, as well as Merrill Lynch, collectively making over $314,000 in ill-gotten gains.

The Commissions action charged that defendants WMDS, Inc. (WMDS), OneUniverseOnLine, Inc. (1UOL), James Bunchan, Seng Tan and Christian Rochon falsely promised members of the Cambodian immigrant community guaranteed monthly returns on investments that purportedly would pass on to future generations. The complaint alleged that the defendants emphasized their shared Cambodian heritage with their victims, and that certain written solicitation documents drew a parallel between investing in WMDS and fulfilling the American dream. In fact, according to the complaint, the defendants were operating a fraudulent pyramid scheme that ceased making the promised monthly payments in mid-2005., The complaint alleged that the defendants violated the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and also violated the registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act. On January 24, 2006, the Commission amended its complaint to add Bunchans former wife as a relief defendant. The Commissions case is pending as to the relief defendant., The final judgments entered by the Court against Bunchan, Tan, Rochon, WMDS and 1UOL came in response to a Commission motion for default judgments and (1) permanently enjoin the defendants from future violations of Sections 17(a) and 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and (2) require the defendants, jointly and severally, to disgorge $26,261,133.16 in ill-gotten gains, such amount to be reduced by any amount forfeited or paid as part of a related criminal proceeding., On November 28, 2007, Bunchan and Tan each were sentenced by the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts in a related criminal action after being convicted of mail fraud, conspiracy and money laundering in connection with the fraudulent investment scheme. Bunchan was sentenced to 35 years in prison and Tan was sentenced to 20 years in prison. On August 7, 2008, Rochon was sentenced by the same court based on his June 4, 2007 guilty plea to mail fraud, conspiracy and money laundering in connection with the fraudulent investment scheme.

Plant to serve 97 months in federal prison for securities fraud, making false statements to the SEC, witness tampering, and obstruction of an agency proceeding, charges to which Jim Plant pled guilty on June 30, 2008., Plant was arrested on March 13, 2007, in St. George, Utah, by agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigations Philadelphia Economic Crimes Squad and the United States Postal Inspection Service on charges of securities fraud and aiding and abetting securities fraud. That same month, the Commission charged CyberKey Solutions, Inc. and Plant for engaging in an ongoing unregistered offering of CyberKey shares while promoting a bogus purchase order from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for more than 150,000 USB thumb drives. Plant falsely claimed that this purchase order was worth more than $24 million, and resulted in net profits of more than $12 million in 2006. In fact, CyberKey had practically no revenues or profits and had never received any purchase order from DHS (or any other governmental agency)., In late 2006 and early 2007, Plant unsuccessfully tried to cover up his fraud by providing the SEC with numerous fake and fraudulent documents, including bogus purchase orders, wire transfers, and bank statements meant to verify the multi-million dollar DHS order. On March 7, 2007, in sworn testimony before the Commission, Plant repeated the false claims that CyberKey had a multi-million dollar contract with DHS and had been receiving payments of several million dollars pursuant to that contract. In addition, when asked by the SEC staff why DHS had no record of any business relationship with CyberKey, Plant fabricated another story, claiming falsely that CyberKeys DHS purchase order was actually through another company, Kikomac., Finally, after the testimony concluded, Plant convinced a CyberKey employee to provide a false confession to federal law enforcement and to take sole responsibility for the creation of the bogus DHS contract as well as the phony documents submitted to the SEC., A restitution hearing is set for April 28, 2009, to determine Plants responsibility for the monetary damages he caused by perpetrating his scheme., For more information, see Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20171.htm>20171</a> and Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20049.htm>20049</a>.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr20979.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Min of Tacoma, Wash., and his company Dime Financial Group LLC for raising more than $6 million in a fraudulent investment scheme that targeted churches, church members and senior citizens. The SEC alleges that Min misled some investors into believing their money would support Third World charitable causes while in fact spending the funds on his own lavish lifestyle and on failed high-risk investments., According to the SECs complaint, Min associated himself with a tight-knit religious and philanthropic community in the Pacific Northwest, creating a not-for-profit entity to attract charitable investors who believed that their investments would support certain Third Word aid groups, such as a charity supporting Bolivian widows and orphans. Min lured other investors by telling them that his trading expertise allowed him to make annual returns as high as 800 percent, and by touting Dime as a safe, low-risk investment for retirees savings. The SEC alleges that Min and Dime deceived more than 60 investors since 2005 into buying interests in Dimes purportedly prosperous investment program., According to the SECs complaint, filed in federal court in Seattle, Min told investors that he would use their money to trade in the foreign currency exchange (Forex) market. The SEC alleges that Min instead misappropriated about $1.4 million of investors funds to finance a lavish lifestyle that included a $70,000 Mercedes, expensive vacations, and private school tuition for his children. Min also illicitly used investor funds to bankroll a failed film venture about evangelical churches, and to pay expenses relating to the operation of the fraud. When Min did actually invest the funds, his trading record was abysmal. He lost more than $5 million on the Forex market, according to the SECs complaint., To conceal the fraud, Min sent investors false account statements reporting high returns, while he was actually depleting the entire investment pool through theft and trading losses. Min lied about his and Dimes credentials by, among other things, falsely telling investors that Dime was supervised by an Advisory Board populated by accomplished individuals., The SECs litigated action against Min and Dime charges both with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

(Take-Two), alleging that during a seven year period, Take-Two defrauded investors by granting backdated, undisclosed in the money stock options to officers, directors, and key employees while failing to record required non-cash charges for option-related compensation expenses., The Complaint alleges that on over 100 occasions from 1997 through September 2003, Take-Two looked back and picked grant dates for the Companys incentive stock options, resulting in grants of in-the-money options. According to the Complaint, Take-Two used several means to backdate options, including pre-priced option pools, backdating of employment agreements, and pick-a-date backdating, whereby a set exercise price for the grants was chosen, and then a past grant date was selected when Take-Twos stock price most closely corresponded to the set exercise price. On at least 26 occasions, the backdated grant dates coincided with dates of historically low annual and quarterly closing prices for Take-Twos common stock. These fortuitous grant dates, the complaint alleges, could not have been selected so consistently without the benefit of hindsight. According to the Complaint, Take-Two granted these options without complying with its own stock option plans and, generally, without the Board or a Committee thereof approving the grant dates or exercise prices. The Complaint alleges that Take-Two officers and employees prepared documents falsely indicating that the option grants had been made on earlier dates when Take-Twos stock price had closed lower., The Complaint alleges that because of the undisclosed backdating scheme, Take Two filed with the Commission and disseminated to investors current, quarterly and annual reports, proxy statements and registration statements that contained materially false and misleading statements concerning the true grant dates and proper exercise prices of stock options. In doing so, Take-Two created the false and misleading impression that stock options were granted in accordance with the terms of the applicable stock option plans. According to the Complaint, Take-Two materially understated its compensation expenses and materially overstated its quarterly and annual pre-tax earnings and earnings per share in its financial statements. On February 28, 2007, Take-Two restated historical financial results for multiple years to record additional non-cash charges for option-related compensation expenses totaling $42.1 million net of tax., Without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions Complaint, Take-Two consented to the entry of an order: (1) permanently enjoining it from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B) and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13 and 14a-9; and (2) requiring it to pay a $3 million civil penalty.

The complaint alleges that Stein made material misrepresentations and omissions to induce individuals to invest in Gemini and DISP and then deceived investors by producing false statements reflecting healthy returns over the life of their investments.  The Commission further alleges that in the past several months, Stein has turned to stealing client funds to keep his scheme going.  Beginning in May 2008 and continuing into March 2009, Stein converted millions of dollars from a single client to pay off investors and pay personal expenses, including the purchase of a million dollar Manhattan condominium., The Commission alleged the following.  In 1992, Stein set up Gemini as an investment fund, which he claimed was a feeder fund to other investment vehicles engaging in arbitrage and hedge trading.  Instead, the primary investment Stein made with Gemini money was in Detour Media Group, Inc., an entity that published a fashion magazine called Detour.  In a petition signed by Stein as its President, Detour Media filed for protection under Chapter 7 of the bankruptcy laws in 2003.  However, Stein continued to solicit investments in Gemini and has continued to issue statements to his investors reflecting healthy returns over the life of their investments., In 2002, Stein set up DISP as an investment fund to invest in life settlement policies. While DISP did buy some life insurance policies with investor funds, it has not bought any since at least 2004 and Stein transferred the portfolio of policies DISP held to Vibrant, a Stein controlled entity, without disclosing the transfer to existing or prospective DISP investors.  Stein also used DISP investor funds to pay off Gemini investors., The Commissions complaint charges violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) the Investment Advisers Act of 1940., Judge Lynch of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York granted the Commissions request for an order temporarily restraining Stein, freezing his assets and those of the relief defendants, and ordering accountings of Stein and the relief defendants.  The SECs complaint also seeks a final judgment permanently enjoining Stein from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering him to pay financial penalties and to disgorge ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest., The United States Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York (USAO) announced criminal charges against Stein., The Commissions investigation is ongoing.

In fact, according to the SECs complaint, Defendants expended investor funds for their own personal use or sent money to other entities under their control.  Proctor and McCoy are also alleged to have diverted funds to three additional entities, Sun Commerce and Investment, Infinity Investment Club LLC, and Sunland Investment Club, LLC, which the SEC charged as relief defendants., The SECs complaint, filed in federal district court in Santa Ana, alleges that Proctor represented to prospective Sun Empire investors they would receive at least $35,000 per month on a $4,995 investment and that their investments were guaranteed to be safe.  She allegedly represented that the funds from each investment group are pooled with other investment clubs funds to create one super corporation.  The complaint alleges that Proctor represented that these pooled funds were then invested in secure offshore investments.  Proctor and McCoy are alleged to have told potential ECAM investors they were able to obtain favorable rates for investors money based on the large sums of pooled money.  McCoy allegedly explained that Proctor has access to financial vehicles only available to extremely wealthy individuals., The complaint also alleges that Proctor and McCoy presented several purported investment programs offered by ECAM during presentations at the Desert Palms Hotel and Suites.  McCoy described the first program as the College Advantage Program (CAP), in which an investor invests $5,000 and, if the investment is on behalf of a child between the ages of one (1) and nine (9) years old, the investor is guaranteed to receive $1,000,000 by the time the investors child enters college.  McCoy also allegedly described a retirement account similar to an IRA or 401K, which was a purported roll-over program that did not require payment of taxes on the appreciation until retirement.  McCoy stated that this program had an investment return of 4% every month, equaling an annual return rate of 48%.  McCoy also offered certificates of deposit with returns five to ten times higher than those available through banks.  McCoy added that these returns are guaranteed.  Finally, McCoy and Proctor allegedly offered entry into a pyramid scheme in which individuals interested in ECAM could obtain one of 125 positions in the ECAM organization by accumulating funds to invest in the program.  The offered positions purport to be related to the amount of money each person obtained from other investors.  McCoy and Proctor promised that investors in ECAM would receive at least a 36% return on their investments per year.  The complaint also alleges that they assured investors nothing could happen to the investments and that the investments were never at risk., In fact, according to the complaint, investors did not receive returns as promised and money from investors went into accounts controlled by Proctor instead of going into foreign investments, CDs, or other promised forms of investment.  McCoy allegedly claimed the investments complied with securities registration exemptions pursuant to Regulation D of the Securities Act of the 1930s and 1940s, which was not true., The SEC obtained an order (1) freezing the assets of Sun Empire, ECAM, Proctor, and McCoy; (2) requiring accountings; (3) prohibiting the destruction of documents; and (4) granting expedited discovery; and (5) temporarily enjoining Sun Empire, ECAM, Proctor, and McCoy from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The complaint alleges that, from July 2001 to January 2009, Wise raised more than $67 million from approximately 125 investors by touting his 10 to 15 years of experience in real estate investments and luring investors with promises of lucrative annual returns ranging from 12% to 22%.

The Commission’s complaint alleges that Defendant Weizhen Tang, 50, of Toronto orchestrated the fraud scheme through entities he controls, including Defendants Oversea Chinese Fund Limited Partnership (“Hedge Fund”) and WinWin Capital Management, LLC, a Plano, Texas-based investment adviser (“Investment Adviser”).  U.S. District Judge Jane Boyle granted a temporary restraining order, asset freeze, and other emergency relief against the Defendants, including the appointment of a receiver to take control of assets belonging to the Investment Adviser and two Relief Defendants —  WinWin Capital Partners, LP, and Bluejay Investment, LLC, d/b/a Vintage International Investment, LLC. , The complaint alleges that from at least as early as 2004 to the present, Tang, acting through the Hedge Fund and other entities he controls, raised between $50 million and $75 million from more than 200 investors.  According to the Commission’s complaint, Weizhen Tang (the self-described “Chinese Warren Buffet”) recently admitted to investors that the Hedge Fund operated as a Ponzi scheme since at least 2006.  Specifically, the Commission alleges that Tang told investors in February 2009 that he and the Hedge Fund posted false profits on investors’ account statements for the purpose of concealing substantial trading losses, and to attract new investors to the Hedge Fund.  Further, the Commission alleges that Tang admitted he used funds from new investors to return principal and pay out “fake” profits to other investors, which totaled at least $8 million in 2006, 2007, and 2008 — despite significant trading losses incurred during that time., According to the Commission’s complaint, Tang specifically targeted members of the Chinese-American community and solicited U.S. investors to directly and indirectly invest in the Hedge Fund.  The Commission alleges that since at least November 2007, Tang raised capital for the Hedge Fund from U.S. investors by offering and selling limited partnership interests in WinWin Capital Limited Partnership.  The Commission alleges that WinWin Partners’ sole business is investing partnership capital in the Hedge Fund.  As detailed in the complaint, WinWin Partners had raised, as of March 10, 2009, almost $17.3 million in principal investments from approximately 75 investors, most of which are located in the Dallas area, but also include investors in California.  According to the complaint, the U.S. investors have withdrawn approximately $8.4 million from the Hedge Fund, of which at least $700,000 was paid out as purported profits; leaving nearly $9.6 million in investor principal unaccounted for.  The Commission further alleges that, consistent with Tang’s recent confession to investors, funds invested with WinWin Partners were used to pay other investors in a Ponzi fashion., The complaint alleges that the Defendants Oversea Chinese Fund, Limited Partnership, Weizhen Tang &amp; Associates, Inc., Weizhen Tang Corp., WinWin Capital Management, LLC, WinWin Capital Limited Partnership, J.O.R &amp; Associates, LLC, and Weizhen Tang violated the anti-fraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the offering registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933.  The complaint also alleges that Tang, Weizhen Tang &amp; Associates, Inc., J.O.R &amp; Associates, LLC, and WinWin Capital Management, LLC violated Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and Tang, Weizhen Tang &amp; Associates, Inc., and J.O.R &amp; Associates, LLC violated Section 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.  In addition to the emergency relief granted by the Court, the Commission seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties against the Defendants., Finally, the Commission’s complaint alleges that the Defendants funneled some investor funds to associated persons and entities: WinWin Capital Partners LP and Bluejay Investment LLC d/b/a Vintage International Investment LLC.

On April 6, 2009, the Honorable Judge Jane Boyle of the U.S. District Court in Dallas entered final judgments against Beverage Creations, Inc., former Chief Executive Officer Robert Wieden and former Chief Operating Officer Patrick Dado., In March 2008, the SEC sued Beverage Creations, Inc. and several stock promoters alleging that they sold 30 million shares of stock to the public without a registration statement filed or in effect. According to the complaint, the stock promoters (1) purchased shares directly from Beverage Creations, Inc., (2) touted Beverage Creations, Inc. to investors through a nationwide marketing campaign, and (3) immediately dumped their shares into the public market at grossly inflated prices. The SEC also charged that Beverage Creations, Inc. participated in the touting by issuing a false press release denying any relationship between the company and one of the stock promoters. In December 2008, the SEC amended its complaint to add Beverage Creations, Inc. officers Robert Wieden and Patrick Dado. According to the amended complaint, Wieden and Dado were responsible for Beverage Creations, Inc.s public offering, and they authored and approved the false press release.

The Complaint further alleges that Copeland promoted investments orally and through written materials claiming to earn 15-18 percent interest per year, and claiming that investor funds would be loaned in connection with real estate transactions, including private mortgage lending. Through entities which he controlled, Copeland directed the unregistered offer and sale of promissory notes evidencing the investor loans. The notes were often collateralized by security deeds to which Copeland signed the names of fictitious persons., The Complaint alleges that Copeland represented to investors that the loans were safe and secured by real estate. In reality, Copeland used comparatively few of the investor funds in connection with real estate acquisition or development. The Complaint also alleges that Copeland promised, among other things, a current rate of return of 15 percent and represented to investors past returns as high as 18 percent. In reality, the representations were false and misleading because Copeland never consistently generated 15 percent annual returns and was not investing the funds as represented. The Complaint further alleges that Copeland deposited investor funds into four bank accounts in the name of his law firm, and that he misappropriated millions of dollars of investor funds for his personal use, spending the funds in connection with his personal residence, vehicles, and expensive artwork, among other things., The Complaint alleges that Copeland has violated the registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Flores, 42, of El Segundo, California, and her El Segundo, California-based company Maximum Return Investments, Inc. (MRI) for operating a fraudulent investment scheme that attracted more than 150 investors in seven states between late 2006 and early 2008.  According to the complaint, the scheme purported to use investor funds to invest in risk-free, high-yield investment programs in real estate, commodities, and bank instrument trading.  Flores and MRI raised approximately $23 million from investors while promising returns of up to 25 percent within 30 to 45 days.  The SEC alleges, however, that Flores and MRI were operating a Ponzi-like scheme that used approximately $13 million from new investors to pay principal and returns due to earlier investors.  The complaint further alleges that Flores also misappropriated more than $3.5 million of investor funds for personal expenses, including $443,000 to purchase a home, and almost $1.5 million of investor money to finance MRI’s operations, most of which was used to pay for a lavish party celebrating MRI’s alleged financial success.  , According to the SEC’s complaint, Flores and MRI solicited investors in the Hispanic-American community through word of mouth, referrals, and testimonials by investors.  As alleged in the complaint, Flores claimed all investor funds would be used to invest in MRI’s risk-free, high-yield investment programs and touted to investors that their principal would be “guaranteed safe.”  Promotional materials falsely represented that an investor’s principal would be fully secured by a bank-endorsed guarantee and MRI’s promissory notes claimed the investment was insured.  However, the SEC alleges that Flores and MRI neither guaranteed nor insured the $23 million raised from investors and only used $5.6 million of this amount to invest in high-risk ventures and start-up companies that had never paid MRI any returns., The SEC’s complaint charges Flores and MRI with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, and civil penalties., MRI investors seeking more information about this case should contact the SEC’s hotline that is in English, at 323-965-3313, or in Spanish, at 323-965-3314.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr20997.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The seven individuals defrauded scores of investors of more than $12 million by making numerous misrepresentations, including promises of returns as high as 75 percent, to encourage them to invest in two hedge funds - the Logos Fund and the Donum Fund.  Instead of investing the money as promised, the defendants misappropriated millions of dollars to furnish their own lavish lifestyles with purchases of luxury cars, jewelry, clothing, meals, and expensive foreign travel., According to the Commissions complaint, filed in federal court in Brooklyn, NY, the fraudulent scheme was orchestrated by seven individuals who were active members and leaders of the church:  Isaac I. Ovid; Aaron Riddle; J. Jonathan Coleman; Stephen Cina; Cory A. Martin; Timothy Smith; and Robert J. Riddle.  The Complaint alleges that these individuals used two entities to carry out the fraudulent scheme:  Jadis Capital, Inc. - the hedge fund manager of the Logos Fund and the Donum Fund - and Jadis Capitals subsidiary, Jadis Investments, LLC, a registered investment adviser and the investment manager of the funds., The SECs complaint alleges that between January and November 2005, the defendants raised more than $12 million from more than 80 investors in the two funds by making material misrepresentations including promises of incredible returns.  The defendants misrepresented the performance of the Logos Fund, the amount of assets under management, the identity and skill of the portfolio managers, and the level of supervision of the portfolio managers.  The defendants also misrepresented the registration status of the Donum Fund by falsely claiming to investors that the fund was registered with the SEC., The SECs complaint further alleges that instead of investing the investor funds as promised, the defendants misappropriated investor funds almost as soon as they were obtained, using the money to buy luxury items including a Bentley automobile and expensive watches.  They also used investor assets to pay for unauthorized operating expenses incurred by Jadis Capital and Jadis Investments, such as the construction of lavish offices, and to satisfy prior debts owed by Ovid., The SECs complaint charges each of the defendants (except Logos Fund) with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting each others violation of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Kuykendall, and Steven M. Ivester in connection with a financial fraud involving VoIP, Inc., a defunct Internet telecommunications provider formerly located in Altamonte Springs, Florida.  The Commissions complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, alleges that Pitters, VoIPs former Chief Financial Officer, and Kuykendall, the former General Manager of a VoIP subsidiary, recorded fictitious sales when it became apparent that the subsidiary would not meet VoIPs revenue projections in 2004 and the first quarter of 2005.  Pitters and Kuykendall recorded sham transactions with third parties, thereby inflating the subsidiarys revenues.  Pitters further provided false sales journals and fictitious invoices to VoIPs auditors during its audit for fiscal year 2004.  As a result, VoIP filed a Form 10-K and two Forms 10-Q with the Commission that overstated the companys revenues by more than 40%., The complaint further alleges that Ivester, VoIPs former Chief Executive Officer, was aware the subsidiary was struggling financially, but did not question the suspiciously high revenue figures.  By November 2004, Ivester knew the subsidiary had generated $400,000 or less in revenues since its acquisition by VoIP, and that unpaid vendor bills and technical problems with VoIPs voice-over-Internet systems were hindering sales.  Yet Ivester did not question the consolidated figures showing the subsidiary had generated over $790,000 in additional revenues before the end of 2004, and that its revenues had increased again substantially in the first quarter of 2005.  In addition, the Complaint alleges in 2004 and 2005, Ivester sold more than four million shares of VoIP stock and that he failed to report the sales transactions with the Commission by filing the required Forms 4 until December 2005., The Commissions complaint charges Pitters and Kuykendall with violating the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and charges Ivester with violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act.  The complaint further charges Pitters and Kuykendall with aiding and abetting VoIPs violations of the reporting, books and records, and internal control provisions under Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13; charges Pitters and Kuykendall with direct violations of Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1; and further charges Pitters with knowingly making false statements to VoIPs auditors, in violation of  Rule 3b2-2 under the Exchange Act.  Finally, the complaint charges Ivester and Pitters with violations of the officer certification provisions under Rule 13a-14 under the Exchange Act, and charges Ivester with violations of the beneficial ownership reporting provisions under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 16a-3 thereunder.  The Commissions complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief against all defendants, enjoining them from future violations of the provisions charged, and an order requiring them to disgorge their ill-gotten gains, with prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties against each of them., On April 13, 2009, the Commission also suspended trading in VoIPs securities for ten days and instituted public administrative proceedings to determine whether the registration of its securities should be suspended or revoked.  The Commission also entered an order against VoIPs former independent auditor, Jesus A.

In this settled action, the Court ordered the Tri Energy Defendants to pay $35 million in disgorgement and $2,048,466 in prejudgment interest, and ordered Simburg and Jennings to each pay a civil penalty of $7 million.  $28,058,310 of the disgorgement is deemed satisfied by the criminal restitution ordered in a parallel criminal proceeding.  In the  criminal case, Simburg was sentenced on November 17, 2008, to nine years imprisonment after entering into a plea agreement.  Jennings was convicted after a jury trial on July 11, 2008, and sentenced to twelve years imprisonment on November 17, 2008.  Defendant Henry Jones was extradited from Hong Kong and convicted after a jury trial on July 11, 2008, and was sentenced to twenty years imprisonment on April 3, 2009.  This $50 million Ponzi scheme and affinity fraud has a long history, numerous defendants, and has resulted in several court actions both civil and criminal., The Commissions Amended Complaint, filed on August 10, 2006, alleged that the aforementioned defendants, and others, perpetrated a massive affinity fraud and Ponzi scheme involving a purported coal mine venture and a so-called international gold deal.  The Complaint alleged that defendants had been telling investors that these extraordinary profits were to be generated in part by helping an unnamed Saudi Arabian prince move gold from Israel through Luxembourg to the United Arab Emirates.  In reality, according to the Complaint, although some money had been paid out to investors, those funds appeared to havecome from new investor money, and substantial amounts of investor funds had been transferred to bank accounts controlled by some of the defendants and relief defendants.  Defendants recruited potential victims through claims that their investments were aimed, at least in part, at raising money for humanitarian and religious efforts.  The defendants promised their victims outlandish returns on their investments of 100-1000% in as little as 60 days.  Over 500 investors lost more than $50 million in the scheme., The Court previously on August 13, 2007, enjoined the Tri Energy Defendants from violations of the reporting and anti-fraud provisions of the securities laws (Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10-b-5 thereunder), and specifically enjoined them from soliciting investments of the type at issue in the Commissions lawsuit.  The Commission obtained a default judgment against Jones and his companies Marina Investors Group, Inc. and Global Village Records on March 20, 2008, enjoining them from future violations of the same provisions identified above, as well ordering $22,291,725 in disgorgement, $2,073,922 in prejudgment interest, and a $7 million civil penalty.  The Commission also obtained final judgments against relief defendant Thomas Avery and his company T.M.A. Investment Enterprises and relief defendant R.P.J.

The SEC previously charged Henry Hank Morris and David Loglisci for orchestrating the fraudulent scheme to enrich Morris and others with close ties to them.  Specifically, the SEC alleges that Wissman arranged some of the payments made to Morris, and Wissman was rewarded with at least $12 million in sham finder or placement agent fees.  Harding received approximately $800,000 in sham fees that were arranged by Morris and Loglisci., The SECs amended complaint alleges that the payments to Morris, Wissman, Harding and certain others were kickbacks that resulted from quid pro quo arrangements or that were otherwise fraudulently induced by the defendants.  Loglisci ensured that investment managers that made the requisite payments - to Morris, Wissman, Harding, and certain other recipients designated by Morris and Loglisci - were rewarded with lucrative investment management contracts, while investment managers who declined to make such payments were denied fund business.  Morris, Wissman, Harding and the others who received the payments at issue did not perform bona fide placement or finder services for the investment management firms that made the payments., The SECs amended complaint additionally charges three entities through which Wissman perpetrated the fraud - Flandana Holdings Ltd., Tuscany Enterprises LLC, and W Investment Strategies LLC - as well as two investment management firms with which he was affiliated at the time, HFV Management L.P. and HFV Asset Management L.P.  According to the SECs amended complaint, Wissman was a longtime family friend of Loglisci and a key participant in the kickback scheme.  Wissman worked with Loglisci and Morris to extract sham finder fee payments for Morris and for himself from investment managers.  Wissman received millions of dollars in sham fees and other illicit payments, and arranged millions of dollars in additional payments for Morris.  In addition, Wissman caused HFV Management L.P. and HFV Asset Management L.P. to pay sham finder fees to Morris in one New York State Common Retirement Fund transaction., According to the SECs amended complaint, Harding was a political ally who was allegedly inserted by Morris and Loglisci into at least two fund transactions for the sole purpose of compensating Harding, and Harding received a total of approximately $800,000 in sham finder fees.  In one of those transactions, the investment management firm already had a finder and Morris arranged for that finder to secretly split his fee with Harding.  In another transaction, Morris and Loglisci simply inserted Harding as a finder on an investment solely for the purpose of directing money to Harding., In a partial settlement of the SECs charges, Wissman and Flandana Holdings Ltd. have consented, without admitting or denying the SECs allegations, to the entry of a partial final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers Act) and defers the determination of disgorgement and financial penalties until a later date., In addition, HFV Management and HFV Asset Management have consented, without admitting or denying the SECs allegations, to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act and Section 206(2) of the Advisers Act, and that orders them to pay a penalty in the aggregate amount of $150,000. , The SECs charges against Harding remain pending.

Kelly (Kelly), a former resident of North Liberty, Indiana and Cancun, Mexico, in connection with a civil injunctive action filed in September, 2007 against Kelly and 25 other defendants. The order, entered with Kellys consent, permanently enjoins him from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder., The SECs complaint in this matter charges that Kelly and 25 other defendants participated in a massive fraud on U.S. investors that involved the offer and sale of securities in the form of Universal Lease investments. Universal Leases were structured as timeshares in several hotels in Cancun, Mexico, coupled with a pre-arranged rental agreement that promised investors a high, fixed rate of return. The SECs complaint alleges that from 1999 until 2005, Kelly and others raised at least $428 million through the Universal Lease scheme from investors throughout the United States, with more than $136 million of the funds invested coming from IRA accounts. The SEC further alleges that Kelly used a nationwide network of unregistered salespeople who sold the Universal Leases and collected undisclosed commissions totaling more than $72 million. The SEC also alleges that Kelly and others ran the scheme from Cancun, Mexico through a number of foreign entities in Mexico and Panama. According to the SECs complaint, Kelly and others told investors that Universal Leases would generate guaranteed income through the leasing of investor timeshares by a large, independent leasing agent. In fact, the complaint alleges the leasing agent was a small Panamanian travel agency controlled by Kelly and for most of the scheme its payments to investors came from accounts funded by money raised from new investors. Further, the complaint alleges that Kelly and others failed to disclose key facts about the Universal Lease investments, including the risks of the investments and that more than $72 million in investor funds were used to pay commissions as high as 27% to the selling brokers. The SEC continues to pursue its claims against Kelly for disgorgement and civil penalties.

The Complaint alleged that after this information was conveyed to the Board of Directors, a Fidelity Board member cautioned the directors not to trade in LendingTree securities because they had been provided with confidential information., The Complaint alleged that two days after the Board meeting, Talbot breached the fiduciary duty he owed to Fidelity and purchased 5,000 shares of LendingTree stock at $13.50 per share on the basis of the material, non-public information he misappropriated from Fidelity. According to the Complaint, Talbot similarly purchased an additional 5,000 shares of LendingTree at $14.50 per share on April 30, 2003. The Complaint further alleged that on May 5, 2003, the day that USA Interactive announced that it would acquire LendingTree, Talbot sold his 10,000 shares of LendingTree stock, realizing illicit profits of $67,881., This concludes the Commissions action against Talbot.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21004.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

According to the Commissions complaint, since mid-2005 Donald Anthony Walker Young, of Coatesville, Pennsylvania, through Acorn Capital Management, LLC (Acorn Capital), a registered investment adviser controlled by Young, has misappropriated more than $23 million from investors buying into limited partnership interests in Acorn II, L.P., (Acorn LP) which invested in publicly traded securities. Young used investor funds to pay other investors in the nature of a Ponzi scheme, and directly stole some of the money to purchase a vacation home in Palm Beach, Florida, and pay personal expenses related to horse ownership and racing, construction, boats, limousines, chartered aircraft and other luxuries. He has also directed funds to others. According to the Commissions complaint, the defendants refused to provide Commission staff with client files, account statements, general ledgers and other documents that are statutorily required to be maintained and produced by registered investment advisers., The Honorable John R. Padova, U.S. District Judge for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, has issued an order granting a temporary restraining order, freezing assets, and imposing other emergency relief. The Court also froze the assets of three named relief defendants — Oak Grove Partners, L.P., W. B. Dixon Stroud, Jr. and Neely Young, Youngs wife., The Commissions complaint alleges that Young established Acorn LP in 2001 for the purpose of investing in securities, and he has nearly complete control of all aspects of the operations and makes all of the investment decisions. In addition, he has complete control of and access to the assets of Acorn LP held at a broker-dealer. Young also controls the information provided to investors, accountants and the broker-dealer and he has used this information flow to provide false information about investor deposits and withdrawals, and to perpetuate the scheme., The complaint further alleges that, although the Acorn LP account currently holds approximately $3 million for approximately 40 investors, Young has told investors through quarterly and annual statements that their account balances are much higher. In February 2009, Young gave phony documents to employees at the broker-dealer to deceive them into believing that Acorn LP held an additional $23 million at two other broker-dealers., The complaint alleges violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 204, 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rules 204-2 and 206(4)-8 thereunder.

Investors ultimately deposited a total of $12.2 million into a designated bank account, but no buy-sell transactions ever occurred. Instead, Praise and others absconded with the funds., In the second offering, the Commission alleges that defendants Burke and Praise told an investor that a company Burke controlled had arranged to purchase a 500 million euro medium-term note, which they would use to support a trading program. Burke and Praise told the investor he would receive $10 million in 30 days, plus trading profits over the next year. At their direction, the investor deposited $2.5 million into an account controlled by defendant William F.

The Commission’s complaint alleges, among other things, that Defendant Francesco Rusciano, 27, of Stamford, Connecticut, in selling interests in the Hedge Fund, (i) forged documents, (ii) promised false returns, and (iii) misrepresented assets managed by the Hedge Fund.  U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks granted a temporary restraining order, asset freeze, and other emergency relief against the Defendants.     , The Commission’s complaint alleges that from at least as early as September 1, 2007 to the present, the Hedge Fund, acting through Rusciano, raised at least $31 million from at least 15 investors.  According to the Commission’s complaint, on at least two occasions, Rusciano forged brokerage account statements for the Hedge Fund to make it appear that the Hedge Fund had millions of dollars more in assets than it actually had.  Specifically, the Commission alleges that Rusciano provided a selling agent for the Hedge Fund a January 11, 2008 brokerage statement, reflecting an account balance for Ponta Negra Fund I of $42,967,338.90.  According to the Commission’s complaint, the correct balance for that account as of January 11, 2008 was $2,967,338.90 — $40 million less than the amount represented by Rusciano.  Similarly, the Commission alleges that, on August 5, 2008, Rusciano produced to another selling agent a brokerage account statement reflecting an “equity” balance for Ponta Negra Fund, LLC of more $64 million.  According to the Commission’s complaint, Rusciano altered the August 1, 2008 account statement by, among other things, redacting the word “excess” in the “excess equity” field on the account statement to make it appear as though the Hedge Fund had in excess of $64 million in that account.  In reality, the account had less than $7 million., According to the Commission’s complaint, Rusciano also misrepresented the Hedge Fund’s monthly and yearly performance results.  With regard to monthly returns, the Commission alleges that Rusciano falsely represented that the Hedge Fund had consistently achieved positive results for every month throughout 2007 and 2008.  In fact, in the account that held most of its assets, the Hedge Fund lost money in 10 of the 24 months from March 2007 through March 2009.  With regard to yearly results, the Commission alleges that Rusciano misrepresented that the Hedge Fund earned total annual returns of 42.99% for 2007, 24.85% for 2008, and 6.14% for the first two months of 2009.  In reality, the account that held most of the Hedge Funds’ assets suffered substantial trading losses in 2007, had modest profits in 2008, and again sustained losses in 2009.  Finally, the Commission alleges that, on April 21, 2009, Rusciano sent an email to a selling agent for the Hedge Fund, detailing the Hedge Fund’s assets under management.  According to the e-mail, the Hedge Fund had $59 million in assets under management as of February 2009.  According to the Commission’s complaint, the Hedge Fund had less than $10 million.  , The complaint alleges that Defendants Ponta Negra Fund I, LLC, Ponta Negra Offshore Fund I, Ltd., Ponta Negra Group, LLC, and Francesco Rusciano violated the anti-fraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The SEC obtained additional relief against Pang including an order requiring him to repatriate assets sent overseas and turn over to the court all of his passports.  The SEC’s complaint alleges that Pang and his Irvine, Calif.-based firms Private Equity Management Group, Inc. and Private Equity Management Group LLC (the PEM Group) violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder., The SEC alleges that Pang and the PEM Group misled investors by falsely claiming that their returns would come from proceeds made on the timeshare or insurance policies investments.  Instead, some of the purported returns were paid out of funds raised from newer investors.  Furthermore, in at least one instance, the PEM Group presented investors with a forged $108 million insurance policy to support a false claim that a particular investment was entirely covered by insurance. , The SEC also alleges that Pang and the PEM Group attracted investors by falsely representing Pang as a former senior vice president and high-tech merger adviser from Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. with an MBA from the University of California at Irvine.  Pang never worked at Morgan Stanley nor did he attend or obtain any degrees from UC Irvine.  Neither Pang nor his entities have ever been registered with the SEC., According to the SEC’s complaint, Pang and the PEM Group have been engaged in the fraudulent offering of securities since at least 2003 and raised several hundreds of millions of dollars from investors, primarily located in Taiwan.  Pang and the PEM Group told investors that they would generate enough profit to pay returns on their investments through purchasing life insurance policies at a discount before maturity and then collecting the proceeds of the policy upon the death of the insured.  In fact, the life insurance policies did not generate sufficient profit to cover the cost of the premiums to maintain the policies and pay the purported returns to investors.  Pang instead directed PEM Group to use funds raised from subsequent investors, who were supposed to be investing in timeshares, to pay the purported returns of earlier investors in the ill-fated life insurance investment., The SEC alleges that Pang and the PEM Group claimed that both principal and interest were insured and “guaranteed” by the purported $108 million of insurance when in fact the relevant insurance policy was for approximately $31 million.

The Commission alleges that Strauss and Hozie engaged in accounting fraud and made false and misleading disclosures that were designed to conceal from investors that American Home Mortgages financial condition and prospects had significantly worsened in the first four months of 2007., The complaint alleges that Strauss and Hozie fraudulently understated American Home Mortgages first quarter 2007 loan loss reserves by tens of millions of dollars, converting the companys loss into a fictional profit. In fact, as Strauss and Hozie knew, the companys own analysis showed that American Home Mortgage needed significant additional reserves. The analysis also showed that the companys losses on its delinquent second liens were mounting quickly and that American Home Mortgage would lose at least 72% of the value of these loans after the properties went through foreclosure. Strauss and Hozie knowingly failed to reserve adequately for the expected losses caused by these delinquent loans., According to the SECs complaint, Strauss and Hozie made misleading disclosures concerning, among other things, the riskiness of the mortgages the company originated and held and the companys liquidity. Strauss and Hozie also failed to disclose the fact that, during the month of April 2007, American Home Mortgage was forced to sell the majority of its multi-billion dollar mortgage-backed securities portfolio to meet pressing liquidity demands. The complaint further alleges that Strauss, Hozie and Bernstein misled American Home Mortgages auditor about the adequacy of the reserves., The complaint alleges that Strauss and Hozie violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint further charges (i) Strauss and Hozie with aiding and abetting American Home Mortgages violations of Section 10(b) and Rules 10b-5 and 13a-11 of the Exchange Act; (ii) Strauss, Hozie and Bernstein with aiding and abetting American Home Mortgages violations of the reporting, books and records, and internal control provisions under Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-13 thereunder; and (iii) Strauss, Hozie and Bernstein with direct violations of Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder. Finally, the complaint charges Strauss and Hozie with violations of the officer certification provisions under Rule 13a-14 of the Exchange Act. The Commissions complaint seeks permanent injunctions against future violations, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and the imposition of civil penalties. The complaint also seeks officer and director bars against Strauss and Hozie., Strauss has agreed to settle the SECs charges without admitting or denying the allegations. He will be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud, reporting, record-keeping, and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws and will pay approximately $2.2 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest and a $250,000 penalty. Strauss will also be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.

The complaint further alleges that, immediately after learning this information, Browne sold his entire position in SGLP (5,200 units), at an average price of $24.06 per share.

Story, United States District Judge for the Northern District of Georgia, entered default judgment as to defendants Frederick J. Barton (Barton), Barton Asset Management, LLC (Barton Asset Management), and TwinSpan Capital Management, LLC (TwinSpan) on April 27, 2009. The judgment restrained and enjoined all of the defendants from future violations of Sections 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934(Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and also enjoined defendants Barton and TwinSpan from future violations arising from their violation of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-9 thereunder. The judgment also granted injunctive relief against all of the defendants from future violations of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940., The court ordered disgorgement against Barton in the amount of $3,170,000, of which $1,021,900 is owed jointly and severally with TwinSpan, and $685,000 is owed jointly and severally with Barton Asset Management. The court further ordered prejudgment interest against Barton in the amount of $945,110.92, of which $265,936.86 is owed jointly and severally with TwinSpan, and $106,589.43 is owed jointly and severally with Barton Asset Management. Further, the court ordered Barton, Barton Asset Management and TwinSpan to pay civil penalties in the amounts of $120,000, $60,000 and $60,000, respectively. The defendants were ordered to pay the above amounts within 10 business days after the entry of the default judgment., The courts judgment specifically found that between approximately May 1999 and December 2003, Barton, acting individually or through Barton Asset Management, misappropriated approximately $970,000 from a single, elderly brokerage customer of his who suffered from diminished mental capacity arising from Alzheimers disease, and that Barton tricked her into selling the securities in her brokerage account and providing him and Barton Asset Management with the proceeds of those sales. The court also found that between October 2004 and October 2005, Barton and TwinSpan engaged in a $1.515 million offering fraud involving ten investors. Barton and TwinSpan told investors that the funds raised would only be used upon reaching a minimum offering amount and then, would only be used for TwinSpans general corporate purposes. The court concluded that despite these representations, Barton and TwinSpan diverted at least $493,100 of the offering proceeds for Bartons personal use and used a substantial portion of the offering proceeds in advance of reaching the minimum offering amount. Finally, the court specifically found that, between October 2006 and January 2007, Barton misappropriated $685,000 from an advisory client of TwinSpan. Specifically, Barton, acting through TwinSpan, forged the customers signature on four wire-transfer authorizations that transferred $185,000 of the clients assets at TwinSpan to a bank account in the name of Barton Asset Management. Shortly thereafter, Barton borrowed an additional $500,000 from this client, without disclosing his earlier theft of her funds., See also: L.

The SEC alleges that Ruderman defrauded his hedge fund investors by misrepresenting to them the hedge funds investment returns and the assets under management., Specifically, the SECs complaint alleges that Ruderman falsely told investors that the hedge funds had earned positive returns from 15% to 60% per year and had over $800 million in assets. In reality, the hedge funds lost money and had less than $650,000 in assets. The complaint further alleges that in 2009, Ruderman made at least one Ponzi-like payment, using new investor money to pay returns to an earlier investor, and that Ruderman falsely told prospective investors that Lowell Milken (chairman of the Milken Family Foundation and Michael Milkens younger brother) and Larry Ellison (the CEO of Oracle Corporation) were investors in his hedge funds. , The Honorable Valerie Baker Fairbank, U.S. District Judge for the Central District of California, granted the SECs request for emergency relief, including an order temporarily enjoining Ruderman, his company Ruderman Capital Management (RCM), and the hedge funds from future violations of the antifraud provisions, freezing their assets, and prohibiting the destruction of documents.

The SEC previously charged Henry Hank Morris and David Loglisci for orchestrating a fraudulent scheme to enrich Morris and other political allies and associates including Raymond Harding and Barrett Wissman, who have also been charged in the case., The SEC alleges that Meyer caused Aldus to pay a shell company owned by Morris approximately $320,000 in sham finder fees, in exchange for which Loglisci caused the pension fund to invest a total of $375 million with Aldus from 2004 to 2006., The SECs amended complaint further alleges that Loglisci ensured that Aldus and certain other investment managers who were willing to make the requisite payments to Morris and others were rewarded with lucrative investment management contracts, while investment managers who declined to make such payments were denied Common Fund business. The scheme corrupted the integrity of the Common Funds investment processes and resulted in the retirement funds assets being invested with the undisclosed purpose of enriching Morris and certain others., The SEC alleges that Loglisci chose Aldus as the Common Funds emerging fund portfolio manager on the sole basis of Meyers willingness to pay Morris. Prior to selecting Aldus, the Comptrollers office had been in discussions with another investment manager about creating and managing an emerging fund portfolio for the Common Fund. When that investment manager refused to pay kickbacks to Morris, Loglisci rejected that firm and recruited Aldus to manage the Common Funds emerging fund portfolio., According to the SECs amended complaint, Aldus was serving as the Common Funds outside consultant at the time, making Aldus a fiduciary of the Common Fund. In the midst of Alduss negotiations to manage the Common Funds emerging fund portfolio, a close associate of Morris approached Meyer and assured Meyer that Aldus would win the contract if Aldus agreed to pay Morris a portion of the management fees that Aldus received from the Common Fund. After Morriss friend made clear to Meyer that Aldus would not be hired if Aldus did not retain Morris, Meyer arranged for Aldus to kickback 35 percent of its management fees to a shell entity run by Morris. As a result of the quid pro quo arrangement, Aldus secured the Common Funds emerging fund portfolio business., The SECs amended complaint alleges that Meyer and Aldus violated and/or aided and abetted violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

The Commissions complaint alleges that, during the period from June 2005 through September 2006, Grifco International, Inc. (Grifco), a publicly-traded company that claims to be an international provider of oil and gas services equipment, issued 15,750,000 purportedly unrestricted, nonexempt securities to GGI.  The agreements underlying the unregistered stock transactions provided that Grifco would issue GGI large blocks of Grifco stock in return for an up-front monetary advance and a large percentage of the net sales proceeds after the stock was sold.  Shortly after receiving its shares, GGI sold its Grifco stock to the investing public and then returned a portion of the proceeds to Grifco.  The complaint alleges that none of the securities transactions were registered with the Commission and the transactions did not satisfy any exemption from registration.  The SEC alleges that, as a result of this conduct, GGI received nearly $3.8 million from the sale of newly-issued Grifco stock and remitted approximately $2.3 million of those proceeds to Grifco during 2005 and 2006.

The SEC further alleges that Michael Kara, in addition to buying stock and options in target companies that were the subject of the Citigroup deals, leaked the information to a network of friends and family who also traded in advance of the deals. The SEC has charged the Kara brothers and six others in the case., According to the SECs complaint, Michael Kara is a self-employed environmental clean-up consultant who traded in at least 20 companies that were involved in confidential transactions pending in the Citigroup health care investment banking group where Maher Kara worked. In many cases, Michael Kara also tipped friends and family members in California and Illinois., The participants in the scheme made their biggest profits trading in the stock and options of San Diego, Calif.-based medical testing company Biosite, Inc., less than three days before a March 25, 2007, announcement that it would be acquired. According to the SECs complaint, Maher Kara tipped his brother on March 22 about the confidential merger negotiations, and less than 15 minutes later Michael Kara began acquiring a large volume of Biosite stock and short-term call options. That same day, Michael Kara began calling friends and family members to pass along the tip, and they too began buying Biosite securities. After the acquisition of Biosite was publicly disclosed days later, the stock price jumped over 50 percent. Michael Kara made illegal profits of more than $1.2 million, while his six tippees together made nearly $4 million., In addition to the Kara brothers, the SEC complaint also names the following defendants: Emile Jilwan of Pleasanton, Calif.

Michael Kara allegedly made nearly $400,000 in illegal profits trading on the tip, and passed the information to Jilwan, Haddad, Azar, and Salman (who then tipped Bayyouk). Together, they made an additional $750,000 when the Andrx acquisition was announced., The SECs complaint charges the defendants with violating Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder. The complaint seeks disgorgement of illegal profits, civil penalties, and a permanent injunction against future violations of Sections 10(b) and 14(e)., In separate civil actions filed April 30, 2009, the SEC also charged two of Michael Karas tippees, Nasser Mardini of Stockton, Calif. and Joseph Azar of Pleasanton, Calif., with violating Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder.

Deutsche Bank was the lead underwriter for a proposed bond offering by VNU. According to the complaint, Rorech illegally tipped Negrin about the contemplated change to the bond structure, and Negrin then purchased CDS on VNU for a Millennium hedge fund. When news of the restructured bond offering became public in late July 2006, the price of VNU CDS substantially increased, and Negrin closed Millenniums VNU CDS position at a profit of approximately $1.2 million., The Commissions complaint charges violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

(144 Opinions) a California corporation formerly headquartered in Newport Beach, California. The complaint alleges that Rasch was the sole partner and owner of the Law Firm of Albert J. Rasch and Associates. Novinger was the sole associate at Rasch and Associates. Masino was the sole owner and employee of 144 Opinions., The complaint alleges that during 2007, the defendants collectively operated a legal opinion mill, which issued fraudulent legal opinions used by promoters in a pump-and-dump scheme, and others, to sell securities in violation of the registration provisions of the federal securities laws. Masino and 144 Opinions drafted and Rasch or Novinger executed, at least 24 legal opinion letters concerning the removal of restrictive legends on certificates representing over 22 million shares of Mobile Ready Entertainment Corp.

(RMCI), its Chairman, Bruce Bent Sr., its Vice Chairman and President, Bruce Bent II, and Resrv Partners, Inc., with fraud for failing to provide key material facts to investors and trustees about the funds vulnerability as Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc. sought bankruptcy protection. The Reserve Primary Fund broke the buck on Sept. 16, 2008, when its net asset value fell below $1.00 per share, meaning investors in the money market fund would lose money. In bringing the enforcement action, the SEC also seeks to expedite the distribution of the funds remaining assets to investors., According to the complaint, defendants failed to provide key material information to the Primary Funds investors, board of trustees, and ratings agencies after Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy protection on September 15. The fund, which held $785 million in Lehman-issued securities, became illiquid on that day when the fund was unable to meet investor requests for redemptions. According to the SECs complaint, the defendants misrepresented that RMCI would provide the credit support necessary to protect the $1 net asset value of the Primary Fund when, in fact, RMCI had no such intention., The SEC also alleges that RMCI significantly understated the volume of redemption requests received by the fund and failed to provide the trustees with accurate information concerning the value of Lehman securities. Because of these misrepresentations and omissions, the fund was unable to strike a meaningful hourly net asset value as required by the funds prospectus., The complaint alleges that RMCI, Resrv Partners and Bruce Bent II violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and that RMCI directly violated and Bruce Bent Sr. and Bruce Bent II directly violated and aided and abetted violations of Sections 206(1), (2) and (4) of the Investment Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.

Carnes, United States District Judge for the Northern District of Georgia, entered an order of permanent injunction and other relief against defendant Robert P. Copeland, a Georgia resident and an attorney licensed to practice in the State of Georgia. The order permanently enjoined Copeland from future violations of the registration and antifraud provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Copeland was ordered to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest and a civil penalty in amounts to be determined by the Court upon motion of the Commission at a later date. Copeland consented to the entry of the order without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions Complaint., The Commissions Complaint was filed on April 9, 2009. It alleged that from at least 2004 through January 2009 Copeland fraudulently raised over $35 million from at least 140 investors in Georgia and several other states, ant that Copeland promoted investments orally and through written materials claiming to earn 15-18 percent interest per year, and claiming that investor funds would be loaned in connection with real estate transactions, including private mortgage lending. The Complaint further alleged that through entities which he controlled, Copeland directed the unregistered offer and sale of promissory notes evidencing the investor loans. The notes were often collateralized by security deeds to which Copeland signed the names of fictitious persons., The Complaint alleged that Copeland represented to investors that the loans were safe and secured by real estate. In reality, Copeland used comparatively few of the investor funds in connection with real estate acquisition or development. The Complaint also alleged that Copeland promised, among other things, a current rate of return of 15 percent and represented to investors past returns as high as 18 percent. In reality, the representations were false and misleading because Copeland never consistently generated 15 percent annual returns and was not investing the funds as represented. Copeland deposited investor funds into four bank accounts in the name of his law firm, and that he misappropriated millions of dollars of investor funds for his personal use, spending the funds in connection with his personal residence, vehicles, and expensive artwork, among other things. The Complaint alleged that Copeland orchestrated a classic Ponzi scheme, in which he used new investor funds to make payment obligations to earlier investors., See also: L.

The Honorable Otis D. Wright II, United States District Judge for the Central District of California, also granted additional relief that the Commission sought including orders freezing assets, appointing Robb Evans &amp; Associates LLC as permanent receiver over Finbar, and requiring the defendants to repatriate assets from abroad., The Commissions complaint, filed on April 3 in federal court in Los Angeles, alleges that Tringham and Finbar fraudulently raised at least $6.4 million from investors in the U.S. and abroad, and falsely represented that Finbar was a licensed Securities Dealer. The complaint further alleges that Finbar provided false account statements to an investor as recently as March 13 that displayed the National Association of Securities Dealers logo, despite the fact that the use of the NASD name ceased in July 2007, and cited to non-existent CUSIP numbers purportedly representing the investors securities holdings. The complaint alleges that Finbar has not been registered with the Commission and that Tringham has not been associated with any registered broker or dealer. According to the complaint, Tringham has operated Finbar since at least 2006 and, as part of his scheme, he appropriated the identity of a now defunct Oregon corporation, also called Finbar, that was registered with the Commission as a broker-dealer from 1987 to 2006, and which Tringham had unsuccessfully attempted to purchase. The complaint alleges Tringham told investors Finbar sold debt instruments and high yield risk-free investment opportunities., On April 3, the Commission obtained an order freezing the assets of Finbar and Tringham, temporarily enjoining Finbar and Tringham from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and other emergency relief.

(EGS)</h2>, <h2>SEC Files Settled Books and Records and Internal Controls Charges Against Novo Nordisk for Improper Payments to Iraq Under the U.N. Oil for Food Program</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed Foreign Corrupt Practices Act books and records and internal controls charges against Novo Nordisk in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Novo Nordisk A/S, a Danish company, specializes in the manufacture and development of pharmaceutical products and is a leading supplier of insulin worldwide. The Commissions complaint alleges that from 2000 through 2003, Novo Nordisk paid $1,437,946 in kickbacks and agreed to pay an additional $1,315,454 in kickbacks in connection with its sale of humanitarian goods to Iraq under the United Nations Oil for Food Program (the Program). The kickbacks were characterized as after-sales service fees (ASSFs), but no bona fide services were performed. The Program was intended to provide humanitarian relief for the Iraqi population, which faced severe hardship under international trade sanctions. The Program required the Iraqi government to purchase humanitarian goods through a U.N. escrow account. The kickbacks paid by Novo Nordisk diverted funds out of the escrow account and into Iraqi-controlled accounts at banks in countries such as Jordan., According to the Commissions Complaint:, Novo Nordisk engaged its long-time Jordan-based agent to submit bids on Novo Nordisks behalf to Kimadia, the Iraq State Company for the Importation and Distribution of Drugs and Medical Appliances, under the Program. Two branches of Novo Nordisk — RONE, based in Athens, Greece, and NEO, based in Amman, Jordan — handled the sales to Iraq and supplied the agent with bid prices for each contract. In late 2000 or early 2001, a Kimadia import manager advised the agent that Kimadia required Novo Nordisk to pay a ten percent kickback in order to obtain a contract under the Program. The Kimadia import manager told the agent that Novo Nordisk should increase its prices by ten percent and pay that amount to Kimadia. By doing so, Novo Nordisk would recover the secret kickback from the U.N. escrow account when the contract, with the inflated price, was subsequently approved for disbursement and paid by the U.N., A Novo Nordisk officer rejected the request to pay Kimadia a ten percent kickback, and instead suggested that Novo Nordisk find another way. Novo Nordisk offered to reduce the price of its medicines by ten percent, but the Kimadia import manager angrily refused the offer. A Novo Nordisk Senior Vice President, along with RONE and NEO managers authorized the kickbacks to Kimadia despite the other officers refusal to do so. On or about April 2001 and August 2001, respectively, Novo Nordisk paid increased commissions to its agent to pay the kickbacks to Kimadia. The agents commission was increased under the guise that the payment was used to cover the agents increased distribution and marketing costs. Various e-mails discussed the scheme to conceal the conduct, and the U.N. contracts were artificially inflated by ten percent. According to the RONE managers, subsequent kickbacks were also approved by Novo Nordisk. Altogether, Novo Nordisk made a total of $1,437,946 in improper kickback payments on eleven contracts through the agent. Novo Nordisk also agreed to pay approximately $1,315,454 in ASSFs on two additional contracts. Novo Nordisk recorded the kickbacks as legitimate commission payments on its books and records., Novo Nordisk failed to maintain adequate systems of internal controls to detect and prevent the payments and their accounting for these transactions failed properly to record the nature of the payments.

Nodurft</i>, Civil Action No. 8:09-CV-866-T26/TGW (M.D. Fla.)</h2>, <h2>SEC BRINGS ACTION AGAINST ATTORNEY FOR ROLE IN UNREGISTERED OFFERING FRAUD</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) announced today that on May 8, 2009 it filed a complaint against Daniel W. Nodurft, a resident of Louisiana and the former vice-president and current secretary and general counsel of Aerokinetic, Energy Corporation (Aerokinetic), a Sarasota-based company purportedly in the business of developing and marketing alternative power technologies and products. The Commissions complaint alleges that Nodurft violated the registration and antifraud provisions of the securities laws in connection with Aerokinetics fraudulent unregistered securities offering., The Commissions complaint alleges that from at least September 2006 until the Commissions emergency action in July 2008, Aerokinetic raised at least $535,000 from 24 investors nationwide, and was seeking to raise an additional $575,000, by making material misrepresentations and omissions about its technology, products, and financial prospects. Aerokinetics fraudulent offering was halted on July 24, 2008, when the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida issued a temporary restraining order against Aerokinetic and its president., According to the complaint, Aerokinetic claimed to have developed new energy technologies, including a power generation station capable of creating electrical energy at a fraction of the cost of conventional or nuclear means, without generating any pollution. It further claimed to have built an operating power generation station and to hold patents on these new technologies, as well as to have standing purchase orders for the finished product. In addition, Aerokinetic projected millions of dollars of sales revenue within its first years of operations and billions of dollars shortly thereafter. The complaint alleges that these claims were false because Aerokinetic had no patents, income, or standing orders for its technology or products. Aerokinetics purported energy technologies and products were, at best, in the early development stage and, therefore, its predictions of imminent financial success and its financial projections lacked any reasonable basis in fact., The Commissions complaint further alleges that Nodurft was fully aware of Aerokinetics material misrepresentations and omissions. Nodurft was associated with Aerokinetic from its inception and was a central player in Aerokinetics fraudulent offering. He was in constant contact with the Companys president, provided recommendations concerning operations, and handled investor relations. Nodurft drafted, reviewed or approved all offering materials and the Companys two websites that contained Aerokinetics false and misleading statements to prospective investors, and personally repeated many of these misrepresentations to prospective investors. Moreover, contrary to assurances that Aerokinetic would use investor funds to research and develop Aerokinetics products, the complaint also alleges that Aerokinetics president — with Nodurfts knowledge and approval — misappropriated investors funds to pay his personal expenses, with approximately $250,000 in investor funds unaccounted for., The Commissions complaint alleges that Nodurft violated Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The Commission seeks a final judgment against Nodurft enjoining him from future violations of the foregoing antifraud and securities registration laws and assessing civil penalties., For additional information, see Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20655.htm>20655</a> (July 28, 2008) , <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2009/comp21034.pdf>SEC Complaint</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21034.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

(Gemstar), a Redlands, California-based venture capital company. The Commissions complaint alleges that from approximately June 2007 to the present, Defendant Michael J. Kiselak (a former Dallas Cowboys football player), solicited approximately $24 million from 14 investors on behalf of KCG by promising inflated returns and misrepresenting how investor funds would be invested. The complaint also alleges that Kiselak failed to disclose to investors that KCG took a 35% performance fee on all trading profits. The complaint further alleges that Kiselak told investors that KCG made a 2.25% per month profit trading treasury bills; instead, Kiselak invested over 95% of the investor funds in Gemstar., According to the complaint, KCG and Gemstar could not account for all of the investor funds. Specifically, the Commissions alleges that KCG provided to the SEC a brokerage statement purportedly showing that Gemstar, as of March 31, 2009, had over $23 million in segregated accounts for the benefit of KCG. But the complaint alleges that Gemstar, through its president, Defendant Jeffrey J. Sykes, produced this fabricated document to KCG. According to the complaint, as of March 31, 2009, Gemstar had only $20 million in its brokerage accounts — exactly $3 million less than the amount represented in the letter Sykes provided to Kiselak — and the funds were not segregated for the benefit of KCG investors. According to the SECs complaint, as of May 7, 2009, the account had approximately $19 million., U.S. District Judge John McBryde granted a temporary restraining order and asset freeze against the Defendants, and other emergency relief., The complaint alleges that Defendants Kiselak Capital Group, LLC, Gemstar Capital Group, Inc., Michael J.

The SEC has previously charged Morris and David Loglisci with orchestrating this wide-ranging scheme to enrich Morris and others and has alleged that Aldus and one of its founding principals, Saul Meyer, also participated in the scheme by agreeing to pay kickbacks to Morris., According to the SECs amended complaint, Ramirez facilitated Morriss scheme by contacting Meyer and making clear to him that Aldus must pay a kickback to Morris to secure an investment from the Retirement Fund. Although Aldus was already negotiating with the Retirement Funds investment staff about the proposed investment at the time, Aldus agreed to kick back 35 percent of its management fees to a shell entity run by Morris. Morris in turn paid Ramirez a portion of those fees. As a result of the quid pro quo arrangement, Aldus secured the Retirement Funds emerging fund portfolio business, and Ramirez shared in the profits even though he performed no legitimate services., The SECs amended complaint alleges that Ramirez aided and abetted violations of Section Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

Upon release from imprisonment, Mathur will be placed on supervised release for three years. The Court also ordered Mathur to pay restitution in the amount of $12,572,237.28 and a special assessment of $2,000.00. Mathur, who operated an advisory firm called Entrust Capital Management, Inc., in Worcester, Massachusetts, is also a defendant in a Commission civil action filed in April 2005. , Mathur was initially indicted on criminal charges on September 28, 2006. At Mathurs two-week long criminal trial in May 2008, evidence was presented that Mathur, beginning in 2001, raised several million dollars in investor funds and dissipated millions in investor funds through undisclosed trading losses, unauthorized use of investor funds, and use of client funds for Mathurs personal expenditures. According to evidence presented at the criminal trial, Mathur used investor funds to, among other things, buy a Porsche Cayenne, purchase Mercedes Benz luxury vehicles, and fund gambling trips to Las Vegas for Mathur and his friends. A federal jury found Mathur guilty on May 16, 2008., The Commission filed its action against Mathur and Entrust on April 12, 2005 and filed an Amended Complaint adding Rajeev Johar as a defendant on September 14, 2005. The Commissions Amended Complaint alleged that, from 2000 through 2005, the defendants engaged in a scheme to defraud investors in a purported hedge fund run by Mathur and Johar at Entrust. The Amended Complaint alleged that approximately twenty clients invested over $16 million with Entrust. The Commission alleged that the defendants made material misrepresentations to investors about, among other things, their assets under management and returns that the fund generated. According to the Amended Complaint, the defendants dissipated most of the $16 million invested through undisclosed trading losses and misappropriation of investor funds for the defendants personal use. The Commissions action against Mathur, Entrust, and relief defendant AMR Realty, LLC, is pending. A Final Judgment by consent was entered against Johar in the Commission action on June 4, 2007, which, among other things, ordered him to pay over $600,000 in disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and penalties.

On many occasions, the grant dates coincided with dates of low monthly closing prices for the companys common stock., The SECs complaint further alleges that Ray continued to use hindsight for stock option grant dates even after the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 imposed stricter reporting requirements. The complaint alleges that, because of the backdating scheme, KB Home filed proxy statements with the SEC that inaccurately stated that KB Home granted options at market value on the date of the grant. In addition, the complaint alleges that, by concealing his knowledge about stock option backdating at KB Home, Ray contributed to KB Homes filing of a false and misleading quarterly report with the SEC in 2006.

Driver (Driver) and his company Axcess Automation, LLC (Axcess) raised $14.1 million from investors since approximately February 2006 by promising them a weekly return of up to 5 percent from trading in futures.

The Commissions emergency action, filed on January 23, 2009, alleged that Rennie, while working at an insurance and financial services agency in Rhode Island and acting as an investment advisor, defrauded numerous clients in Massachusetts and New Hampshire of over $3 million. The final judgment enjoins Rennie from future violations of the securities laws. Additionally, Rennie was ordered to pay disgorgement in the amount of $3,678,377, profits gained as a result of the conduct alleged in the Complaint, prejudgment interest in the amount of $30,653, and a penalty of $500,000., According to the Commissions complaint, from early 2007 through early 2009, Rennie made misrepresentations to several of his clients about investing their money in risk-free federal housing certificates that paid up to 12% per year, tax free, and were offered by a real estate investment company based in Boston. In fact, however, the complaint alleges that the investments were completely fictitious and that Rennie had no relationship with the real estate investment company whose name he used. According to the Commissions filings, Rennie defrauded clients who were elderly, including an 89 year old man. The filings allege that Rennie induced some clients to cash out their investments in annuities, incurring substantial surrender charges, in order to invest in his fraudulent program. According to the complaint, Rennie used investor proceeds to pay personal expenses, including a gym membership and liquor, grocery, shoe and department store purchases, and withdrew thousands of dollars in cash from the account where investor funds were sent., In addition to ordering Rennie to pay $4,209,030 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest and penalties, the judgment imposes a permanent injunction against the defendant prohibiting him from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933; Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940., The Commission brought this action in collaboration with the Massachusetts Securities Division, which, simultaneously with the filing of the Commissions complaint, filed an administrative action seeking immediate suspension and subsequent revocation of Rennies Massachusetts broker-dealer agent registration., The Commission acknowledges the assistance provided by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority in this matter.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21043.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

(WellCare), a managed care services company that administers federal government-sponsored health care programs. According to the Commissions complaint, from at least November 2003 to October 2007, WellCare fraudulently retained over $40 million it was required to return to Florida state agencies under programs that provided mental health services to Medicaid recipients and health care services to uninsured children. As a result, WellCare materially overstated its publicly reported net income and diluted earnings per share in periodic filings made with the Commission., As alleged in the complaint, WellCare executed its scheme by intentionally underpaying refunds it owed to two Florida state health care entities, the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA), and the Florida Healthy Kids Corporation (Healthy Kids). Under these contracts, WellCare received funds, or premiums, from the state to be used to provide medical and health benefits. To ensure a proper balance between cost savings and quality health care, the state required WellCare to spend a certain percentage of the premiums on eligible medical expenses. If WellCare spent less than the minimum amounts on eligible expenses, it was required to refund some or all of the difference to the state., According to the Commissions complaint, WellCare did not follow the states guidelines and regulatory framework governing how the company was required to calculate the refunds under each program. Instead, the company evaded the statutory requirements and fraudulently included ineligible payments to a subsidiary and administrative expenses as legitimate medical expenses. In addition, for certain refunds, WellCare considered a range of arbitrary amounts to refund to AHCA, and then reverse-engineered a methodology to arrive at a particular refund target. WellCare also engaged in a rate-swapping scheme whereby it inflated reimbursement rates for its Healthy Kids plan in exchange for lower Medicaid and Medicare rates at two Florida hospitals. In total, through its fraudulent conduct, WellCare reduced the refunds it paid to AHCA by approximately $35 million and to Healthy Kids by approximately $6 million., WellCares fraudulent retention of over $40 million materially inflated its net income and earnings per share by essentially the same amounts — 14% for fiscal year (FY) 2004, 9% for FY 2005, 13% for FY 2006, and 9% for the first quarter of FY 2007. On January 26, 2009, WellCare filed its Form 10-K for FY 2007 and restated its financial results for its FYs 2004 through 2006 and the first two quarters of FY 2007., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, WellCare has consented to the entry of a final judgment for violations of the antifraud provision of the federal securities laws, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, the reporting provisions, Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13, and the record-keeping and internal controls provisions, Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act. In addition, the company has agreed to pay $1 in disgorgement and a $10 million civil penalty.

The SEC obtained an emergency court order freezing their assets and halting the scheme., The SEC alleges that Bich Quyen Nguyen, Johnny E. Johnson, and their entities, Sun Group and Sun Investment Savings and Loan, raised more than $9 million by promising guaranteed returns on high-yield instruments. The SEC had previously charged two other entities, Empire Capital Asset Management (ECAM), and Sun Empire, and two individuals, Delilah Proctor and Shauntel McCoy, for also participating in the multi-level marketing scheme. Instead, the amended complaint alleges that the defendants misused investor funds for their own personal use or sent money to other entities under their control., According to the SECs amended complaint, Nguyen solicited investors through Sun Group and Sun Investment Savings and Loan and encouraged club leaders to find investors who were unemployed or recently bankrupt. Through Sun Investment Savings and Loan, Nguyen offered certificates of deposit with returns as high as 19.30%. Johnson represented to prospective investors that they could double their investment with Sun Group and could earn many times more than 10% returns. Both Nguyen and Johnson promised a full guarantee for the original investment and profit. In fact, according to the amended complaint, Sun Investment Savings and Loan is not a savings and loan at all. The amended complaint alleges that Sun Investment Savings and Loan does not exist at the purported business location alleged by defendants and was not authorized by the state to do business as a financial institution. Moreover, Sun Investment Savings and Loan has not been paying the promised returns to investors., The SEC obtained an order (1) freezing the assets of Sun Group, Sun Investment Savings and Loan, Nguyen, and Johnson; (2) requiring accountings; (3) prohibiting the destruction of documents; and (4) granting expedited discovery; and (5) temporarily enjoining Sun Group, Sun Investment Savings and Loan, Nguyen, and Johnson from future violations of the registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. In addition to this emergency relief, the Commissions complaint alleges that Sun Group, Sun Investment Savings and Loan, Nguyen, and Johnson violated antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and seeks a final judgment permanently enjoining the defendants and ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains and financial penalties.

Meyers of Walpole, Massachusetts, Apogees former Chief Operating Officer, and Annette Jaynes of Sharon, Massachusetts, Apogees controller, in connection with a scheme to inflate Apogees earnings in 2003 and 2004., The Commissions complaint, filed in federal district court in Massachusetts, alleges that in connection with the scheme, Apogee filed materially misleading financial statements with the Commission that misstated its revenue by including sales transactions that contained terms making revenue recognition improper.  According to the complaint, Meyers, as Apogees COO, entered into arrangements with purchasers of Apogees products containing terms hidden from the companys outside auditors that made it improper for Apogee to recognize revenue from the transactions at the time that it did, such as agreements allowing customers to return goods or pay nothing to Apogee unless they sold the products to end users.  For example, the complaint alleges that when Apogee could not finalize a sale to one customer at the end of a quarter, Meyers approved a sham sale of the same product to a second customer.  This second customer was simply holding the product until the sale to the first customer could be finalized later, and the second customer could return the product to Apogee and had no obligation to pay for the product until it was actually resold to the first customer.  According to the complaint, Jaynes recorded transactions as revenue despite receiving documents containing the sales terms that precluded revenue recognition.  As a result, Apogee materially overstated its quarterly and annual earnings by between 7% and 45% in its financial statements in the second and fourth quarters of 2003 and the first three quarters of 2004.  Apogee restated these results in 2005., Each of the defendants has agreed to settle this matter, without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions complaint.  Apogee, Meyers and Jaynes agreed to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining them from variously violating or aiding and abetting violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder.  Meyers and Jaynes will also be enjoined from violating Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder.  The final judgment as to Meyers will hold him liable for disgorgement of $9,365 plus prejudgment interest of $3,701.91, representing his ill gotten gains from the sale of Apogee stock during the period of the fraud.  However, under the terms of the judgment, disgorgement and prejudgment interest will be waived, and no penalty will be imposed as to Meyers, based on his financial condition.  The final judgment as to Meyers will bar him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.

In addition, the Complaint alleges that Emerging Markets is an unregistered broker-dealer., The complaint names the following defendants:, The Complaint alleges that, in furtherance of their Ponzi-like scheme, defendant Clamens, assisted by defendant Lopez, knowingly caused FTC to make unauthorized purchases of securities for the two customers FTC accounts, knowingly prepared and sent the customers false account statements that omitted the unauthorized securities trades and falsely listed holdings exclusively in short-term, low-risk, liquid investments of the type that the customers authorized FTC to make on its behalf but which were not made.  In addition, Clamens and Lopez caused the Venezuelan bank to receive statements for its account falsely stating that it held the $50 million in (fictitious) notes.   In addition, defendant Emerging Markets effected, or purported to effect, securities transactions for its own account and on behalf of numerous foreign investors, without having properly registered as a broker-dealer with the Commission or other appropriate authority.  Emerging Markets thus has illegally acted as an unregistered broker-dealer., As a result of this conduct, the Complaint alleges that defendants FTC, Emerging Markets, Clamens and Lopez violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; defendant FTC violated Section 15(c) of the Exchange Act; defendant Emerging Markets violated Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act; and defendants Clamens and Lopez aided and abetted FTCs violations of Exchange Act Section 15(c) and Emerging Markets violations of Exchange Act Section 15(a).In its Complaint, the Commission seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement and prejudgment interest and civil penalties against all defendants., The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York and the Financial Services Authority of the United Kingdom in this matter. , <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2009/comp21052.pdf>SEC Complaint</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21052.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Dynkowski, Matthew W. Brown, Jacob Canceli, Gerard J. D’Amaro, Joseph Mangiapane Jr., Nathan M. Michaud, Marc J. Riviello and Adam S. Rosengard.  The complaint alleges that in 2006 and 2007, Dynkowski, a Polish citizen who resided in the U.S., engaged in market manipulation schemes with at least four separate stocks:  GH3 International, Inc., Asia Global Holdings, Inc., Playstar Corp., and Xtreme Motorsports of California, Inc.  As alleged in the complaint, Dynkowski’s co-defendants each participated in one or more of these schemes, which together generated more than $6.2 million in illicit profits.  , The SEC’s complaint alleges that these fraudulent schemes generally followed the same pattern:  Dynkowski and his accomplices agreed to sell large blocks of shares for penny stock companies in exchange for a portion of the proceeds.  The companies put these shares in nominee accounts that Dynkowski and his accomplices controlled.  The defendants pumped the market price of the stocks using wash sales, matched orders and other manipulative trading, often timed to coincide with false or touting press releases by the companies, to give the market the false impression that there was real demand for these stocks.  After artificially inflating the market price of the stocks, Dynkowski and his accomplices then dumped the shares obtained from the issuers and divided the illicit proceeds.         , The SEC’s complaint further alleges that:, The SEC’s complaint alleges that Dynkowski and Brown violated Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”), Sections 10(b) and 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), and Rules 10b-5, 13d-1 and 13d-2 thereunder; that Canceli, D’Amaro, Mangiapane, and Riviello violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5; that Michaud violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5; and that Rosengard violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act.  The complaint seeks against each defendant a permanent injunction against future violations, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil monetary penalties, and, as to certain defendants, orders barring them from participating in penny stock offerings.  , The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Delaware also announced today felony criminal charges against Dynkowski, Brown, Canceli, D’Amaro, Mangiapane, and Riviello., The SEC thanks the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Delaware; the Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement; the Internal Revenue Service – Criminal Investigations; and the Delaware State Police for their assistance in this matter.  , The SEC’s investigation is continuing., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2009/comp21053.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21053.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The bogus press release falsely stated that WCI’s board of directors received a buyout offer potentially worth $220 million.  After this fake news was reported publicly by media outlets, WCI’s share price increased dramatically and Karp quickly sold his shares to generate his illegal profits., The SEC’s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, alleges that Karp drafted and disseminated the bogus WCI press release so that he could sell his WCI stock at an inflated price.  Karp had actively traded the stock of WCI throughout late 2007 and early 2008, and in early July he bought 42,000 shares of WCI for approximately $54,700.  However, on July 14, WCI announced that it was no longer engaged in discussions with affiliates regarding alternative restructuring proposals. , The SEC alleges that Karp attempted to drive up WCI’s share price by creating and faxing the bogus press release to Southwest Florida and national media outlets on a Saturday evening, July 19.  The fake news was consequently reported by at least four Fort Myers media outlets.  WCI’s share price increased dramatically the following Monday morning, July 21.  Karp sold his shares in pre-market trading that day, generating approximately $29,000 in illegal profits., The SEC’s complaint charges Karp with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 9(a)(4) and 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The complaint alleges that Wealth Management, Putman, and Fevola caused clients to invest in the pools throughout the period of May 2003 through August 2008 and that Wealth Management claims currently to have approximately $102 million of its clients’ assets invested in the pools.  The complaint alleges that in 2006 and 2007, Putman and Fevola each accepted at least $1.24 million in undisclosed payments derived from certain investments made by the pools, while continuing to cause clients to invest in the pools.  The complaint alleges that Wealth Management, Putman and Fevola have also breached their fiduciary duties and engaged in fraud by misrepresenting the safety and stability of the two largest pools, and by placing their clients into these investments even though they were unsuitable for some of their clients.  The complaint alleges that the pools appear to have limited remaining assets and that it appears likely that the reported values of the pools are substantially overstated.  The complaint alleges that Wealth Management and Putman have received and continue to receive management fees on the basis of these likely overvalued assets, and that Wealth Management and Putman have been providing redemptions to investors based on likely overstated valuations., In an order dated May 20, the Honorable Judge William Greisbach entered a temporary restraining order enjoining Wealth Management and Putman from violating the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 [Section 17(a)], the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder], and the Investment Advisers Act [Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder], aiding and abetting of Wealth Management’s violations of the antifraud provisions of the Exchange Act and the Advisers Act by Putman, and as to Wealth Management, violating Section 207 of the Advisers Act.

Pursuant to the Commission’s motions for emergency relief, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas entered a temporary restraining order against the defendants, froze their assets, and appointed Thomas L. Taylor III of Houston as a receiver over them and all affiliated entities., The SEC’s complaint alleges that Watson and Petroski raised more than $19 million from investors and claimed they would earn profits through “Alpha One,” a foreign-currency trading software program purportedly owned by their firm PrivateFX Global One Ltd. They claimed they would employ the services of 36 Holdings Ltd., a so-called “deal clearing company” owned and controlled by Watson.

(G&amp;A) and Jacques R. Gendreau, age 67, who as of October 2007 had approximately 185 clients and $97 million in assets under management, advised their clients to become heavily leveraged and invested client funds using substantial margin.  The SEC alleges that Gendreau failed to disclose to clients that his investment strategies were high-risk.  The SEC also alleges that this high-risk strategy was unsuitable for many G&amp;A clients due to their age, retirement status, and otherwise lower risk tolerance.  According to the SEC’s complaint, as a result of Gendreau’s misconduct, G&amp;A clients suffered catastrophic financial losses. , In its complaint, the SEC alleges that Gendreau invested client funds using substantial margin even though many clients had retired, needed the money in the short-term, or had otherwise expressed concerns about incurring additional losses.  The SEC further alleges that in late August and early September 2008, Gendreau implemented his riskiest investment strategy by investing client funds using maximum margin solely in the preferred shares of Citigroup Inc. and Wachovia Corporation.  The SEC’s complaint contends that Gendreau invested client funds in the banks’ preferred shares using significant margin even though this strategy was not suitable for many clients and was contrary to some clients’ express instructions.  Further, the SEC claims that Gendreau misrepresented to his clients that this investment strategy was “guaranteed” or with “practically no risk.”  According to the complaint, shortly after Gendreau purchased the preferred shares on behalf of his clients, the prices declined and G&amp;A’s custodial broker issued margin calls on the client accounts.  The SEC alleges that Gendreau failed to meet these margin calls resulting in the custodial broker cancelling margin and liquidating the G&amp;A client accounts.  As a result of this investment strategy, according to the SEC’s complaint, clients lost approximately $12 million (approximately 72% of their assets) within days, and approximately 42 G&amp;A clients were left owing the custodial broker approximately $300,000 for margin loans., The SEC’s complaint charges G&amp;A and Gendreau with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers Act); G&amp;A with violating Section 204 of the Advisers Act and Rule 204-2 thereunder; and Gendreau with aiding and abetting G&amp;A’s violation of Section 204 of the Advisers Act and Rule 204-2 thereunder.

May 27, 2009)</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a civil action against three former finance executives of Cardinal Health, Inc. (Cardinal), a pharmaceutical distribution company based in Dublin, Ohio, in which the former Cardinal executives agreed to settle charges that they engaged in a fraudulent revenue and earnings management scheme.  Cardinal’s former chief financial officer, Richard J. Miller, former controller and principal accounting officer, Gary S. Jensen, and former senior vice president of finance, Michael E. Beaulieu, without admitting or denying the allegations, consented to the entry of an injunction and agreed to pay a total of $245,000 in civil penalties. , The Commission’s Complaint alleges that, at different times from September 2000 through March 2004, the former Cardinal executives engaged in the misconduct in order to present a false picture of Cardinal’s operational results to the financial community and the investing public – one that matched Cardinal’s publicly disseminated earnings guidance and analysts’ expectations, rather than its true economic performance.  The Complaint alleges that as a result of these actions, Cardinal materially overstated its operating revenue, earnings, and growth trends in public earnings releases and filings with the Commission., According to the Complaint, the Defendants and other members of Cardinal’s management closely monitored Cardinal’s financial performance to assess whether it met internal expectations and external guidance to analysts.  Miller, Jensen, and Beaulieu, as the Complaint describes, engaged in the management of Cardinal’s reported revenue and earnings through a variety of undisclosed and improper actions.  The Complaint alleges that their actions had the effect of inflating reported operating revenue through the improper misclassification of more than $5 billion of bulk sales as operating revenue.  As detailed in the Complaint, Cardinal classified its revenue from drug distribution as either “bulk” revenue or operating revenue.  Bulk revenue consisted primarily of certain full case quantities of pharmaceutical products delivered to customer warehouses and had virtually no profit margin.  Operating revenue consisted primarily of customized orders delivered to pharmacies and other provider customers.  The Complaint alleges that in November 2001, with Miller’s approval and Beaulieu’s knowledge, Cardinal implemented an undisclosed internal practice, under which it reclassified any revenue from the sale of bulk product held on its premises for 24 hours or longer as operating revenue.  The Complaint alleges that Jensen became aware of this undisclosed practice and its impact on operating revenue after becoming Cardinal’s controller in August 2002.  Shortly after implementing this practice, as the Complaint describes, Cardinal began to intentionally hold bulk inventory orders on its premises for longer than 24 hours in certain quarters, in order to convert the sale of this product from bulk revenue to operating revenue (the 24-Hour Lever).  The Complaint alleges that Miller decided when to use the 24-Hour Lever and that Beaulieu and Jensen participated in deciding to activate the 24-Hour Lever, based on the strength or weakness of Cardinal’s quarterly sales.  Miller, Jensen, and Beaulieu used the 24-Hour Lever, along with other revenue and earnings management practices, to fraudulently overstate Cardinal’s reported operating revenue and earnings., According to the Complaint, Miller, Jensen, and Beaulieu manipulated Cardinal’s reported earnings by selectively accelerating, without disclosure, the payment of vendor invoices in order to prematurely record a cumulative gross total of $133 million in cash discount income.  The Complaint further alleges that, at different times, and to varying degrees, Miller, Jensen, and Beaulieu also boosted Cardinal’s reported earnings by improperly creating and using a general reserve account and approving improper adjustments to other reserve accounts.  The Complaint alleges that these improper reserve practices contributed to Cardinal’s approximately $65.9 million overstatement of its net earnings from fiscal years 2000 through 2004.  According to the Complaint, Miller also advocated for and approved the improper classification of $22 million in anticipated litigation settlement proceeds, which enabled Cardinal to meet its earnings targets in two quarters.  , The Complaint alleges that Miller, Jensen, and Beaulieu each:  violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5; violated the falsification of accounting records and circumvention of internal controls provision of the Exchange Act, Section 13(b)(5), and Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1; and aided and abetted Cardinal’s violations of  the reporting, record-keeping, and internal controls provisions of the Exchange Act, Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and      13a-13.  The Complaint also alleges that Miller and Jensen each signed one or more materially false and misleading management representation letters to Cardinal’s auditor in violation of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-2 and that Miller signed officer certifications to Cardinal’s periodic filings in violation of Exchange Act Rule 13a-14.  , Without admitting or denying the allegations set forth in the Commission’s Complaint, Miller, Jensen, and Beaulieu have consented to the entry of orders permanently enjoining them from engaging in the violations set forth above.  Miller agreed to an order imposing a $120,000 civil penalty against him and prohibiting him from acting as an officer or director of a public company for a period of five years.  Jensen agreed to an order imposing a $75,000 civil penalty and prohibiting him from acting as an officer and director of a public company for three years.  Beaulieu agreed to an order imposing a $50,000 civil penalty and prohibiting him from acting as an officer or director of a public company for three years.  The settlements are subject to the approval of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.  , In addition, separately, without admitting or denying the Commission’s findings, Miller has consented to the institution of administrative proceedings pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, suspending him from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant, with a right to re-apply after five years, based on the anticipated entry of the injunction.  Without admitting or denying the Commission’s findings, Jensen and Beaulieu also have consented to the institution of administrative proceedings pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3), suspending them from appearing or practicing before the Commission as accountants, with a right to re-apply after three years, based on the anticipated entry of the injunctions., On July 26, 2007, the Commission filed a related action against Cardinal, in which it consented to the entry of an order enjoining it from violating the antifraud, reporting, record-keeping, and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws and agreed to pay a $35 million penalty.

Judge Castel also enjoined Brodsky from further violations of the antifraud provisions of the United States securities laws., The SEC complaint alleged that in August 2006 defendant Brodsky was tipped by his daughter, defendant Donna B. Murdoch (Murdoch), with the material, non-public information that Freescale was to be acquired by a private equity firm.  The complaint alleged that Murdoch learned of the acquisition from a close friend, defendant James Gansman (Gansman).  At the time, Gansman was employed by the accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young LLP (E&amp;Y), which had been retained to assist in conducting due diligence by the private equity firm looking to acquire Freescale.  According to the complaint, Gansman worked on the engagement and breached his duty of confidentiality owed to E&amp;Y and his client by telling Murdoch about the proposed deal.  Murdoch then told her father, who used the information to profit from trading in Freescale securities., The complaint alleged that by using the inside information, Brodsky violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

They then touted several acquisitions in a series of press releases, causing Pegasus’ stock price to soar and briefly giving the company a market capitalization of more than $1.4 billion.  Unbeknownst to investors, however, Knabb and Durland are alleged to have secretly controlled hundreds of millions of Pegasus shares through nominees, which they sold to individual investors and dumped on the open market through 2008.  Pegasus saw its share price steadily decline to under a penny., As alleged in the SEC’s complaint, Knabb and Durland accomplished their scheme by issuing hundreds of millions of shares to individuals and entities they controlled, including Knabb’s mother-in-law, his sister-in-law, his then-mistress, and an entity ostensibly managed by Knabb’s personal pilot.  The nominees unloaded the shares and funneled millions of dollars to Knabb, Knabb’s wife, and Durland.  Knabb and Durland reported none of these transactions in reports with the SEC, and instead falsely told investors they owned only minimal amounts of stock and received no compensation from Pegasus.  The SEC further alleges that Knabb and Durland falsely claimed in numerous SEC filings that much of the stock was issued to satisfy a business debt, when in reality this “debt” was entirely fabricated through phony documentation.  By February 2008, Pegasus had issued more than 75 percent of its total outstanding shares in this fraudulent manner.  The forged documents and false SEC filings concealed the fact that Knabb and Durland were, in essence, printing shares and diluting the interests of innocent shareholders to enrich themselves. , The SEC’s complaint, filed in federal court in San Francisco, charges Pegasus, Knabb, and Durland with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, including Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Pegasus is also charged with violating the books-and-records requirements of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13, and Knabb and Durland are charged with aiding and abetting Pegasus’ violations.  All three defendants are charged with violations of the registration requirements embodied in Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of Securities Act.

Ruskjer (Ruskjer) with fraudulently raising $16 million from at least 140 investors in a Ponzi scheme. The SECs complaint alleges that between September 2004 and December 2008, Ruskjer engaged in an unregistered offering of promissory notes to investors that were to pay fixed monthly returns of 3 percent to 5 percent from Ruskjers purportedly profitable trading in call options. According to the SECs complaint, Ruskjer, a self-employed computer consultant who lives in Koloa, Hawaii, used only half of the investors monies to trade securities, which incurred an average monthly loss over the four years of his scheme, and used remaining monies to pay fictitious trading profits to investors and his personal expenses., The SECs complaint alleges that Ruskjer induced investors to purchase his promissory notes by misrepresenting his unsuccessful options trading and his use of their funds. The SEC asserts that Ruskjer claimed to have a safe and non-speculative options trading strategy that made a monthly net profit of 5 percent to 5.5 percent, from which he promised to pay investors, depending on the time period and investor, a 3 percent to 5 percent monthly return. According to the SECs complaint, Ruskjers securities trading from 2004 to 2008 sustained an average monthly loss of 5.8 percent and a net loss of $2.6 million. Moreover, as alleged in the complaint, Ruskjer used only $7.9 million of the $16 million entrusted to him by investors to trade securities, $5.5 million to pay fictitious securities trading profits to investors, and most of the remaining funds for personal expenses, such as $523,466 to buy a condominium, $112,000 on cash withdrawals, and $743,000 on debit card purchases., The SECs complaint charges Ruskjer with violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, the securities registration provisions of Section 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act, and the broker-dealer registration provisions of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act.

The Commission’s complaint alleges that Wurzel authorized illicit payments to an Egyptian-based agent while he knew or consciously disregarded the high probability that the agent would offer, provide, or promise at least a portion of such payments to Egyptian Air Force officials for the purpose of influencing these officials to award business to UIC related to a military aircraft depot in Cairo, Egypt.  The Commission charged Wurzel with violations of the anti-bribery, books and records and internal controls provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), and with aiding and abetting UIC’s violations of the anti-bribery and books and records provisions of the FCPA., The Commission’s complaint alleges that in late 2001 to 2002, Wurzel authorized three forms of illicit payments to the agent: (1) payments to the agent ostensibly for labor subcontracting work; (2) a $100,000 advance payment to the agent in June 2002 for “equipment and materials;” and (3) a $50,000 payment to the agent in November 2002 for “marketing services.”  Furthermore, Wurzel later directed his subordinates to create false invoices to conceal the fact that the $100,000 “advance payment” in June 2002 was never repaid.  As a result, UIC, through ACL, was awarded a contract with gross revenues and net profits of approximately $5.3 million and $267,000, respectively., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Wurzel has consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of Sections 30A and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1 and from aiding and abetting violations of Exchange Act Sections 30A and 13(b)(2)(A) and ordering him to pay a $35,000 civil penalty.  , In a related action, the Commission also instituted, on May 29, 2009, a settled administrative proceeding against UIC.

Hamlin (Hamlin), a resident of Owosso, Michigan, and two companies owned and controlled by Hamlin, Kingdom First Trading, LLC (KFT) and Kingdom First Corp. (KFC), for conducting a fraudulent, unregistered offer and sale of approximately $2 million in securities., The SEC’s complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan, alleges that from approximately April 2005 through June 2008, Hamlin offered and sold securities to at least 90 investors and raised approximately $2 million.  The complaint alleges that Hamlin represented to investors that he was a day trader who would invest their funds, along with other investors’ funds, in the stock market.  The complaint further alleges that Hamlin told investors that he closed out all open positions at the end of the day and told some investors that he only invested in stocks.  According to the complaint, Hamlin represented to some investors that he could double their money, had earned past investment returns exceeding 100%, and investors would not lose their money invested with him.  According to the complaint, Hamlin, who acted as an unregistered investment adviser, also represented that he would send the investors weekly reports of his trading and their profits or losses and that he would not receive a commission or any other financial benefit unless the investments were profitable.  In the weekly trading reports, Hamlin represented that the investors earned profits in all but seven weeks of trading during the period in question.  The complaint alleges that Hamlin’s representations to investors regarding his use of investor funds, trading profits, and trading strategy were all false.  Specifically, the complaint alleges that Hamlin did not invest all of the investor funds that he raised.  Hamlin invested only a portion of the funds raised from investors, and used $668,000 of investor funds to pay his personal expenses and $755,000 to pay prior investors’ redemption requests.  The complaint further alleges that Hamlin’s trading generated losses totaling approximately $644,862 and his trading was profitable for only nine of the 39 months of the offering and generated a total of only $22,150 in profit for those months.  In addition, the Commission’s complaint alleges that Hamlin did not close out all open securities positions at the end of the day and frequently traded options. , Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC’s complaint, Hamlin, KFC, and KFT consented to the entry of an order of permanent injunction enjoining them from violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, enjoining Hamlin and KFC from violations of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act, enjoining Hamlin from violations of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and enjoining KFC from violations of Section 7(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940.

Conaway, the former Chief Executive Officer of Kmart Corporation. Conaway was charged with misleading investors about Kmarts financial condition in the months preceding the companys bankruptcy. According to the Commissions complaint, Conaway was responsible for material misrepresentations and omissions about the companys liquidity and related matters in the Managements Discussion and Analysis (MD&amp;A) section of Kmarts Form 10-Q for the third quarter and nine months ended October 31, 2001, and in an earnings conference call with analysts and investors. The verdict followed a three-week trial in Ann Arbor, Michigan, before Magistrate Judge Steven D. Pepe of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan., The Commission alleged that, in the MD&amp;A section, Conaway and Kmarts former Chief Financial Officer, John T. McDonald, failed to disclose the reasons for a massive inventory overbuy in the summer of 2001 and the impact it had on the companys liquidity. For example, the MD&amp;A disclosure attributed increases in inventory to seasonal inventory fluctuations and actions taken to improve our overall in-stock position. The Commission alleged that this disclosure was materially misleading because, in reality, a significant portion of the inventory buildup was caused by a Kmart officers reckless and unilateral purchase of $850 million of excess inventory. According to the complaint, the defendants dealt with Kmarts liquidity problems by slowing down payments owed vendors, thereby effectively borrowing $570 million from them by the end of the third quarter. According to the complaint, Conaway and McDonald lied about why vendors were not being paid on time and misrepresented the impact that Kmarts liquidity problems had on the companys relationship with its vendors, many of whom stopped shipping product to Kmart during the fall of 2001. Kmart filed for bankruptcy on January 22, 2002., The Commissions complaint charged Conaway and McDonald with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and aiding and abetting violations of Sections 10(b) and 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 13a-13, and 12b-20 thereunder by Kmart, and seeks as relief permanent injunctions, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, civil penalties and officer and director bars. McDonald agreed to settle shortly before trial. Without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, McDonald consented to a permanent injunction prohibiting further violations of those provisions of the federal securities laws, a five (5) year officer and director bar and $120,000 civil penalty and to an administrative order suspending his privilege to appear and practice before the Commission as an accountant for three (3) years.

Without admitting or denying the Commission’s allegations, the firms consented to settle the actions. These settlements, combined, will provide or already have provided nearly $6.7 billion to approximately 9,600 customers who invested in auction rate securities before the market for those securities froze in February 2008., According to the Commission’s complaints, Bank of America, RBC and Deutsche Bank misrepresented to certain customers that ARS were safe, highly liquid investments that were comparable to money markets.  According to the complaints, in late 2007 and early 2008, the firms knew that the ARS market was deteriorating, causing the firms to have to purchase additional inventory to prevent failed auctions.  At the same time, however, the firms knew that their ability to support auctions by purchasing more ARS had been reduced, as the credit crisis stressed the firms’ balance sheets. The complaints allege that Bank of America, RBC and Deutsche Bank failed to make their customers aware of these risks.  In mid-February 2008, according to the complaints, Bank of America, RBC and Deutsche Bank decided to stop supporting the ARS market, leaving Bank of America, RBC and Deutsche Bank customers holding billions in illiquid ARS., The settlements, which are subject to court approval, will restore approximately $4.5 billion in liquidity to Bank of America customers, $800 million in liquidity to RBC customers and $1.3 billion in liquidity to Deutsche Bank customers.

This matter involves insider trading in the securities of Warrior Energy Services Corporation (Warrior Energy) by Dupuis, who received tips directly or indirectly from Hollier, a member of Warrior Energys board of directors., The Complaint alleges that during the latter part of August 2006, Hollier had knowledge of pending merger talks between Warrior Energy and Superior Energy Services, Inc.

The judgment permanently restrains Donnelly and the other defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Judge Conrad also ordered the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the Court upon motion of the Commission at a later date.

The Commission further alleged that Donnelly orchestrated the scheme through three entities, Tower Analysis Inc., Nasco Tang Corp., and Nadia Capital Corp.  Donnelly told investors that he would pool their funds to invest in, among other things, stock and bond index derivatives.  According to the complaint, despite representations to investors that he had generated annual returns of as much as 22%, Donnelly had done almost no securities trading.  The Commission further alleged that instead of using investor funds to execute trades, Donnelly used investor funds to repay other investors, and paid himself approximately $1 million in salary and fees during the last three years alone.  The Commission also alleged that Donnelly was in the process of soliciting investors for a new fund called Nadia Capital Partners, LP based on misrepresentations about his past trading results., In a related criminal action arising from the same conduct alleged in the Commissions complaint, on May 11, 2009 Donnelly pled guilty to charges of wire fraud, securities fraud, fraud in connection with futures contracts, and impeding administration of internal revenue laws.

(Berkshire), a Wyoming company purportedly involved in oil and gas exploration, its principals, Jason T. Rose and David G. Rose, the six companies through which Berkshire carried out a securities offering - Berkshire (40L), L.L.P., Berkshire 2006-5, L.L.P., Passmore-5, L.L.P., Gueydan Canal 28-5, L.L.P., Gulf Coast Development #12, L.L.P., Drilling Deep in the Louisiana Water, J.V. (collectively, the Berkshire Offerings)- with securities fraud in connection with an oil and gas offering fraud.  The complaint also charged Berkshires head sales agents, Mark D. Long and Yolanda C. Velazquez, with securities registration and broker-dealer registration violations., In its complaint, the Commission alleges that from April 2006 through December 2007, Berkshire raised approximately $15.5 million from about 265 investors in the U.S. and Canada through a series of unregistered, fraudulent offerings of securities in the form of units of participation.  The defendants marketed the offerings to the public through cold call sales solicitations, and at trade shows and wealth expositions.  The purported purpose of the offerings was to fund oil and gas development projects that Berkshire was to oversee.  According to the complaint, Jason Rose was the public face of Berkshire and was held out as its lead manager with significant experience in the oil and gas industry.  In reality, Jason Rose had no experience managing an oil and gas company, and David Rose, Jasons father, ran the company behind the scenes.  David Rose has an extensive disciplinary history for securities fraud and is facing a criminal indictment in connection with another similar but unrelated oil and gas scam., The complaint further alleges that Berkshire, the Berkshire Offerings, Jason Rose, and David Rose also misled investors, among other things, about the use of investor proceeds.  The defendants assured investors they would use 100 percent of their funds for the oil and gas drilling projects.  Contrary to these representations, Berkshire spent approximately $6.7 million on items having nothing to do with developing the projects, including its own payroll and outside sales commissions, as well as marketing and promotional expenses.  Moreover, of the $6.7 million, approximately $1.3 million went directly to members of the Rose family to pay for mortgages on their homes, home furnishings and electronics, cars, and personal credit card charges.  The complaint also alleges that to further their scheme, Jason and David Rose enlisted Velazquez and Long to run two boiler-room type sales offices on Berkshires behalf; one in Lake Mary, Florida and the other in Jeffersonville, Indiana.  Long and Velazquez received commissions for their sales efforts, despite the fact that neither they nor Berkshire were registered broker-dealers.  The complaint also alleges that Velazquez violated a prior Commission order issued in March 2005 that barred her from association with any broker or dealer.  Finally, the complaint names Brian C. Rose and Joyce A. Rose as relief defendants and alleges that they received ill-gotten gains., The complaint charges that:  (a) Berkshire, Jason Rose, and David Rose violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5; (b) the Berkshire Offerings violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act, and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5; (c) Mark D.

The First Amended Complaint alleges that Kohler purchased out-of-the-money call options in CNS in his personal account and in an account in the name of Swiss Real Estate, a company controlled by Kohler, based on material non-public information relating to the companys potential acquisition.  The Commission alleges that Kohler and Swiss Real Estate realized illicit gains of approximately $387,566.The Commission further alleges that Kohler tipped his wife and his brother-in-law, who then traded in CNS options in advance of the announcement of the acquisition of CNS and realized significant illicit gains., The First Amended Complaint also names Sacho Todorov Dermendjiev (Dermendjiev) as a relief defendant.  The Commission alleges that Dermendjiev, who resides in Bulgaria, was the beneficial owner of banking and securities accounts over which Kohler held power of attorney.  According to the First Amended Complaint, Kohler purchased option contracts on CNS stock for Dermendjievs account just prior to announcement of the acquisition of CNS and sold these options immediately after announcement of the CNS acquisition, resulting in illicit gains of $74,655 for Dermendjiev., According to the First Amended Complaint, Kohler has engaged in a pattern of highly suspicious trading both prior to and immediately after the trades in CNS securities that are charged in the First Amended Complaint.  During late 2005 and 2006, Kohler and a group of his friends and relatives also traded in the securities of five other public companies in advance of acquisitions or earnings announcements.

Son, of Danville, Calif., and Jin K. Chung, of Los Altos, Calif., lured approximately 500 investors in the United States, South Korea, and Taiwan into their investment scheme in which funds were not traded in the forex market as claimed, but instead used to pay cash returns to certain investors in Ponzi-like fashion.  They also misappropriated investor money for their own personal use, including mortgage payments on Sons multi-million dollar home.  The SEC is seeking an emergency court order to freeze the defendants assets., According to the SECs complaint, filed in federal district court in San Francisco, Son and Chung operated their scheme through SNC Asset Management, Inc. (SNCA) and SNC Investments, Inc. (SNCI), which maintained offices in Pleasanton, Calif., and New York City.  Son and Chung promised investors spectacular annual returns of up to 36 percent from forex trading, and told investors that SNCA had generated 50 percent profits from such trading each year since 2003., The SEC alleges that Son and Chung faked SNCAs supposed forex trading profits, providing investors with monthly account statements showing fictitious returns.  Son and Chung drained SNCAs and SNCIs bank accounts as their Ponzi scheme was collapsing and transferred investor funds to accounts they controlled overseas.  In addition to paying Sons mortgage, investor funds were used to provide capital infusions to SNCI and pay Sons wife a salary for which she did no work., The complaint charges the defendants with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Kunkel (Kunkel). The complaint alleges that Kunkel, an attorney and resident of Grayson, Georgia, provided services to Pinnacle Development Partners LLC (Pinnacle) and assisted in a fraudulent unregistered offering of securities by Pinnacle in the form of nominal general partnership interests., The complaint alleges that from October 2005 until October 2006, Pinnacle raised more than $62 million from approximately 2,220 investors in 48 states and several foreign countries through a national advertising scheme which promised investors a 25% return in 45 or 60 days. The complaint further alleges that although the investments were described as general partnerships, they functioned as limited partnerships in that Pinnacle had sole control of the ventures. Further, the complaint alleges that Pinnacles investment program purported to generate profits by buying and flipping foreclosed real estate in Atlanta. In fact, the investment program functioned as a Ponzi scheme in which Pinnacle used investments by later investors to generate returns for earlier investors., The complaint further alleges that Kunkel knew Pinnacle was advertising a 25% profit to investors in 45 days and understood that the promised return was nonsensical. Kunkel was also aware that Pinnacle was not effecting sufficient real estate transactions on behalf of the partnerships to generate the purported returns. Despite this knowledge, Kunkel allegedly spoke with prospective investors on a regular basis and vouched that the company had always paid investors profits on a timely basis. In his conversations with investors, Kunkel failed to disclose his belief that the promised return was nonsensical or that Pinnacle was not selling sufficient properties to pay the returns promised to investors. According to the complaint, Kunkel also wrote a reference letter that Pinnacle sent to prospective investors personally touting the integrity of Pinnacle and its business model and informing investors that they might forfeit their profits if they contacted other Pinnacle investors without his permission., In a consent filed with the complaint, Kunkel agreed, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Weitzman sold securities in clients brokerage accounts and illegally funneled their money to a bank account that he secretly controlled. While Weitzman spent the money on a multi-million dollar home, cars, and other luxury items, he provided false account statements to clients often showing inflated account balances and securities holdings. Weitzman also submitted to a broker-dealer phony letters from clients that purported to authorize the money transfers. When clients questioned Weitzman about the transfers they did not authorize, he misrepresented that he was withdrawing their funds to make legitimate investments., According to the SECs complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Weitzman is the co-founder and a principal of AFW Wealth Advisors, the business name for AFW Asset Management, Inc., a registered investment adviser located in Purchase, N.Y., with an office in Natick, Mass. Weitzman also served as AFWs compliance officer., The SEC alleges that Weitzman either sold securities held in the clients accounts or redeemed shares held in money market funds in order to acquire cash for the unauthorized transfers, because the clients brokerage accounts at the broker-dealer generally did not hold more than a minimal amount of cash. He also siphoned money from clients Individual Retirement Accounts. Once he had the looted funds under his control in the AFW bank account, Weitzman either withdrew the clients funds or transferred the money directly into one of his personal bank accounts., According to the SECs complaint, Weitzman in some instances misappropriated funds from AFW clients who were unlikely to be scrutinizing their account statements. For example, Weitzman misappropriated a total of approximately $430,000 in a series of unauthorized transfers from a client who was terminally ill. Weitzman later misappropriated $85,000 in two separate unauthorized transfers from the account of the clients widow. Furthermore, the SEC alleges that Weitzman targeted an elderly couple with compromised mental capacities, misappropriating approximately $400,000 of their money., The SECs complaint charges Weitzman with violating Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and with aiding and abetting violations of Section 204 and Rules 204-2(a)-3 and 204-2(a)(7) also of the Advisers Act. The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, financial penalties, an asset freeze, a sworn accounting, an order prohibiting the destruction of documents, and a requirement that Weitzman notify the SEC and obtain approval of the court before he files for bankruptcy protection., Weitzman agreed to settle the SECs claims and, without admitting or denying the allegations, consented to the entry of a judgment that will grant the SEC the full relief that it seeks, but will defer the determination of the financial amounts of the settlement until a later date.

Goodman instead misappropriated the information by disclosing it to his friend and business associate, Macdonald and to another business associate, Gollan.

Bhavnagari (Bhavnagari), Dipin Malla (Malla), Sandeep Singh (Singh), and Raymond Rapaglia (Rapaglia). , The Complaint alleges that, from approximately October 2005 through at least April 2009, the Defendants used fraudulent sales practices to induce customers to open and fund Aura brokerage accounts. The Complaint also alleges that the Defendants rampantly churned these accounts of at least fifteen customers by causing numerous trades to be executed which enriched Defendants through brokerage commissions and, in some cases, mark-ups, while depleting the customers balances through trading losses and excessive transaction costs. In addition, the Complaint alleges that many of the trades effected by Defendants were unauthorized by the customers.

Woodcock is a resident of Rockwall, Texas., The Complaint alleges that, during 2006 and 2007, the defendants raised millions of dollars from investors to participate in a fictitious investment program involving the trading of financial instruments among top financial institutions. The defendants told investors that their principal was guaranteed or never placed at risk. However, according to the Complaint, the defendants used investor funds for various undisclosed purposes, including Bowmans gambling expenses, mortgage payments by the Morgans, and Ponzi payments to some investors. The SEC claims that John Morgan, Marian Morgan, and Stephen Bowman have continued to lull investors into remaining complacent by promising the imminent payment of their principal and returns. None of the relevant offerings was registered with the Commission, nor were any of the defendants registered as a broker-dealer or associated with a registered broker-dealer., The Complaint claims that, based on this conduct, all of the defendants violated Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The SEC alleges that First Canadian and Winick engaged in a scheme to create publicly traded companies through illegal distribution of the securities of more than 50 First Canadian subsidiaries., The SECs complaint alleges that from April 2002 to May 2004, First Canadian spun off 59 subsidiaries through unregistered distribution of their securities to shareholders. As alleged in the complaint, these spinoffs had no legitimate business purpose and were instead a means to create publicly traded companies without providing the disclosure required by registration. According to the complaint, while conducting the spinoffs, First Canadian never filed periodic reports with the Commission, and made no meaningful disclosure about the financial and business operations of First Canadian or any of the subsidiaries. The complaint alleges that while First Canadian reported the spinoffs on Forms 8-K and proxy statements on Schedule 14A, these filings failed to disclose the true nature of the spinoff transactions and that Winick had control over 16.5% of First Canadians stock through his wife, his friends, and affiliated entities., The complaint further alleges that, as a result of the spinoffs, Winick assembled an inventory of public company shells for sale and later sold many of them. In addition, the complaint alleges that Winick traded in the shares of some of these companies and profited by at least $3.2 million from 2004 through 2007., The SECs complaint charges Blackout Media and Winick with violating Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 14a-9 thereunder. The complaint also charges Blackout Media with violating, and Winick with aiding and abetting violations of, Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder; and Winick with violating Sections 13(d) and 16(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13d-1 and 16a-3 thereunder., The Commission seeks permanent injunctions and civil penalties against Blackout Media and Winick, and seeks from Winick an accounting, disgorgement, a penny stock bar, and the surrender of all stock he owns or controls in the companies spun off by First Canadian or their successors., Also today, the Commission filed an action in the Northern District of California alleging fraud and registration violations against one of the companies First Canadian spun off, Pearl Asian Mining Industries, Inc.

In reality, as alleged in the complaint, PAIM was and currently is nothing but a shell used by Gamboa to generate stock sale profits, and any gold mining operations that do exist belong to a separate Philippine company of the same name owned almost entirely by Gamboa., The SECs complaint further alleges that Gamboa issued the false and misleading disclosures to artificially sustain demand for PAIM stock. According to the complaint, from 2006 through March 2008, PAIM sold at least 1.9 billion shares of purportedly unrestricted PAIM stock to a penny stock promoter. Gamboa allegedly knew the buyer acquired PAIM shares for immediate resale and facilitated such resales by issuing stock certificates without restrictive legends and at times providing the buyer advance copies of PAIM press releases., The complaint alleges that Gamboa profited from her misconduct by at least $1 million through misappropriation of PAIMs stock sale proceeds and an arrangement to sell 1.5 billion of her PAIM shares through the companys investor relations officer., The SECs complaint charges ZNext Mining and Gamboa with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The Honorable Samuel Der-Yeghiayan, United States District Court Judge for the Northern District of Illinois, granted the Commission’s motion for emergency relief, including an order temporarily restraining Hernandez from committing further violations of the registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and an order freezing Hernandez’s assets and the assets of several relief defendants., The SEC’s complaint alleges that between at least February 2008 and the present, Hernandez, a convicted felon, solicited investors to purchase “guaranteed investment contracts” by making false and misleading statements about his background, the existence of the company that issued the investments, the uses of investor proceeds and the safety of the investments.  The complaint alleges that Hernandez sold the “guaranteed investment contracts” in person and through NextStep Financial’s website and claimed that he had an extensive background in banking and business, including having business and law degrees, and that NextStep Financial was a successful company that invested in payday advance stores.  The complaint further alleges that Hernandez told investors that their investments were safe because they were covered by insurance.  According to the complaint, however, Hernandez never received the claimed degrees, his “banking experience” included a prior federal conviction for wire fraud and NextStep Financial was a defunct corporation with no financial services operations other than running this scheme.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Hernandez never invested in the payday advance stores or purchased the insurance that covered investors’ funds and instead used the majority of the investors’ funds to pay existing investors their promised returns and diverted the remaining funds into his other business ventures and for his and his wife’s personal benefit.    , The SEC’s complaint charges Hernandez with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Cash and then-chief financial officer David E. Grose caused Quest to make a series of transfers to a separate company that Cash controlled. Cash tried to conceal the transfers by, among other things, ostensibly transferring the funds back to Quest at the end of each quarter. The SEC alleges, however, that Cash took progressively greater amounts from Quest over time that he used to support his lavish lifestyle, including spending more than $5 million on his Oklahoma City mansion. Grose was complicit in Cashs wrongdoing by, among other things, initiating wire transfers to Cashs company and creating a false cover story to explain the transfers to Quests employees and auditors., The SECs enforcement action was filed in U.S. District Court in Oklahoma City concurrently with criminal charges against Grose filed by the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Western District of Oklahoma., The SEC alleges that the scheme, which began in June 2004, collapsed in August 2008 after other Quest executives discovered and began questioning the legitimacy of the transfers. By that time, Cash had misappropriated a total of $10 million from Quest. Cash subsequently resigned from Quest and Grose was terminated., According to the SECs complaint, Grose also took advantage of Quests lax internal controls to siphon more than $1.8 million from the company for his own benefit. From December 2005 through August 2008, one of Quests equipment vendors kicked back approximately $850,000 to Grose from equipment purchases that Quest had made. The SEC also contends that Grose used $1 million of Quests money to fund his personal investment in a small Oklahoma start-up company., The SECs complaint states that none of these transactions were disclosed in the multiple quarterly and annual filings Quest made with the SEC during the periods in question, even though Cash and Grose each certified in these filings that they had disclosed any fraud involving management. Cash and Grose also signed numerous Quest filings in which such related party transactions were required to be disclosed, but were not. Lastly, the SEC claims that Cash and Grose signed multiple representation letters to Quests auditor attesting that all related party transactions had been disclosed and that there had been no fraud involving management., The SECs complaint charges, among other things, that Cash and Grose violated the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the anti-fraud, internal controls, proxy statement, record-keeping and reporting provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

According to the complaint, Sanchez claimed that investor funds were secured by a promissory note and an interest in real property and would be used to cure defaults on distressed properties.

According to the Complaint, as a result of its improper conduct, Comverse was able to portray itself as a company with steady, but measured growth, which regularly met analysts earnings targets., According to the Commissions Complaint, the first scheme involved improper backdating of Comverse stock options granted between 1991 and 2001. With respect to the backdating scheme, the Complaint alleges:, Comverse routinely backdated grants of stock options made to the Companys employees, officers, and others to coincide with historically low closing prices for the Companys common stock, distributing options from at least 26 backdated grants. Six out of seven company-wide grants made by Comverse during the relevant period were granted at, or near, the lowest stock price for the fiscal quarter or year., Comverse awarded employees these disguised in-the-money options without recording a corresponding compensation expense for the in-the-money portion of the option grant. The failure to record the expense did not conform to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles., Comverse also made grants to fictitious employees in order to establish an illegal pool of options thereby creating a slush fund of in-the-money stock options to later use in circumvention of the approved stock option grant process., Comverses second fraudulent scheme involved several improper accounting practices. According to the Complaint:, Comverse improperly built up, and subsequently improperly released, certain reserves to meet earnings targets, improperly reclassified certain expenses to manipulate other performance metrics, and made false disclosures about its backlog of sales orders., The manipulation of earnings allowed Comverse to meet or exceed Wall Street analysts consensus earnings estimates in every quarter between 1996 and the first quarter of 2001., As a result of the accounting fraud, Comverse understated its pre-tax income in fiscal years 1996 through 1999, overstated its pre-tax income in fiscal years 2000 to 2003, and made materially false and misleading disclosures about its operating margins and sales backlog., The Complaint also alleges that Comverse published materially false and misleading financial information about its quarterly and annual pre-tax earnings, net income, operating income, liabilities, cost of goods sold, research and development expense, and sales order backlog in reports filed with the Commission, including its annual and quarterly reports for fiscal years 1995 through 2005., Without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions Complaint, Comverse has consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it from violating the antifraud, reporting, record-keeping, and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws. Specifically, the proposed final judgment would permanently enjoin Comverse from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13, and 14a-9. In accepting the companys settlement offer, the Commission considered, among other things, Comverses extensive cooperation in the Commissions investigation., The settlement is subject to the approval of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York., The Commission previously charged former Comverse Chairman and CEO Jacob Kobi Alexander, former Comverse Chief Financial Officer David Kreinberg, and former Comverse General Counsel William F. Sorin. Kreinberg and Sorin each settled with the Commission. The Commission today also announced the filing of settled civil charges against Ulticom, Inc., a majority owned subsidiary of Comverse whose stock is also publicly traded, for fraudulent options backdating and earnings management practices.

Roberts, for two separate fraudulent schemes, involving improper options backdating practices and certain improper accounting practices. The Commissions Complaint against Ulticom alleges the misconduct began in 1996, when Ulticom was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Comverse Technology, Inc. (Comverse), and continued after Ulticom became a publicly-traded company, while still majority-owned by Comverse, in 2000., According to the Commissions Complaint, between April 2000 and April 2004, Ulticom improperly recorded the grant dates of eight company-wide grants of employee stock options. The Complaint alleges:, Ulticom backdated four of these option grants to coincide with near-term lows in the companys stock price. The options in these four grants were in-the-money, meaning the exercise prices of the backdated Ulticom options were less than the companys stock price on the date the grants were formally approved by Ulticoms Stock Option Committee., The backdating allowed Ulticom to award employees disguised in-the-money options, without recording a corresponding non-cash compensation expense for the in-the-money portion of the option grant in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)., The Commissions Complaint alleges that Ulticoms second scheme involved certain long-standing and improper accounting practices that were not in conformity with GAAP. Specifically, the Complaint alleges:, From 1996 until its initial public offering in April 2000, Ulticom made improper adjustments to its reserve accounts in order to stockpile reserves. In its first fiscal year following its IPO, Ulticom released some of these improper excess reserves into income., Without these improper releases, the company would not have met Wall Street analysts earnings estimates., In addition, from 1998 to April 2001 Ulticom improperly deferred to subsequent periods the recognition of revenues from certain shipments and service contracts between itself and another subsidiary of Comverse., According to the Complaint, as a result of these two schemes, Ulticom filed materially false and misleading financial statements with the Commission that misstated the companys revenues, expenses, liabilities, net income, and earnings per share and made other materially false and misleading disclosures on reports filed with the Commission through April 15, 2005, when it filed its 2004 annual report. In a related Complaint, the Commission also brought suit against Roberts for her alleged participation in these two schemes while serving in various senior accounting and management positions at Ulticom, including Chief Financial Officer (CFO), and for misleading the companys auditors in furtherance of the accounting fraud., Without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions Complaint, both Ulticom and Roberts have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud, reporting, record-keeping, and internal controls, and other provisions of the federal securities laws. Specifically, the proposed final judgment against Ulticom would permanently enjoin it from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Exchange Act Rules 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13, and 14a-9. In accepting the settlement offer, the Commission considered, among other things, Ulticoms extensive cooperation in the Commissions investigation., The proposed final judgment against Roberts would permanently enjoin her from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2, and for aiding and abetting Ulticoms violations of Exchange Act Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 14(a) and Exchange Act Rules 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13, and 14a-9. In addition, Roberts has agreed to pay a $25,000 civil monetary penalty and has consented to an order that would prohibit her from acting as an officer or director of any issuer that has a class of securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act or that is required to file reports pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act. As part of her settlement with the Commission, and following the entry of the proposed final judgment, Roberts has consented to the entry of an administrative order, pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3) of the Commissions Rules of Practice, suspending her from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant, with the right to reapply after five years., The settlements are subject to the approval of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York., The Commission today also announced the filing of settled civil charges against Comverse for fraudulent options backdating and improper accounting practices, including earnings management.

Stanford International Bank, Ltd., et al.</i>, Civil Action No. 3:09-cv-0298 (N.D. Texas, February 17, 2009).</h2>, <h2>SEC CHARGES TWO ACCOUNTANTS AND ANTIGUAN REGULATOR FOR ROLES IN STANFORD PONZI SCHEME</h2>]","[On June 19, 2009, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged two accountants who produced bogus financial statements and an Antiguan regulator who took bribes to look the other way as Robert Allen Stanford conducted an alleged $8 billion Ponzi scheme., The SEC previously charged Stanford and his companies — Antiguan-based Stanford International Bank (SIB), Houston-based broker-dealer and investment adviser Stanford Group Company (SGC), and investment adviser Stanford Capital Management — as well as SIB chief financial officer James Davis and Stanford Financial Group chief investment officer Laura Pendergest-Holt with securities fraud in an enforcement action filed in federal court in Dallas on February 17., The SEC amended its complaint today to additionally charge Mark Kuhrt and Gilberto Lopez, accountants for Stanford-affiliated companies who allegedly fabricated financial statements to give investors the false illusion that their investments were solid, safe and secure. The SEC also charged Leroy King, the administrator and chief executive officer of Antiguas Financial Services Regulatory Commission (FSRC), for accepting thousands of dollars per month in bribes to ignore the Stanford Ponzi scheme and supply Stanford himself with confidential information about the SECs investigation. King obstructed the SECs case since 2005, when its investigation into Stanford began., The SECs additional charges today are in coordination with criminal authorities. The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) today simultaneously announced federal fraud charges against Stanford, Davis, Pendergast-Holt, King, Kuhrt, and Lopez. The DOJ also charged King, Kuhrt, and Lopez with conspiracy to obstruct the SECs investigation. The DOJ previously charged Pendergast-Holt with obstruction of justice in the SECs investigation., According to the SECs complaint, Kuhrt and Lopez used a pre-determined return on investment number (typically provided by Stanford or Davis) to reverse-engineer the SIBs financial statements and report investment income that the bank did not actually earn. Information in SIBs financial statements and annual reports to investors bore no relationship to the actual performance of the bank investments., The SECs complaint alleges that King facilitated the Ponzi scheme by ensuring that the FSRC conducted sham audits and examinations of SIBs books and records. In exchange for bribes paid to him over a period of several years, King made sure that the FSRC did not examine SIBs investment portfolio. King also provided Stanford with access to the FSRCs confidential regulatory files on him, including the SECs requests for information from FSRC in its investigation. King went so far as to allow Stanford to essentially dictate the FSRCs responses to the SEC on those information requests. King made false assurances that there was no cause for concern about Stanford International Bank. He collaborated with Stanford to withhold significant information being requested by the SEC., According to the SECs complaint, King is a citizen of the U.S. as well as Antigua and Barbuda, West Indies. He maintains residences in both Atlanta and Antigua. Lopez lives in Spring, Texas, and worked in SFGs Houston office as the chief accounting officer of SFG and its affiliate, Stanford Financial Group Global Management, LLC (SFGGM). Lopez provided accounting services to many entities under Stanfords control, including SIB, SFG and SFGGM. Kuhrt is a resident of Christiansted, St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands, and is the global controller for SFGGM. He provided accounting services to many entities under Stanfords control, including SIB, SFG, and SFGGM. Kuhrt reported at various times to Lopez and Davis, but also directly to Stanford. Neither Lopez nor Kuhrt is a certified public accountant (CPA)., The SECs complaint charges the defendants with violating and/or aiding and abetting violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933; Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940; and Section 7(d) of the Investment Company Act of 1940.

The Court scheduled a hearing on the matter later in the month., On May 20, 2009, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action charging Clamens, FTC, Emerging Markets, and Lina Lopez, an FTC employee, with a fraudulent ponzi-like scheme to engage in tens of millions of dollars of unauthorized securities trading in the accounts of two FTC customers.  Clamens and Lopez are alleged to have engaged in the unauthorized activity in part to conceal their prior fraudulent sale of $50 million in non-existent notes to a Venezuelan bank.  When the fictitious notes held by the Venezuelan bank purportedly came due in August 2008, Clamens misappropriated $50 million from FTC’s customers to fund the redemption.

Kovachevich, United States District Judge for the Middle District of Florida, entered an order of civil contempt against defendant Jeffrey G. Turino.  In addition to finding Turino in contempt, the Court ordered him to pay $9.6 million in disgorgement, plus $348,423.24 in prejudgment interest, and permanently banned him from participating in any penny stock offering., In her ruling, Judge Kovachevich found that the Commission had demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that Turino acted in flagrant and repeated contempt of the penny stock bar that she had imposed against him in December 2003 in connection with a previous Commission enforcement action brought against Turino in May 2002.  In that action, the Commission had alleged that Turino, one of his associates, and the penny stock company they operated, Pinnacle Business Management, Inc., had committed securities fraud by making materially false and misleading statements about Pinnacle’s business operations.  Turino settled this enforcement action by consenting to the entry of a permanent fraud injunction, a permanent officer and director bar, payment of a $60,000 civil penalty, and a five-year penny stock bar., In its motion to hold Turino in contempt, the Commission outlined its evidence that Turino had violated the five-year penny stock bar by, first, spearheading the reverse merger in 2004 of a penny stock issuer and arranging the resulting penny stock offering and, second, by using two nominees, one a former exotic dancer whom he had been dating, and the other a former nightclub manager, to participate in penny stock offerings by four other issuers during 2006 through 2008.  Turino gave detailed instructions to his nominees to create corporations, open bank and brokerage accounts, buy, sell, and transfer billions of shares of penny stock companies, and deposit, withdraw, and distribute millions of dollars worth of penny stock proceeds to his friends and family.  Altogether, Turino improperly obtained at least 3.5 billion shares of penny stocks.  He subsequently sold at least 1.8 billion of these shares into the U. S. securities markets, generating approximately $9.6 million in ill-gotten proceeds., For additional information, see below:,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21094.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Civ. 09 CV 5680)</h2>, <h2>SEC CHARGES MADOFF SOLICITORS WITH FRAUD</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Cohmad Securities Corporation, a New York-based broker-dealer, as well as its chairman Maurice J. Cohn, chief operating officer Marcia B. Cohn, and registered representative Robert M. Jaffe alleging that they collectively raised billions of dollars from investors for Bernard L. Madoffs Ponzi scheme., In a complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, the SEC charged the defendants for actively marketing investment opportunities with Madoff while knowingly or recklessly disregarding facts indicating that Madoff was operating a fraud. The SEC previously charged Madoff and Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC (BMIS) as well as their auditors with committing securities fraud through a Ponzi scheme perpetrated on advisory and brokerage customers of BMIS., The SECs complaint against the Cohmad defendants alleges that while bringing investors to Madoff, they ignored and even participated in many suspicious practices that clearly indicated Madoff was engaged in fraud. For example, the SECs complaint alleges that the Cohns and Cohmad filed false Forms BD and FOCUS reports that concealed Cohmads primary business of bringing in investors for BMIS. This referral business comprised as much as 90 percent of Cohmads revenue in some years, brought in more than 800 accounts, and billions of dollars into BMIS advisory business, for which BMIS paid them more than $100 million., The SECs complaint also alleges that the compensation arrangement between BMIS and Cohmad indicated fraudulent conduct at BMIS. Cohmad was paid an annual percentage of the funds its representatives (except Jaffe) brought into BMIS offset by any withdrawals from those investor accounts. This compensation arrangement indicated to Cohmad and the Cohns that BMIS was not providing any real returns to investors. For example, where the clients principal investment had been $10,000, Cohmad stopped receiving fees if a client withdrew $15,000 from an account, even if under BMIS management the account had purportedly grown to $100,000. In Cohmads internal records, such an account was designated with a negative $5,000 number., The SEC alleges that Jaffe also participated in Madoffs fraud by soliciting investors and bringing more than $1 billion into BMIS. The Complaint alleges, among other things, that Madoff compensated Jaffe with outsized returns in Jaffes personal accounts that he knew, or was reckless in not knowing, were manufactured by BMIS employees entering fictitious, backdated trades onto trade confirmations and account statements for his personal accounts at BMIS., The SECs complaint against the Cohmad defendants specifically alleges that Cohmad violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b), 15(b)(1), 15(b)(7), and 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 15b3-1, 15b7-1 and 17a-3 thereunder and aided and abetted violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-3 thereunder; that the Cohns violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and aided and abetted violations of Sections 10(b), 15(b)(1), 15(b)(7), and 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 15b3-1, 15b7-1 and 17a-3 thereunder and Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of the Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-3 thereunder; and that Robert Jaffe violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and aided and abetted violations of Sections 10(b), 15(b)(7), and 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 15b7-1 and 17a-3 thereunder and Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-3 thereunder., Among other things, the SECs complaint seeks injunctions, financial penalties and a court order requiring Cohmad, the Cohns, and Jaffe to disgorge their ill-gotten gains., The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the Trustee for the Securities Investor Protection Corporation.

Chais made a number of misrepresentations over the years to the Funds investors indicating that he formulated and executed the Funds trading strategy. In reality, Chais was an unsophisticated investor who did nothing more than turn all of the Funds assets over to Madoff, while charging the Funds well over $250 million in fees for his purported services. Despite the fact that Chais turned all of the Funds assets over to Madoff, many of the Funds investors had never heard of Madoff before the collapse of his Ponzi scheme, and had not known that Chais invested with Madoff until Chais informed them after Madoffs arrest., The SEC also alleges that Chais ignored red flags indicating that Madoffs reported returns were false. For example, Chais told Madoff that Chais did not want there to be any losses on any of the Funds trades. Madoff complied with Chaiss request, and from 1999 to 2008, despite reportedly executing thousands of trades on behalf of the Funds, Madoff did not report a loss on a single equities trade. Chais however, with the assistance of his accountant, prepared account statements for the Funds investors based upon the Madoff statements, and continued to distribute them to the Funds investors even though he should have known they were false., According to the complaint, Chais also opened and exercised control over approximately 60 other accounts at Madoffs firm on behalf of his family members and related entities. Taking all of these accounts collectively, between 1995 and 2008, Chais and his family members and related entities withdrew more than $500 million more than they actually invested with Madoff., The SECs complaint specifically alleges that Chais violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder., Among other things, the SECs complaint seeks financial penalties and a court order requiring Chais to disgorge his ill-gotten gains., The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the Trustee for the Securities Investor Protection Corporation, and California Attorney General Jerry Brown.

The final judgment settles the Commissions claims against Schmidgall that were asserted in a civil action filed on September 15, 2008 against Schmidgall and AIPCs former executive vice president of corporate development and strategy, David E. Watson, alleging securities fraud and other violations of the federal securities laws. The Commissions case against Watson is ongoing., In its complaint, the Commission alleged that from AIPCs fiscal year 2002 through the second quarter of its fiscal year 2004, Schmidgall engaged in a fraudulent accounting scheme to mislead the investing public about the growth of the companys earnings and to increase artificially the companys stock price. According to the complaint, the fraudulent accounting, and other errors arising from inadequate internal controls, resulted in the overstatement of AIPCs pre-tax income for the relevant period by approximately $59 million, or 66 percent., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, Schmidgall consented to a final judgment enjoining him from violations of Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder, and aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder.

Nothern, Liable for Insider Trading of U.S. Treasury 30-Year Bonds</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that on June 22, 2009, a federal jury in Boston, Massachusetts, returned a verdict in its favor against Steven E. Nothern, a former Senior Vice President and manager of seven fixed income mutual funds for Massachusetts Financial Services Company (MFS). This action is one of several brought by the Commission arising from trading in U.S. Treasury 30-year bonds., The Commissions complaint against Nothern alleged that Peter J. Davis, Jr., a Washington, D.C. based consultant, marketed himself to Wall Street clients by claiming special access that enabled him to get Washington information ahead of the media, and by promising clients the first call on investment issues they care about. Nothern, who managed seven fixed income mutual funds for MFS, was Davis primary contact at MFS., The complaint alleged that, since 1994, Davis had attended the Treasury Departments quarterly refunding press conferences under an explicit agreement that he would honor the news embargo that Treasury imposed until the designated public announcement time. At these press conferences, the Treasury Department announced the Federal Governments financing requirements for the coming quarter. The complaint further alleged that at the October 31, 2001, refunding press conference, Treasury Department officials announced three times that the information being made available was embargoed until 10:00 a.m. The press conference ended at approximately 9:25 a.m. Then, Davis, despite the officials warnings, and in violation of his prior explicit agreement to abide by the embargo, placed a series of cell phone calls to his clients, including Nothern, and told Nothern that the Treasury Department was suspending future long bond issuances. The complaint charged that Nothern knew, from a voice mail which Davis left him and which he listened to, that Davis had learned about the suspension of 30-year bond issuances directly from the Treasury Department, and that the news was embargoed until a scheduled 10:00 a.m. press announcement., According to the complaint, after Nothern heard the news of the Treasurys decision to cease issuance of the long bond from Davis on the morning of October 31, 2001, and before the news became public, Nothern and other MFS portfolio managers that he tipped bought $65 million in par value of 30-year bonds for funds that they managed, generating approximately $3.1 million in illegal profits., After deliberating for three hours, the jury returned a verdict finding that Nothern violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The Commissions complaint seeks as relief a permanent injunction, disgorgement with pre-judgment interest, and a civil money penalty. The court will determine the appropriate remedies against Nothern at a later date., For more information about this and related cases, see the Commissions Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18322.htm>18322</a>, dated September 4, 2003, Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18453.htm>18453</a>, dated November 12, 2003 and Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr19223.htm>19223</a>, dated May 12, 2005.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21099.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The Commission alleges that the defendants engaged in a fraudulent offering of securities of Gold Rush Technologies, Inc., Dillon Scotts parent company., The SECs complaint alleges that from January 2001 through July 2007, the defendants raised at least $1.3 million from 29 investors through three unregistered offerings of Gold Rush. Becker and Schaefer, in offering memoranda, direct solicitations, and solicitations by two of their salespersons, represented that the money raised would be used to form and expand a brokerage firm, Dillon Scott. Instead, Becker and Schaefer diverted about 79% of the offering proceeds to enrich themselves and others. Becker and Schaefer used Gold Rushs corporate ATM cards over 4,200 times to withdraw approximately $600,000. Becker and Schaefer also used $69,000 in investor funds to pay various personal expenses including meals, groceries, and domestic and international travel. They also wrote checks to themselves and others in amounts totaling approximately $361,000. The victims of the scheme include at least 10 individuals who are sixty years of age or older and at least 10 individuals who were brokerage customers of Dillon Scott., The complaint further alleges that Dillon Scott, aided and abetted by Becker and Schaefer, did not disclose Beckers control over Dillon Scott in the firms broker-dealer regulatory filings; permitted Becker and another individual to effect securities transactions when they were not registered with FINRA; and did not keep and maintain a current Form U-4 or other questionnaire or application for employment for Becker and the salesperson., The complaint charges Becker, Schaefer, and Dillon Scott with violating the general antifraud and registration provisions of the securities laws, Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.

(AMM), and Business Development &amp; Consulting Co. (BD&amp;C) raised $14.7 million from more than 200 investors over a 3½-year period, acting as investment advisers to the five self-described hedge funds — AP Premium Value Funds I through IV and Capital Partnership Group. According to the SECs complaint, Pacheco told investors that he had developed a lucrative investment strategy involving the purchase and sale of covered call options, and that the hedge funds exclusively relied upon this strategy to generate trading profits ranging from 30 percent to 48 percent per year. In reality, Pacheco did not generate the returns he claimed to have made, and instead used investor principal to pay purported returns until the scheme collapsed., According to the SECs complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, the hedge funds generated trading profits of only about $367,000, but paid investors purported returns of more than $9.7 million. The SEC alleges that the defendants thus operated a Ponzi-like scheme and further misused investor principal by transferring their money to Pacheco, entities under his control, or numerous third parties for reasons having nothing to do with the purported trading., The SEC alleges that Pacheco claimed that the hedge funds had generated returns ranging from 2.5 to 4 percent per month during their existence, and continued to claim that they generated returns in that range until January 2008, when he reduced the returns to 1.25 percent per month. Pacheco told fund investors that the reduction was due to deteriorating economic conditions. Most fund investors live in the Chula Vista, California area, and know either Pacheco, one of his friends or family members, or another investor. The SEC alleges that Pacheco made no effort to determine whether the hedge fund investors were accredited or sophisticated, and did not provide investors with financial statements. Neither Pacheco nor his entities have ever been registered with the SEC., The SECs complaint alleges that Pacheco, AMM, and BD&amp;C violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), (2), and (4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest thereon, and financial penalties.

Regan and Regan &amp; Co. have agreed to settle the Commissions charges, without admitting or denying the allegations., The Commissions action, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that over an eight year period Regan offered and sold securities in his now defunct investment fund, dubbed the River Stream Fund, by falsely representing to investors that he would invest their funds in the stock market. Regan also represented that, because of his trading expertise and successful investment record, investors could expect annual returns averaging twenty percent, with minimal risk to their principal. Contrary to his representations, Regan did no securities trading at all for several years, used less than half of the funds entrusted to him for trading purposes, and suffered substantial losses on investments that he did make. Regan repeatedly concealed his misconduct and deceived investors by preparing and sending them fictitious account statements and tax forms showing artificially inflated balances and returns. Instead of protecting the investors principal and delivering the promised returns, Regan misappropriated and used millions of dollars of investor funds to support his extravagant lifestyle and to satisfy withdrawal requests from some investors., The Commissions complaint charges Regan and Regan &amp; Co. with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), 206(4) and Rule 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

Selden was the former CEO of Transkaryotic Therapies (TKT), a biotechnology company that was headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and was publicly-traded until it was acquired in July 2005. The Commission filed an enforcement action against Selden in September 2005 alleging that he made misleading statements about TKTs flagship drug. On July 8, 2008, the Court entered a final judgment by consent against defendant Selden, enjoining him from violating the antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws and ordering him to pay a $125,000 civil penalty and $1,041,417 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest related to his sales of TKT stock during the period of the alleged fraud, but leaving the issue of an officer and director bar open to a later decision by the Court., Selden was the only defendant in a civil injunctive action filed on September 1, 2005, alleging that he made materially misleading statements between October 2000 and October 2002 concerning results of TKTs clinical trials and its U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) application for its flagship drug, Replagal. The Commissions complaint alleged that, during the relevant time period, Selden and, at his direction, TKT, made positive statements concerning Replagals clinical benefits, describing its clinical trials as a success, and made positive statements about Replagals chance of being approved by FDA. However, the complaint alleged that Selden knew, but failed to disclose, material negative information, including that Replagals clinical trial failed to meet its primary objective and FDA had told TKT on several occasions that it was a failed study and had recommended additional clinical trials. The complaint further alleged that Selden benefited by selling 90,000 shares of TKT stock between May 2001 and February 2002, prior to TKTs disclosure of some negative information about Replagal on October 2, 2002, which caused TKTs stock price to fall., For further information about the Commissions action in SEC v.

Mattera, with securities antifraud and registration violations for their participation in a fraudulent scheme to evade the registration requirements. , The Commission’s complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, alleges that from February 2006 through November 2007, defendants Prime Time, Arnold, Robinson, and Metz participated in the dissemination of false and misleading press releases to the public concerning, among other things, Prime Time’s acquisition and ownership interest in a Puerto Rico convenience store franchise, agreements the Company claimed to have with other wireless businesses, and its purported acquisitions of other companies., The complaint also alleges that during the same period, Prime Time, Arnold, and Mattera made false statements to the Company’s transfer agent in connection with a fraudulent scheme involving the issuance of bogus promissory notes.  This scheme allowed Mattera to obtain millions of unlegended shares of Prime Time stock, most of which he later sold in the open market in November 2007., The complaint further alleges that Prime Time, Arnold, and Mattera violated the securities registration provisions by engaging in unregistered distributions of Prime Time stock.  For instance, the Commission alleges that Prime Time, Arnold, and Mattera engaged in an improper “gypsy swap” transaction in which Mattera agreed to transfer his unlegended shares to various stock promoters on behalf of Prime Time.

Cocchiola and Venechanos</i>, No. CR05-533-SRC.  , The Commission also announced today that on June 4, 2009, the Commission brought to a close related civil injunctive proceedings against eleven other defendants, listed below, whom the Commission alleged had participated in the Suprema financial fraud:, Each of the eleven above-listed individuals and entities had previously consented to the entry of judgments imposing full permanent injunctive relief and, in the case of the individuals, officer and director bars.  These judgments had reserved the Commission’s right to apply to the court at a later time to determine disgorgement and civil penalties.  In view of the restitution orders and other criminal sanctions subsequently imposed on these defendants in the parallel criminal case, the Commission has withdrawn its claims for additional disgorgement and civil penalties from these defendants.   The Commission has also withdrawn its claims for additional relief against Van Sickell, who died in June 2008.   , As detailed in prior releases, the Commission’s complaints in this matter alleged that Suprema engaged in fraudulent “round-tripping” transactions that resulted in total misstatements of Suprema’s reported revenue of between approximately 35% and over 60% in each of the 1999, 2000 and 2001 fiscal years, and in the first quarter of fiscal year 2002.  The complaints further alleged that the scheme resulted in total misstatements of Suprema’s reported accounts receivable of 60% or more in each of the 1999, 2000 and 2001 fiscal years., According to the complaints, the “round-tripping” transactions were effectuated through “circles” of entities, each of which included Suprema, a third-party “customer,” and a related “vendor.”  As the complaints alleged, the customer and vendor in each circle tended to have a common owner.  The complaints alleged that false paperwork was created documenting the fictitious transactions, and checks were circulated in purported payment for the transactions.  Participants allegedly received a kick-back or “commission” on each transaction, the funds for which were generally drawn from Suprema’s line of credit, which increased as Suprema’s accounts receivable grew.  With rare exceptions, the complaint alleged, no goods were actually sold, purchased, or exchanged in these transactions. , The Commission alleged that Cocchiola and Venechanos were aware of, approved of, and participated in the fraud from at least in or around February 2000.  The Commission further alleged that Christensen was aware of improprieties in Suprema’s cheese transactions from at least 1998 and that, from August 2001 through his resignation in December 2001, he assumed responsibility for coordinating the flow of false invoices and checks in the round-tripping scheme.  The Commission further alleged that, from December 2001 through February 2002, Vieira assumed responsibility for coordinating the flow of false invoices and checks in the round-tripping scheme.  Finally, the Commission further alleged that Battaglia, CMM, LNN, Packing Products, and WCC participated as customers and vendors in the round-tripping transactions and that Fransen, Gaglio, Quattrone, and Vieira controlled these entities and received commissions in return for their participation.  , In related proceedings, Christensen, Fransen, Gaglio, Quattrone, Van Sickell, and Vieira pled guilty to criminal informations filed by the United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey, including counts of securities fraud and conspiracy to commit securities fraud.  All of these defendants (except Van Sickell, who died prior to sentencing) were sentenced to terms of probation or imprisonment and were ordered jointly and severally to pay varying amounts of restitution that totaled in excess of $100 million.  (<i>U.S. v. Arthur Christensen</i>, CR07-32 (D.N.J.); <i>U.S. v. Lawrence Fransen</i>, CR04-10 (D.N.J.); <i>U.S. v. Jack Gaglio</i>, CR05-141 (D.N.J.); <i>U.S. v.

Also in related proceedings, Cocchiola and Venechanos were convicted by a jury on 38 felony counts of conspiracy, bank fraud, false statements to the Commission, mail fraud and wire fraud prosecuted by the United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey.  Cocchiola and Venechanos were sentenced to 15 and 8 years of imprisonment, respectively, and were ordered joint and severally to pay over $115 million in restitution.  (<i>U.S. v.

The judgment enjoins Finbar from violating the antifraud and the broker-dealer registration provisions of the federal securities laws, and specifies that funds and assets of the receivership estate, if any, will be distributed to investors less court-approved fees and expenses pursuant to a plan of distribution that may be submitted by the receiver. On May 21, 2009, the Court clerk entered Tringhams default for failing to respond to the Commissions complaint. , The Commissions complaint, filed on April 3, alleges that Tringham and Finbar fraudulently raised at least $6.4 million from investors in the U.S. and abroad, and falsely represented that Finbar was a licensed Securities Dealer and engaged in other fraudulent conduct. The complaint alleges Tringham told investors Finbar sold debt instruments and high yield risk-free investment opportunities, and that Finbar had not been registered with the Commission and that Tringham had not been associated with any registered broker or dealer. The Commission obtained a temporary restraining order and other emergency relief on April 3, and a preliminary injunction and an order appointing a permanent receiver on April 13., In addition to the relief already obtained, the Commission seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement, and civil penalties against Tringham, and disgorgement and civil penalties against Finbar.

The Complaint alleged that the defendants engaged in a scheme beginning in January 2001 by which they and other executives of PFTC defrauded a defined contribution plan client and group of mutual funds of approximately $4 million. Donald F. McCracken, of Naples, Maine, a former senior managing director and head of fund accounting at PFTC consented to imposition of the final judgment without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions Complaint. The Court issued an order of permanent injunction against McCracken against future violations of Section 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and imposed a civil money penalty of $35,000. McCracken also agreed to an order barring him from association with any broker or dealer and transfer agent with the right to reapply for association after one year, which order will be imposed in a separate administrative proceeding. As part of the settlement, the Commission also agreed to dismiss certain other charges against McCracken., The Commission=s Complaint against McCracken and five other defendants, filed on December 30, 2005, alleges that the defendants= misconduct arose out of PFTC=s one-day delay in investing certain assets of a defined contribution client, Cardinal Health, Inc., in January 2001. The markets rose steeply on the missed day, causing Cardinal Health=s defined contribution plan to miss out on nearly $4 million of market gains. According to the Complaint, rather than inform Cardinal Health of the one-day delay and the missed trading gain, the defendants decided to improperly shift approximately $3 million of the costs of the delay to shareholders of certain Putnam mutual funds through deception, illegal trade reversals, and accounting machinations. The Complaint also alleges that the defendants improperly allowed Cardinal Health=s defined contribution plan to bear approximately $1 million of the loss without disclosing to Cardinal Heath that they had done so. The Complaint further alleges that certain defendants also took steps to cover-up the wrongful conduct, and, as a result, the conduct was not discovered until January 2004.

In addition to the asset freeze, the court has appointed a receiver to preserve and marshal assets for the benefit of investors., The Commission alleges that from at least June 2006 through January 2009, Provident made a series of fraudulent offerings of preferred stock and limited partnership interests for the purpose of generating promised returns through investments in oil and gas assets. The complaint alleges the sales were made through 21 affiliated entities to more than 7,700 investors throughout the United States.

(UCI or the Company). UCI is a public issuer and a provider of nonmedical management and administrative services based in South Carolina., The Complaint alleges that between 2003 and 2008, Wells embezzled approximately $2.97 million from UCI through a variety of measures including: (1) using UCIs corporate credit card to pay personal expenses: (2) preparing false expense reports and submitting them for reimbursement; and (3) submitting unsupported check requests for non-business expenses, including construction work on Wells personal residences and personal credit card accounts. The Complaint further alleges that Wells capitalized the expenses as fixed assets on the Companys balance sheet, rather than expensing them in their entirety as they were incurred, causing UCI to overstate its net earnings in the affected periods. According to the Complaint, to justify capitalizing these expenses, Wells altered invoices from contractors performing work on his personal residences to suggest that the work was for one of UCIs facilities, and provided fraudulent work descriptions on the related check requests. The Complaint also alleges that Wells signed each of the Companys Forms 10-Q and 10-K and accompanying Sarbanes-Oxley certifications, thereby misrepresenting that they did not contain any untrue statements of material fact. The Complaint further alleges that, in connection with the audit of the Companys annual financial statements, Wells also signed multiple management representation letters to UCIs auditors, thereby misrepresenting that the Companys financial statements were prepared in conformity with GAAP., The Complaint charges Wells with violations of Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, 13b2-2 and 13a-14, promulgated thereunder.

(the Sky Entities). The Commission also charged Sky Capitals founder, former President and CEO, Ross Mandell, the firms former COO, Stephen Shea, and four registered representatives, Adam Harrington Ruckdeschel, Arn Wilson, Michael Passaro, and Robert Grabowski, for orchestrating and participating in the fraudulent scheme designed to fraudulently induce numerous individuals to invest in the Sky Entities., According to the Commissions complaint, Mandell orchestrated the fraudulent scheme with the assistance of Shea and the other defendants. According to the complaint, Mandell directed Sky Capital brokers to make material misrepresentations, and fail to disclose material information, to induce their Sky Capital customers to purchase stock in the Sky Entities. Mandell also personally made material misrepresentations to his customers. Additionally, the defendants implemented and enforced a no-net sales policy, which had the effect of preventing investors from selling their Sky Entities stocks that were otherwise publicly traded on the Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange. The no-net sales policy had the effect of artificially inflating the price of the Sky Entities stocks. Moreover, as a result of the no-net sales policy, which the defendants did not disclose to their customers, numerous Sky Capital investors were unable to sell their shares in the Sky Entities before trading in those stocks was suspended thereby rendering the investments worthless., The SECs complaint further alleges that the fraudulent scheme was extremely profitable for the defendants. Between 2002 and 2006, Sky Capital raised over $61 million from investors in the U.S. and the U.K. Mandell used the investor funds to subsidize his own lifestyle, including using investor funds for various personal expenses, including first-class travel, five-star hotel stays, expensive meals, adult entertainment, and child-care expenses. Mandell also used investor funds to richly compensate the other individual defendants by paying them hefty undisclosed commissions and giving them other perks., The SECs complaint charges each of the defendants with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also, in the alternative, charges Shea with aiding and abetting the other defendants violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Additionally, the SECs complaint charges Sky Capital with violating Section 15(c) of the Exchange Act, and Mandell with aiding and abetting Sky Capitals violation of Section 15(c) of the Exchange Act. The complaint seeks a final judgment permanently enjoining the defendants from future violations of the above provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to disgorge their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and ordering them to pay civil penalties.

Duncan, Montecastro, and McLeod used PWM, Stonewood, and TRF to raise more than $29 million from investors in several affinity groups, including the Southern California Filipino community, fellow church members, and military personnel. The Court permanently enjoined Duncan, Montecastro, PWM, Stonewood, and TRF from future violations of the registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, as it had previously done with McLeod on August 28, 2008. The Court also ordered Duncan to pay disgorgement of $29,498,679 plus prejudgment interest, imposed joint and several liability on Montecastro for $27,515,421 of this amount, ordered McLeod to pay $469,223 in disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, and imposed civil penalties of $130,000 against each of Duncan, Montecastro, and McLeod., In its Complaint, filed February 27, 2008, the Commission alleged that Duncan, Montecastro, and McLeod, operating through Murrieta, California-based PWM and Stonewood, promised investors financial freedom within three years in exchange for control over their finances. The defendants offered investors securities in the form of investment contracts to purchase and maintain investment homes on behalf of investors. The Complaint further alleged that Duncan conducted a separate offering of preferred membership units in Total Return Fund, LLC, and that the proceeds raised in both offerings were commingled and used to run a Ponzi-like scheme that fell apart in late 2006., Following a hearing on July 6, 2009, Judge Phillips granted the Commissions motion as to all of its claims against each defendant. In her 43-page order granting summary judgment, Judge Phillips found that the defendants represented that they were a Christian organization. In fact, Duncan and Montecastro were using investor funds for regular sprees to Las Vegas. An investor would consider it important to know that the principals were misrepresenting their beliefs and not using investor funds as represented, but rather to fund a lavish lifestyle which meant there was little likelihood that investors would receive a reasonable return, or any return, on their investments. Judge Phillips also found that Duncan used a complex web of transactions to obscure his involvement, which was clear evidence of his intent to deceive., For additional information, please see Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20469.htm>20469</a> (February 27, 2008).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21121.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The unauthorized purchases created the appearance of legitimate trading activity, thereby inducing others to trade the securities and driving up the price and volume of these stocks. The complaint further alleges that in each of these instances, Badmaevas trading pattern was similar. In some instances, Badmaeva first accumulated in her own account a position in one of the issuers. Next, a series of unauthorized electronic intrusions involving that issuer occurred at one or more broker-dealers whereby the intruders liquidated existing positions in the accounts and used the resulting proceeds to buy thousands of shares of the same stocks previously purchased by Badmaeva in her own account. Then, at the height of the pump, Badmaeva sold her shares at the inflated prices for a profit. In other instances, Badmaeva engaged in short sales, timing her covers by taking advantage of the lower prices following the intrusions., The complaint further alleges that the Pointer Worldwide account, which is beneficially owned by Badmaeva, was the only account that traded in all four of these securities on the dates of the intrusions. Moreover, the account, which was opened just one week before the intrusions began and closed shortly thereafter, traded in only these four securities. In just three days of trading involving a combination of buys, sales and short sales, Pointer Worldwide and Badmaeva generated a net profit of $33,113.75 trading in the four securities., The Commissions action charges Pointer Worldwide and Badmaeva with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement and civil money penalties., The SECs Office of Investor Education and Assistance has previously issued an investor alert, available on the SECs website, which provides tips for avoiding becoming a victim of an online intrusion.

Kevin Castel, United States District Judge for the Southern District of New York, found after a bench trial that Cary G. Brody and two entities he controlled, New York hedge fund Colonial Fund LLC and its adviser, Colonial Investment Management LLC, were liable for illegal trading relating to eighteen registered public offerings. The court permanently enjoined the defendants from violating Rule 105 of Regulation M under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Judge Castel also ordered defendants to pay disgorgement totaling more than $1.4 million in ill-gotten gains, plus prejudgment interest, and required Brody to pay a civil penalty of $450,000., In general, Rule 105 seeks to prevent manipulative trading by short sellers prior to registered public offerings and to promote offering prices that are based upon open market prices, determined by supply and demand, rather than by artificial forces. At the time of the violations, Rule 105 generally prohibited short sellers, regardless of intent, from using securities purchased in registered public offerings to cover short sales that occurred during the five business days before the pricing of the offerings (the restricted period)., The Commissions complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan on October 15, 2007, alleged that the defendants violated Rule 105 when they used shares purchased in at least eighteen registered public offerings to cover short sales that they made during the rules restricted period. The defendants allegedly realized profits in excess of $1.4 million from the illegal trades because Colonial Fund typically sold shares short during the restricted period at prices that were higher than the offering prices and then covered the restricted period short positions with shares purchased at lower prices in the offerings. The complaint also alleged the defendants often structured post-offering trades in an effort to conceal their Rule 105 violations., In his ruling, Judge Castel found, among other things, that the defendants Rule 105 violations were complete when Colonial purchased offering stock, that the defendants post-offering trading could not undo the violations, and that those trades were an effort by the defendants to create the false appearance to third parties and regulators that they had not used shares purchased in public offerings to illegally cover the short positions. Judge Castel further found that defendants acted recklessly with respect to five of the offerings, and knowingly, intentionally, and willfully with respect to the other thirteen offerings. The court imposed a $450,000 civil penalty on Brody, finding that Brodys unlawful actions involved fraud, deceit, manipulation, or deliberate or reckless disregard of a regulatory requirement., For further information, please see <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20332.htm>LR-20332</a> (October 15, 2007)., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21123-findings.pdf>Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21123.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Minn.)</h2>, <h2>SEC FREEZES ASSETS OF ILLINOIS-BASED HEDGE FUND MANAGER WHO WAS $2 BILLION FEEDER TO PONZI SCHEME</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced fraud charges and an asset freeze against a Highland Park, Ill.-based hedge fund manager and his firm for facilitating a multi-billion dollar Ponzi scheme operated by Minnesota businessman Thomas Petters., The SECs complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota, alleges that Gregory Bell and Lancelot Management LLC invested more than $2 billion in hedge funds assets with Petters and pocketed millions of dollars in fraudulent fees at the expense of investors in the funds. The SECs complaint also charges Petters with fraud for perpetrating the massive Ponzi scheme through the sale of notes related to consumer electronics. When Petterss scheme began to unravel, Bell participated in a series of sham transactions to conceal that Petters owed more than $130 million in investor payments on the notes., Bell, Lancelot Management, and the hedge funds they manage have never been registered with the SEC or any other regulatory agency., At the SECs request for emergency relief for investors, the Hon. Ann D. Montgomery, United States District Court, District of Minnesota, issued a court order freezing all assets of Bell and Lancelot Management as well as relief defendants, including Bells wife Inna Goldman. Among other things, the court order requires that they repatriate all overseas assets to the United States. Petters was previously charged by the U.S. Attorney for the District of Minnesota in early October 2008, and his assets were frozen at that time. He is in custody awaiting trial., According to the SECs complaint, Petters carried out his Ponzi scheme from as early as 1995 through September 2008, promising investors that proceeds from the notes they were sold would be used to finance the purchase of vast amounts of consumer electronics by vendors who then re-sold the merchandise to Big Box retailers including such well-known chains as Wal-Mart and Costco. Instead, the purchase order inventory financing business was a complete sham, and the vendors secretly returned most investor money back to Petters, who diverted billions of dollars for his own purposes., The SEC alleges that Petters sold the notes to several feeder funds that in turn raised their investment capital from hundreds of private investors in the U.S. and abroad. Beginning in 2002, Bell and Lancelot Management raised approximately $2.62 billion from hundreds of investors through the sale of interests in three hedge funds they managed (Lancelot Investors Fund, L.P., Lancelot Investors Fund II, L.P., and Lancelot Investors Fund, Ltd.). The investors included individuals, retirement plans, individual retirement accounts, trusts, corporations, partnerships, and other hedge funds. Bell and Lancelot Investment used almost all of the fund assets to purchase notes offered by Petters and his companies., The SECs complaint alleges:, <b>False Assurances</b> — Bell and Lancelot Management falsely assured investors that they were taking specific steps to protect investor money and to verify the legitimacy of Petterss financing business, when in fact they did not. Bell and Lancelot Management also failed to inform investors that Petters was previously convicted of multiple crimes involving fraud and deception., <b>Bogus Roundtrips</b> — Beginning around February 2008 after Petters had been delinquent for months in repaying more than $130 million of notes, Bell and Petters concocted a series of bogus roundtrip payments to conceal Petterss delinquencies. Bell and Lancelot Management on multiple occasions sent money directly to Petterss company under the pretense that the money was for investment in a new note. Petters, through his employees, then returned the money to Bell and Lancelot Management, typically on the same day. It was packaged as the repayment of one of the outstanding debts owed to the Lancelot hedge funds., <b>Wrongful Withdrawals</b> — During the final months before the collapse of the Petters Ponzi scheme, Bell and Lancelot Management wrongfully withdrew more than $40 million from the Lancelot Funds as purported fees. Bell and Lancelot Management also transferred millions to an account he controls jointly with his wife as well as a revocable trust in his name and a revocable trust in his wifes name. Bell also transferred millions to an account in Switzerland for the benefit of a third trust., The SECs complaint charges Bell, Lancelot Management and Petters with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also charges Bell and Lancelot Management with violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206-4(8)., The SEC seeks entry of a court order of permanent injunction against Bell, Lancelot Management and Petters, as well as an order of disgorgement, including prejudgment interest and financial penalties. The SEC also seeks an order requiring the relief defendants to disgorge all ill-gotten gains and pay prejudgment interest., The SECs investigation is continuing., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2009/comp21124.pdf>SEC Complaint</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21124.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

According to the State of Indiana, the Reeves’ scheme involved approximately 300 separate bond issuances that raised at least $120 million from investors.  The State of Indiana alleged that the Reeves’ scheme was an affinity fraud in that Alanar’s marketing strategy was devised to appeal to the Christian faith of potential investors.  The court papers filed in the state criminal prosecution alleged that the Reeves misused funds from certain bond issuances to conceal from investors the true rate of default on Alanar’s bonds.  The State of Indiana further alleged that the Reeves received more than $6 million in ill-gotten gains from their actions.  The Reeves were charged with 10 separate felony counts of violating the Indiana Securities Act and each of them could face up to eight years in prison per charge if convicted., In July 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) filed a civil action against the Reeves and other defendants alleging, among other things, that the Reeves violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws by misusing investor funds and improperly diverting investor funds to themselves and entities they controlled.  The Commission further alleged that the Reeves’ scheme raised more than $120 million from investors in church bonds, including $50 million from investors in related bond funds.  On July 26, 2005, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana issued an Order of Permanent Injunction against the Reeves and various entities they controlled which, among other things, permanently enjoined the Reeves from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, froze their assets, and appointed an independent monitor over the Reeves’ entities.   In December 2005, the Court appointed a receiver over the Reeves’ entities.  The Court subsequently approved a plan that provides for a distribution of funds to harmed investors through the Court-appointed receiver.  On May 19, 2008, the Court entered final judgments against the Reeves which, among other things, required them to collectively pay more than $7.88 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest and civil penalties.

With claims that its products had anti-aging benefits from an ingredient extracted from a berry used in traditional Chinese medicine, MitoPharms stock price more than quadrupled during the aggressive stock promotion campaign.  However, the SEC alleges that MitoPharms products were not available as advertised and were still in the developmental stage.  Full-color photos featuring beverage cans and pill bottles were only mock-ups of non-existent products., The SECs complaint, filed in federal court in Seattle, charges Otto, his associate Todd Van Siclen of Seattle, and Houston-based stock promoter Charles Bingham and his company Wall Street PR, Inc.  MitoPharm and its CEO Pak Peter Cheung of Vancouver were also charged., According to the SECs complaint, the scheme began in late 2006 when Otto, who was hired by Cheung, arranged to purchase a publicly traded shell company as a merger partner for MitoPharm.  Otto and Van Siclen drafted opinion letters to MitoPharms transfer agent filled with false statements in order to secure supposedly freely tradable stock certificates for individuals and entities secretly controlled by Otto., The SECs complaint alleges that Cheung hired Bingham on Ottos recommendation, and they embarked on an aggressive public relations campaign that centered on the misleading promotion of two key products - Restorade and Stamina Solutions - that did not exist.  They developed promotional materials that falsely stated that both Restorade and Stamina Solution are [a]vailable as functional beverage or as a soft gel capsule.  To accompany the written text of MitoPharms Web site and other promotional materials, Cheung had a graphics artist create renderings of what the containers for MitoPharms products could look like.  Written materials and Web profiles created by Bingham and others were disseminated to investors with fake images and present-tense descriptions of the products., The SEC further alleges that as the promotional campaign caused the stock price to rise above $2.30, Otto sold his shares for more than $1 million and Bingham netted an additional $300,000.  The massive selling of the stock caused the price to fall to a nickel per share by November 2007., The SECs complaint alleges that all defendants violated Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and that Otto, Van Siclen, Cheung and MitoPharm violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SECs complaint also charges MitoPharm with violating Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder, and Otto with violating Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 16a-3 thereunder.  The SEC seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement and financial penalties from the defendants as well as penny stock bars for Otto, Van Siclen, and Cheung, and an officer-and-director bar against Cheung., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2009/comp21126.pdf>SEC Complaint</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21126.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Despite repeated assurances that his purported trading was earning excellent returns, Healy did not invest any of the money he received in securities or commodities futures and instead made personal purchases as well as Ponzi-like payments to investors he defrauded., According to the SECs complaint, filed in federal district court in Pennsylvania, Healy obtained most of the funds from a Pennsylvania resident who invested his own money as well as funds provided by his attorney and more than 40 of their friends, acquaintances and business associates.  The SEC alleges that Healy stole investor funds to purchase a $2.4 million home and more than 10 luxury vehicles including Porsches, Lamborghinis, Ferraris, a Bentley, and a Lincoln limousine.  Healy further spent investor money to lease 2,500 square feet of garage space to store the vehicles.  He also purchased approximately $1.4 million worth of jewelry including an engagement ring for his wife, and approximately $2.3 million in home renovations, including a $500,000 home movie theater., The SECs complaint further alleges that when Healy was questioned about his trading, he provided falsified bank and trading records to the Pennsylvania resident and to the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania., The SECs complaint charges Healy with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC seeks entry of a court order of temporary and permanent injunction against Healy, as well as an order directing Healy and the relief defendants to disgorge ill-gotten gains, and directing Healy to pay prejudgment interest and civil penalties.  The SEC also seeks an order freezing the assets of Healy and the assets of the relief defendants that are traceable to the fraud, and requiring Healy and the relief defendants to account for the ill-gotten investor funds they received, expediting discovery, preventing the destruction or alteration of documents, and the appointment of a temporary receiver to oversee the assets of the Healys and Sand Dollar., The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania granted the SECs request for a temporary restraining order and asset freeze against Healy, his wife and Sand Dollar Investing Partners.  The court also appointed a receiver to oversee Healys assets and all the assets of the relief defendants that are traceable to the fraud., The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, U.S. Postal Inspection Service, and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).

The sham transaction was utilized every time that Tyco purchased a new security monitoring account from its dealers. The complaint also alleges that Power further inflated Tycos operating income by engaging in fraudulent acquisition accounting, primarily through directing the pre-acquisition reduction of asset valuations and overstatement of liabilities in connection with several of Tycos most significant acquisitions., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, Power consented to the entry of a Final Judgment that would permanently enjoin him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1, and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13.

The Final Judgments permanently enjoin Kozlowski and Swartz from violating, or aiding and abetting violations of, the antifraud, proxy statement, periodic reporting, books and records, and lying to auditors provisions of the federal securities laws and permanently bar each of them from serving as an officer or director of a public company., The Commissions complaint alleges that, from 1996 until June 2002, Kozlowski and Swartz failed to disclose hundreds of millions of dollars in executive indebtedness, executive compensation, and related party transactions that they received while at Tyco. As alleged in the complaint, Kozlowski and Swartz granted themselves undisclosed low interest and interest-free loans from the company that they regularly used for personal expenses and other unauthorized purposes. They repeatedly arranged to have many of these loans forgiven by Tyco. They also engaged in undisclosed related party transactions. In violation of the federal securities laws, Kozlowski and Swartz failed to disclose their indebtedness, loan forgiveness, and related party transactions and caused Tyco to fail to disclose those items in its proxy statements and annual reports., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, Kozlowski and Swartz consented to the entry of Final Judgments that will permanently enjoin each of them from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2, and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 14a-9.

According to the complaint, they bought the shares after learning during their work for Neff that another company might acquire it. Following the acquisition, Acord exchanged shares that he purchased for his personal account and for the account of a long time client for a profit of nearly $155,000., The complaint also alleges that Alberto Perez, a business associate and close friend of Neffs CEO, learned of the possible acquisition while working at an office at Neffs headquarters two doors down from the acquisition due diligence teams. Perez abused his position of trust and confidence with the CEO, and misappropriated the information by tipping his brother Jose Perez. The complaint alleges that the two then used the information to purchase $282,000 of Neff stock for a brokerage account they jointly owned, in advance of the acquisition announcement. Following the acquisition, the Perezes exchanged their Neff shares for a profit of $399,000., The complaint further alleges that Dr. Sebastian De La Maza, the father-in-law of Neffs CEO, learned about the pending acquisition from his daughter, who is married to Neffs CEO. According to the complaint, during the weeks preceding the acquisition announcement, De La Maza abused his position of trust and confidence with his daughter and misappropriated this information to buy $111,000 of Neff stock. Following the acquisition, De La Maza exchanged the Neff shares for a profit of $84,000., Finally, the Commissions complaint alleges that Thomas Borell, a Miami lawyer and a close friend of a Neff director misappropriated information about the acquisition. He abused the position of trust and confidence with the director and bought more than $1.3 million of Neff stock during the six weeks before the announcement — much of it while he was on a family vacation with the director.

Specifically, the Commissions complaints allege that the defendants either tipped or purchased securities of Safeco Corp. (Safeco) in advance of the April 23, 2008 announcement that it was being acquired by Liberty Mutual Insurance Company for an all-cash price of $68.50 per share (a $23.02 premium over the prior days closing price)., In the first civil action, in the United States District Court for the Western District Washington, the Commission alleges that Math J. Hipp Jr., of Seattle, Washington, misappropriated material, non-public information about a potential sale of Safeco from his wife, an executive assistant to Safecos Executive Vice President of Insurance Operations. Hipps wife was working on projects related to the potential sale of Safeco and received material, non-public information about merger-related developments. Hipp bought Safeco call options on April 17, 2008, and sold them on April 23, 2008 through early May 2008, for a realized profit of over $118,245. Hipp has consented to entry of a proposed final judgment, without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions complaint, permanently enjoining him from further violations of Sections 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5, and ordering him to pay disgorgement of $118,245 and pre-judgment of $3,280, and a civil penalty of $118,245., In the second civil action, the Commission alleges that Anthony Perez, of Maitland, Florida, then an investment banker at Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. (Goldman Sachs), misappropriated material non-public information from Goldman Sachs and its client regarding a potential acquisition of Safeco, and unlawfully tipped his brother, Ian C. Perez. Ian C. Perez bought Safeco call options on April 22, 2008, and sold them on April 23, 2008, for a realized profit of over $152,000. Both defendants have consented to entry of proposed final judgments, without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions complaint, permanently enjoining them from further violations of Sections 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 and holding them jointly and severally liable for payment of disgorgement of $152,231 and prejudgment interest in the amount of $761. The proposed final judgment against Ian C. Perez does not order him to pay a civil penalty based upon his sworn Statement of Financial Condition; the proposed final judgment against Anthony Perez orders him to pay a penalty in the amount of $25,000, but does not impose a higher penalty based upon his sworn Statement of Financial Condition., In a third action, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, the Commission alleges Peter E. Talbot, of Springfield, Massachusetts, then a financial analyst at a subsidiary of The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. (the Hartford) tipped his nephew, Carl E. Binette, of Ludlow, Massachusetts, after he learned at work that Safeco was an acquisition target. The Commissions complaint alleges that Talbot learned this information because he was snooping in a co-workers folder on the shared computer network which contained Safecos Form 10-K and detailed analyses and evaluations of Safecos assets. When Talbot subsequently noticed that key employees were working long hours and in unusual pairings, Talbot told Binette to buy Safeco call options because Safeco was an acquisition target. Using Binettes brokerage account, Talbot and Binette bought Safeco call options from April 17, 2008 to April 22, 2008 and sold them on April 23, 2008, for a realized profit of $615,833. The Commission seeks a final judgment enjoining Talbot and Binette from further violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5, and ordering Talbot and Binette to disgorge their illegal trading profits, with prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties against each of them., The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Chicago Board Options Exchange and New York Stock Exchange for their cooperation in this matter., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2009/comp21133-perez.pdf>SEC Complaint v.

Matthew W. Hardey, L. Cyrus DeBlanc, and Joe E. Penland</i>, Civil Action No. 09-cv-4414 (E.D. La. July 15, 2009)</h2>, <h2>SEC CHARGES TWO FORMER FINANCE EXECUTIVES OF NEWPARK RESOURCES, INC. AND PRINCIPAL OF KEY NEWPARK VENDOR IN FRAUDULENT ACCOUNTING SCHEME</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil action against two former finance executives of Newpark Resources, Inc. (Newpark), an oil and gas company based in Houston, Texas, as well as the principal of Quality Mat Company, a Newpark vendor, for violations of the federal securities laws. According to the Complaint, Matthew W. Hardey, a former Chief Financial Officer for Newpark, and L. Cyrus DeBlanc, a former Chief Financial Officer for Newpark subsidiary Soloco LLC, conspired with Quality Mat president Joe E. Penland to engage in a fraudulent accounting scheme that allowed Newpark in fiscal year 2003 to avoid writing off approximately $4.2 million in aging debt. As a result, Newpark reported approximately $500,000 of net income instead of a significant loss for that fiscal year., The Commissions Complaint alleges that, in 2002 and 2003, Newpark recognized $4.2 million in revenue based on sales of its primary product — industrial mats used to lay temporary roads at drilling sites — to Quality Mat and another vendor, Easy Frac. The Complaint claims that neither vendor had made any payment on the sales through the end of 2003, and that Hardey, DeBlanc and Penland devised and executed a scheme to funnel money to Quality Mat and Easy Frac through sham transactions that would then allow the vendors to pay their debts to Newpark., According to the Complaint, one of the sham transactions took place in 2004 and involved Dura-Base Nevada, LLC and Dura-Base de Mexico, two Newpark subsidiaries created to begin mat rentals in Mexico. The Complaint asserts that Newpark purchased the entire initial inventory of mats for the Dura-Base business from Quality Mat, and that the decision to purchase the approximately 6,175 mats from Quality Mat was a pretext meant to give the appearance of a legitimate business transaction to Newparks repurchase, at the original sales price, of 1,500 mats sold to Quality Mat in 2002 and 600 mats sold to Easy Frac in 2003. The Complaint claims that, in an attempt to perpetuate the pretext, Hardey also misled Newparks auditors about the basis for buying the Dura-Base inventory from Quality Mat by falsely claiming that Quality Mat had contractual rights in Mexico that Newpark would have to buy in order for the Dura-Base venture to go forward. According to the Complaint, this ruse was necessary to allow Newpark to buy back the mats at the original sales price without suffering any adverse accounting consequences. Under this scheme, Newpark could account for the repurchases as if they had taken place at Newparks manufacturing cost, but still pay Quality Mat the original purchase price for the mats by assigning the difference in value to the intangible asset allegedly created by the repurchase of Quality Mats contract rights., The Complaint alleges that the other sham transaction, which took place during 2004 and 2005, involved Quality Mat sending fictitious invoices to Newpark purportedly for bulk lumber sales. According to the Complaint, in early 2004, Penland agreed to convert Quality Mats outstanding debt from the 2002 sales to notes receivable. One of the notes required monthly payments of $52,409, which Quality Mat began making in March 2004. Between May 2004 and July 2005, the bulk lumber invoices, which were sent monthly, averaged $52,409, but there were no purchase orders or delivery tickets backing up the alleged sale. The Complaint alleges that Hardey, DeBlanc and Penland devised this scheme to provide Quality Mat with funds to continue making payments on this note, thus allowing Newpark to keep the debt on its books., The Complaint alleges that Hardey and DeBlanc each: violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5; violated the falsification of accounting records and circumvention of internal controls provision of the Exchange Act, Section 13(b)(5), and Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1; and aided and abetted Cardinals violations of the reporting, record-keeping, and internal controls provisions of the Exchange Act, Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13. The Complaint also alleges that Hardey and DeBlanc misled Newparks auditor in violation of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-2 and that Hardey signed officer certifications to Newparks periodic filings in violation of Exchange Act Rule 13a-14. The Complaint alleges that Penland aided and abetted violations of Section 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and directly violated Exchange Act Rule 13b2-2., The Complaint asks the Court to enter permanent injunctions and to levy civil monetary penalties against all defendants. The Complaint also asks that the Court permanently prohibit Hardey and DeBlanc from acting as officers or directors of a public company pursuant to Section 20(e) of the Securities Act and Section 21(d)(2) of the Exchange Act. The Commission acknowledges the cooperation of Newpark in its investigation., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2009/comp21137.pdf>SEC Complaint</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21137.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Mladen, Settle SEC Fraud Charges</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that on July 16, 2009, a final judgment by consent was entered by the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut against Excellency Investment Realty Trust, Inc., a publicly-traded real estate investment trust located in Hartford, Connecticut, and its chief executive officer, David D. Mladen, age 55, of Scarsdale, New York.  The Commission initially filed this case in October 2008 alleging a fraudulent market manipulation scheme.  The Commission filed an amended complaint on July 13, 2009, alleging additional charges that Excellency and Mladen made a false or misleading material statement in a public filing relating to the contemplation of legal proceedings against them and that Mladen failed to file required reports relating to his beneficial ownership of Excellency.  The defendants agreed to settle both the original charges and the additional charges.  The final judgments against Excellency and Mladen permanently enjoin them from violating the antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws.  In addition, Mladen was ordered to pay a $50,000 civil penalty and  $5,254 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest relating to his sales of Excellency stock during the period of his alleged fraud, and is prohibited for a period of five years from acting as an officer and director of any public company., The Commissions original complaint, filed on October 16, 2008, alleges that during at least July 2006 through September 2006, Mladen and Excellency engaged in a market manipulation scheme to defraud Excellency investors.  According to the complaint, Mladen, acting in his capacity of CEO of Excellency and acting through a brokerage account that was owned and controlled in part by Excellency and Mladen, traded in Excellency stock in such a way as to artificially increase the price of Excellency stock.  The complaint alleges that Mladen purchased Excellency stock in small quantities at progressively higher prices and executed wash or match trades in order to create the appearance of an active market for Excellency shares.  According to the complaint, Mladens trading activity systematically manipulated the stock price of Excellency, causing it to increase from $8 per share to $24.35 per share., The amended complaint filed on July 13, 2009 alleges, in addition to the alleged fraudulent market manipulation scheme, that Excellency filed a periodic report with the Commission on August 14, 2008, which Mladen signed as CEO, in which it falsely stated that no government agency was contemplating any proceeding against it, even though the company had been notified by the Commission staff on June 27, 2008 that the staff intended to recommend enforcement action against the company concerning the market manipulation scheme.  Moreover, the amended complaint alleges that Mladen was trading in Excellency stock at the same time the false or misleading statement was made and during other times.  The amended complaint alleges that, as an insider of Excellency, Mladens trading caused a change in his beneficial ownership of Excellency stock and that Mladen almost never disclosed his change in ownership in required Commission filings.  According to the amended complaint, Excellency violated Sections 10(b) and 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 13a-13 and Rule 12b-20 thereunder and that Mladen violated Sections 10(b) and 16(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 16a-3 thereunder and aided and abetted violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-13 and Rule 12b-20 thereunder., The final judgments against Excellency and Mladen, to which each consented without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, enjoins Excellency from violating Sections 10(b) and 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 13a-13 and Rule 12b-20 thereunder and enjoins Mladen from violating Sections 10(b) and 16(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 16a-3 thereunder and from aiding and abetting violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-13 and Rule 12b-20 thereunder.

Approximately two hours later, the complaint alleges, Leyva purchased 80 Qualcomm call option contracts priced at $.39 each with a strike price of $50., After the market closed on July 23, 2008, Qualcomm and Nokia announced their new licensing agreement and a global settlement of all litigation between them. On July 24, 2008, Qualcomms stock price increased 17 percent to $52.43, and its trading volume increased 394 percent.

The Formula solicited investors to purchase discounted, pre-construction condominium units that either The Formula or the developer would re-sell prior to closing for a substantial profit to investors. In connection with the sale of these investments, The Formula and Neiman made misleading statements to investors, including, among other things, The Formulas profitability and its success rate., The Commissions complaint alleges that from at least 2002 until mid-2007, The Formula sold unregistered securities in the form of investment contracts in real estate developments. The Formula entered into bulk purchase agreements with developers to purchase a block of the condominium units in a condominium development, in exchange for a discount from the initial listing price of the condominiums.

In February 2009, the Commission filed an emergency action to halt the investment fraud at WGTC and obtained preliminary injunctions, asset freezes and other relief against the WGTC principals who were the primary perpetrators of the fraud, Paul Greenwood and Stephen Walsh., The defendant named in the Commissions complaint filed today is:, <b>Deborah Duffy</b>, age 53, resides in Mahwah, New Jersey. She was until February 2009, the Chief Compliance Officer of WGTC, a broker dealer registered with the Commission. Duffy was also a registered representative associated with WGTC and held Series 7, 24 and 63 licenses., The Commissions complaint specifically alleges as follows:, From at least 1996 to February 2009, Duffy aided and abetted Greenwood and Walshs fraudulent investment scheme. Greenwood and Walsh promised investors, which included several pension funds and educational institutions and endowments, that their money would be invested in a stock index arbitrage trading strategy at WGTC. Instead of investing the money as promised, Greenwood and Walsh treated the investors account as their personal piggy-bank to pay for their lavish lifestyles, which included multi-million dollar homes, luxury cars, horses, and rare collectible items. The Commissions complaint alleges that Duffy assisted in the fraud by knowingly wiring investor funds to Greenwood and Walshs personal bank accounts and by creating phony promissory notes to cover up the fraud. Duffy knew that the funds she was wiring out of the investors account were being used by Greenwood and Walsh for their personal expenses and were not being invested at WGTC. Duffy also misappropriated as much as $292,000 of investors money for herself by wiring investor funds to accounts that she controlled or to third-parties to pay for personal items she purchased., The Commissions complaint charges Duffy with aiding and abetting violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The complaint seeks a final judgment permanently enjoining Duffy from violating or aiding and abetting future violations of the federal securities laws and ordering her to disgorge her ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest and to pay a civil monetary penalty. , Duffy pled guilty today to related criminal charges brought by the United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York (USAO) involving the same conduct alleged in the Commissions complaint., The Commission acknowledges the assistance and cooperation of the USAO, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

Tom for criminal charges for his role in an insider trading scheme. The sentence ordered Tom to serve 12 months and one day imprisonment, followed by three months of supervised release. The sentencing came nearly three years after Toms original sentencing hearing and followed a series of appeals that ultimately reached the United States Supreme Court., Tom was charged in a five-count criminal information on December 28, 2005 that alleged, among other things, that Tom partially owned Global Time Capital Management, LLC, the general partner of a Burlington, Massachusetts based hedge fund, GTC Growth Fund, L.P. The information alleges that prior to establishing Global Time Capital Management, Tom served as a senior analyst at Citizens Financial Group, Inc. in Boston, Massachusetts, where he briefly worked with portfolio analyst, Shengnan Wang, in December 2003. According to the information, on April 29, 2004, Wang called Tom and told him that members of her group were performing due diligence of an acquisition target in Cleveland, Ohio. The information further alleges that on April 29, 2004, Tom purchased securities in three Cleveland-based banks, including Charter One Financial, Inc., and that over the next three days Tom purchased hundreds of call options in Charter One as well as certain shares of Charter One common stock. According to the information, after the close of the market on May 3, 2004, Citizens publicly announced that it intended to acquire Charter One. The information further alleges that on May 5, 2005, the day after the merger was announced, Tom sold most of his stock realizing a profit of $743,505., On February 15, 2006, Tom pled guilty to the five counts of securities fraud as alleged in the criminal information. On November 28, 2006, Tom was sentenced to three years probation, six months of which were to be served in a community confinement center, and was ordered to pay a special assessment of $500. The U.S. Attorneys Office appealed the criminal sentence and, on October 1, 2007, the First Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the District Court of Massachusetts sentence and remanded the matter for re-sentencing. Subsequently, on January 22, 2008, the United States Supreme Court granted Toms petition for a Writ of Certiorari and vacated the First Circuit Court of Appeals judgment and remanded the case for further consideration. On April 30, 2008, the First Circuit Court of Appeals remanded the matter to the District Court of Massachusetts for reconsideration., On September 29, 2005, the Commission filed a related civil injunctive action against Tom, among others, in the U.S. District Court in Massachusetts alleging many of the same facts charged in the criminal action.

Filed July 23, 2009)</h2>, <h2>SEC CHARGES WEST MARINE WITH FALSIFYING ITS FINANCIALS</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a settled enforcement action against West Marine, Inc., a Northern California-based boating supply retailer. According to the SEC, West Marine filed numerous false financial statements from 2004 to 2006 after making undisclosed accounting changes designed to offset an unexpected earnings shortfall., The SECs complaint, filed in federal court in San Jose, alleges that shortly after pre-announcing its fiscal 2003 earnings, West Marine determined that it needed to change the way in which the company valued its inventory. That change reduced the value of its inventory by approximately $13.2 million, dramatically decreasing the companys previously announced earnings. Rather than disclose this change to investors and report reduced earnings in its annual report, the SEC alleges that West Marine sought an offset and eventually devised a solution of capitalizing certain store occupancy expenses such as rent and utilities. This change in accounting methodology was neither disclosed to investors nor in compliance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). According to the SEC, West Marine failed to properly disclose these significant accounting changes to its auditor by suggesting that its accounting methodology was consistent with prior years., By capitalizing store occupancy costs, West Marine improperly increased its pre-tax income for the year, offsetting the undisclosed reduction in earnings caused by the change in inventory valuation. As a result, the companys annual report filed in March 2004 was misleading. Moreover, the SEC alleges that the improper accounting resulted in similarly misleading registration statements and periodic reports to investors filed in 2005 and 2006. The wrongful conduct was ultimately uncovered in 2007, when the company restated its financial results for fiscal years 2002 through 2005., Without admitting or denying the SECs allegations, West Marine agreed to a permanent injunction against future violations of Section 17(a)(2) and (a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 under the Exchange Act., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2009/comp21150.pdf>SEC Complaint</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21150.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Maloney, United States District Judge for the Western District of Michigan, granted the Commissions motion for summary judgment, in part, against Philip E. Lowery, the architect of a fraudulent offering of Colorado registered limited liability partnership (RLLP) units that were supposedly formed to share in the profits from online casinos Lowery was to create and run. The Court permanently enjoined Lowery from future violations of the registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws., In its Complaint, filed May 19, 2005, the Commission alleged that Lowery violated the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws in connection with the offer and sale of $5.8 million RLLP units to over 80 investors nation-wide. According to the complaint, Lowery made false and misleading statements in connection with his selling efforts, including providing potential investors with unrealistic profit projections and telling them the investments were guaranteed and their funds would be used for partnership and casino business expenses, when, in fact, most of the funds were used to pay for personal expenses. Eventually, investors lost all of their money after the casinos were shut down due to operational problems., Judge Maloney granted the Commissions motion as to all of its claims against Lowery. In his 46-page order granting summary judgment, Judge Maloney found that, in failing to find arguably-sound statistics or other bases for his profit and market-share projections, and in diverting investor-partner capital from the RLLPs and casinos to his personal use without consulting or even informing them, [Lowery] engaged in highly unreasonable conduct which is an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care. The Court permanently enjoined Lowery from further violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The SEC obtained an emergency court order to freeze more than $5 million in trading profits that it has located in various accounts in their names., In its complaint, the SEC alleges that Hazem Khalid Al-Braikan and the related entities traded around false news of a purported tender offer by a Middle East investment group to acquire Harman International Industries, Inc. at $49.50 per share. A phony press release publicizing the hoax offer was faxed to media outlets on Sunday, July 19, and subsequently reported on the Internet on Monday, July 20, before the stock market opened. Harman Internationals share price, which had closed the previous trading day at $25.18, climbed more than 40 percent in pre-market trading. Harman International repudiated the offer shortly before the market opened for regular trading. The share price dropped sharply thereafter and closed the day at $20.86., The SEC further alleges that two of the entities similarly traded around a hoax tender offer in April 2009, when a Kuwaiti newspaper reported that a consortium of Middle East companies were offering to purchase Textron Inc. This offer also turned out to be false. Al-Braikan and the entities amassed positions in the one or both of the securities of the companies shortly before the bogus offers were publicized. They then sold their securities at prices inflated by the false information to reap their illicit profits., The SECs complaint alleges that Al-Braikan, who is or was associated with each of the three entities, traded in an account in his own name. Accounts in the names of the three entities also traded. The three entities are United Gulf Bank (B.S.C.); KIPCO Asset Management Company (KAMCO); and Al-Raya Investment Company., By virtue of the conduct described above, the Commission alleges in its complaint that the defendants violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.

The Commissions complaint alleges that Hashemi reaped $458,760 in profits by unlawfully trading in advance of the merger announcement. The Commission also obtained a temporary restraining order freezing Hashemis assets as well as other emergency relief., According to the Commissions complaint, Nova, which had principal executive offices in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Alberta, Canada, is a producer of plastics and chemicals.

These purchases began to accelerate as the merger date approached, as he made 54 percent of his total purchases on the last trading day before the announcement. Hashemi funded these purchases by liquidating nearly 80 percent of the value of his stock portfolio, and by wiring approximately $100,000 into his trading account.

In order to keep their scheme afloat, they paid out $11.3 million in Ponzi payments by using new investment proceeds to pay distributions to earlier investors. They also spent $14 million soliciting and marketing the offering in order to continue the scheme., The SECs complaint charges John Bravata, Trabulsy, and Bravata Financial with violating Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint charges BBC Equities with violating Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5. The complaint also charges Antonio Bravata with violating Section 5 of the Securities Act and Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act. The SECs complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief and disgorgement from all of the Defendants, and civil penalties from John Bravata, Trabulsy, and Antonio Bravata. The SECs complaint further seeks disgorgement of all investor funds or assets acquired with investor funds from Relief Defendant Shari Bravata.

The SEC also issued an administrative order finding that Avery violated the same provisions of the FCPA.  In the administrative proceeding, the SEC ordered Avery to cease and desist from such violations, and to disgorge $273,213, together with $45,257 in prejudgment interest.  In the federal civil action, Avery agreed to the entry of a final judgment requiring it to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $200,000. , The SEC’s complaint and administrative order charge that, from 2002 through 2005, the Reflectives Division of Avery (China) Co. Ltd. (“Avery China”) paid or authorized the payments of kickbacks, sightseeing trips, and gifts to Chinese government officials.  The amount of illegal payments actually paid amounted to approximately $30,000.  In one transaction, Avery China secured a sale to a state-owned end user by agreeing to pay a Chinese official a kickback of nearly $25,000 through a distributor.  Avery China realized $273,213 in profit from this transaction, which it inaccurately booked as a sale to the distributor rather than to the end user.  In addition, after Avery acquired a company in June 2007, employees of the acquired company continued their pre-acquisition practice of making illegal petty cash payments to customs or other officials in several foreign countries, resulting in illegal payments of approximately $51,000.  Avery failed to accurately record these payments and gifts in the company’s books and records, and failed to implement or maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to detect and prevent such illegal payments or promises of illegal payments., As a result of the conduct described above, the SEC charged that Avery violated Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Through their company, Radical Bunny LLC, they pooled investor funds to make loans to Mortgages Ltd., a Phoenix-based originator of high-interest, short-term loans to real estate developers., According to the Commissions complaint, the four promoters misrepresented how Mortgages Ltd. could use money loaned by Radical Bunny LLC by falsely telling investors that their funds could only be used for commercial development when there were no such restrictions. They also misrepresented to investors that they were closely monitoring Mortgages Ltd.s financial condition, but they were caught completely unaware of the circumstances that ultimately led to its bankruptcy. Furthermore, they misrepresented to investors that the offering was not subject to the federal securities laws when, in fact, legal counsel had advised them otherwise on at least three separate occasions., The Commissions complaint, which was filed in federal court in Phoenix, charges Radical Bunny LLC and its four managing members: Tom Hirsch of Paradise Valley, Ariz.; Harish Shah of Phoenix; and Howard Walder and Berta Bunny Walder, both of Phoenix. Hirsch and Shah operate an accounting practice together and obtained many investors through their accounting firm. Husband and wife Howard and Berta Walder are by profession a pharmacist and grade school principal, respectively., , According to the Commissions complaint, the foursome primarily communicated with investors through semi-annual meetings held at a luxury golf resort in Scottsdale, Ariz. Investors were provided with presentations about the status of their investments, and they were permitted to invite their friends, family, and others to the meetings as potential investors. Shah particularly solicited investors of South Asian descent, raising approximately $40 million from about 150 families., The Commission alleges that Hirsch, Shah, and the Walders each made false and misleading statements to persuade people to invest in Radical Bunny, and they falsely represented that Radical Bunny held a secured interest in Mortgages Ltd.s assets even after their attorneys advised them that such documentation was either non-existent or defective. They also falsely represented that they (particularly Hirsch) had unfettered access to Mortgages Ltd.s books and records, allowing them to monitor Mortgages Ltd.s financial condition. However, they ignored the fact that most of Radical Bunnys funds were being shifted into Mortgage Ltd.s riskier projects to the detriment of the Radical Bunny investors., The Commissions complaint further alleges that Hirsch received at least $3 million, the Walders received at least $2 million, and Shah received at least $700,000 as part of a vendor fee that they claimed to have earned for maintaining accounts for the Radical Bunny investors and facilitating loans to Mortgages Ltd. , Radical Bunny was not registered with the Commission in any capacity and did not register any offering under the securities laws. Therefore, in addition to the securities fraud charges, Hirsch, Shah, and the Walders were charged by the Commission with offering and selling unregistered securities and for acting as unregistered broker-dealers in violation of the federal securities laws. Radical Bunny also was charged with offering and selling unregistered securities., In its federal court action, the Commission seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and financial penalties against all of the defendants. , <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2009/comp21157.pdf>SEC Complaint</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21157.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

(DCBM), Strongs Capital Investments, Inc., the Optimus Fund, Damian Meneses, 37, Edward Lantz Ferguson, 37, and Joel S. Ley, Jr., 31, raised at least $14 million by promising investors guaranteed returns based on profits from foreign currency trading. In fact, defendants used investor funds to pay other investors returns, for their own personal use, or sent money to other entities or persons related to them. The defendants are alleged to have diverted funds to at least two individuals, Juan Galindo Flores, 48, and Socorro Terlizzi, 41, who are both named as relief defendants in the action., The Diversity Capital website claims that it is one of the largest private funds in the market and manages over 1.7 billion dollars. According to the complaint, Meneses promised investors in Diversity Capital that they would receive returns of at least 4% each month from the profits made from foreign currency trading. The SEC alleges that Meneses encouraged investors to refinance their homes and to use the proceeds to invest in Diversity Capital. The complaint alleges, however, that Diversity Capital and its New Zealand affiliate, DCBM, did not generate any profits from foreign currency trading and instead used investor funds to pay earlier investors in a Ponzi-like fashion. According to the complaint, investor funds were also used for personal expenses, including car payments, mortgage payments, meals, travel and retail purchases., According to the complaint, Ferguson, 37, identified himself to investors as the president of Chula Vista-based Strongs Capital. The complaint alleges that Ferguson told investors in Strongs Capital that he would guarantee them monthly profits of 3% to 8.25%. The complaint alleges that although Ferguson told investors that all of their money would be invested in Diversity Capital, Ferguson used over $500,000 of investor funds to pay out earlier investors and for his own personal use. The complaint alleges that Ley, 31, operated the Optimus Fund out of San Diego and identified himself as the president of the Optimus Fund. According to the complaint, Ley promised investors returns of at least 4% each month and sent out monthly statements reflecting these profits. The complaint alleges that although Ley told investors that all of their money would be invested in Diversity Capital, Ley used some of the money from investors to pay out earlier investors and for his own personal use, including for travel, automobile payments and retail purchases. The complaint alleges that neither Strongs Capital nor the Optimus Fund received any significant or regular payments from Diversity Capital.<br/>On July 27, 2009, the SEC obtained an order (1) freezing the assets of Diversity Capital, DCBM, Strongs Capital, the Optimus Fund, Meneses, Ferguson, and Ley; (2) requiring accountings; (3) prohibiting the destruction of documents; (4) granting expedited discovery; and (5) temporarily enjoining defendants from future violations of the registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.

(“Integral Systems” or the “Company”), a corporation based in Columbia, Maryland that manufactures satellite ground systems, with fraudulently concealing for over seven years the identity and involvement of a convicted securities fraud felon in the Company’s top management.  Named in the complaint were Steven R. Chamberlain, the former CEO of Integral Systems, Elaine M. Brown, the former CFO at the Company and Gary A. Prince, the undisclosed felon.  Separately, the Commission instituted and settled an administrative proceeding against Integral Systems charging the firm with violations of the periodic reporting and proxy solicitation provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”)., The Commission’s complaint alleges that from 1999 through August 2006 Chamberlain, Brown and Prince made materially false and misleading statements, and omitted material information, in various filings with the Commission by failing to disclose Prince’s role at the Company and his legal background in its filings.  Prince’s executive officer position at Integral Systems was concealed from investors out of concern that disclosing his securities fraud conviction and other legal issues would have a negative impact on the Company’s stock price.  The complaint states that Prince pleaded guilty to criminal charges of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and bank fraud at another company in 1995.  In related Commission actions, he was enjoined from violating the antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws and was barred from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant.  Prince had been CFO of Integral Systems for several years until he resigned shortly before his criminal conviction.  When Prince was rehired in 1998 after serving his criminal sentence, he was given executive officer responsibilities in the Company’s accounting, financial reporting, and policy making functions, but was never disclosed as an officer of the Company.  , As a result of the conduct described in the complaint, the Commission alleges that Chamberlain, Brown and Prince violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and aided and abetted violations of Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1.  Defendants Chamberlain and Brown are alleged to have also violated Exchange Act Rule 13a-14 by signing false and misleading certifications accompanying Integral Systems’ periodic filings.  The complaint also alleges that Chamberlain violated, and Brown and Prince aided and abetted violations of, the proxy statement provisions of Exchange Act, Section 14(a) and Rule 14a-9 thereunder; and that Prince violated the Exchange Act’s provisions concerning stock ownership and transaction reports, Exchange Act Section 16(a) and Rule 16a-3 thereunder.  The Commission also alleges that through certain of his conduct at the Company, such as reviewing the Company’s filings with the Commission and drafting the MD&amp;A portion of those filings, Prince violated the Commission’s order denying him the privilege of appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant., The Commission seeks permanent injunctions against further violations of the securities laws against each defendant, as well as court orders imposing officer and director bars and civil penalties., In the related administrative proceeding against Integral Systems, without admitting or denying the Commissions findings, Integral Systems consented to an order finding that the Company violated the periodic reporting and proxy solicitation provisions of the Exchange Act.  The order directs Integral Systems to cease and desist from committing or causing violations of Sections 13(a) and 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 14a-9.

The Commission alleges that from at least 2005 to the present, Bard and Vision Specialist have targeted investors in and around the small rural community of Warfordsburg with promises of high yields and safety of principal, telling clients that they had invested in safe investments such as bonds, certificates of deposit, and money market funds. In reality, Bard squandered hundreds of thousands of dollars or more of client funds by making risky (and losing) investments in penny stocks and other securities and borrowing on margin., The Commissions Complaint further alleges that Bard, through Vision Specialist, perpetrated his scheme by materially misrepresenting and failing to fully disclose the types of investments he made for clients and the performance of clients accounts. He created false statements misrepresenting the true value of client accounts and used Vision Specialists operating account to cover client withdrawals and pay margin calls so that clients believed their accounts had funds that they did not have. In addition, for at least one client, Bard and Vision Specialist charged fees although Bard represented that he would not. Furthermore, Bard forged client authorization forms to transfer funds between accounts to conceal the dissipation of assets. Bard has marketed himself as a deeply religious man and has benefitted from his and his familys reputation in this small rural community. Vision Specialist currently has at least $4.4 million in advisory client assets under management in over 150 accounts., As a result of the conduct described in the Complaint, the Commission alleges that Bard and Vision Specialist violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

Instead of investing the money as he claimed he would, Tennies siphoned money out of the fund for personal use. To conceal his fraud, Tennies gave investors fabricated tax documents and account statements claiming phony returns., The SECs complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho, alleges that Tennies told investors that they could expect positive returns during all market cycles through a proprietary trading strategy in liquid and exchange-traded securities. Tennies then allegedly led investors to believe that their money was invested in the Adeona Fund and that the fund was posting consistent, positive returns., The SEC alleges that Tennies actually commingled investor funds with his personal accounts and used fund assets to pay his personal expenses, which included hundreds of thousands of dollars toward a divorce settlement, the mortgage on a custom-built home, rare first-edition books and artwork, and financing a car business. Tennies then allegedly paid investors in Ponzi-like fashion to keep his scheme afloat, using funds from new investors to pay returns to other investors., Tennies and Price Geld agreed to settle the SECs claims against them, including violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws under Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder. Tennies and Price Geld agreed to settle these claims and consented to the entry of a judgment, subject to approval by the court, that enjoins them from violating the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws.

The scheme involved granting backdated, undisclosed in the money stock options that coincided with dates of historically low annual and quarterly closing prices for Take-Twos common stock. The complaint alleges that Take-Two granted backdated stock options to senior officers, directors, and key employees without complying with its own stock option plans, and generally, without the Board or a committee thereof approving the grant dates and exercise prices. Take-Two also did not record or disclose the compensation expenses it incurred as a result of the in-the-money portions of the option grants.

Filed August 3, 2009)</h2>, <h2>SEC Charges Bank of America for Failing to Disclose Merrill Lynch Bonus Payments</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Bank of America Corporation for misleading investors about billions of dollars in bonuses that were being paid to Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. executives at the time of its $50 billion acquisition of the firm. Bank of America agreed to settle the SECs charges and pay a penalty of $33 million., The SEC alleges that in proxy materials soliciting the votes of shareholders on the proposed acquisition of Merrill, Bank of America stated that Merrill had agreed that it would not pay year-end performance bonuses or other discretionary compensation to its executives prior to the closing of the merger without Bank of Americas consent. In fact, Bank of America had already contractually authorized Merrill to pay up to $5.8 billion in discretionary bonuses to Merrill executives for 2008. According to the SECs complaint, the disclosures in the proxy statement were rendered materially false and misleading by the existence of the prior undisclosed agreement allowing Merrill to pay billions of dollars in bonuses for 2008., The SECs complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that Bank of America represented in the merger agreement that Merrill had agreed not to pay any bonuses to its executives before the merger closed, except as set forth in a schedule. Unbeknownst to shareholders, the schedule was already in place weeks before the proxy statement was filed with the SEC and disseminated to shareholders. Under the schedule, Bank of America had agreed that Merrill could pay up to $5.8 billion, or nearly 12 percent of the $50 billion merger consideration, in discretionary bonuses to its executives. The merger agreement was included as an appendix and summarized in the joint proxy statement that was distributed to all 283,000 shareholders of both companies. But Bank of Americas agreement to allow Merrill to pay these discretionary bonuses was in a separate document that was omitted from the proxy statement and whose contents were never disclosed before the shareholders vote on the merger., In settling the SECs charges without admitting or denying the allegations, Bank of America consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins Bank of America from violating the proxy solicitation rules — Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 14a-9 — and orders Bank of America to pay the financial penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval., The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the U.S. Attorneys Offices for the Southern District of New York and the Western District of North Carolina, the Federal Bureau of Investigations, and the Office of the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program.

(MCHI), Medical Capital Corporation (MCC), Medical Provider Funding Corporation VI (MP VI), Sidney M. Field, and Joseph J. Lampariello. The SECs complaint, filed in federal court in Orange County, California, alleges that the defendants defrauded investors by misappropriating about $18.5 million of investor funds and by misrepresenting to investors that no prior offerings had defaulted on or been late in making payments to investors of principal and/or interest., MCHI is a medical receivables financing company that operates through MCC, its wholly-owned subsidiary, to administer several Special Purpose Corporations (SPCs), including MP VI. Field and Lampariello are directors of MCHI, MCC, and MP VI, with Field also serving as the defendant entities CEO and Lampariello serving as their president and COO. Field, 63, resides in Villa Park, California, and Lampariello, 55, resides in Huntington Station, New York and Newport Beach, California., The SECs complaint alleges that, since 2003, MCHI, MCC, Field, and Lampariello have raised over $2.2 billion through offerings of notes in MP VI and five other similarly structured SPCs. As of March 31, 2009, MP VI and its affiliated SPCs had over $1.2 billion in notes outstanding, and since August 2008, five of the SPCs have been in default or late in paying principal and/or interest on $992.5 million in notes., As alleged in the SECs complaint, the defendants defrauded investors by misappropriating approximately $18.5 million of the $76.9 million raised through the sale of MP VI notes to pay administrative fees to MCC. The complaint alleges that these fee payments were contrary to representations in MP VIs original offering documents, which stated that administrative fees would not be paid out of proceeds from the sale of notes. The complaint also alleges that these fee payments were contrary to representations in MP VIs May 27, 2009 supplemental offering documents that less than $4 million had been used for purposes other than purchasing accounts receivables., In addition, the SECs complaint alleges that the defendants defrauded investors by misrepresenting in MP VIs offering documents that none of the SPCs affiliated with MP VI had defaulted on or been late in making payments of principal and/or interest to their respective investors. In fact, two MP VI-affiliated SPCs began defaulting on interest and/or principal payments in the same month that MP VI began its offering, and recently two other MP VI-affiliated SPCs have defaulted or been late in making interest payments., The Honorable David O. Carter, U.S. District Judge for the Central District of California, granted the SECs request for emergency relief, including an order temporarily enjoining all defendants from future violations of the antifraud provisions and freezing the assets of and appointing a temporary receiver over MCHI, MCC, and MP VI. The SEC also seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions, disgorgement, and civil penalties against all defendants. A hearing on whether a preliminary injunction should be issued against the defendants and whether a permanent receiver should be appointed is scheduled for August 17, 2009, at 8:30 a.m. PT.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21165.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The suit, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut, alleges that GE misled investors by reporting materially false and misleading results in its financial statements.  The SEC alleges that GE used improper accounting methods to increase its reported earnings or revenues and avoid reporting negative financial results.  GE has agreed to pay a $50 million penalty to settle the SECs charges., According to the Commissions complaint, GE met or exceeded final consensus analyst earnings per share (EPS) expectations every quarter from 1995 through filing of its 2004 annual report.  However, on four separate occasions in 2002 and 2003, high-level GE accounting executives or other finance personnel approved accounting that was not in compliance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).  In one instance, the improper accounting allowed GE to avoid missing analysts final consensus EPS expectations.  The four accounting violations were (1) beginning in January 2003, an improper application of the accounting standards to GEs commercial paper funding program to avoid unfavorable disclosures and an estimated approximately $200 million pre-tax charge to earnings; (2) a 2003 failure to correct a misapplication of financial accounting standards to certain GE interest-rate swaps; (3) in 2002 and 2003, reported end-of-year sales of locomotives that had not yet occurred in order to accelerate more than $370 million in revenue; and (4) in 2002, an improper change to GEs accounting for sales of commercial aircraft engines spare parts that increased GEs 2002 net earnings by $585 million., Without admitting or denying the SECs allegations, GE agreed to the financial penalty and consented to the entry of an order permanently enjoining it from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13 thereunder.

The complaint further alleges that, during the offering, Rizvi misrepresented or omitted to disclose to investors numerous material facts regarding his personal and professional background, the professionals employed by Bellwether and Strategy Partners, the payment of commissions, and Bellwethers investment returns. In addition, the complaint alleges that Rizvi misappropriated and misapplied nearly $1.2 million of the offering proceeds., As a result of the conduct described in the complaint, the Commission alleges that Rizvi violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b), and 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; Bellwether violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act, and Section 7(a) of the Investment Company Act; and Strategy Partners violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act and Section 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act., The Commission seeks permanent injunctions against further violations of the securities laws, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties from each defendant., In a related administrative proceeding against Ryan Douglas Smith, without admitting or denying the Commissions findings, Smith consented to an order finding that Smith willfully aided and abetted and caused violations of the registration provisions of the Investment Company Act.

Smith is also charged with direct violations of the antifraud and other provisions of the securities laws., The complaint alleges that Greenberg and Smith were responsible for material misstatements that enabled AIG to create the false impression that the company consistently met or exceeded key earnings and growth targets. According to the complaint, Greenberg publicly described AIG as the leader in the insurance and financial services industry with a history of delivering consistent double-digit growth. However, AIG faced numerous financial challenges under Greenbergs leadership that were disguised through improper accounting., The complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges the defendants with responsibility for the following improper accounting transactions:, Sham reinsurance transactions to make it appear that AIG had legitimately increased its general loss reserves., A purported deal with an offshore shell entity to conceal multi-million dollar underwriting losses from AIGs auto-warranty insurance business., Economically senseless round-trip transactions to report improper gains in investment income., The purported sale of tax exempt municipal bonds owned by AIGs subsidiaries to trusts that AIG controlled in order to improperly recognize realized capital gains., The complaint alleges that Greenberg knew about the effects that certain improper transactions would have on AIGs reported financial results, and along with Smith was responsible for false and misleading public statements and material omissions in quarterly reports that AIG filed in the second and third quarters of 2002, and in related press releases and investor conference calls.

The SEC further alleges that DiPascali helped Madoff cover up the fraud by preparing fake trade blotters, stock records, customer confirmations, Depository Trust Corporation (DTC) reports and other phantom books and records to substantiate the non-existent trading., Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SECs complaint, DiPascali has consented to a proposed partial judgment, which if entered by the court would impose a permanent injunction against DiPascali and leave the issues of disgorgement and a financial penalty to be decided at a later time., The SEC alleges that DiPascali, who resides in Bridgewater, N.J., sustained Madoffs unprecedented fraud from at least the 1980s until the schemes collapse, causing billions of dollars in investor losses. A specific computer was used to simulate phantom trading in advisory accounts, and to generate phony books and records reflecting that trading. This fake set of books and records was kept separate and distinct from the books and records for the market-making and proprietary trading operation at Bernard L.

When investors sent in funds to BMIS for investment, the funds were deposited or wired into a bank account at JPMorgan Chase that was not in any way reflected on the books and records (including the ledger) of the BMIS broker-dealer operation., The SECs complaint alleges that great effort was made to hide the fact that there were several thousand advisory accounts at BMIS, which would have required SEC registration. DiPascali helped Madoff devise a shifting subset of 10 to 25 accounts — known as the special accounts — which they deceptively presented as the universe of BMIS advisory accounts. DiPascali and others prepared fake books and records to provide regulators with information about only these special accounts in order to conceal the true size of the advisory business., According to the SECs complaint, DiPascali joined BMIS as a research clerk at age 19 after dropping out of college. Eventually, Madoff put DiPascali in charge of the bulk of day-to-day operations on the now-infamous 17th floor of BMIS. As Madoff consistently communicated his fear of detection to DiPascali, a significant portion of DiPascalis time and effort was dedicated to anticipating and preparing for regulatory inquiries — particularly SEC examinations in 2004 and 2005 and an SEC investigation in 2006., The SECs complaint alleges that DiPascali helped carry out Madoffs fictitious split-strike conversion strategy that BMIS claimed to be pursuing on behalf of its clients. DiPascali helped Madoff structure and record non-existent trades that were reflected on millions of pages of customer confirmations and account statements distributed each year. None of the trades purportedly executed as part of this strategy ever occurred. In fact, the strategy was nothing more than fictitious trading by hindsight, supported by documents created after the fact based on actual historical data., According to the SECs complaint, DiPascali helped Madoff cover his tracks in numerous nefarious ways. For instance, when Madoff grew concerned that showing positive returns every month would be suspicious, he occasionally instructed DiPascali to enter phony trades designed to lose money in order to make their investment strategy and returns more credible. In order to avoid scrutiny by sophisticated financial institutions, they made a practice of closing down accounts of investors who worked at such institutions. Madoff and DiPascali even went so far as to develop a phantom computer trading platform that would appear to reflect real trading. In the event of a surprise visit from outsiders requesting to observe real-time trading activity, one BMIS employee was to enter trades on a computer screen and another employee was to go into an office nearby and play the role of a counterparty trader in Europe., The SEC further alleges that DiPascali misappropriated investor funds for personal gain, setting up an account at BMIS for himself in 2002 that he named after his fishing yacht, Dorothy Jo. DiPascali withdrew more than $5 million from the account between 2002 and 2008 to fund personal expenses, including the purchase of a new boat. DiPascalis withdrawals were funded directly from money deposited by investors with BMIS. Investor money being used to fund the overall operations of BMIS also contributed to the more than $2 million in salary and bonus that DiPascali received each year., Todays charges mark the fifth enforcement action taken by the SEC related to the Madoff fraud. Previously, the Commission charged Madoff and BMIS, their auditors, certain solicitors, and feeder funds., The Commissions complaint specifically alleges that DiPascali violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act; violated, and aided and abetted violations of, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and aided and abetted violations of Sections 204, 206(1) and 206(2) of the Advisers Act and Rule 204-2 thereunder and Sections 15(c) and 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-3 and 17a-3 thereunder. Among other things, the SECs complaint seeks financial penalties and a court order requiring DiPascali to disgorge his ill-gotten gains., The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

The SEC alleges Ferrer used brokerage accounts opened in his name and that of his law firm to execute manipulative trades in Weida common stock.  Ferrer was an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of Florida and outside counsel for Weida.  The SEC further alleges that Ferrer falsely testified under oath when questioned by the staff about his trading activity during the investigation.  The SEC charges Ferrer with violations of Section 10(b) Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and seeks as relief a permanent injunction, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, a civil penalty and penny stock bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations against him, Ferrer consented to a permanent injunction and penny stock bar.

(URI), another Connecticut-based public company.  , Terex has agreed to settle the SEC’s charges and pay a penalty of $8 million.  The SEC previously charged URI with fraud as well as officers of URI and Terex., The SEC’s complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut, alleges that Terex aided and abetted the fraudulent accounting by URI for two year-end transactions that were undertaken to allow URI to meet its earnings forecasts.  These fraudulent transactions also allowed Terex to prematurely recognize revenue from its sales to URI.  The fraud occurred through URI’s sales of used equipment to a financing company and its lease-back of that equipment for a short period.  As part of the scheme, Terex agreed to sell the equipment at the end of the lease period and guarantee the financing company against any losses.  URI separately guaranteed Terex against losses it might incur under the guarantee it had extended to the financing company., The SEC’s complaint also alleges that from 2000 through June 2004, Terex’s accounting staff failed to resolve imbalances arising from certain intercompany transactions.  Instead of investigating and correcting the imbalances, Terex offset the imbalances with unsupported and improper entries.  As a result, costs were not recorded as expenses, and, on a consolidated basis, Terex appeared to be more profitable than it was. , Without admitting or denying the SEC’s charges, Terex agreed to settle the Commission’s action by consenting to be permanently enjoined from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and from violating and aiding and abetting any violation of Sections 10(b), 13(a), and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder, and by paying the $8 million penalty.

Brantley Capital Management, LLC, Robert Pinkas, and Tab Keplinger,</i> 1:09-CV-01906 (JSG) (N.D. Ohio)</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Ohio-based investment advisers Robert Pinkas and his firm Brantley Capital Management (BCM) with securities fraud for overvaluing assets in an investment portfolio they managed in order to generate higher investment advisory fees.  The SEC also charged another BCM official., The SEC alleges that BCM, Pinkas, and its former part-time CFO Tab Keplinger substantially overstated the value of equity and debt investments in two failing private companies that represented more than half of the investment portfolio of Brantley Capital Corporation, a New York-based investment company.  The SEC further alleges that BCM, Pinkas, and Keplinger made material misrepresentations and failed to make required disclosures about the two companies to Brantley Capital’s board of directors, independent auditors, and investors.  , During the alleged misconduct from 2002 to 2005, BCM was the investment advisory firm that managed the investment portfolio of Brantley Capital.  According to the SEC’s complaint, Pinkas was the CEO of both Brantley Capital and BCM, and directed all of BCM’s investment decisions and valuation recommendations.  Keplinger was the part-time CFO of both entities and generally acted at the direction of Pinkas. , The SEC’s complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, alleges that BCM, through Pinkas and Keplinger, advised Brantley Capital’s board that its equity investment in Flight Options International (FOI) was worth $32.5 million.  The value of Brantley Capital’s interest in FOI, which represented approximately 50 percent of its total investment portfolio, was derived primarily from FOI’s ownership interest in Flight Options LLC, a private airline that was consistently losing millions of dollars.  , The SEC alleges that Pinkas and Keplinger understood that Flight Options faced severe financial difficulties, and Pinkas knew that it was able to remain in business only because another investor in Flight Options repeatedly loaned it money.  Pinkas and Keplinger not only failed to disclose these financial difficulties to Brantley Capital’s board and investors, but they also misrepresented the financial performance of Flight Options to Brantley Capital’s board and its independent auditors, cited various false rationales to support their $32.5 million valuation, and concealed third-party valuations of Flight Options indicating that Brantley Capital’s investment in FOI was worth substantially less than what Pinkas and Keplinger were representing.  , The SEC’s complaint also alleges that BCM, through Pinkas and Keplinger, directed Brantley Capital to overstate the value of its debt investments in Disposable Products Company (DPC), a now-defunct company that comprised 4 to 8 percent of Brantley Capital’s total investment portfolio.  Pinkas and Keplinger repeatedly advised Brantley Capital’s board that DPC would repay most of these loans, when in fact DPC could not repay the loans because the company was losing ever-increasing amounts of money.  DPC also consistently missed its financial targets by large margins, remained in business only because Brantley Capital continued to loan it money, and lacked sufficient assets to cover Brantley Capital’s loans in the event of liquidation.  Despite knowing these facts and that the value of Brantley Capital’s loans to DPC were essentially worthless, Pinkas and Keplinger advised Brantley Capital’s board that only relatively minor write-downs of its loans to DPC were required., From 2002 to 2005, BCM received more than $6.4 million in investment advisory fees from Brantley Capital, which were calculated as a percentage of Brantley Capital’s net asset value., BCM and Pinkas are contesting the SEC’s charges., Keplinger has agreed to settle the SEC’s charges without admitting or denying the allegations.  He consented to the entry of a judgment enjoining him from violating the antifraud and other provisions of the securities laws, requiring him to pay a $50,000 penalty, and barring him from serving as an officer or director of any public company for five years.  Keplinger also consented to the entry of a Commission order that will suspend him for five years from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant and bar him for one year from associating with an investment adviser., The Commission’s complaint specifically alleges that BCM violated Exchange Act Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder; Investment Advisers Act Sections 206(1) and 206(2); and that he aided and abetted violations of Exchange Act Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder., The Commission’s complaint specifically alleges that Pinkas violated Exchange Act Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) and Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder; Investment Advisers Act Sections 206(1) and 206(2); and that he aided and abetted violations of Exchange Act Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder; and Investment Advisers Act Sections 206(1) and 206(2)., The Commission’s complaint specifically alleges that Keplinger violated Exchange Act Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) and Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder; and that he aided and abetted violations of Exchange Act Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder; and Investment Advisers Act Sections 206(1) and 206(2)., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2009/comp21178.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21178.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

In each instance, Seiden had no authority to place orders for the customers.  In many instances, Seiden’s false representation caused the broker-dealers to execute the orders, which resulted in purchases totaling more than $1.8 million., The amended complaint also alleges that Abdallah conspired with Seiden to manipulate the prices of penny stocks.  Abdallah, the former CEO of Universal Property Development &amp; Acquisition Corp. (“UPDV”), paid Seiden to create artificial demand for UPDV stock and inflate its stock price.  Seiden and Abdallah worked in concert to manipulate the market price of UPDV stock, enabling Abdallah to dump his UPDV stock in the public market at an inflated price., The Complaint charges Seiden with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Abdallah with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  , On July 21, 2009, the Court issued a temporary restraining order.

The Commission further alleges that the defendants claimed to pool investor funds to invest in commercial paper, foreign currency trading products, and other guaranteed investments.  The complaint alleges that the investment products Khanna claimed to have invested in were non-existent.  Instead, the complaint alleges, Khanna misused investor funds to pay for several luxury cars and residential properties, including those now owned by his wife, Sharanjit Khanna of San Diego, Calif., who was also named as a relief defendant.  , The Commission’s complaint, which was filed in federal court in San Diego, alleges that the defendants falsely claimed that investor accounts would be FDIC and SIPC insured and were “insured” by insurance policies purchased by the defendants.  The complaint alleges Khanna fabricated and gave to an accountant a “screen shot” of MAK 1’s online banking activity purporting to show a balance of over $50 million in its bank account.  The defendants obtained a letter verifying the account balance from the accountant which was sent to investors.  The complaint alleges that, in reality, the average daily balance in that account never exceeded $197,000.  The complaint also alleges the defendants concealed Khanna’s FINRA-bar which resulted from unrelated, alleged fraudulent conduct.  , The Honorable Roger T.

On August 26, the Court entered an order granting a temporary restraining order against the defendants, freezing their assets, and imposing other emergency relief., Prime bank and high yield investment schemes are offering frauds typically characterized by, among other things, promises of spectacular returns for investors, at little or no risk.

Benson and his two entities, Ben-Wal Leasing Company and Ben-Wal Management, Inc. (the Ben-Wal entities) for perpetrating an ongoing investment fraud targeting investors, including seniors, at mobile home park communities throughout California. The court entered an order halting the alleged fraud and freezing the assets of Benson and the Ben-Wal entities., The SECs complaint alleges that since approximately 1990, Benson has been offering and selling investments in Ben-Wal Leasing in the form of promissory notes, guaranteeing annual returns of 12% and claiming that investors have earned annual returns up to 18%. Ben-Wal Leasing raised at least $5.7 million from approximately 126 investors from 2004 through April 2009. The complaint alleges that the defendants offered the investment through advertisements in circulars provided to mobile home park communities throughout California. The complaint alleges that Benson falsely told investors that their funds would be used to purchase printing equipment that would be leased to printing companies and the income from the printing companies lease payments would pay the 12% returns to investors. He also represented that no investor had ever lost money., The SECs complaint alleges that the defendants did not use investor money as represented. Instead, a significant amount of investor money was transferred to CTR Web Printing, Inc. (CTR Printing), a company owned and operated by Bensons son, Scott W. Benson. In addition, Benson did not disclose to investors that CTR Printing was, in essence, the only lessee of printing equipment, and it was not regularly making its lease payments to Ben-Wal Leasing. Moreover, Benson never informed investors that Ben-Wal Leasing was using new investor funds to make principal and interest payments to previous investors in a Ponzi-like fashion., In May 2009, Benson and Ben-Wal Leasing stipulated to a desist-and-refrain order issued by the California Department of Corporations (DOC), which ordered Benson and Ben-Wal Leasing to cease offering or selling securities in California in violation of state law. The SECs complaint alleges that Ben-Wal Leasing stopped making interest payments to investors in June 2009. According to the complaint, Benson first claimed to investors that the cessation of payments was due to some account discrepancies requiring an audit. More recently, however, Benson falsely told investors they were not being paid because the SEC had not approved the payments and that he was working with the SEC to expand business. The complaint alleges that despite the DOCs desist-and-refrain order, Benson continues to solicit investors under a different name — Ben-Wal Management, Inc., In its lawsuit, the SEC obtained an order (1) freezing the assets of Benson and the Ben-Wal entities along with the assets of relief defendant CTR Printing; (2) appointing a temporary receiver over the Ben-Wal entities and their affiliates; (3) preventing the destruction of documents; (4) granting expedited discovery; (5) requiring accountings from Benson and the Ben-Wal entities; and (6) temporarily enjoining Benson, Ben-Wal Leasing, and Ben-Wal Management from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and temporarily enjoining Benson and Ben-Wal Leasing from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC also seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions, disgorgement, and civil penalties against Benson and the Ben-Wal entities and disgorgement from CTR and Scott Benson.

Souza allegedly took advantage of investors trust by appealing to their religious faith with slogans such as Where Business Is Moral and the Miraculous Is Routine., In reality, the SECs complaint alleges, Souza never invested any of the money he received from investors. Instead, he diverted most of the investors money to expenditures designed to create the false appearance of a successful business operation. Souza used another portion of the money to pay certain investors fictitious high returns in the style of a Ponzi scheme, and he used the remainder to pay his personal living expenses. , The SECs complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California in Sacramento, alleges that Souza told investors that their money would be pooled together and invested in stocks or business ventures. Souza convinced individuals to invest with him by professing that he had achieved remarkable rates of return on his past investments. According to the complaint, one prospectus Souza distributed showed purported annualized returns of 158 percent. The supposed returns were entirely fictional, as Souza had no prior investment experience, and he never invested any of the money he received., The complaint further alleges that rather than investing the money as he had represented to investors, Souza spent it on items that were neither disclosed to nor authorized by investors. For example, Souza spent approximately $100,000 to rent office space and to supply it with luxurious furniture and computers; he also used additional investor funds for his personal living expenses, including dental and optical expenses, clothing, and groceries. The complaint further alleges that Souza distributed approximately $230,000 back to certain investors, much of it as purported dividend payments as in a Ponzi scheme.

According to the complaint, Gangavarapu spoke frequently with his sister by telephone during April 2007 and asked her questions about her husbands work activities and whereabouts. Among other things, Gangavarapus sister told him that her husband was in meetings behind closed doors, that he was working extra hours and that he traveled twice overseas for work. The complaint alleges that on the night of April 24, 2007, after learning from her husband that Covansys board of directors would vote the next day on which acquisition offer to accept, Gangavarapus sister told Gangavarapu by tomorrow, its a relief, it will be over. According to the complaint, Gangavarapu purchased over 17,000 shares of Covansys stock at a cost of nearly $450,000 between April 17 and April 24, 2007. On April 25, 2008, the day after the telephone call from his sister, Gangavarapu purchased an additional 37,000 shares of Covansys stock at a cost of over $980,000. After the close of the stock market on April 25, 2007, Covansys and CSC publicly announced that CSC would acquire Covansys for $34 per share. The next day, the price of Covansys stock rose 24%.

When the misrepresentations came to light in December 2007, the company’s stock price fell 46 percent, resulting in a one-day drop in market capitalization of<i> </i>$1.8 billion.  , The SEC’s complaint, filed in federal court in San Jose, alleges that at the end of each of the first three quarters of 2007, internal company reports showed that gross margins would be markedly lower than previously released guidance to analysts.  According to the SEC, senior management was convinced that the previous forecasts were correct and directed finance employees to figure out and fix the problem so the company could report results in line with forecasts and thereby avoid, in the words of a senior officer, an “unmitigated disaster.”  , The SEC alleges that VeriFone’s former supply chain controller, Paul Periolat, then made large manual adjustments to inventory balances on VeriFone’s books each quarter, dramatically increasing both gross margins and operating income.  In each of the first three quarters of 2007, the accounting adjustments allowed the company to meet its internal forecasts and guidance to investors.  However, the complaint alleges that the adjustments were based on incorrect assumptions which Periolat did not take adequate steps to verify.  In fact, the company’s unreported results had been correct, and Periolat’s adjustments led to VeriFone’s improper inflating of its income by over $37 million., Without admitting or denying the Commission’s allegations, VeriFone consented to a permanent injunction against violations of the reporting, internal controls, and other provisions of the federal securities laws.

(Hain), a Melville, New York natural foods company, alleging that Hain backdated and re-priced stock option grants to its officers, directors, and employees and reported false information to shareholders., The SECs complaint, filed in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, alleges that from at least 1998 to 2002, Hain fraudulently backdated stock options granted to Company officers, directors, and employees, concealing millions of dollars in expenses from the Companys shareholders.  Hain, and its former Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and Secretary, used hindsight to choose dates corresponding to low stock prices for stock option grants, backdated stock option agreements to make it appear as if options had been granted on the earlier dates, and prepared or approved financial statements and SEC filings that omitted necessary expenses for backdated options and falsely described Hains option granting practices.  During this period, Hain and its former CFO also re-priced grants that had previously been approved, but for which stock option paperwork had not yet been issued, to give recipients the advantage of subsequent lower exercise prices., The SECs complaint also alleges that by virtue of the undisclosed backdating and re-pricing scheme, Hain materially understated the Companys expenses and overstated its income in disclosures to the Commission and the investing public, and falsely represented in filings that Hain had incurred no expenses for option grants.  Additionally, throughout the period of 1993-2005, Hain did not have adequate internal controls relating to the granting of stock options and did not maintain accurate books and records concerning its stock option grants., After media inquiries and analyst reports regarding its stock option practices in mid-2006, Hains current CFO conducted a limited internal review of selected grants.  At the time, Hain did not retain outside counsel to review its historical option practices and did not conduct a forensic review of e-mails or accounting records.  Subsequently, Hains current CFO and the company made statements during September and November 2006 that the company had carefully reviewed its historical stock option grants and found nothing improper., After being contacted by the SEC staff in mid-2007, Hain formed a group of independent directors and retained outside counsel and other experts to conduct a detailed review of its stock options practices.  In January 2008, Hain restated its historical financial statements as a result of this review.  Hain re-measured 48 grants and recorded $20.5 million of compensation expense.  Twenty-one of the 48 re-measured grants, representing approximately 3.7 million options and $13.2 million of compensation expense, were issued between 1998 and 2002., Without admitting or denying the SECs allegations, Hain consented to a permanent injunction against violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13, and 14a-9 thereunder.

Averett (collectively, the Promoters), raised approximately $41 million from the unregistered offer and sale of high-yield promissory notes to over 150 investors in several states, over half of which was lost to investors. According to the complaint, around $18 million of the funds raised by Fry and the Promoters was funneled by Fry into a Ponzi scheme run by Jeffrey L. Mowen, a convicted felon and securities law recidivist, who misappropriated over $8 million of these funds. The complaint also alleges that Fry and the Promoters knowingly or recklessly distributed private placement memoranda to investors that misrepresented the level of their due diligence and falsely stated that all the funds were being used to make collateralized domestic real estate loans and domestic small business loans. The complaint further alleges that, Fry, who dealt directly with Mowen, committed fraud by failing to disclose Mowens involvement and criminal history to the Promoters and investors. According to the complaint, Fry and the Promoters also committed registration violations with respect to the securities offerings and their status as brokers., The Commissions complaint alleges that, as a result of their conduct, the defendants violated, and unless enjoined, will continue to violate, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The defendants, who consented to the order as well as civil injunctions and other equitable relief, are charged with operating a scheme that sold approximately 500 investors in North Carolina and elsewhere throughout the United States $32.5 million in private loan agreements from at least August 2006 to June 2009., The Commissions complaint alleges that the defendants, Sidney S. Hanson and Charlotte M. Hanson, through a network of more than 45 salesmen, offered and sold the so-called private loan agreements to investors located throughout the country. Operating through the various limited liability companies, the Hansons told investors that the investment contracts would generate fixed yearly profits ranging from 8% to 30%, depending on the amount invested and length of the agreement. Investors were provided periodic interest payments and account statements reflecting supposedly successful results and increasing balances. The Hansons informed investors that they were able to earn fixed, above-average, returns because the funds they invested in the private loan agreements were placed in a diversified and safe portfolio of treasury bills, precious metals, and foreign currency. In actuality, they invested the majority of the investor funds in a number of very risky private investments and did not invest in any treasury bills. Investors also were not informed that their funds would be used to pay the Hansons and their extensive sales force, or to make interest payments to other investors including investors in prior unsuccessful investment schemes operated by the Hansons., Without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating Sections 17(a) and 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, with monetary relief to be determined by the court at a later date upon motion of the Commission.

Barry and his firms Leverage Group, Leverage Option Management Co., Inc, and North American Financial Services defrauded investors, including senior citizens and retirees, by selling securities in Leverage investment funds.  According to the Commissions complaint, Barry provided fake account statements to investors that recorded growing account balances and concealed that Barry had not been trading securities at all for several years.  Neither Barry nor any of his related firms is registered with the SEC in any capacity., The SEC alleges that Barry and his firms made numerous and varied misrepresentations to induce investors to invest in or to maintain their investments with the Leverage investment funds.  For example, Barry falsely represented that he would use the investors funds to trade in options or other securities.  In addition, Barry falsely told investors that he would use a proven trading strategy to protect investors principal and generate guaranteed returns of as much as 21 percent per year.  As alleged in the complaint, these purportedly guaranteed rates of return were simply numbers arbitrarily selected by Barry.  Barry also misrepresented to some investors that their investments in Leverage would be protected from loss by privately obtained insurance and/or by the Securities Investors Protection Corporation (SIPC).  Barry told investors that they could liquidate their investment at any time and withdraw their funds, after providing Leverage with a few weeks notice., The SECs complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, alleges that, by approximately 1999, Barry had ceased investing any of his investors funds in options or other securities.  Instead, the Commission alleges that Barry ran a Ponzi scheme in which he used incoming investor money to repay other existing investors and diverted the remaining investor funds for his own personal use.  According to the Commissions complaint, Barry spent the money by purchasing real estate in his own name and those of other entities he controlled, paying expenses of a separate mail order business that sold pornographic materials, and supporting his lifestyle., The SECs complaint charges Barry, Leverage Group, Leverage Option Management Co., Inc, and North American Financial Services with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), 206(4) and Rule 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

In reality, the SEC alleges, the company merely had a license for a very early stage technology and no reasonable basis for its claims. According to the SEC, stock promoters hired by the company then spread the false information to investors, briefly driving the stock price to $7.50 before it plummeted back down to under a dime., The SECs complaints, filed in federal district court in Seattle, allege that in multiple public filings with the SEC and in other investor materials, CellCyte falsely claimed it had received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval to begin human clinical trials with a special stem cell compound to repair the heart. In fact, the SEC alleges, CellCyte did not know how to properly formulate the stem cell compound, had never attempted experiments with the compound to repair organs, and had not satisfied any of the FDA requirements to begin human clinical trials. According to the SEC, CellCytes Chief Scientific Officer, Ronald Berninger of Mukilteo, Wash., originally approved or participated in the drafting of many of the false and misleading statements, while CEO Gary Reys of Freeland, Wash., approved the companys fraudulent SEC filings., The SECs action further alleges that CellCyte engaged in an illegal stock distribution by partnering with a Canadian stock promoter, who sent millions of spam emails, faxes and newsletters containing false information about CellCyte. During the August-December 2007 promotional campaign, CellCytes stock price rose from $4.00 to $7.50, briefly giving the fledgling company a market capitalization of nearly half a billion dollars. The price later crashed to under ten cents per share., The SECs action against CellCyte and Berninger alleges that CellCyte violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Sections 10(b) and 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-11 and 13a-13.

Those purchases accounted for 33% of the total trading volume in the stock, and triggered a 358% increase in the stock price (from $0.95 per share to a high of $4.35 per share)., The complaint further alleges that while Anderson was recommending Cloudtech stock to investors, contrary to his buy recommendations, he was secretly selling his personal Cloudtech shares, thereby realizing $930,852 in illicit profits from his stock scalping scheme., Anderson has consented to a permanent injunction against future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations. Anderson also agreed to pay disgorgement of his ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty, in amounts to be determined by the court., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2009/comp21204.pdf>SEC Complaint</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21204.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Mackey, the former co-president and chief operating officer of Tenet Healthcare Corporation and the sole remaining defendant in an action brought by the Commission on April 2, 2007. Mackey consented to the relief described below without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions Complaint. Mackeys consent has been submitted to the Court for its approval., The Complaint alleges that Mackey, of Keswick, Virginia, was the principal architect of Tenets scheme to inflate its earnings by exploiting Medicares outlier reimbursement regulations, which provided for additional reimbursement to hospitals to cover the additional costs for treating extraordinarily sick patients. Mackey realized that additional outlier reimbursement could be triggered simply by increasing Tenets gross charges, regardless of the actual cost incurred by Tenet to treat its Medicare patients. In 1999, and under Mackeys direction, Tenet management calculated the precise increase to Tenets gross charges needed to boost its revenue from Medicare outlier payments to a level that would allow Tenet to reach its earnings targets. For the next three years, Mackey continued to oversee aggressive gross charge increases by Tenet. Tenets outlier revenue more than tripled by 2002 and accounted for over 40% of Tenets earnings per share in fiscal year 2002, as Tenets earnings goals were surpassed year after year. Once Tenet finally revealed its scheme to the investing public and admitted that its strategy was not sustainable, the market value of Tenets stock plunged by over $11 billion., During the relevant time, Tenet was based in Santa Barbara, California, and was the second largest publicly traded healthcare company in the United States., To settle the charges, Mackey consented to entry of a permanent injunction prohibiting him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and aiding and abetting violations of the issuer reporting provisions of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder. He also agreed to disgorge $1,780,000 in ill-gotten gains resulting from his exercise of Tenet stock options during the period when its revenues were artificially inflated together with $251,541 in prejudgment interest thereon, and to pay a $500,000 civil penalty, which the Commission will seek to have placed into a Fair Fund for distribution to harmed investors pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, together with disgorgement and penalties previously paid by other settling defendants in the case. Finally, Mackey agreed to be permanently barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company., On March 30, 2006, the Commission charged three of Tenets outside auditors with improperly changing audit work papers in connection with the audit completed during the period of the defendants scheme., For further information see <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20067.htm>LR-20067</a>; Exchange Act Release No. <a href=/litigation/admin/2009/34-60170.pdf>60170</a> and AAER No. <a href=/litigation/admin/2009/34-60170.pdf>3000</a> (June 25, 2009).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21205.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Texas, Tyler Division)</h2>, <h2>SEC HALTS $5.2 MILLION OFFERING FRAUD</h2>]","[On September 8, 2009, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action against Paul D. Poetter and his affiliated entities in connection with an alleged fraudulent scheme in which Poetter raised $5.2 million from more than 2300 investors nationwide. The complaint alleges that Poetter, of Gilbert Arizona, offered and sold trust certificates that investors could purportedly exchange for commons shares of a publicly traded-company. Initially, investors were told they would receive shares of 4309, Inc., a public shell company controlled by Poetter. Later, Poetter allegedly told investors they would receive shares of AMs-TEC Acquisitions (AMs-TEC), a purported Arizona entity that Poetter claimed had a projected value of $13.5 billion and was qualified to trade on a European stock exchange. In fact, according to the complaint, investors never received their promised shares, and Poetters claims regarding the projected value and tradability of AMs-TEC stock were bogus. The complaint also named as defendants three of Poetters affliated entities, 4309 Inc., 4309 Acquistion Trust, and AMs-TEC Acquisition Trust, as well as four entities named as relief defendants, AMs-TEC Commodities, Inc., AMs-TEC Energy, Corp., Greener Cleaner Farms, Inc., and RoboCargo Corporation., As alleged in the complaint, Poetter began his scheme in June 2007 by convincing a few members of a small Baptist church in East Texas to invest. Poetter used those investors to recruit new investors from their church, family members, and friends. In shareholder newsletters mailed to investors, Poetter encouraged investors to solicit investments from family members and friends. Poetter allegedly misrepresented to investors that AMs-TEC and its affiliated entities were in the process of acquiring, or had acquired, several valuable assets or companies. For example, Poetter touted AMs-TECs acquisition of an African cocoa processing plant with negotiated contracts to process over $120 million worth of cocoa. However, Poetter never acquired the cocoa plant and there were no outstanding orders to process cocoa. It is also alleged that Poetter misappropriated and misapplied investor funds by transferring millions of dollars to various affiliated entities which were used to fund various administrative and employment-related expenses, including at least $300,000 paid to Poetter., Simultaneously with the filing of the complaint, the defendants and relief defendants, consented, on a neither admit nor deny basis, to the entry of a final judgment that:, Further, all defendants and relief defendants consented to the appointment of a receiver to recover and preserve assets for the benefit of investors. The agreed final judgment and receivership order are subject to the courts approval. , <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2009/comp21206.pdf>SEC Complaint</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21206.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

According to the complaint, Commercial Vehicle Systems (CVS), a subdivision of one of Danas two main business units, the Heavy Vehicle Technologies and Systems Group (HVTSG), improperly recognized revenue or income on several transactions and delayed recording expenses in the appropriate period. The improper accounting entries included, among other things: (1) recognizing revenue on transactions where assets were never transferred or risk of ownership never passed, (2) recognizing revenue for price increases on parts sales without agreement from the customers, (3) deferring the recognition of steel surcharge expenses, and (4) recording other improper accounting entries, including decreasing debts owed to suppliers without any contractual support or agreement from the suppliers and recording entries that increased income without any basis or supporting documentation. At the time, Cole was the President of HVTSG, Hennessy was the Vice-President of North and South America of HVTSG and CVS General Manager, Hodge was the Vice-President and Group Controller of HVTSG and Steimle was the Controller for CVS. Dana overstated its earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) by $31.6 million or 26.5% due to the fraud., The complaint further alleges that as CVS General Manager, Hennessy instructed certain Dana plant managers and controllers to record improper accounting entries. Hennessy and Hodge repeatedly directed Steimle to improperly record income or defer expenses even though Steimle expressed concerns about the propriety of the accounting treatment for a number of these entries. In turn, Steimle directed his accounting staff to make improper accounting entries despite knowing that those entries did not comply with Danas accounting policies or with GAAP. Finally, Cole was aware that CVS had accrued income from certain proposed price increases before those increases were accepted by customers., The complaint also alleges that Cole, Hennessy, Hodge and Steimle were each responsible for the accuracy of the financial statements of their business unit or division. They signed quarterly and year-end representations that the financial results of CVS were accurate and in accordance with GAAP. However, these statements were false., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, Cole, Hennessy, Hodge and Steimle consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder and aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder; enjoining Hennessy, Hodge and Steimle from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act; and enjoining Hennessy and Steimle from violating Rule 13b2-2 of the Exchange Act. The final judgments impose a $65,000 civil penalty and five-year officer-and-director bar against Cole and Hodge and a $45,000 civil penalty against Hennessy and Steimle. The final judgments also order Hodge to pay $71,037 in disgorgement plus $21,420 in prejudgment interest, Hennessy to pay $44,825 in disgorgement plus $13,122 in prejudgment interest and Steimle to pay $21,744 in disgorgement and $6,449 in prejudgment interest., In a separate action, Dana Holding Corporation was ordered by the Commission to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder. Dana Holding Corporation consented to the issuance of the Order without admitting or denying any of the findings in the Order. The order contains findings that, in addition to the fraud, Danas financial statements from 2004 through the first two quarters of 2005 contained accounting errors amounting to $56.4 million of EBIT. Dana failed to maintain accurate books and records. Dana also had materially deficient internal accounting controls that significantly contributed to the accounting irregularities and errors. As a result, Dana filed materially false and misleading periodic filings with the Commission for fiscal year 2004 and the first two quarters of 2005. In total, Dana materially overstated its EBIT by $88 million, or 73.9% of restated EBIT. This is equivalent to an overstatement of $43 million or 39.8% of restated net income, as reported in Danas Form 10-K/A and Forms 10-Q/A filed in December 2005.<br/>(Rel. 34-60657; AAE Rel. 3048; File No. 3-13614)., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2009/comp21207.pdf>SEC Complaint</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21207.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Fuhlendorf, former Chief Financial Officer of Isilon Systems, Inc. On the heels of the Seattle-based electronic storage companys successful initial public offering (IPO), Fuhlendorf allegedly cut secret side deals with Isilon customers to allow the company to report inflated sales to its shareholders., The SEC alleges Fuhlendorf concealed the true deal terms from Isilons controller, audit committee, and outside auditor, leading the company to report $4.8 million in improper revenue during 2006 and 2007. In a separate proceeding, the SEC also filed settled charges against Isilon for its misleading financial information., According to the SECs complaints, filed in federal district court in Seattle, Isilon became a publicly-traded company in December 2006 and its stock price increased 77 percent on its opening day. The high expectations created by the successful IPO placed significant pressure on Isilons management to meet analysts lofty revenue forecasts. When anticipated deals failed to materialize, the SEC alleges that Fuhlendorf personally negotiated deal terms so that Isilon could get product out the door, even though the secret deal terms made revenue recognition improper under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and the companys own internal policies., The SECs complaints allege that Isilon improperly booked revenue on five transactions, including three transactions with oral side agreements between Fuhlendorf and representatives of Isilon customers; a sale in which the terms were not fixed and determinable until after Isilons quarter ended; and a roundtrip transaction that was essentially a circular flow of cash from Isilon to the customer and back to Isilon. The SEC alleges that Fuhlendorf lied to Isilons audit committee about the true nature of the deal, which was merely a sham transaction designed to artificially boost Isilons revenues., In February 2008, following an internal investigation, Isilon restated its financial statements to correct its accounting for these and other transactions., In its federal court action against Fuhlendorf, the SEC alleges Fuhlendorf violated Section 17(a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act (Exchange Act), and Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder and aided and abetted violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13.

Kelly in District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Johnson was convicted of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, securities fraud for violating Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, witness tampering and obstruction of justice on May 15, 2008. On November 14, 2008, Judge Liam OGrady (E.D. Va.) sentenced Johnson to, among other things, 108 months in prison and ordered him to pay restitution of $9.7 million. Following Johnsons sentencing, the stay of the Commissions case against Johnson was lifted on January 12, 2009., Previously, on April 24, 2008, a jury found Christopher Benyo, former Senior Vice President for Marketing and Network Development for PurchasePro liable for aiding and abetting PurchasePros violation of the antifraud provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder). The jury found Benyo not liable on other charges. The jury also found Michael Kennedy and Kent Wakeford not liable on the charges against them. The SEC voluntarily dismissed the allegations against John Tuli on November 3, 2008., Moreover, as previously announced, the Commission settled with six other former executives of PurchasePro — R. Geoffrey Layne, James S. Sholeff, Dale Boeth, Shawn McGhee, Jeffrey R. Anderson, and Scott H. Miller — for violations of the federal securities laws.

Filed September 21, 2009)</h2>, <h2>SEC Files Settled Civil Action against Regions Bank in Which Regions Agrees to Pay $1 Million Civil Penalty</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) announced today that on September 21, 2009, it filed a settled civil action against Regions Bank (Regions) in the District Court for the Southern District of Florida, for its role in connection with a Florida-based offering fraud by unregistered broker-dealers U.S. Pension Trust Corp. and U.S. College Trust Corp. (collectively, USPT). For over six years, Regions or its predecessor bank served as trustee of investment plans through which USPT defrauded thousands of investors (residing primarily in Latin America) by charging exorbitant, undisclosed commissions and fees in connection with the sale of mutual funds., The Commissions Complaint alleges that since 1996, USPT has offered and sold to investors mutual funds, through a trust created at a U.S. bank. USPT sells the funds through a series of investment plans that give investors a choice of making either annual contributions for multiple years or a single, lump-sum contribution. Until March 2006, USPT did not disclose to new investors that it subtracted from their contributions up to 85% of investors initial contributions in the annual plans, and as much as 18% in the single contribution plans, for payment of sales commissions, USPTs net profit, and insurance premiums., According to the Commissions Complaint, Regions — which has served as trustee of the plans since October 2001 (through its predecessor bank) — contributed to the investment scheme because a primary selling point for USPTs investment plans was the trust relationship created between the investor and the U.S. bank. As trustee, Regions allowed USPT to use its name in marketing materials, prepared a promotional video that was posted on USPTs website, and sent representatives to Latin America to meet with sales agents and prospective investors to explain Regions role as trustee. Regions entered into individual trust relationships with all investors, processed their contributions, and purchased the selected mutual funds for them. However, when it sent them confirming certificates (prepared by USPT but signed by a Regions representative), it failed to disclose the amounts taken out for USPTs fees and commissions. Regions own Trust Agreement and Trust Summary were also misleading and failed to disclose the nature and amounts of the commissions and fees that USPT charged (except for Regions own trust fees). Regions stopped accepting new USPT investor trust relationships in January 2008, and stopped accepting additional contributions under existing plans in August 2009., The Commissions Complaint charges Regions with violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933, and with aiding and abetting USPTs violations of Section 15(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by serving as trustee. Regions has agreed to settle the civil action by consenting to the entry of a Final Judgment, without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions Complaint, providing for payment of a civil penalty of $1 million, which will be paid into a Fair Fund for the benefit of investors injured in the USPT offering fraud. Simultaneously with the filing of the Commissions complaint, the Commission issued a cease-and-desist Order in a settled administrative proceeding ordering Regions to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations or future violations of these provisions., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2009/comp21215.pdf>SEC Complaint</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21215.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Immediately following the tender offer announcement on Monday, September 21, Saleh sold all of the call option contracts in the accounts and reaped approximately $8.6 million in illicit profits., Later that same morning, SEC staff with assistance from the Options Regulatory Surveillance Authority identified Saleh as a suspicious trader.

In its complaint, the Commission alleges that Black aided and abetted ACLs violation of Regulation FD and Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act). The complaint further alleges that Black, while acting in his capacity as the companys designated investor relations contact and without informing anyone at ACL, selectively disclosed material, nonpublic information regarding ACLs second quarter 2007 earnings forecast to a limited number of analysts without simultaneously making that information available to the public. More specifically, the complaint alleged that on Monday, June 11, 2007, ACL issued a press release projecting second quarter earnings in line with ACLs first quarter earnings of approximately $.20 per share. The complaint further alleges that on Saturday, June 16, 2007, Black sent an e-mail from his home to the eight sell-side analysts who covered the company. In addition, the complaint alleges that Blacks e-mail stated that ACLs earnings per share for the second quarter will likely be in the neighborhood of about a dime below that of the first quarter, effectively cutting in half ACLs second quarter earnings guidance. The complaint also alleged that Blacks selective disclosure and resulting analysts reports triggered a significant drop in ACLs stock price. Lastly, the complaint alleged that on Monday, June 18, the first trading day after Blacks e-mail to analysts, ACLs stock price dropped 9.7% on unusually heavy volume., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Black consented to the entry of a final judgment requiring him to pay a $25,000 penalty., Black also consented to the entry of an order in a follow-on administrative proceeding directing him to cease and desist from violating Regulation FD and Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934., In determining not to bring an enforcement action against ACL, the Commission considered several factors. Prior to the June 16, 2007 disclosure by Black, ACL cultivated an environment of compliance by providing training regarding the requirements of Regulation FD and by adopting policies that implemented controls to prevent violations. Further, Black alone was responsible for the violation and he acted outside the control systems established by ACL to prevent improper disclosures. Moreover, once the illegal disclosure was discovered by ACL, it promptly and publicly disclosed the information by filing a Form 8-K with the Commission the same day. In addition, ACL self-reported the conduct to the staff the day after it was discovered and the company provided extraordinary cooperation with the staffs investigation.

The SEC previously filed charges against May and E-M in connection with the fraudulent scheme. , The SEC alleges that Bluestein specifically targeted potential investors who were retired or elderly and conducted so-called “investment seminars” in Michigan and California to lure them into investing in E-M securities. , The SEC’s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, alleges that Bluestein facilitated May’s fraudulent scheme by raising approximately $74 million from more than 800 investors through the sale of E-M securities over a five-year period.  Bluestein, through his company Maximum Financial, conducted numerous investment seminars to find new E-M investors., According to the SEC’s complaint, Bluestein was very methodical and careful not to discuss the E-M offerings openly during these “seminars” in a way that would alert attendees to the fact that they were actually forums to pitch the E-M offerings.  Bluestein first gained the trust of potential investors in attendance by discussing generic financial planning topics and other investment products.  But under the guise of informal conversations, Bluestein would generate talks among attendees who already had invested in E-M offerings.  For instance, Bluestein would often ask if they had “received their Ed May checks?” or “How do you like those Ed Mays?” in order to drum up discussion of the investments and attract the interest of other potential investors attending the seminars.  , The SEC’s complaint alleges that Bluestein misrepresented to investors that the investments were low-risk and that he had conducted adequate due diligence with respect to the investments when, in fact, he did little to investigate the legitimacy of the E-M offerings even when confronted with serious red flags about the existence of some transactions.  Bluestein also misled investors about the compensation he was receiving from the offerings by failing to disclose that he received at least $2.4 million in commissions from May and E-M in addition to the $1.4 million in disclosed compensation he received from investor funds., The SEC complaint alleges violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”), Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder by Bluestein.

Judge Presnell also ordered an asset freeze against the Stock Distributors and temporarily prohibited them from participating in any offering of penny stock.    , The SEC’s complaint, filed on September 24, alleges that the defendants engaged in an ongoing scheme to evade the registration provisions of the federal securities laws by selling billions of shares of stock issued by microcap companies to the investing public without adhering to the registration requirements of Section 5 of the Securities Act.  According to the complaint, the scheme involved a series of transactions between the Stock Distributors and the microcap companies, including Enzyme Environmental (the Issuers), with the same essential characteristics:  First, a Stock Distributor either purported to lend money to an Issuer or the Issuer identified a “debt” owed to its officer that the Issuer and officer assigned to the Stock Distributor.  Second, to reduce or eliminate the loan or the assigned debt, the Issuer issued shares of its stock to the Stock Distributor.  Third, before or after the stock issuances, the Stock Distributor paid the Issuer or an affiliate of the Issuer.  Finally, the Stock Distributor immediately sold the shares into the public market.  In two years, the Stock Distributors generated approximately $7 million in illegal profits the complaint alleged.           , In addition to the emergency relief already obtained, the SEC is seeking permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, and civil penalties against all defendants.

The SEC alleged that Flores and MRI perpetrated a $23 million Ponzi scheme that targeted the Hispanic-American community.  In an amended judgment issued September 9, 2009, the Honorable Otis D. Wright II of the United States District Court for the Central District of California permanently enjoined MRI and Flores from future violations of the antifraud provisions of the securities laws, imposed civil penalties of $650,000 against MRI and $130,000 against Flores, and ordered MRI and Flores jointly to pay disgorgement of $10,355,778 plus prejudgment interest of $259,738.63. , The SEC filed its complaint against MRI and Flores on April 13, 2009.  The complaint alleged that Flores and MRI misled investors by promising that their money would be used for risk-free investment programs in real estate, commodities, and bank instrument trading and promised returns of up to 25 percent within 30 to 45 days.  The Commission alleged, however, that Flores and MRI used approximately $13 million from new investors to pay the principal and interest due to earlier investors.  According to the complaint, Flores also misappropriated more than $3.5 million of investor funds for personal expenses, including $443,000 to purchase a home, and almost $1.5 million to finance MRIs operations, most of which was used to pay for a lavish party celebrating MRIs purported financial success.  Only $5.6 million was invested in high-risk ventures and start-up companies that never paid MRI any returns.

The complaint alleges that the five offerings, which were not registered with the Commission, as required under the law, were sold through an unregistered boiler-room located in Irving, Texas.

Investors were told in the offering materials that the sales commissions paid on their investments were dramatically less than they actually were. An imminent Initial Public Offering (IPO) was repeatedly hyped to investors while no steps were actually being taken toward going public. And prestigious business relationships between 3001 AD and Microsoft, Apple, and former Disney CEO Michael Eisner were touted to investors even though such relationships never existed., The SECs complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, charged 3001 AD, LLC; its principals Jimmy L. Barker, Robert J. Ladrach and Marc S. Rifkin; and three former sales agents Ronald B. Bowsky, Jack W. Maddock and Michael J. Weidgans with making several material misrepresentations and omissions to investors in the offer and sale of units of 3001 AD and a myriad of general partnerships., According to the SECs complaint, the defendants avoided telling investors that 3001 AD and the partnerships paid up to five times more than the 8 percent sales commissions disclosed in offering materials. In telephone sales calls, Web site postings, press releases, personal meetings, and conference calls, they repeatedly failed to disclose the excessively large sales commissions to investors., The SEC alleges that the defendants (with the exception of Maddock) repeatedly misrepresented to investors for several years that 3001 AD was preparing to conduct an IPO in the near future, telling investors different versions of the purported pending IPO story. They went so far as to issue a press release titled Were Going Public that falsely identified progress with the SEC as well as NASDAQ acceptance of 3001 AD. However, 3001 AD was never prepared to conduct an IPO, according to the SECs complaint. The company did not take any steps to draft and file the required registration statement for an IPO, and did not collect the information required for a registration statement. 3001 AD never had any audited financial statements, even though two years of audited financial statements are required to conduct an IPO. The company also lacked the necessary capital to conduct an IPO., The SEC further alleges that Barker, Ladrach, Rifkin, and Weidgans misrepresented 3001 ADs business relationships while soliciting investors. For instance, 3001 AD, Barker, and Ladrach touted that their company would soon be signing contracts with Microsoft when in fact Microsoft expressed no interest in 3001 ADs technology or in contracting with them. Similarly, these defendants and Rifkin misstated that the companys purported negotiations with Microsoft had triggered Apples interest in a virtual reality game system for use with its Macintosh computer and the successful iPod. This was impossible because Apple had not even received the product that they claimed Apple was reviewing at that time. Additionally, Barker, Ladrach, Rifkin, and Weidgans falsely claimed 3001 AD was the target of a possible buyout by Michael Eisner. They touted purported meetings and promising negotiations; however Eisner had in fact already rejected their attempts at forging a business relationship., The SECs enforcement action charges 3001 AD and the defendants with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, thereunder, and charges Barker, Rifkin, Bowsky, Maddock and Weidgans with violating Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act.

Rivers contemporaneously sold over one million shares of IBSG stock, generating approximately $1.23 million in illicit proceeds., The Commissions complaint alleges that, between January 2006 and January 2009, IBSG, which discontinued all of its operations earlier this year, marketed an Internet-based business software it had developed for small businesses. According to the complaint, Rivers directed IBSG to issue a series of press releases disclosing the purported sale of licenses for the software to various entities in South Africa, Hungary and Finland, as well as the revenues the company would allegedly generate from the licenses. The complaint alleges that, contrary to the press releases, the licenses either did not exist or that IBSG had agreed to waive the licensing and service fees required by the agreements. The complaint further alleges that Rivers directed IBSG to file periodic reports with the Commission that falsely reported the company had generated $23.4 million in revenues from the purported license agreements., In addition, the complaint alleges that Rivers, while directing IBSG to report the false license agreements and revenues, sold over one million shares of IBSG stock from brokerage accounts that he and he wife maintained in the name of a nominee company, Relief Defendant, ARKR Trust, LLC. The stock sales generated approximately $1.23 million in proceeds., The Commissions complaint charges Rivers with violating Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2, and with aiding and abetting IBSGs violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13.

AGCO Corporation</i>, Civil Action No. 1:09-CV-01865 (D.D.C.)(RMU)</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed Foreign Corrupt Practices Act books and records and internal controls charges against AGCO Corporation in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.  AGCO Corporation, headquartered in Duluth, Georgia, is a manufacturer and supplier of agricultural equipment.  The Commission’s complaint alleges that from 2000 through 2003, certain AGCO subsidiaries made approximately $5.9 million in kickback payments in connection with their sales of equipment to Iraq under the United Nations Oil for Food Program (the “Program”).  The kickbacks were characterized as “after sales service fees” (“ASSFs”), but no bona fide services were performed.  The Program was intended to provide humanitarian relief for the Iraqi population, which faced severe hardship under international trade sanctions.  The Program required the Iraqi government to purchase humanitarian goods through a U.N. escrow account; however, AGCO’s subsidiaries’ kickbacks diverted funds out of the escrow account and into Iraqi-controlled accounts at banks in Jordan.  , According to the Commission’s Complaint: , Prior to the Oil for Food Program, AGCO tried unsuccessfully to increase its market share in Iraq.  AGCO’s U.K. subsidiary, AGCO Ltd., marketed and negotiated the sale of agricultural equipment to Iraqi ministries.  In December 2000, AGCO Ltd.’s business manager for Iraq learned from its Jordanian agent that the Iraqi Ministry of Agriculture was demanding a kickback of ten percent of the contract value as a condition to awarding contracts to AGCO.  The business manager and his supervisor agreed to the kickbacks, and the agent agreed to make the payments on AGCO’s behalf. The agent asked AGCO to set up bank guarantees in favor of the agent to facilitate the payments.  In a December 2000 e-mail, the agent stated that “the payments are in the ‘interest of continuity of our solid position we are enjoying now.’”  , The fees AGCO normally paid to the agent were:  (1) a flat rate commission; (2) a variable commission based upon the value of the equipment sold; and (3) an “After Sales” commission to allow the agent to establish and maintain an infrastructure in Iraq to support AGCO’s farm machinery.  However, beginning in early 2001, AGCO paid additional amounts to the agent to make the kickbacks.  To conceal the scheme, AGCO’s employees created a fictional account in its books and records denoted as “Ministry Accrual.”  The kickbacks were recorded in this account.  The AGCO employees made it appear that the account was being used to pay the agent for his After Sales commissions.  Thus, AGCO maintained and used two accounts, both of which were described as for the purpose of After Sales work.  , The accrual account was created by AGCO Ltd.’s marketing staff with virtually no oversight from AGCO Ltd.’s finance department.  No one questioned the existence of the dual accounts.  No one questioned why the Ministry Accrual account contained approximately ten percent of the contract value despite the fact that there was no contract in place requiring that such ten percent be paid to the ministry or anyone else.  Unlike other payments to the agent, the Ministry Accrual payments were made by bank guarantee and in French francs or Euros instead of U.S. dollars.  Marketing and finance employees in the U.K., Denmark, and France were all instrumental in the scheme.  As part of the scheme, AGCO’s subsidiaries concealed the kickback payments from the UN by secretly inflating UN contract prices by an artificial ten percent.  Altogether, AGCO’s subsidiaries paid approximately $5,912,393 in ASSFs on sixteen contracts.  The ASSFs were inaccurately described as a “Ministry Accrual” for infrastructure repair in the company’s books and records and were included among legitimate commission payments to AGCO’s agent in Iraq., On at least two occasions, the Jordanian agent asked for and received funds for “car payments” related to business in Iraq, and AGCO employees did not obtain any documentation as to the appropriateness of these expenses or ask if the cars were going to government officials.  In October 2002, an employee who set up bank guarantees for the agent knowing that the payments would be forwarded to the ministry warned AGCO Ltd. that “we do not want the auditors raising any questions on Iraq business!”  In February 2002, AGCO’s internal auditors noted numerous problems with AGCO Ltd.’s sales process, including the establishment of accrual accounts by the marketing department.  However, AGCO failed to conduct a review of the accrual accounts that existed at the time of the report, and the Ministry Accrual account continued to be used in the scheme to make and record additional ASSF payments to Iraq.  One AGCO Ltd. accounting employee described the Finance Department employees as “blind loaders” who input information into AGCO’s books without any adequate oversight role.  AGCO’s legal department was aware that the company was conducting sales under the Program into Iraq, a sanctioned country, but failed to ensure that the sanctions or the UN rules and regulations were followed.  In fact, AGCO’s General Counsel’s office assisted on at least one occasion with obtaining 661 Committee approval for an Oil for Food contract.  The General Counsel’s office then sent a letter to a London bank asking that money be paid to the Jordanian agent.  , AGCO failed to maintain an adequate system of internal controls to detect and prevent the payments and AGCO’s accounting for these transactions failed properly to record the nature of the payments.  AGCO, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission’s complaint, consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining AGCO from future violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and ordering AGCO to disgorge $13,907,393 in profits plus $2,000,000 in pre-judgment interest plus a civil penalty of $2,400,000.  AGCO will also pay a $1,600,000 penalty pursuant to a deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice, Fraud Section.  AGCO will also enter into a criminal disposition in which the Danish State Prosecutor for Serious Economic Crime will confiscate over $600,000.  , The Commission considered remedial acts promptly undertaken by AGCO and the cooperation the company afforded the Commission staff in its investigation.  The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Department of Justice, Fraud Section and the United Nations Independent Inquiry Committee.  , <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2009/comp21229.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21229.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Huber, falsely portrayed himself to investors as a successful money manager who managed three private investment funds with assets over $40 million, consistently beating market indices through skillful trading and shrewd investments. In reality, he managed just $3 million in investor assets, frequently lost money on his trading and misappropriated investor funds to pay for his lavish bi-coastal lifestyle., The SEC alleges that William A. Huber reported false account balances to investors in three investment funds he controlled, stating that the funds held more than $40 million as of August 31, 2009. Hubers funds, however, held little more than $3 million in assets as of that date. Huber lost money on his trading throughout 2009, yet told investors that his trading had generated substantial returns. Huber collected performance fees he did not earn based on his false claims of returns in the funds he managed. Huber made Ponzi-like payments to investors by using newer investor funds to make investor redemption payments at inflated amounts. Huber also diverted investor funds for his personal benefit, including purchasing expensive homes for himself in Naples, Florida and La Jolla, California. The SEC further alleges that shortly after the arrest of Bernard Madoff, in an effort to conceal his fraud from investors, Huber sent his investors an email reassuring them that he managed his funds honestly and that his funds bore no resemblance to Madoffs scheme. Similarly, the complaint alleges that Huber lied to SEC staff members during their investigation of his activities, reporting false account balances to the SEC and claiming hedge fund investments that did not exist., The SECs complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in Chicago, alleges that Huber solicited investments in three different private funds he controlled: The Quarter Funds, L.P., The Symmetry Fund, L.P. and The Trimester Fund. Huber managed the funds through Hubadex, Inc., a Decatur, Illinois-based company that he controlled., The SECs complaint charges Huber and Hubadex with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder, and seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement, prejudgment interest, civil penalties and the appointment of a receiver.

In its complaint, the Commission alleges that Genet helped China Energy falsely obtain a listing on the Nasdaq National Market System (NMS) and entered into secret arrangements to give away China Energy stock to people who agreed to purchase China Energy stock in the market, thereby creating the false and misleading impression of bona fide and active investor interest in China Energy. The Complaint alleges that Genet acted in concert with Chiu Wing Chiu, a Chinese national who secretly controlled China Energy. The Commission previously sued Chiu and his associates for their conduct in the China Energy fraud., Among other things, the Commissions Complaint alleges that Genet played a crucial role in the illegal pump and dump manipulation of the common stock of China Energy. According to the Complaint, as part of the manipulation, Genet: (i) helped China Energy falsely obtain a listing on the Nasdaq NMS by helping China Energy to give away shares to hundreds of persons, and thereby created the false and misleading impression that China Energy had a bona fide and active shareholder base; (ii) engaged in unregistered distributions of securities; and (iii) entered into secret arrangements to give away China Energy stock to persons who agreed to purchase China Energy stock in the market, and thereby created the false and misleading impression of active trading and interest in China Energy. In payment for his fraudulent activities, Genet received thousands of shares of China Energy stock, which he later sold into the artificially inflated market, realizing illicit profits in excess of $1.7 million., The Commissions complaint charges Genet with violating the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws (Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933). The Commission seeks a permanent injunction against Genet prohibiting him from further violations of the securities laws, disgorgement of his ill-gotten gains, civil penalties and a penny stock bar., The Commission previously filed fraud charges against China Energy, Chiu Wing Chiu, and several of Chius associates, seeking permanent injunctions, disgorgement, penalties, and other relief, as well as an order freezing $3.9 million in assets held in four U.S. brokerage accounts by nominees of Chiu.

The Court of Appeals also affirmed the District Courts order of disgorgement against relief defendant William Minerva (Minerva)., The Commission had charged that, while Mitchell Drucker was a lawyer at NBTY, and had learned that NBTY was about to announce lower than expected quarterly earnings, he and his father, a former New York City police detective, sold their entire holdings of NBTY stock just before the negative announcement. Collectively, the defendants avoided $197,243 in losses by selling in advance of the announcement., On December 3, 2007, a federal jury in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York found Mitchell Drucker and Ronald Drucker violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws by committing insider trading.

Hedgelender LLC et al.</i>, Case No. 2:09-CV-859 (S.D. Ohio)</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that, on September 30, it filed a complaint against HedgeLender LLC, a stock-based loan broker located in Philadelphia, and its two principals, Daniel W. Stafford and Fred R. Wahler, Jr., for their conduct in connection with a fraudulent stock-based loan scheme orchestrated by Michael and Melissa Spillan through One Equity Corporation and other companies.  Upon filing of the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of orders, without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, that will permanently enjoin them from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.   The orders also provide that the Court shall order disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest and civil penalties in amounts to be determined upon later motion of the Commission. , The Commission’s complaint alleges that in February 2006, HedgeLender entered into an agreement with One Equity through which HedgeLender referred borrowers to One Equity in exchange for commissions on successful stock-based loan transactions.  One Equity was not, however, a legitimate lender.  The Spillans, through One Equity, induced borrowers to transfer ownership of publicly traded stock to them as collateral for purported non-recourse loans.  They represented that all shares would be returned to borrowers upon repayment of the loans.  Instead, the Spillans generally liquidated the shares to fund the loans and failed to maintain adequate cash reserves necessary to repurchase and return the shares to borrowers., According to the complaint, HedgeLender promoted One Equity’s stock-based loan program as Hedgelender’s Star HedgeLoan®.  On its website, HedgeLender represented to potential clients that it had certified its stock-based loan programs, vetted the professional reputations of those that administered the programs, and took steps to ensure the security of borrowers’ shares.  In reality, Stafford, a resident of Gaithersburg, Maryland, and Wahler, a resident of Philadelphia, conducted minimal due diligence and failed to investigate “red flags” that cast doubt on One Equity’s ability to administer and fund its stock-based loans.  Adequate due diligence would have revealed that One Equity had no funding source and that the Spillans had never run a legitimate stock-based lending enterprise.  The complaint further alleges that from February 2006 through at least November 2007, HedgeLender referred approximately 54 borrowers to One Equity and received approximately $1.7 million in commission payments.  , For more information about the Commission’s related actions against the Spillans and One Equity, see Litigation Release Nos. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20716a.htm>20716A</a> (September 15, 2008) and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20652.htm>20652</a> (July 22, 2008)., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2009/comp21234.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21234.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

(AIG) for their roles in helping AIG mislead investors through the use of fraudulent reinsurance transactions.  Four of the former executives, Ronald Ferguson, Elizabeth Monrad, CPA, Robert Graham, Esq., and Christopher Garand, worked for Gen Re, while the fifth, Christian Milton, worked for AIG., On February 2, 2006, the Commission filed its civil action against the defendants, alleging that they aided and abetted AIG’s violations of the antifraud and other provisions of the securities laws.  The complaint alleged that Ferguson, Monrad, Graham, Garand, and others at Gen Re worked with Milton and others at AIG to fashion two sham reinsurance contracts between Cologne Re Dublin, a Gen Re subsidiary in Dublin, Ireland, and an AIG subsidiary.  The sham reinsurance transactions made it appear that AIG had legitimately increased its general loss reserves., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants each consented to the entry of a final judgment, permanently enjoining them from violating or aiding and abetting violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13 and 13b2-1.

In determining to accept defendants’ settlement offers in which they consented to final judgments, the Commission considered the sanctions the court ordered against them in the criminal proceedings.  , The SEC previously charged AIG in 2006 with securities fraud and improper accounting, and the company settled the charges by paying disgorgement of $700 million and a penalty of $100 million, among other remedies.,  ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21235.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

PENLAND IN FRAUDULENT ACCOUNTING SCHEME</h2>]","[On October 2, 2009, the Honorable Carl Barbier, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Louisiana entered a final judgment of permanent injunction and other relief on behalf of the Honorable Martin L.C. Feldman, to whom the case is assigned. The final judgment is against defendant Joe E. Penland, a Texas resident and the owner of a third-party vendor of Newpark Resources, Inc. (Newpark), an oil and gas company based in Houston, Texas. Penland was the principal of Quality Mat Company, a Newpark vendor, and was charged in the complaint along with Newpark principals for violations of the federal securities laws. The final judgment permanently enjoined Penland from future violations of the antifraud provision of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and from future violations of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-2, which prohibits lying to auditors. The final judgment also permanently enjoined Penland from aiding and abetting accounting violations of others as set forth in Sections13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act. The final judgment ordered that Penland pay a civil penalty in the amount of $70,000. Penland consented to the entry of the order without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions complaint., According to the Commissions Complaint, Matthew W. Hardey, a former Chief Financial Officer for Newpark, and L. Cyrus DeBlanc, a former Chief Financial Officer for Newpark subsidiary Soloco LLC, conspired with Quality Mat president Joe E. Penland to engage in a fraudulent accounting scheme that allowed Newpark in fiscal year 2003 to avoid writing off approximately $4.2 million in aging debt. As a result, Newpark reported approximately $500,000 of net income instead of a significant loss for that fiscal year. The Commissions Complaint alleged that, in 2002 and 2003, Newpark recognized $4.2 million in revenue based on sales of its primary product — industrial mats used to lay temporary roads at drilling sites — to Quality Mat and another vendor, Easy Frac. The Complaint alleged that neither vendor had made any payment on the sales through the end of 2003, and that Hardey, DeBlanc and Penland devised and executed a scheme to funnel money to Quality Mat and Easy Frac through sham transactions that would then allow the vendors to pay their debts to Newpark., According to the Complaint, one of the sham transactions took place in 2004 and involved Dura-Base Nevada, LLC and Dura-Base de Mexico, two Newpark subsidiaries created to begin mat rentals in Mexico. The Complaint asserted that Newpark purchased the entire initial inventory of mats for the Dura-Base business from Quality Mat, and that the decision to purchase the approximately 6,175 mats from Quality Mat was a pretext meant to give the appearance of a legitimate business transaction to Newparks repurchase, at the original sales price, of 1,500 mats sold to Quality Mat in 2002 and 600 mats sold to Easy Frac in 2003. The Complaint claimed that, in an attempt to perpetuate the pretext, Hardey also misled Newparks auditors about the basis for buying the Dura-Base inventory from Quality Mat by falsely claiming that Quality Mat had contractual rights in Mexico that Newpark would have to buy in order for the Dura-Base venture to go forward. According to the Complaint, this ruse was necessary to allow Newpark to buy back the mats at the original sales price without suffering any adverse accounting consequences. Under this scheme, Newpark could account for the repurchases as if they had taken place at Newparks manufacturing cost, but still pay Quality Mat the original purchase price for the mats by assigning the difference in value to the intangible asset allegedly created by the repurchase of Quality Mats contract rights., The Complaint alleged that the other sham transaction, which took place during 2004 and 2005, involved Quality Mat sending fictitious invoices to Newpark purportedly for bulk lumber sales. According to the Complaint, in early 2004, Penland agreed to convert Quality Mats outstanding debt from the 2002 sales to notes receivable. One of the notes required monthly payments of $52,409, which Quality Mat began making in March 2004. Between May 2004 and July 2005, the bulk lumber invoices, which were sent monthly, averaged $52,409, but there were no purchase orders or delivery tickets backing up the alleged sale. The Complaint alleged that Hardey, DeBlanc and Penland devised this scheme to provide Quality Mat with funds to continue making payments on this note, thus allowing Newpark to keep the debt on its books., See also: <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21137.htm>L.R. 21137</a> (July 16, 2009).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21236.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The Indictment alleged that in reality, Richman did not have cancer. Rather, according to the Indictment, he falsely claimed to be terminally ill in order to avoid discovery and a scheduled trial in the SECs case against him and to obtain a favorable settlement. The Indictment alleged that, to perpetuate his lie, Richman provided the Court with false affidavits and fabricated letters from a physician., Previously, in September 2005, the Commission filed an enforcement action against Biopure, Richman and three other executives alleging that beginning in April 2003, Biopure received negative information from the FDA regarding its efforts to obtain FDA approval of its synthetic blood product Hemopure but failed to disclose the information, or falsely described it as positive developments in its filings with the Commission., After Richmans lie was revealed, the Commission reached a settlement of its case with him, and the Court entered a final judgment by consent against Richman on August 6, 2008 permanently enjoining Richman from violating the antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws, permanently barring Richman from serving as an officer or director of any public company and ordering him to pay a $150,000 civil penalty.

DOCX executives asked Xie to compile information about DOCX’s source code and other documents in anticipation of the meeting with EMC.  Xie also worked on the project with a due diligence firm hired by EMC., On December 7, 2007 at a meeting between EMC and DOCX employees in Oakland, Xie made a presentation and answered related questions.  After the meeting, Xie asked his DOCX supervisor what would happen if someone were to buy DOCX shares in a time period when they thought something was going to happen to that company.  Xie’s supervisor told Xie that would be a bad thing to do, that it could be traced, and that it was prohibited and illegal.  As late as December 19, 2007, Xie continued to work with EMC and EMC’s due diligence firm., Xie began acquiring shares of DOCX common stock prior to the December 7th meeting, while preparing due diligence materials for EMC.  These initial purchases of 6,892 shares were made at prices ranging from $8.39 to $8.68.

The complaint alleges that Cho falsely represented to investors that he would pool their funds to invest in shares of specific well-known companies in anticipation of expected initial public offerings of those companies, including Centerpoint, AOL/Time Warner, Inc., Google, Inc., Facebook, Inc. and Rosetta Stone, Inc.  The complaint alleges that, instead of purchasing these shares for investors, Cho used investor funds for personal trading, the personal expenses of himself and his family, and also operated a Ponzi scheme, using new investor funds to repay existing investors.  The complaint alleges that throughout the scheme, Cho falsely told investors that he had worked at Goldman Sachs, still had an account there and made his investments through the firm, and/or that Goldman Sachs still considered him a preferred client.  The complaint further alleges that Cho told some investors that additional funds would be needed to satisfy a U.S. tax liability in connection with their supposed purchase of Google and Rosetta Stone shares, when there was no tax liability and when the shares had not even been purchased for the investors., In an order dated October 7, 2009, the Honorable Judge James F.

Cal.)</h2>, <h2>Operator of Mx Factors Sentenced to 100 Years for Orchestrating Multi-Million Dollar Ponzi Scheme </h2>]","[The Securities &amp; Exchange Commission announced today that on September 28, 2009 United States District Judge Virginia A. Phillips sentenced Richard M. Harkless, 65, of Riverside, California to 100 years in federal prison.  Harkless was convicted in July of three counts of mail fraud, three counts of wire fraud, and one count of money laundering.  According to the United States Attorneys Office, Harklesss sentence is believed to be the longest ever imposed in a white collar crime in the Central District of California., Harkless was charged by the United States Attorneys Office for the Central District of California with orchestrating a multi-million dollar Ponzi scheme between 2000 and late 2003.  Harkless and his sales agents fraudulently induced investors nationwide to invest in Mx Factors notes, which purportedly paid a guaranteed return of up to 14% every two to three months.  Mx Factors claimed that it would use the investor funds to provide its clients - construction contractors, wholesalers, and manufacturers - with accounts receivable financing.  Instead, Harkless operated a Ponzi scheme and skimmed investor funds to finance a Mexican crab fishing business, pay personal expenses, and fund overseas bank accounts.  In February 2004, the Commission obtained a restraining order against Harkless, Mx Factors, and the sales agents, and federal criminal authorities executed search warrants.  Harkless fled to Mexico shortly thereafter. Harkless was arrested by special agents with IRS-Criminal Investigation two years ago when he traveled to Phoenix., In a related proceeding, the Commission obtained a final judgment against Harkless on February 6, 2006.  That judgment permanently enjoins Harkless from future securities law violations and orders him to pay over $42 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  The Commission also obtained a judgment by default against Mx Factors and its sales agents BBH Resources and JTL Financial.  Mx Factors, BBH Resources, and JTL Financial have been under the control of a court-appointed receiver since the Commissions action was filed on February 26, 2004 in federal district court in Riverside, California.  And, on June 2, 2006, the Commission obtained a final judgment against Harklesss three sales agents, Daniel Berardi, Jr., Thomas Hawkesworth, and Randall W. Harding ordering disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  The judgment orders Berardi and Hawkesworth, managing members of BBH Resources, LLC, to pay over $11 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  The judgment orders Harding, managing member of JTL Financial Group, LLC, to pay over $17 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Berardi, Hawkesworth, and Harding received sentences of up to six years as part of the criminal proceeding., This case is the product of an investigation by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, the United States Attorneys Office for the Central District of California, the United States Postal Inspection Service, the IRS-Criminal Investigation, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation., For information about earlier developments in this matter, see Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18599.htm>18599</a> (Feb. 27, 2004) (complaint and temporary restraining order), Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18619.htm>18619</a> (Mar. 11, 2004) (preliminary injunction), Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18779.htm>18779</a> (Jul. 12, 2004) (civil contempt), and Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19726.htm>19726</a> (June 13, 2006) (final judgments).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21242.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Loisel, Roger L. Shoss, and Jason C.  Wong, Birte Boock, and 1621566 Ontario, Inc.</i>, Civil Action No. 09 CV 8261 (S.D.N.Y) (DLC)</h2>, <h2>SEC Charges Five With Dozens of Fraudulent Corporate Hijackings and Unregistered Offerings of Securities and Names Two Relief Defendants</h2>]","[On September 29, 2009, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil injunctive action against Irwin Boock, Stanton B. J. DeFreitas, and Jason C. Wong, all of Ontario, Canada, and two Houston-based attorneys, Roger L. Shoss and Nicolette D. Loisel, charging them with having violated the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws by effecting dozens of corporate hijackings and making unregistered offerings and sales of shares.  The complaint also names as relief defendants Boocks wife, Birte Boock, and a company of which she allegedly was the sole officer and director during the relevant period, 1621566 Ontario, Inc., The Commissions complaint alleges that the hijackings were effected by identifying inactive or defunct publicly-traded corporations which were no longer operating and either illicitly revivifying the corporations by falsely representing that the defendants were duly authorized officers, directors, or agents of the corporations or by incorporating new corporations using the names of the void corporation. Once an inactive corporation was revivified or a new corporation formed, the complaint alleges that the defendants immediately effected a name change in the corporation and requested from third parties responsible for assigning unique identifiers to each class of securities issued by a publicly-traded corporation a new identifying number known as a CUSIP number and ticker symbol.  According to the complaint, these identifiers were obtained by falsely representing that the companies seeking new CUSIPs and ticker symbols were the same companies to which CUSIP numbers and ticker symbols had previously been issued and that the name changes triggering the need for new identifiers were duly authorized corporate actions., The complaint alleges that Boock recruited Shoss and Loisel in late 2003 to handle the paperwork required to effect hijackings, including submitting false documentation to Secretaries of State, the Standard &amp; Poors CUSIP Service Bureau, transfer agents, and Nasdaq Corporate Data Operations which, during the relevant period, processed requests for ticker symbols.  The complaint further alleges that from November 2003 through March 2006, Boock, Shoss, and Loisel effected at least 22 corporate hijackings. From November 2003 through June 2007, Boock, Wong, and DeFreitas allegedly effected at least another 21 corporate hijackings., With respect to at least 19 of those corporations hijacked with Shoss and Loisels involvement, the complaint alleges that Shoss and Loisel were tasked to provide 28 opinion letters falsely representing that offerings of approximately 223 million shares were exempt from the registration requirements of the federal securities laws.  The complaint alleges that Boock dispensed with the need for obtaining legal opinion letters concerning the issuance of shares by the 21 hijacking corporations involving Wong and DeFreitas by incorporating his own transfer agency, Select American Transfer Company, which Wong and DeFreitas operated.  With respect to these 21 companies, the complaint further alleges that the three men effected the unregistered offerings of up to seven billion shares., The complaint also alleges that DeFreitas effected unregistered sales in the securities of at least 30 of the hijacked or hijacking entities, generating at least $2.2 million in illicit proceeds.  Boock allegedly effected unregistered sales of securities in at least five of the hijacked or hijacking entities, generating at least $267,625 in illicit proceeds.  Wong allegedly effected unregistered sales of securities in at least 11 of the hijacked or hijacking entities., The complaint alleges that each of the defendant received illicit proceeds in the form of remuneration for services, proceeds from the sale of the shell companies to buyers, and/or from the sale of shares in purported private placements or into the secondary market., Based on the foregoing, the Commissions complaint alleges that the five defendants violated Sections 5(a) and (c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint further alleges that Boock violated a penny stock bar instituted against him in 2002 in a settled administrative proceeding (see In the Matter of Birte Boock and Irwin Boock, Admin. Proc. File No. 3-10960 (Ex. Act Rel. No. 46952)), thereby violating Exchange Act Section 15(b)(6)(B)(i).  With respect to each of the five defendants, the Commission is seeking a permanent injunction, a judicial penny stock bar, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  The Commission is also seeking officer and director bars against Boock and Wong., On September 23, 2009, the Commission issued an order suspending trading in the securities of 17 of the above-mentioned issuers pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(k).  See Ex. Act Rel. No. 60707.  The Commission previously instituted a trading suspension on March 13, 2008 with respect 26 issuers, 11 of which are identified in the Commissions complaint as having been newly incorporated by Boock, Shoss and Loisel and used in the scheme.

No. 07 CV 1774 (S.D.N.Y.), an insider trading case the Commission filed on March 1, 2007.  The Commission’s complaint alleged illegal insider trading in connection with two related schemes in which Wall Street professionals serially traded on material, nonpublic information tipped by insiders at UBS Securities LLC (“UBS”) and Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., Inc. (“Morgan Stanley”), in exchange for cash kickbacks., The Commission’s complaint alleged that from 2001 through 2006, Mitchel S. Guttenberg, an executive director in the equity research department of UBS, illegally tipped material, nonpublic information concerning upcoming UBS analyst upgrades and downgrades to two Wall Street traders, Franklin and Tavdy, in exchange for sharing in the illicit profits from their trading on that information.  The complaint also alleged that Franklin was a downstream tippee in another scheme in which, in 2005 and 2006, Randi Collotta, an attorney who worked in the global compliance department of Morgan Stanley, illegally tipped material, nonpublic information concerning upcoming corporate acquisitions involving Morgan Stanley’s investment banking clients.  , The complaint alleged that Franklin illegally traded on the inside information for two hedge funds he managed, Lyford Cay Capital, LP and Q Capital, and in his personal accounts.  Tavdy illegally traded on the inside information (i) for Andover Brokerage, LLC and Assent LLC, registered broker-dealers where Tavdy was a proprietary trader, (ii) in his own personal account, (iii) in the accounts of a relative and friend, and (iv) in the accounts of Jasper Capital LLC, a day-trading firm with which Tavdy was associated.  Franklin and Tavdy also had downstream tippees who traded on the inside information.

Sentencing on this charge, which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years and a fine of $250,000, will be held on a later date. The U.S. Attorneys Office for the District of Minneapolis had filed criminal charges against Bell on July 10, 2009., Bell is one of the defendants in a pending civil injunctive action filed by the Commission on July 8, 2009 in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota. The Commissions Complaint charges another defendant, Minnesota businessman Thomas Petters, with fraud for perpetrating a massive Ponzi scheme from 1995 to September 2008 through the sale of notes related to consumer electronics. In 2001 Bell formed an investment company Lancelot Investment Management, LLC, also a defendant in the Commissions lawsuit. From 2002 to 2008 Bell and his investment company raised over $2.62 billion from hundreds of investors through the sale of interests in hedge funds they managed. The Commissions Complaint alleges that Bell in turn invested almost all of these assets in notes sold by Petters, falsely assuring investors that he was taking steps to protect their money and to verify the underlying transactions. The Complaint alleges that when Petterss scheme began to unravel, Bell participated in a series of sham transactions to conceal that Petters owed more than $130 million in investor payments on the notes. Bell and Lancelot Management also withdrew more than $40 million in fees from the hedge funds during the final months before Petterss scheme collapsed. On July 24, 2009 the Court entered a Preliminary Injunction that, among other things, froze all assets of Lancelot Management, Bell and Bells wife, who is a relief defendant, and required an accounting of their assets and liabilities including all funds and assets received from Petterss notes and/or the hedge funds., On October 9, 2009 the Commissions action was stayed pending the conclusion of Bells sentencing and the outcome of the trial in the U.S. Attorneys criminal suit against Thomas Petters.

(Jamdat), a software company that designed games for cell phones, and four individuals for tipping and trading in Jamdat stock prior to an announcement that Jamdat would be acquired by Electronic Arts, Inc. (EA)., The Commissions complaints allege that throughout the fall of 2005, Benjamin Jones (Ben Jones), a former vice president of sales at Jamdat, was apprised of the status of Jamdats merger discussions, and that he tipped several friends and his brother, William Jones, III (Bill Jones), who in turn bought Jamdat stock. According to the complaints, Bill Jones also tipped the information to his friend, William Dailey, III, a former securities trader, and Dailey bought Jamdat stock for his own account based on that tip.

Slowey, Jr.; Endeavor Partners, LLC; Endeavor Capital Management Group, LLC; Edward D. Puttick, Sr.; and Advanced Planning Securities, Inc. with violations of the antifraud provisions of the securities laws in connection with the sale of unregistered securities representing interests in four real estate funds to investors, many of whom were unsophisticated retirees and senior citizens. The SEC also charged the above defendants, along with two brokers, Gregory L. Oldham and Glenn R. Harris and their company Oldham Harris Inc., with violations of the registration provisions of the securities laws., According to the SECs complaint, the securities fraud was orchestrated by Charles C. Slowey, Jr., 65, of Oak Beach, NY, and two companies controlled by Slowey, Endeavor Partners, LLC and Endeavor Capital Management Group, LLC. The SEC alleges that the four real estate funds were managed by Endeavor Partners or Endeavor Capital Management Group. The SEC alleges that these three defendants made misrepresentations to investors who invested approximately $12 million in the funds, and, further, that these defendants misappropriated investor proceeds. The SEC also alleges that Advanced Planning Securities, Inc. (APS) a formerly registered broker-dealer firm in Smithtown, N.Y., and its former president Edward D. Puttick, Sr., 70, of Setauket, New York, failed to conduct sufficient due diligence prior to authorizing brokers to sell interests in the funds to investors, including unsophisticated senior citizens. Finally, the SEC alleges that these defendants; the brokers, Gregory L. Oldham, 59, of Kenosha, Wisconsin, and Glenn R. Harris, 34, of Santa Rosa, California; and Oldham Harris Inc. (OHI) violated the registration provisions of the securities laws., According to the SECs complaint, Oldham, Harris, and OHI solicited investors by means of invitations to free lunch or dinner seminars at restaurants. On several occasions, Slowey joined Oldham and Harris at the gatherings to help them make sales of Endeavor Securities to potential investors at the seminars or in meetings at the OHI office scheduled shortly afterwards. Many of the investors to whom Oldham, Harris, and OHI sold these investments were elderly and of limited means and few had previously invested in private placement securities or securities based on distressed or subprime mortgages., The SEC alleges that when the funds began to have increasing financial difficulties, Slowey continued to make false statements to investors. For example, told one senior investor in Florida in mid-2006 that his investment was safe, when in fact the funds had little money left by that time. Slowey told another senior investor in January 2007 that the funds would recover by the following year, and he had no basis for making that statement. In June, July, and November 2006, Slowey asked investors to reinvest their maturing interest in the Endeavor Funds even though he knew that the funds had lost substantial sums of money, and owned only a handful of properties worth far less than the $10 million initially deposited by investors., The SECs complaint alleges that Puttick and APS failed to conduct sufficient due diligence into the private placement securities they were selling and failed to resolve numerous red flags concerning Slowey and the funds, and, as a result, violated the implicit representation that all brokers make to their customers that there is an adequate basis for recommending an investment. Puttick and APS also failed to disclose to investors their lack of due diligence., The SEC further alleges that the defendants violated the registration provisions of the securities laws by selling fund securities for which there was no registration statement in effect. Many of the customers were elderly, unsophisticated investors who could not have been expected to understand the risks associated with the funds investments in distressed mortgages and other real-estate plays., The SECs complaint charges each of the defendants with violations of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933. Further, the SECs complaint charges Slowey, the Management Companies, Puttick, and APS with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SECs complaint seeks a final judgment permanently enjoining the defendants (except APS) from future violations of the above provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to disgorge their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest on a joint and several basis, and ordering them to pay financial penalties., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2009/comp21258.pdf>SEC Complaint</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21258.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Ballas created and then distributed fake press releases purporting to announce good news regarding the companies, including that Google was buying one company at a substantial premium. Ballas then posed as an investor on Internet message boards, touting the announcements he had fabricated. In one instance, Ballas scheme caused the stock price to increase by over 75 percent within a few hours of the issuance of his phony press release. Among other relief, the SEC is seeking an emergency court order to enjoin Ballas from further fraudulent activity., The Commissions complaint, filed in federal court in San Jose, Calif., and documents filed in support of the requested emergency relief, alleges:, On September 29, 2009, Ballas issued a phony press release announcing that Pennsylvania biotech company Discovery Laboratories had obtained approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for a drug under development. Ballas then posted a message on a stock message board with a link to what he described as the companys official press release. In his post, Ballas claimed to have called his personal broker who says its been confirmed. Discovery Laboratories stock price shot up nearly 50%., The next day, September 30, Ballas issued a release falsely claiming that IMAX Corporation had been acquired by Disney. Once again he followed up by posting links to the phony release on a stock message board, telling other potential investors that he had bought 10,000 IMAX shares and that his broker just called me to tell me at the crack of dawn., Ballas continued his scheme on October 1, issuing a phony press release stating that California search engine company Local.com was being acquired by Microsoft. Ballas followed this by again posting messages and links to the Local.com release on stock message boards. In one posting he stated: Local just bought out by Microsoft, at $12.50 per share including patent ownership. In aftermarket trading, Local.coms stock price rose over 75%., Later that night, Local.com issued a corrective release saying that the Microsoft release had been false — there was no Microsoft acquisition. Undeterred, the next day Ballas issued another phony release, this time stating that it was Google, and not Microsoft, that was acquiring the company., The SEC further alleges that for at least one of the stocks he touted, Ballas purchased shares of the company immediately before disseminating the phony press release he had drafted., In its federal court action against Ballas, the SEC alleges Ballas violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC seeks an ex parte temporary restraining order, a preliminary and permanent injunction, expedited discovery, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against Ballas., The Commission appreciates the significant assistance of FINRA, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.

Spaugy, the former Vice President of Financial Services at SemGroup, LP (SemGroup), engaged in insider trading in the securities of then Nasdaq-listed SemGroup Energy Partners, LP (SGLP). At the time of Spaugys trading, SemGroup was SGLPs parent company and its largest source of revenue., According to the Commissions complaint, between late May 2008 and the morning of July 15, 2008, and in the course of his employment at SemGroup, Spaugy learned that SemGroup was in a liquidity crisis driven by massive margin calls from its wrong-way bets in the commodities and futures markets. In particular, the complaint alleges that, shortly before liquidating his SGLP holdings, Spaugy: (1) received, via email, 111 margin calls for SemGroup from six futures commission merchants totaling over $570 million; (2) knew that certain SemGroup customers and trading partners were reducing/terminating their trade and credit lines with the company; and (3) was notified by SemGroups commercial bank that a primary corporate account was overdrawn by over $4 million., The complaint further alleges that, after learning this material nonpublic information, on July 15 and 16, 2008, Spaugy liquidated 4,500 SGLP units, at an average price of $23.28 per unit. According to the complaint, by secretly trading on the nonpublic information, Spaugy breached a duty of trust and confidence he owed to his employer, SemGroup., On July 17, after the close of trading, SGLP announced that SemGroup was experiencing liquidity issues and was considering bankruptcy. On July 18, SGLPs unit price closed at $8.30 per unit, 64.35% lower than Spaugys average sale price. According to the complaint, by liquidating his SGLP holdings on July 15 and 16, Spaugy avoided losses of $67,424., Spaugy has consented, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, to a permanent injunction against future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and to pay disgorgement of the $67,424 loss he avoided by his illegal trading, plus prejudgment interest of $3,378.13, and a civil penalty of $67,424., The staffs investigation is ongoing., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2009/comp21260.pdf>SEC Complaint</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21260.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Grmovsek used inside information funneled to him by his former law school classmate Gil I. Cornblum to trade on U.S. exchanges through foreign accounts.  Approximately $8.5 million of the illegal profit was attributable to trading on U.S. markets, and the illegal trading occurred from 1994 to 1998 and then again from 2004 to 2008.  Grmovsek traded in advance of as many as 40 public announcements of merger and acquisition transactions using non-public information that Cornblum (deceased) learned through his work as an attorney with major law firms, including Dorsey &amp; Whitney LLP and Sullivan &amp; Cromwell LLP., According to the SECs complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, the scheme involved trading in both U.S. and Canadian markets.  Grmovsek used the inside information to make illicit trades through numerous Canadian accounts held in his own name and in the names of his friends and relatives, as well as through offshore accounts., The SECs complaint charges that Grmovsek violated the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including specific provisions that prohibit trading while in possession of material, non-public information about tender offers.

The Court also appointed Soneet Kapila as Receiver over Amante, Commonwealth, and the relief defendants., The Commissions complaint alleges that, from at least at least May 2008 to the present, Amante, Commonwealth, Denigris, and Dyer raised at least $2.3 million from investors by offering and selling Amante common stock in unregistered transactions. According to the complaint, defendants told investors that an initial public offering (IPO) of Amantes stock was imminent, and that once the stock began trading publicly, the price per share could increase as much as one hundred times. These claims were false or misleading because Amante had not filed a registration statement or conducted any other necessary steps to even begin that process. In addition, there was no basis for the defendants statements about the high returns investors would realize on their investment in Amante stock because those statements were predicated on a fictitious IPO and Amante has no current or future business prospects to support such an increase in its stock price. The complaint also alleges that Commonwealth, Denigris, and Dyer acted as unregistered broker-dealers in selling Amante shares to investors. Moreover, Denigris misappropriated the majority of investor funds both by making large, undisclosed transfers to himself for personal expenses and transferring money to individuals working at Commonwealth., The Commissions complaint alleges that Amante, Commonwealth, and Denigris violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; that Amante and Denigris violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act; and that Commonwealth, Denigris, and Dyer violated Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act.

Calif.)(Oct. 30, 2009)</h2>, <h2>SEC Charges Former CFO and Six Relatives and Friends in California-Based Insider Trading Ring</h2>]","[On October 30, 2009, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California charging the former chief financial officer of a San Francisco private investment firm and six of his relatives and friends with insider trading, alleging that their scheme collectively reaped more than $8 million in illicit profits from unlawful trades in the securities of Tempur-pedic International, Inc. and Acxiom Corporation., The SEC alleges that Chen Tang of Fremont, Calif., learned non-public information as the CFO of a private equity fund and from illegal tips by his brother-in-law, who was the CFO of a venture capital fund. Tang and his trading partners, which included his brother and four friends, traded on the inside information through their personal brokerage and retirement accounts, the accounts of their spouses, children and relatives, and the accounts of several privately-offered investment funds that Tang and three of his friends managed., The complaint alleges that Tang learned confidential information in 2008 about an impending surprise pre-announcement that Tempur would not meet its earnings forecast. Tang illegally tipped the information to three of his friends — Joseph Seto of San Francisco, Ming Siu of Hayward, Calif., and Zisen Yu of Fremont. Tang and his friends began establishing short positions in Tempur securities and purchasing put option contracts that would only be profitable to the traders if Tempurs stock price declined. When Tempur made its pre-announcement, its stock price declined 37 percent and the traders closed all their short positions, garnering illegal profits of approximately $1.2 million., The SEC alleges that Tang also became aware of plans by his firm to make a large, market-moving purchase of Tempur securities in the days following the pre-announcement. Based on this inside information, Tang and his friends purchased Tempur securities just before and during the transaction. On the same day that the firm completed its acquisitions of Tempur stock, Tang and his trading partners began selling their Tempur stock holdings. During the two-day period of the firms stock purchases, Tempurs stock price increased approximately 18 percent. When they closed their positions, Tang and his friends obtained illegal profits of more than $800,000. During all relevant periods and at the time he traded, Tang was under express instructions from his firm not to trade Tempur securities., The SEC also alleges that Tang separately received illegal trading tips in 2007 from his brother-in-law Ronald Yee, who also lives in Fremont. In his role as CFO at a venture capital fund, Yee learned that his firm planned to submit a bid to acquire Acxiom. Months later, after Acxiom and his firm had publicly announced a merger agreement, Yee learned that the deal was in jeopardy. As soon as Yee learned about each of these matters, in breach of his duties to the firm, he passed material, non-public information to Tang. Tang then tipped Seto, Siu and Yu as well as his brother James Tang of San Gabriel, Calif., and Yees brother Eddie Yu of Fremont., According to the SECs complaint, Yee did not make any trades himself. But Tang and each of the others bought Acxiom securities based on Yees initial tip about his firms bid, and some of them took short positions in Acxiom based on the later tip that the deal was in jeopardy. Collectively, they realized profits of more than $6 million from their insider trading in Acxiom securities., The complaint alleges that the Defendants violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that Defendants Chen Tang, Ronald Yee, Zisen Yu , Ming Siu, and Joseph Seto violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933. The complaint requests that the court permanently enjoin the Defendants from future violations of the federal securities laws, and order them to disgorge ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest and pay financial penalties. The complaint also names Venture Associates Fund I, Tang Capital Partners, Acceleration Capital Partners, American Pegasus Long Short Fund Segregated Portfolio, Ping Lee Tang, Ka Ling Lee, Yin Lee Ka, Cheung-Ting Ka, Sylvia Tsui, Doi Ping Siu, Yuen-Lai Ma, Leung-Kee Siu, Rosalie Cho, and two minor children of Chen Tang as relief defendants in order to recover ill-gotten gains in their possession., The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Chicago Board Options Exchanges Options Regulatory Surveillance Authority and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2009/comp21271.pdf>SEC Complaint</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21271.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

In April 2008, Lu filed a Form 10-KSB and two Forms 10-KSB/A for CHHLs fiscal year 2007 which improperly included audit reports from CHHLs then-current and former auditors. As alleged in the complaint, Lu knew that neither auditor authorized her to use its audit report in the filings because she had not made necessary corrections to the filings, and because she did not give the auditors the opportunity to review and approve the filings. As a result, the filings fraudulently misrepresented that CHHLs fiscal year 2007 financial statements were audited and that CHHLs auditors certified that the financial statements and related disclosures in the filings fairly presented the financial position of CHHL and its subsidiaries., As further alleged in the complaint, in April and May 2008, Lu filed a Form 8-K and two Forms 8-K/A which fraudulently misrepresented that CHHL dismissed its then-current auditor (who had in fact resigned), and that CHHL and the auditor had no disagreements over matters of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedures. Lu attached to the second Form 8-K/A a fabricated letter purportedly from the dismissed auditor which falsely stated that the auditor agreed with CHHLs misrepresentations. As the complaint alleges, Lu and CHHL repeated all of the above misrepresentations in March and April 2009, when Lu filed a Form 10-K and two Forms 10-K/A for CHHLs fiscal year 2008. Lu again included audit reports from CHHLs two previous auditors despite knowing that neither firm authorized her to use its report., The complaint charges CHHL and Lu with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also charges Lu with aiding and abetting CHHLs violations of Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5.

Stanton, a federal judge in the Southern District of New York, the consents of David G. Friehling and Friehling &amp; Horowitz, CPAS, P.C.

Friehling and F&amp;H consented to the partial judgment without admitting or denying the allegations of the SECs complaint, filed on March 19, 2009.

Madoff Investment Securities LLCs (BMIS) financial statements pursuant to Generally Accepted Auditing Standards (GAAS). F&amp;H also made representations that BMIS financial statements were presented in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and that Friehling reviewed internal controls at BMIS.

The complaint alleges that throughout the scheme, Cho falsely told investors that he had worked at Goldman Sachs, still had an account there and made his investments through the firm, and/or that Goldman Sachs still considered him a preferred client.

The three judgments imposed the following relief, to which each of the three defendants consented without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions complaint:, <b>Kenneth Jaeggi</b>, Symbols Chief Financial Officer, consented to entry of a judgment that requires him to disgorge a total $3,091,539, consisting of $2,274,935 in ill-gotten gains he obtained as a result of the conduct alleged in the complaint and $816,604 in prejudgment interest, and to pay a civil penalty of $250,000.

The judgment settles the SEC’s claims against Treacy in a civil action filed on April 30, 2008, in which the SEC alleged that Treacy engaged in a fraudulent scheme to backdate option grants while he was an officer of Monster.  , The SEC’s complaint alleged that Treacy participated in a scheme that began in 1997 to fraudulently backdate stock options to coincide with the dates of low closing prices for the New York-based company’s common stock.  As a result of this conduct, Monster misrepresented that all stock options were granted at the fair market value of the stock on the date of the award, when that was not the case.  Monster also filed materially misstated financial statements with the SEC in its Forms 10-K and 10-Q that did not recognize compensation expense for the company’s stock option grants, as required by generally accepted accounting principles.

(“NextStep Medical”), NextStep Holdings, Inc. (“NextStep Holdings”), Spectrum Entertainment Group, Inc. (“Spectrum”) and The Ilumina Group, Inc. (“Ilumina”).  In these judgments, the Court ordered each of the relief defendants to disgorge the profits obtained as a result of the conduct alleged in the complaint and to pay prejudgment interest on those amounts.  The Court ordered: NextStep Medical to pay disgorgement of $3,218,517.05 together with prejudgment interest of $122,353.56, for a total of $3,340,870.61; NextStep Holdings to pay disgorgement of $886,694.86 together with prejudgment interest of $25,360.21, for a total of $912,055.07; Spectrum to pay disgorgement of $156,500.00 together with prejudgment interest of $2,091.89, for a total of $158,591.89; and Ilumina to pay disgorgement of $271,700.00 together with prejudgment interest of $6,616.00, for a total of $278,316.00.  , The SEC’s complaint alleges that between at least February 2008 and the present, David J. Hernandez, a Downers Grove, Illinois resident and convicted felon, solicited investors to purchase “guaranteed investment contracts” by making false and misleading statements about his background, the existence of the company that issued the investments, the uses of investor proceeds and the safety of the investments.  The complaint alleges that Hernandez, also doing business as “NextStep Financial Services, Inc.,” sold the “guaranteed investment contracts” in person and through NextStep Financial’s website and claimed that he had an extensive background in banking and business, including having business and law degrees, and that NextStep Financial was a successful company that invested in payday advance stores.  The complaint further alleges that Hernandez told investors that their investments were safe because they were covered by insurance.  According to the complaint, however, Hernandez never received the claimed degrees, his “banking experience” included a prior federal conviction for wire fraud and NextStep Financial was a defunct corporation with no financial services operations other than running this scheme.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Hernandez never invested in the payday advance stores or purchased the insurance that covered investors’ funds and instead used the majority of the investors’ funds to pay existing investors their promised returns and diverted the remaining funds into his other business ventures, including relief defendants NextStep Medical, NextStep Holdings, Spectrum and Ilumina, and for his and his wife’s personal benefit. , The SEC’s civil action against Hernandez and Relief Defendant Gina Hernandez remains pending., See also: <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21085.htm>L.R. 21085</a> (June 15, 2009). ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21279.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

MacFaddin</i>, Case No. cv-09 U/B 2238-S (N.D. Ala., filed November 4, 2009)</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Charles E. LeCroy and Douglas W. MacFaddin, two former directors of J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. with fraud in connection with an unlawful payment scheme which allowed J.P. Morgan Securities to obtain $5 billion in Jefferson County, Alabama municipal bond offerings and swap agreement transactions., The SEC complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama, alleges that between October 2002 and November 2003, LeCroy and MacFaddin directed over $8 million in payments from J.P. Morgan Securities to close friends of Jefferson County commissioners (County commissioners) who either owned or worked at local broker-dealers.  These broker-dealers had no official role and performed few, if any, services on the transactions.  In connection with these payments, according to the SEC’s complaint, the County commissioners voted to select J.P. Morgan Securities as managing underwriter and swap provider for the largest municipal auction rate securities and swap agreement transactions in J.P. Morgan Securities’ history.  , According to the SEC’s complaint, although labeled as payments for work on the transactions, LeCroy and MacFaddin knew that these were sham transactions designed to ensure that County officials selected J.P. Morgan Securities.  LeCroy and MacFaddin referred to the payments in taped telephone conversations as “payoffs,” “the price of doing business” or “giving away free money.”  J.P. Morgan Securities incorporated the costs of these unlawful payments by charging Jefferson County higher interest rates on the swap transactions.      , The SEC further alleges that LeCroy and MacFaddin failed to disclose any of these payments, and the inherent conflicts of interest raised by the payments, either to the County or investors in bond offerings, or to the County in the swap agreements at issue.  This conduct deprived Jefferson County and its investors of objective and impartial bond underwriting processes and swap agreement negotiations.  , The SEC’s complaint charges LeCroy and MacFaddin with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 15B(c)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board Rules G-17 and G-20.  The SEC’s complaint seeks judgments against each defendant providing for permanent injunctions and disgorgement with prejudgment interest.   , In April 2008, the SEC filed a civil action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama against Birmingham, Alabama Mayor Larry Langford (the former president of the Jefferson County commission); William B. Blount, chairman of Blount Parrish &amp; Co, Inc., a broker-dealer based in Montgomery, Alabama; and registered lobbyist Albert LaPierre.  The SECs complaint alleged that while Langford served as president of the County Commission, he accepted more than $156,000 in undisclosed cash and benefits over the course of two years from Blount in exchange for Blount Parrish participating in every Jefferson County municipal bond offering and security-based swap agreement transaction during 2003 and 2004.  Securities and Exchange Commission v. Larry P. Langford, William B. Blount, Blount Parrish &amp; Co., Inc., and Albert W. LaPierre, Case No. Case No. cv-08-B-0761-S (N.D. Ala., filed April 30, 2008).  This case was the SEC’s first enforcement action involving security-based swap agreements., On December 1, 2008, the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama filed criminal charges against Langford, Blount and LaPierre. The 101-count indictment charged Langford, Blount, and LaPierre with, among other charges, conspiracy, bribery, and money laundering in an alleged long-running bribery scheme related to Jefferson County bond transactions and swap agreements.  <i> United States of America v.

On August 18, 2009, Blount pled guilty to conspiracy and bribery and agreed to forfeit $1,000,000.

Cotton, pursuant to Cotton’s Consent.  Cotton is the former chief financial officer and chief operating officer of Lantronix, Inc., an Irvine, California technology company.  Cotton consented to entry of a permanent injunction, disgorgement of $344,976.98 in ill-gotten gains plus pre-judgment interest of $62,629.03, payment of a $120,000 civil penalty, and imposition of a ten-year officer and director bar., The Commission’s complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, California, alleged that Cotton, of Huntington Beach, California, orchestrated a scheme to inflate the company’s revenues and earnings by deliberately sending excessive product to distributors and granting them undisclosed expanded return rights and unusual extended payment terms (a fraudulent practice known as “channel stuffing”).  The complaint further alleged that, as part of the channel stuffing scheme and to prevent imminent product returns, Cotton caused Lantronix to loan funds to a third party to purchase Lantronix product from one of its distributors.  According to the complaint, Lantronix, through Cotton, also engaged in other improper revenue recognition practices, including shipping product that had not been ordered and recognizing revenue on a contingent sale.  , The complaint alleged that as a result of Cotton’s scheme, Lantronix overstated its revenues by up to 21 percent and understated pre-tax losses by up to 98 percent for its second and third quarters of fiscal year 2001, its fiscal year 2001, and the first quarter of fiscal 2002.  Lantronix publicly reported its false financials in periodic reports on Form 10-Q and 10-K and in a registration statement for a public offering of stock in July 2001.  Lantronix subsequently restated its financial results for the relevant periods., The complaint further alleged that Cotton made substantial profits from his scheme through bonuses and through the sale of Lantronix stock at artificially inflated prices., The Commission alleged Cotton violated the antifraud provisions, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; the record-keeping and internal controls provisions, Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1; and the false statements to auditors provision, Rule 13b2-2 of the Exchange Act.  Cotton was also alleged to have aided and abetted Lantronix’s violations of the reporting provisions, Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder; the record-keeping provision, Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act; and the internal controls provision, Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act.  <br/>Previously, on September 27, 2006, the Commission issued a cease-and-desist order against  Lantronix, pursuant to its offer of settlement, ordering it to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder., For further information see <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19850.htm>LR-19850, AAER No. 2487</a> (September 28, 2006); <a href=/litigation/admin/2006/33-8745.pdf>Securities Act Release No. 8745</a>, Exchange Act Release No. 54525, AAER No. 2485 (September 27, 2006); and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17799.htm>LR-17799</a> (October 23, 2002).,  ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21281.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Linden was the former Chief Executive Officer of Merge, a company which provides medical imaging software, hardware, and services, and Veech was its Chief Financial Officer.    , The SEC’s complaint, filed in federal court in Milwaukee, alleges that Linden and Veech helped cause fraudulent accounting practices at Merge which involved the improper recognition of revenue from sales on transactions: (1) which included promises of specified future software enhancements; (2) which included sale contingencies; and (3) in which Merge failed to properly execute contracts and/or failed to properly deliver products in the same fiscal period in which Merge recorded revenue from those transactions.  The SEC’s complaint also alleges that Linden interfered with the audit confirmation process between certain of Merge’s customers and Merge’s outside auditor by instructing, or causing others to instruct, some of Merge’s customers not to disclose side agreements between Merge and the customer.  The SEC also alleges that Merge failed to devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls that could have prevented the fraud.  The SEC also alleges that during the period February through August 2006, during which Merge disclosed its accounting misstatements to the public, Merge’s stock price dropped from $24.50 to $7.30 per share, reflecting a $500 million loss in market capitalization., Merge, Linden, and Veech settled the charges without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC’s complaint.  Under the settlement, Linden and Veech are permanently enjoined from committing future violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and are barred from serving as an officer and director of a public company for five years.  Additionally, Linden will pay $382,193 in disgorgement, $117,807 in prejudgment interest, and a penalty of $90,000, and Veech will pay $180,000 in disgorgement, $50,000 in prejudgment interest, and a $50,000 penalty.  Veech also consented to the entry of an administrative order which suspends him from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant, with a right to reapply after three years.

The jury verdict followed three days of trial before Senior District Judge Joe A. Fish, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, Dallas Division., The SEC sued five defendants -- Robert Wayne Tedder, Joseph Wayne Tedder, Phillip Brian Gunn, Brian Patrick Carr and Gregory Carl Gunn - for illegally trading in Aviall securities ahead of Avialls May 1, 2006 announcement of a merger with The Boeing Company. The complaint alleged that two Aviall employees, Robert Tedder and Brian Carr, learned Avialls impending acquisition by Boeing in the course of their employment at Avialls Dallas headquarters. The complaint alleged that Robert Tedder then tipped his father, Joseph Wayne Tedder, and a business associate, Phillip Gunn with this information. Phillip Gunn thereafter passed this information to his brother, Gregory Gunn., Only Gregory Gunn went to trial. The other four defendants offered to settle before trial. The Court severed the claims against Gregory Gunn so that the Commission could proceed against him., At trial, the Commission established that, between April 17 and April 28, 2006, Gregory Gunn liquidated his account of blue-chip stocks and purchased shares of Aviall common stock and Aviall call option contracts while in possession of non-public information about Boeings acquisition of Aviall. On the day of the merger announcement, Avialls common stock closing price of $46.96 was nearly 25% higher than the preceding days closing price of $37.70. Gregory Gunn sold all his Aviall securities on the day of the merger announcement. As a result of his unlawful trading in Aviall common stock and call options, Gregory Gunn reaped illicit profits of $108,587.87., The Commission thanks the Philadelphia Stock Exchange for its cooperation in this matter., For more information, see the original litigation release announcing the filing of the complaint:, <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20623.htm>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20623.htm</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21286.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

AND TWO FORMER SENIOR OFFICERS IN EARNINGS MANAGEMENT AND OPTIONS BACKDATING SCHEMES</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a civil injunctive action against SafeNet, Inc., its former Chief Executive Officer, Anthony Caputo, its former Chief Financial Officer, Kenneth Mueller, and three former SafeNet accountants, Clinton Ronald Greenman, John Wilroy, and Gregory Pasko. The complaint filed in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia alleges that, during the period from the fourth quarter of 2000 through May 2006, SafeNet engaged in two fraudulent schemes — one involving the backdating of options and the other earnings management. Each scheme resulted in SafeNet materially misstating its financial results and disseminating materially false and misleading information concerning its financial condition. According to the complaint, Mueller and Caputo were involved in both schemes, while Greenman, Wilroy and Pasko were involved only in the earnings management scheme. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, except as to jurisdiction, all of the defendants have agreed to settle the action on the terms described below., This is the first enforcement action brought by the Commission pursuant to Regulation G. Regulation G applies whenever a company subject to the periodic reporting requirements under Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act of 1934, or a person acting on the companys behalf, discloses publicly any material information that includes a non-GAAP financial measure. Non-GAAP financial measures, which are not calculated in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, often exclude non-recurring, infrequent, or unusual expenses. Regulation G requires companies to reconcile the non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Regulation G also prohibits companies and their employees from disseminating false or misleading non-GAAP financial measures or presenting the non-GAAP financial measures in such a manner that they mislead investors or obscure the companys GAAP results. The complaint alleges that:, From the third quarter of 2004 through the second quarter of 2005, SafeNet, through the actions of Mueller, Caputo, Greenman, Wilroy (after the third quarter of 2004), and Pasko, engaged in a scheme to meet or exceed quarterly earnings per share (EPS) targets through the use of improper accounting adjustments., During the relevant period, Caputo and Mueller were aware that SafeNet would be unable to meet its earnings targets through normal business operations, and in response, took actions to ensure that SafeNet would meet its earnings targets., At Muellers direction, Greenman, Wilroy, and Pasko, made, or caused others to make, improper accounting adjustments to various expenses including the improper classification of ordinary operating expenses as non-recurring integration expenses (costs incurred to integrate acquired companies into current operations), and the improper reduction of accruals and reserves., SafeNet, Mueller, and Caputo represented to investors that SafeNets non-GAAP earnings results excluded certain non-recurring expenses, when, in fact, SafeNet had misclassified and excluded a significant amount of recurring, operating expenses from its non-GAAP earnings results, in order to meet or exceed quarterly EPS targets., In the course of the earnings management scheme, Mueller, Caputo, Greenman, Wilroy, and Pasko prepared, reviewed, and/or signed SafeNets materially false and misleading securities filings and press releases., In addition, the complaint alleges that SafeNet, through the actions of three former officers, engaged in a scheme to backdate option grants to senior executives and employees in order to take advantage of low points in the companys stock price, without recording the requisite compensation expense for these option grants. According to the complaint:, The three former officers who participated in the backdating of option grants were Caputo, Mueller, and Carole Argo, a former SafeNet President and CFO, who was convicted in a parallel criminal action and settled with the Commission in 2008., Argo, in consultation with Caputo, looked back and selected historical dates when SafeNets stock price had closed at or near the low for a given period to use as grant dates for SafeNet option grants. By selecting these highly favorable dates and causing options to be granted on dates when they would be in-the-money, Argo and Caputo created opportunities for themselves and others at SafeNet to reap substantial profits., Mueller became SafeNets CFO in June 2004 and after learning of SafeNets backdating practice, Mueller continued the backdating scheme by, among other actions, approving a highly favorable historical date to use as the grant date for option grants to himself and others., During the backdating scheme, Mueller, Caputo, and Argo prepared, reviewed and/or signed SafeNets materially false and misleading securities filings and press releases., Argo, Caputo, and Mueller each benefited from the backdating scheme by receiving significant in-the-money option grants. Caputo and Mueller realized illicit profits of approximately $1.6 million and $80,000, respectively, from the sale of SafeNet stock obtained from the exercise of backdated option grants., All defendants have agreed to settle this matter, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, on the following terms:, SafeNet consented to the entry of a judgment: permanently enjoining it from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5, the rule relating to the use of non-GAAP financial measures of Regulation G, the reporting, books and records and internal controls provisions, Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13, and the proxy solicitation provisions, Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 14a-9; and ordering SafeNet to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000., Mueller consented to the entry of a judgment: (a) permanently enjoining him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, the internal controls and books and records provisions of Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1, the misrepresentations to auditors provision of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-2, the ownership reporting provisions of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 16a-3, the proxy solicitation provisions of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 14a-9, the certification provision of Exchange Act Rule 13a-14, and Regulation G, and from aiding and abetting violations of the reporting, books and records, and internal controls provisions; (b) finding him liable for disgorgement of $78,250 plus prejudgment interest of $21,349, but after taking into account his previous settlement with SafeNet, ordering him to pay $37,000 plus prejudgment interest of $13,561; (c) ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $75,000; and (d) barring him from acting as an officer or director of a public company for a period five years., Caputo consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act, Sections 13(b)(5), 14(a), and 16(a) of the Exchange Act, Exchange Act Rules 13a-14, 13b2-1, 13b2-2, 14a-9, and16a-3, and Regulation G, and from aiding and abetting violations of the reporting, books and records, and internal controls provisions; finding him liable for disgorgement of $1,690,000 plus prejudgment interest of $214,000, but deeming these amounts to be fully satisfied by Caputos previous settlement with SafeNet; and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $250,000., Greenman, Wilroy, and Pasko each consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act and Exchange Act Rules 13b2-1 and 13b2-2, and from aiding and abetting violations of the reporting, books and records, and internal controls provisions. Greenman consented to a judgment finding him liable to pay disgorgement of $45,000 plus prejudgment interest, but based on his sworn financial statements and other documents submitted to the Commission, waiving disgorgement, except for $15,000, and not imposing a civil penalty. Wilroy and Pasko consented to judgments ordering them to pay civil penalties of $25,000 and $15,000 respectively., In addition, Mueller, Greenman, Wilroy, and Pasko each consented to the issuance of administrative orders suspending them from appearing or practicing before the Commission as accountants, with the right to apply for reinstatement after (i) five years for Mueller, (ii) two years for Greenman and Wilroy, and (iii) one year for Pasko., The settlements with SafeNet, Greenman, and Pasko take into account the cooperation with the SECs investigation by SafeNet and these individuals.

Madoff cover up the fraud at Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC (BMIS) for more than 15 years., The SEC alleges that Jerome OHara of Malverne, N.Y., and George Perez of East Brunswick, N.J., provided the technical support necessary to produce false documents and trading records, and took hush money to help keep the scheme going., According to the SECs complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Madoff and his lieutenant Frank DiPascali, Jr., routinely asked OHara and Perez for their help in creating records that, among other things, combined actual positions and activity from BMIS market-making and proprietary trading businesses with the fictional balances maintained in investor accounts. OHara and Perez wrote programs that generated many thousands of pages of fake trade blotters, stock records, Depository Trust Corporation (DTC) reports and other phantom books and records to substantiate nonexistent trading. They assigned file names to many of these programs that began with SPCL, which is short for special., A separate computer internally known as House 17 was used to process BMIS investment advisory account data at the direction of Madoff, DiPascali and others. The SEC alleges that OHara and Perez knew that the House 17 computer was missing a host of functioning programs necessary for actual securities trading and reporting. According to the SECs complaint, they recognized that the trades being entered into House 17 and the account statements and trade confirmations being sent to investors did not reflect actual trades., The SEC alleges that OHara and Perez had a crisis of conscience in 2006 and tried to cover their tracks by attempting to delete approximately 218 of the 225 special programs from the House 17 computer. But they did not delete the monthly backup tapes. OHara and Perez then cashed out hundreds of thousands of dollars each from their personal BMIS accounts before confronting Madoff and refusing to generate any more fabricated books and records., According to OHaras handwritten notes from the encounter, one of them told Madoff, I wont lie any longer. Next time, I say ask Frank, meaning that Madoff should rely on DiPascali alone to create the false data and reports., The SECs complaint alleges that Madoff responded by telling DiPascali to offer OHara and Perez as much money as necessary to keep quiet and not expose the misrepresentations. OHara and Perez considered the offer and demanded a salary increase of nearly 25 percent along with one-time bonuses in late 2006 of more than $60,000 each. They stated to DiPascali at the time that they did not ask for more because a greater amount might appear too suspicious. DiPascali then managed to convince OHara and Perez to modify computer programs so that he and other 17th floor employees could create the necessary reports themselves., This is the SECs latest enforcement action concerning the Madoff fraud since the scheme collapsed last December. The Commission previously charged Madoff and BMIS, DiPascali, and auditors David G. Friehling and Friehling &amp; Horowitz CPAs, P.C. The SEC also charged certain feeders with committing securities fraud through a Ponzi scheme perpetrated on advisory and brokerage customers of BMIS. Madoff, DiPascali and Friehling have all pleaded guilty to criminal charges related to their conduct., The SECs complaint specifically alleges that OHara and Perez aided and abetted violations of Sections 10(b), 15(c) and 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-3, 10b-5 and 17a-3 thereunder, and Sections 204, 206(1) and 206(2) of the Advisers Act and Rule 204-2 thereunder.

Instead, at Kaletas direction, KCM loaned approximately $6.7 million of the offering proceeds to the Relief Defendants DFFS and BizRadio, two financially precarious KCM affiliates who had no reasonable prospect of repaying the loans.

The Commissions complaint alleges that Bancinsurance failed to account properly for more than $2 million of reinsurance claims, and that Sokol-Bancinsurances president at the time-failed to ensure that the Companys principal financial officer or its external auditors were informed of the claims. As a result, the Companys financial condition in its Form 10-K for fiscal year 2003 and its Form 10-Q for the first quarter of fiscal year 2004 was materially misstated. Sokol agreed to pay a $60,000 civil penalty, and both Bancinsurance and Sokol agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws., The complaint alleges: During the period 2001 through 2004, Bancinsurance participated in a bail and immigration bond program (the Program) as a reinsurer. On or before March 11, 2004, shortly before Bancinsurance filed its Form 10-K for the fiscal year 2003, Bancinsurance and Sokol were notified that the Company would receive more than $1 million in reinsurance claims under the Program. Sokol understood, or was reckless in not understanding, that these claims represented 2003 losses and therefore were required to be reflected in Bancinsurances fiscal 2003 financial statements. Sokol failed to ensure that the Companys principal financial officer or its external auditors were informed of the claims. As a result, the claims were not properly recorded in the Companys books and records, which caused Bancinsurances 2003 financial statements to materially understate the Companys expenses and loss reserves., The complaint further alleges: On or about March 25, 2004, Bancinsurance received invoices for more than $1 million in additional claims. Sokol understood, or was reckless in not understanding, that these claims were required to be included in Bancinsurances financial statements filed with its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2004. Sokol again failed to ensure that Bancinsurances principal financial officers or its external auditors were informed of the claims.

McKelvy, for allegedly perpetrating a $30 million Ponzi scheme in which they persuaded more than 300 investors nationwide to participate in purported environmentally-friendly investment opportunities.  Mantria is headquartered in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania, near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where Wragg and Knorr reside.  Speed of Wealth is based in Centennial, Colorado, and Donna McKelvy is a resident of Parker, Colorado.  Wayde McKelvy resides in Sunny Isle Beach, Florida., The Complaint alleges that Wayde and Donna McKelvy, through their Denver-based company Speed of Wealth LLC, as well as Mantria executives Wragg and Knorr, raised funds for numerous Mantria “green” initiatives such as a supposed “carbon negative” housing community in rural Tennessee and a “biochar” charcoal substitute made from organic waste.  The SEC alleges that Mantria’s “green” representations were laced with bogus claims, and investors were falsely promised enormous returns on their investments ranging from 17 percent to “hundreds of percent” annually.  In fact, Mantria’s environmental initiatives have not generated any significant cash, and any returns paid to investors have been funded almost exclusively from other investors’ contributions.  None of the relevant offerings was registered with the Commission, nor were any of the defendants registered as a broker-dealer or associated with a registered broker-dealer., The Complaint claims that, based on this conduct, all of the defendants violated Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The SEC further alleges that Tvia’s former Chief Financial Officer Diane Bjorkstrom of Palo Alto, Calif., also played a role in Tvia’s improper accounting, allowing Tvia to recognize revenue on merchandise shipped to a customer weeks before the customer had agreed to accept it, and failing to act on red flags surrounding Silva’s misconduct., Bjorkstrom agreed to settle the SEC’s charges against her by paying a $20,000 penalty., The SEC’s complaint, filed in federal district court in San Jose, alleges that Silva’s side agreements illegally inflated Tvia’s revenue by approximately $5 million from September 2005 through June 2006.  This caused the company’s quarterly revenue to be consistently overstated, including by as much as 165 percent in one quarter.  The SEC further alleges that in order to divert auditors’ attention from delinquent customer payments, Silva fraudulently applied payments from new customers to old receivables., According to the SEC’s complaint, Silva’s misconduct allowed him to meet his revenue targets at the company.  For his efforts in meeting those targets, Silva received an award of options to buy 70,000 shares of Tvia stock.  Before the fraud was discovered in early 2007, Silva exercised and sold all of his available Tvia options for a profit of $300,000., The SEC’s complaint against Silva charges him with violations of the antifraud, reporting, books and records and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of Silva’s ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a financial penalty.  The SEC also seeks a court order permanently barring Silva from acting as an officer or director of any public issuer., In the settled enforcement action against Bjorkstrom, she consented without admitting or denying the SEC’s allegations to an order requiring her to pay the penalty and banning her from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an accountant for a period of two years.,  ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21302.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Axiaq consented to the entry of the judgment without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions Complaint., The Commissions Complaint, filed on October 7, 2008, alleged fraud in connection with insider trading in the securities of Corte Madera, Calif.-based Restoration Hardware, Inc. According to the SECs complaint, Restoration Hardwares Vice President of Treasury, Ciriaco Eric Rivor of Millbrae, Calif., learned in mid-2007 that the company was about to be acquired by a private equity firm at a substantial premium. Rivor allegedly passed the confidential, non-public information to his friend Emmanuel Axiaq of San Carlos, Calif., and told Emmanuel Axiaq to pass the information to his father, Francis Axiaq. Rivor instructed the Axiaqs to limit the size of their Restoration Hardware stock purchases to prevent detection., Francis Axiaq allegedly ignored Rivors instruction to limit the size of his stock purchases and spent the following weeks amassing nearly 250,000 shares of Restoration Hardware stock. When Restoration Hardware publicly announced the acquisition on November 8, 2007, its stock price soared more than 140 percent and gave Francis Axiaq illicit potential profits of $881,102.

(Homestead) to invest in mobile home park communities. The complaint further alleges that Biddlecome, without ever informing investors, changed the partnerships investment strategy to securities day trading. According to the complaint, Biddlecome transferred $4.5 million of the partnerships moneys and began to trade options, trade on margin, and engage in short sales. The complaint alleges that this risky day trading strategy has resulted in erratic performance, alternating between six figure trading losses to profits in various months; in September and October 2009 alone, the account value declined $1.9 million., The Commissions complaint, which was filed in federal court in Los Angeles, alleges that the defendants falsely claimed that a brokerage firm would sell the partnership interests and an accounting firm would audit the partnerships books yearly. The complaint alleges that, in reality, Biddlecome ever enlisted these third parties to perform such services. In addition, although investors were told distributions would be made quarterly out of net profits and certain investors received distributions, Homestead suffered losses for two years. The complaint also alleges Biddlecome misappropriated partnership moneys to pay for his personal credit card bills., On November 16, 2009, the Honorable Cormac J.

These CyberKey shares were sold under no registration statement and no legitimate exemption from registration. The SEC also charged Big Apple and MJMM with acting as unregistered broker-dealers, and Marc Jablon, Maguire, and Kaley with aiding and abetting the two entities violations in that respect., According to the SECs complaint, the Big Apple executives learned by August 8, 2006, that CyberKeys only significant source of revenue, a supposed $25 million purchase order from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), could not be located by DHS itself and almost certainly did not exist. Despite this knowledge, the Big Apple team continued to promote CyberKey and its business relationship with DHS and sold hundreds of millions of CyberKey shares into the public market. In addition to planning and editing press releases, Big Apple used a telephone calling room of 14 to 50 callers to promote CyberKey stock, including the companys relationship with DHS, to registered brokers. In doing so, Big Apple and MJMM acted as dealers in connection with the distribution of CyberKey stock and as brokers by participating in securities transactions at key points in the chain of distribution of CyberKey shares., The SECs complaint charges each of the defendants with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act).

Khanna, age 32, and his former company, MAK 1 Enterprises Group LLC, both of San Diego, Calif., which operated a phony investment pool scheme. Mohit Khanna and MAK 1, through its Court-appointed receiver, agreed to the entry of the permanent injunctions, which were entered on October 6 and November 3, 2009, respectively. The injunctions permanently enjoin Mohit Khanna and MAK 1 from violating the antifraud and securities registration provisions of the federal securities laws., The Commissions initial complaint, filed August 17, in federal court in San Diego, alleged that Mohit Khanna and MAK 1 claimed to pool investor funds to invest in foreign currency trading products and other guaranteed investments, which the complaint alleged were non-existent. The complaint alleged the defendants engaged in a variety of fraudulent conduct designed to solicit new investors and lull existing investors into believing their money was safe and secure, and that Mohit Khanna and MAK 1 misused investor funds to pay for several luxury cars and residential properties, including those owned by his wife, Sharanjit K. Khanna. The complaint charged Mohit Khanna and MAK 1 with violating the antifraud and securities registration provisions of the federal securities laws and named as a relief defendant another company Mohit Khanna controlled, First Opportunities Management Group, Inc. The Commission filed an amended complaint on September 18, which named Sharanjit Khanna as a defendant and charged her with violations of the antifraud provisions and securities registration provisions., On August 26, the Court issued an order to show cause why Mohit Khanna should not be held in civil contempt for violating the Courts Temporary Restraining Order granted on August 18 based on evidence filed by the Commission and the receiver. The Court ordered Mohit Khanna to show cause why an order of civil contempt should not be issued and why he should not be sanctioned pending his compliance with the TRO. The Court held multiple hearings on the contempt application., On September 3, the Court granted additional relief that the Commission sought, with the consent of Mohit Khanna, including orders freezing the assets of Mohit Khanna and MAK 1, appointing Charles LaBella of LaBella &amp; McNamara, LLP, as permanent receiver over MAK 1, and requiring Mohit Khanna and MAK 1 to repatriate assets from abroad. On October 6, the Court entered an order, with the consent of Sharanjit Khanna, freezing her assets., On October 27, the Commission instituted administrative proceedings against Mohit Khanna barring him from association with a broker or dealer based on the entry of the judgment of permanent injunction against him. Mohit Khanna consented to the entry of the order without admitting or denying the Commissions findings., In addition to the relief already obtained, the Commission seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement, and civil penalties against Sharanjit Khanna, and disgorgement and civil penalties against Mohit Khanna and MAK 1., For further information, see Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21181.htm>21181</a> (August 20, 2009).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21306.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Hashemi, without admitting or denying the Commissions claims, consented to the entry of a final judgment enjoining him from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and directing him to pay a total of $875,000, comprised of disgorgement in the amount of $458,760, $9,620 in prejudgment interest, and a penalty of $406,620., According to the Commissions Complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Hashemi purchased 120,000 shares of Nova common stock through his online brokerage account in the two weeks leading up to the merger announcement. These purchases began to accelerate as the merger date approached, as he made 54 percent of his total purchases on the last trading day before the announcement. Hashemi funded these purchases by liquidating nearly 80 percent of the value of his stock portfolio, and by wiring approximately $100,000 into his trading account.

Ahmed (Ahmed), age 45, of Spring Valley, Calif., and his company, Shidaal Express, Inc. (Shidaal Express), which operates in the San Diego area. The complaint alleges Ahmed formed Shidaal Express to provide check-cashing, money transfer, and other financial services for the Somali immigrant community, and a sign at one storefront location listed Investment Opportunities among the services provided. According to the complaint, Ahmed raised at least $3 million, including $200,000 from a San Diego mosque, by promising exorbitant guaranteed returns of 5% per month, or 60% annually., The Commission charged Ahmed and Shidaal Express with committing securities fraud by making false and misleading statements to persuade people to invest with them. According to the complaint, Ahmed solicited investors through word-of-mouth, at a mosque in San Diego, at a presentation given in a Seattle-Tacoma hotel, and through Shidaal Expresss website. The Commission alleges that Ahmed lured investors by assuring them they could receive their money back at any time. While initially paying investors monthly returns, the complaint alleges Ahmed tried to extract more money from the investors. The complaint alleges Ahmed eventually stopped paying monthly returns but continued lulling investors., The Honorable Jeffrey Miller, United States District Judge, granted the Commissions application for emergency relief and froze the defendants assets.

Nelson, and two other Nelson-controlled entities known as Systems XXI, Act I, LLC (Act I) and Systems XXI, Act II, LLC (Act II). The Commission also named two other entities owned by Nelson, Plouteo, Inc. and Homaide Real Estate Services, Inc. as Relief Defendants., The Commission alleges that beginning in 2008 Nelson offered and sold promissory notes issued by CMHC, Act I, and Act II. The notes were marketed through a website and by a Canada-based investment club. The proceeds were to be used to buy distressed properties. Nelson told investors that after acquiring the properties at a discount, he would improve, rent, and resell them at prices closer to the properties true value, thereby generating the returns promised to investors. The CMHC notes promised 10% per month interest for three months. The Act I and Act II notes that paid 18% per annum for two years (Act I) and 21% per annum for five years (Act II). Nelson promised that 90% of Act I and Act II funds would be used to acquire real estate and to rehabilitate the properties for rental or resale. Nelson further represented that Act I and Act II would loan money to CMHC in exchange for first lien positions on CMHCs properties. Nelson persuaded many of the CMHC noteholders to rollover their CMHC note principal into the Act I and Act II notes because they would be more secure., In fact, the Commission alleges, the proceeds from the notes were not used as promised. Instead, Nelson used a substantial amount of investor funds to pay other investors their interest payments and principal redemptions. In addition, Nelson took more than $3.6 million of investor funds for his personal use, including a million dollars to purchase his home. Although CMHC bought some properties, they typically were subject to existing mortgages; Act I and Act II had, at best, second lien positions. Ultimately, as the flow of new investor funds slowed, Nelson was unable to pay investors, and many of CMHCs properties were foreclosed on., The complaint alleges that CMHC, Nelson, Act I, and Act II offered and sold securities in violation of registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. The complaint requests permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against the Defendants. In addition, the Commission has filed motions asking the Court to freeze CMHCs and Nelsons assets and to appoint a receiver to collect, marshal, manage, and distribute these assets for the benefit of investors.

David K. Donovan, of Massachusetts, was found to have engaged in insider trading in stock of Covad Communications Group, Inc. (Covad). The jury found Donovans co-defendant, David R. Hinkle of Texas, not liable for insider trading., In its complaint, the SEC had alleged that, between July and September 2003, Donovan obtained confidential information on Fidelitys internal order database that Fidelity was purchasing a substantial amount of Covad common stock for its advisory clients. The Commissions complaint alleged that after viewing Fidelitys orders and being denied permission by Fidelity to buy Covad stock in his own personal account, Donovan caused purchases of the stock to be made in early August 2003 in the account of his mother. According to the Commissions complaint, Donovans mother profited after later selling the Covad stock in early September 2003, after the price of Covad stock had increased., The jury heard closing arguments in the seven-day trial on November 19, 2009 and announced its verdict the next day. In rendering its verdict, the jury found that David Donovan engaged in insider trading by knowingly giving to his mother material, nonpublic information concerning Covad stock in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5. Although the jury found that Donovan tipped his mother to inside information about Covad, it did not find that he tipped co-defendant David Hinkle to inside information, and did not find Hinkle liable for insider trading., The Honorable Rya W. Zobel of the United States District for the District of Massachusetts presided over the trial. The SEC filed its complaint on April 16, 2008., Donovan was previously a respondent in unrelated administrative proceedings instituted by the Commission on March 5, 2008, alleging that he and others at Fidelity accepted travel, entertainment, and gifts from brokerage firms that sought and obtained orders for securities transactions on behalf of the Fidelity Funds. Donovan later settled that matter by agreeing to an Order by the Commission issued on December 11, 2008, without admitting or denying the Commissions findings, that Donovan violated Section 17(e)(1) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and ordering him to cease and desist from violating that law, censuring him, and ordering him to pay over $208,000 in disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties., For further information, please see Litigation Release Nos. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20528.htm>20528</a> (April 16, 2008), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19930.htm>19930</a> (December 1, 2006) and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr19983.htm>19983</a> (January 29, 2007).

The court also entered a freeze order against certain assets of relief defendants Clifford and Ellen Berg, who received investor funds from Cook. In addition, Judge Davis issued an order appointing a receiver over all of these assets. The court issued the freeze and receivership orders under seal while the assets were being secured, and the seal has now been lifted., The SEC alleges that from at least July 2006 through at least July 2009, Cook and Kiley, through the Defendant Companies, raised at least $190 million from at least 1,000 investors through the sale of unregistered investments in a purported foreign currency trading venture by misrepresenting that they would deposit each investors funds into a separate account in the investors name to trade in foreign currencies and generate annual returns of 10 percent to 12 percent. They also misrepresented that their foreign currency trading program involved little or no risk and that investors principal would be safe and could be withdrawn at any time. The SEC alleges that Cook and Kiley did not place each investors money into a segregated account in the name of the investor. Instead, they pooled the investors funds in bank and trading accounts in the names of entities that they controlled, including the Defendant and Relief Defendant companies. The SEC alleges that Cook and Kiley misappropriated $42.8 million of investors money, including $18 million that Cook used to buy ownership interests in two trading firms; $12.8 million that Cook and Kiley transferred to Panama to purportedly finance the construction of a casino; $2.8 million that Cook used to acquire the Van Dusen Mansion and $4.8 million that Cook lost through gambling. Cook and Kiley also misspent approximately $51 million to make Ponzi-like payments to earlier investors. The SEC further alleges that Cook and Kiley placed $108 million of investors funds into banking and trading accounts in the names of their various shell companies and used some of this money to trade foreign currencies, resulting in losses of at least $48 million., The SECs complaint charges Cook, Kiley, and the Defendant Companies with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The stock price later plummeted after large insider stock sales, the filing of private securities lawsuits alleging fraud, and the companys public announcement that it would restate its financial statements. Home Solutions then-CEO Frank Fradella, who is among seven individuals charged by the SEC in the scheme, dumped approximately $6.8 million worth of stock into the inflated market., According to the SECs complaint, several different illicit maneuvers were used by Home Solutions at various times between 2004 to 2007 at the direction of Fradella and other executives in order to mislead the public about the companys true financial condition. The SEC alleges that Fradella initiated an expense-deferral scheme to inflate earnings by expensing year-end bonuses when paid rather than when earned. Fradella, Home Solutions CFO Jeff Mattich, and Brian Marshall (who became a Home Solutions director and president of its largest subsidiary, Fireline Restoration Inc., after its acquisition by Home Solutions) together engaged in a series of revenue-inflation schemes, booking millions of dollars of bogus revenue by invoicing and recording receivables on work that never occurred. They also improperly caused millions of dollars of revenue from another public company to be booked as Home Solutions revenue., The SEC further alleges that Marshall engaged in a separate revenue-inflation scheme at Fireline, booking more than $9 million of fake construction revenue from undisclosed, related-party contracts with entities that Marshall controlled. In fact, at the time Fireline caused Home Solutions to record the revenue, very little work had been performed on the projects and most remained bare-dirt lots., The SECs complaint charges Home Solutions, Fradella, Marshall and Mattich with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

DiBella, the former Majority Leader of the Connecticut State Senate, and his consulting firm, North Cove Ventures, L.L.C. DiBella and North Cove had sought to overturn a jury verdict and judgment against them for their involvement in a fraudulent scheme relating to investments by the Connecticut state pension fund. In its decision, the Second Circuit held that there was substantial evidence to support the jury verdict and that the District Court for the District of Connecticut did not abuse its discretion in imposing a judgment requiring DiBella to pay disgorgement and civil penalties., In the underlying civil injunctive action, the SEC had alleged that, in November 1998, Paul J. Silvester, then Treasurer of the State of Connecticut, had requested that Thayer Capital Partners, a Washington, DC-based private equity firm, hire DiBella. Thayer, through its chairman, Frederic V. Malek, agreed to retain DiBella and to pay him a percentage of the state pension funds total investment with Thayer, even though DiBella had no prior involvement with the transaction. The SEC had also alleged that Silvester had increased the amount of the investment with Thayer by at least $25 million (to a total of $75 million) solely to secure a larger fee for DiBella., On May 18, 2007, after a seven-day trial, a jury found DiBella and North Cove liable for aiding and abetting Silvesters intentional violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the negligent violations by Malek, Thayer and its affiliates of Section 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. In her decision of March 13, 2008, Honorable Ellen Bree Burns, United States District Judge, reaffirmed the jurys findings and entered a judgment imposing sanctions against DiBella and North Cove.

In its Complaint, the SEC charges Lund with abusing the gate-keeping responsibility he had as president of Standard Transfer &amp; Trust by improperly distributing restricted stock certificates of Mosaic Nutraceuticals Corp. after fraudulently issuing the certificates without the proper restrictive legends.  He did this as part of a scheme to profit from the sale of Mosaic shares he owned and controlled, and, as a result of his actions, market participants were misled into treating these restricted securities as free trading.  To cover his scheme and reap more than $700,000 in illicit profits, according to the Complaint, Lund falsified transfer agent records and obtained a materially false and misleading attorney opinion letter that was backdated at Lund’s direction in an effort to make his distribution of Mosaic stock appear legitimate.  In addition, according to the Complaint, Lund testified falsely during the SEC’s investigation, claiming that he relied on this opinion letter when he made the distribution.  The Complaint further charges Standard Transfer &amp; Trust from violating multiple regulations governing the conduct of transfer agents and Lund with aiding and abetting those violations.  , The Complaint alleges that Lund violated Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Sections 17(a), 5(a), and 5(c) of Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act).

Judge Wood ordered that Anticevic be permanently enjoined from future violations of the federal securities laws, and found Anticevic liable to pay disgorgement of $2,056,055.15, prejudgment interest of $578,223.25, and civil penalties of $3,084,082.73 (representing one-and-a-half times Anticevics ill-gotten gains)., As alleged in the Fourth Amended Complaint, Anticevic, a retired seamstress who lives in Croatia, is the aunt of co-defendant, David Pajcin, one of the ringleaders of three insider trading schemes. Anticevic gave Pajcin permission to execute trades through two domestic brokerage accounts held in her name, and Pajcin repeatedly did so, while promising Anticevic proceeds from his trading in exchange for use of the accounts., Judge Wood found that Anticevic failed to answer the original Complaint, as well as the Second and Third Amended Complaints. Although Anticevics counsel filed an answer to the Fourth Amended Complaint, he represented to the Court that he had not been able to contact his client for some time. Judge Wood subsequently granted counsels request to be relieved as Anticevics counsel and ordered Anticevic to have a new attorney file a notice of appearance on her behalf by August 31, 2009, noting that in the event she failed to do so, the Court could enter a default judgment.

Without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, all three defendants agreed to settle the matter., The Commissions complaint alleges that, in July and August 2007, as a result of a previously announced review of its stock options practices, Black Box filed quarterly and annual reports restating its net income for fiscal years 1994 through 2006 (the Restatements) by identifying approximately $70.9 million of unrecorded expenses it had incurred as a result of mispriced stock option grants. Black Box was required to, but did not, record an expense for options issued at below-market prices (in the money options). More than one-half of the unrecorded expenses reported in the Restatements, approximately $38.1 million, stem from backdated options awarded at Youngs direction., The complaint alleges that, as Chief Executive Officer, Young had authority for the granting of stock options at Black Box. On six occasions, from 1998 through 2001, Young intentionally backdated stock option grants totaling millions of shares, to hundreds of recipients, including Black Boxs officers, directors, and employees. Young chose dates for these grants from between two weeks to over a year prior to the actual dates such grants were awarded. By doing so, the options were in-the-money in amounts ranging from $3.19 to $43.86 per share on the dates they were actually granted (or 13% to 58% lower than the market price on the actual grant date)., The complaint further alleges that, in or about December 2000, Baird, then Black Boxs Chief Financial Officer and a CPA, also participated in granting backdated options to Black Boxs officers and employees. Baird personally exercised backdated options for $87,243 in excess profits. The complaint further alleges that Young and Baird engaged in their conduct despite knowing, or having reason to know, that the Company had improperly recorded compensation expenses for the options and violated the terms of its own stock option plans as disclosed in various filings with the Commission., Black Box consented to the entry of an order permanently enjoining it from violating Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.

The Court also entered agreed orders (1) appointing a receiver to collect, marshal, manage and distribute Striker’s assets for the benefit of investors and an order to freeze Striker’s assets; and (2) prohibiting document alteration or destruction by Striker. , The Commission’s complaint alleges that from September 2006 through September 2008, Striker raised approximately $57 million from the sale of debentures collateralized through oil and gas properties to approximately 540 investors nationwide.  The Commission further alleges that the debenture offering materials included material misrepresentations and omissions concerning Striker’s earnings and asset valuations, use of investor proceeds, and the existence of a third party independent trustee for the debenture collateral.  , The complaint alleges that the Defendants violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

At the time of the fraud, New Century was one of the largest subprime lenders in the nation.  , The SEC’s complaint names as defendants:, In its complaint, the SEC alleges that New Century disclosures generally sought to assure investors that its business was not at risk and was performing better than its peers.  Defendants, however, failed to disclose important negative information, including dramatic increases in early loan defaults, loan repurchases, and pending loan repurchase requests.  Defendants knew this negative information from numerous internal reports they regularly received, including weekly reports that Morrice ominously entitled “Storm Watch.”  , The complaint also alleges that Dodge and Kenneally fraudulently accounted for expenses related to bad loans that it had to repurchase.  In the face of dramatically increasing loan repurchases and a huge, undisclosed backlog of repurchase demands, Kenneally, with Dodge’s knowledge, made changes to New Century’s accounting for loan repurchases in both the second and third quarters of 2006.  These undisclosed accounting changes violated generally accepted accounting principles and resulted in New Century’s improperly avoiding substantial repurchase expenses and materially overstating its financial results., The complaint further alleges that the defendants’ fraud caused investors substantial losses.  From early 2006 to early 2007, New Century’s stock price ranged from $30.00 to $50.00; and in the second half of 2006, the company raised $142.5 million by selling stock to new investors.  After New Century announced in February 2007 that it would have restate its 2006 financial statements, New Century’s stock price fell 36% to around $19.00.  New Century’s stock price continued to fall, and traded at less than $1 when the company filed for bankruptcy in April 2007.  , The complaint, filed in federal court in the Central District of California, charges the defendants with violations of the antifraud provisions in Section 17(a) of the Securities Act (Morrice and Dodge only) and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; the record-keeping provisions of Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder (Dodge and Kenneally only); the internal control provisions of Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act; the false statements to auditors provisions of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-2; the officer certification provisions of Rule 13a-14 of the Exchange Act (Morrice and Dodge only); the failure to reimburse provisions of Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Morrice and Dodge only); and aiding and abetting New Century’s violations of the reporting provisions in Sections 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder.

Brooks with fraud for systematically selling risky mortgage-backed securities to customers with conservative investment goals.  The fraud cost many Brookstreet investors their savings, homes, or retirement cushions, and eventually caused the firm to collapse.  , The SEC alleges that Brookstreet and Brooks developed an internal program through which the firm’s registered representatives sold particularly risky and illiquid types of Collateralized Mortgage Obligations (“CMOs”) to more than 1,000 seniors, retirees, and others for whom they were unsuitable.  The SEC further alleges that Brookstreet continued to promote and sell risky CMOs to retail investors even after Brooks received numerous indications and personal warnings that these were “dangerous” investments that could become worthless overnight.  One trader even called Brookstreet’s program a “scam.”  Finally, in a last-ditch effort to save Brookstreet from failing during the financial crisis, Brooks directed the unauthorized sale of CMOs from Brookstreet customers’ cash-only accounts, causing substantial investor losses., According to the SEC’s complaint, filed in federal district court in Santa Ana, Calif., Brookstreet customers invested approximately $300 million through the firm’s CMO program between 2004 and 2007.  The SEC alleges that Brooks knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that Brookstreet and its registered representatives were selling unsuitable CMOs to retail customers.  , The SEC’s complaint specifically alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Rockford Group falsely touted itself as a leading private equity firm with an $800 million pipeline of investments and many Fortune 500 companies as clients, and told investors their money would be safely invested in structured settlements in private lawsuits., According to the Commission’s complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Rockford Group does not appear to engage in any investment activity that would generate any returns for investors, let alone its claimed returns of at least 15 percent annually.  Instead, dividend payments made to investors have been funded by other investors’ contributions, and Rockford Group transferred most of the money collected from investors to banks in Latvia and Hong Kong., The Commission alleges that Rockford Group lured investors by promising high returns and falsely assuring investors that it is a member of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) with up to $4 million in insurance to meet customer claims.  According to the Commission’s complaint, however, Rockford Group is not a member of SIPC., Misrepresentations that Rockford Group made to mislead investors, according to the Commission’s complaint, included:, The Commission further alleges that Rockford Group has no structured settlement assets and does not appear to engage in any investment activity that would generate returns for investors.  Besides making dividend payments to investors that are funded by other investors’ contributions, Rockford Group misappropriated more than $10.4 million of investor funds by transferring these funds to foreign bank accounts located in Latvia and Hong Kong to supposedly pay for “cooling systems,” “construction equipment,” “electronic systems,” and other equipment unrelated to the firm’s claimed investment strategies.  According to the Commission’s complaint, the investor funds were wired to foreign bank accounts in the names of twelve entities whose relationship to Rockford is unknown.  The Commission charged those entities as well as Genadi Yagodayev, the president and sole member of Rockford Group and sole signatory on its bank accounts, as relief defendants for the purposes of recovering investor assets from them., The Commission’s complaint charges Rockford with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and seeks an injunction, disgorgement and financial penalties., Judge Gardephe of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, issued an order temporarily restraining the defendant, freezing the assets of Rockford and the relief defendants and ordering accountings from Rockford and the relief defendants.

Drew and Eben D. Miller. Investools agreed to a civil injunction and to pay a $3 million civil penalty. Drew and Miller agreed, respectively, to pay civil penalties of $380,000 and $130,000, and to be enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. Drew and Miller additionally agreed to be enjoined, for five years, from receiving compensation for their participation in, among other related activities, the sale of classes, workshops, or seminars given to actual or prospective securities investors concerning securities trading. In settling the matter, Investools, Drew and Miller neither admitted nor denied the allegations in the Commissions complaint., The Commissions complaint alleges that from 2004 to approximately June 2007 at Investools how-to-trade-securities workshops former Investools employees Drew and Miller misleadingly portrayed themselves as expert investors who made their living trading securities. They did so to mislead investors into believing that they too would make extraordinary profits trading securities if they purchased expensive Investools instructional courses and other products and followed Investools securities trading strategies. The complaint further alleges that in reality, neither Drew nor Miller made the trading profits they claimed. For example, in 2005 and 2006, while Drew was portraying himself as a successful investor, he had hundreds of thousands of dollars in net trading losses. In 2006 and 2007, while Miller was portraying himself as a successful investor, he had tens of thousands of dollars in net trading losses., The complaint also alleges that Investools is liable for the fraudulent conduct of its sales personnel as a controlling person under the federal securities laws. According to the complaint, Investools management learned that sales personnel were claiming that they were successful securities traders. However, Investools did not take the next step-examining workshop speakers brokerage statements to determine whether their success claims were accurate.

The SEC alleges that Santarlas misappropriated from his law firm material, nonpublic information concerning at least two corporate acquisitions involving Ropes &amp; Gray clients — 3Com Corp. and Axcan Pharma Inc., The complaint alleges that Santarlas gained access to material, nonpublic information by, among other means, accessing Ropes &amp; Grays computer network and viewing confidential deal documents. The SEC alleges that, using attorney Jason Goldfarb as a conduit, Santarlas and Cutillo tipped inside information concerning these corporate acquisitions to Zvi Goffer (Zvi), a proprietary trader at Schottenfeld Group, LLC (Schottenfeld). The complaint further alleges that Zvi traded on this information for Schottenfeld, and had numerous downstream tippees who also traded on the information, including other professional traders and portfolio managers at hedge fund advisers.

The Court also entered an order by default on October 30, 2009, against Russo Associates Limited Partnership (Russo Associates), a now defunct limited partnership controlled by Russo. The judgments enjoin Russo, FJR and Russo Associates from future violations of the securities laws. Also, on October 2, 2009, the Commission voluntarily dismissed without prejudice the Commissions case against Eliot Partners (Eliot Partners), also defunct, because it had no status as a legal entity and was merely a d/b/a for Russo., The Commission had filed an emergency enforcement action on June 6, 2006 against Russo, FJR, Russo Associates and Eliot Partners, and obtained a court order freezing Russos assets and the assets of entities he controlled. The Commissions complaint alleged that Russo and FJR convinced at least 160 investors to invest a total of over $15 million in the purported investment vehicles they controlled, Russo Associates and Eliot Partners. The complaint alleged that Russo mislead investors about the nature of the investments and their expected returns. According to the complaint, Russo also diverted at least $11.5 million in investor funds to Veritasiti Corporation, a private California company which Russo co-founded with a college friend., On June 28, 2006, the Commission amended its complaint to name Veritasiti as a relief defendant and obtained a court order freezing its assets. On October 30, 2008, the Court entered a default judgment against Veritasiti, ordering the company to pay disgorgement and pre-judgment interest of $14.1 million., On February 25, 2008, in a parallel criminal proceeding, Russo pled guilty to federal charges of investment fraud and mail fraud. He was sentenced to 18 years in prison to be followed by 3 years of supervised release and ordered to pay $20 million in restitution and a $500,000 fine. Because of those criminal sanctions, the judgments the Commission obtained on December 11, 2009, against Russo and FJR do not include additional monetary relief. The judgments entered against Russo, FJR, and Russo Associates all include injunctions against future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

These victims will receive a total of approximately $3.3 million collected as a result of the SECs enforcement actions in this matter., In three separate enforcement actions, the SEC charged various defendants with engaging in fraudulent schemes in connection with the NewAlliance IPO. The Commissions complaints alleged that (1) first priority for receipt of stock in the IPO was given to depositors of New Haven Savings Bank (the predecessor to NewAlliance) as of June 30, 2002, (2) the IPO offering was oversubscribed, and (3) as a result of the alleged fraud, certain eligible depositors did not receive all the shares they requested. Eligible depositors were thus deprived of the opportunity to purchase a total of 790,000 shares of NewAlliance stock., Pursuant to the Distribution Plan, each Eligible Claimant will receive $4.19 per share for the number of shares of NewAlliance stock they would have received but for the fraud. In calculating the number of shares each Eligible Claimant would have received but for the fraud, the Commission utilized the services of Crowe Horwath (the successor to Crowe Chizek, an accounting and consulting firm retained by NewAlliance at the time of the IPO). Using the allocation formula set forth in the NewAlliance IPO prospectus, Crowe Horwath determined exactly how many of the 790,000 shares at issue would have been received by each of the Eligible Claimants if not for the alleged fraud. Each Eligible Claimant will receive a check for $4.19 multiplied by the number of shares he or she would have received., A fourth SEC enforcement action remains pending in U.S. District Court in Connecticut, <i>SEC v.

It is also alleged that from approximately 2003 to 2005, a manager of a Pride subsidiary in Venezuela authorized the bribery of an official of Venezuelas state-owned oil company in order to secure extensions of three drilling contracts. Benton, in an effort to conceal these payments, redacted references to bribery in an action plan responding to an internal audit report and signed two false certifications in connection with audits and reviews of Prides financial statements denying any knowledge of bribery., The SECs complaint charges Benton with violating Sections 13(b)(5) and 30A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder, and aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 30A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Although one of these entities is in Chapter 7 bankruptcy, Bowens solicitation and lulling efforts are ongoing., The Commission alleges that Bowen, age 57, of Rancho Cucamonga, Calif., solicited investors nationwide through three different unregistered offerings that hyped an imminent public offering in the U.K., embellished his companies assets, and concealed a prior cease and desist order imposed by the Alabama Securities Commission in 2005., The Commissions complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court in Orange County, Calif., alleges that since at least 2003, the defendants have raised $28 million from approximately 500 investors through various offerings, each time promising to invest the funds in different schemes ranging from storage and assisted living facilities to helicopters. According to the complaint, the defendants enticed investors by dangling the prospect of an upcoming initial public offering in the U.K., when they knew full well that no steps had been taken for this purpose. The complaint further alleges that the defendants made baseless predictions about the future price of the stock after the purported public offering. Further, the Commission alleges that Bowen commingled and misused at least $3 million of the investor funds to purchase luxury vehicles and to transfer monies to his other companies. Finally, the complaint alleges that defendants failed to disclose to investors that Bowen and Eagle Storage were subjects of Alabamas cease and desist order involving the unregistered sale of Eagle Storage securities., Acting on the Commissions lawsuit, the Honorable James Selna, United States District Judge for the Central District of California, issued a temporary restraining order against the defendants and issued orders freezing their assets, requiring accountings from them, prohibiting the defendants from destroying documents, and ordering expedited discovery. A hearing on whether a preliminary injunction should be issued against the defendants is scheduled for 1:30 p.m. on December 23, 2009., The Commissions complaint alleges that all of the defendants violated the securities registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Laser,</i> Case No. CV 09-9144 (AHM) (RHx) (C.D. Cal.). </h2>]","[On December 14, 2009, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged two Southern California residents, Dean P. Gross, age 47, residing in Agoura Hills, CA, and Gregory W. Laser, age 46, residing in San Diego, CA, with securities fraud in connection with a Ponzi scheme.  The SEC obtained an emergency court order freezing their assets and halting the scheme.  , The SEC alleges that Gross, doing business as Bridon Entertainment, and Laser raised more than $18 million by promising guaranteed returns on sales of advertising to large, well-known corporations.  Defendants offered both short term (30-90 day) and longer term (one-year) investments.  Typically, promised rates of return on the short term investment ranged from 8% to 30 %, while the year-long investment typically offered a return between 10% and 20%.  In some instances, Gross offered a 40% return. , According to the SEC’s complaint, Gross purported to be an advertising industry veteran with extensive connections which allow him to buy advertising time and space at a discount, and to resell it at a substantial profit to large, well-known corporations.  When Gross offered a short-term investment, he identified a specific well-known corporation he claimed he contracted with to buy advertising.  Gross provided investors a fabricated contract that appeared to be between Bridon and a representative of the well-known corporation.  Gross and Laser told investors that Gross would use their money to purchase advertising time and space, and that their promised returns would be generated by the profitable resale of that advertising to the specifically identified company.  In fact, the contracts provided to investors were fake, and Gross did not have relationships with the well-known companies he claimed were his clients.  Gross did not buy or resell advertising, and investors’ purported returns were not generated by the sale of advertising, but instead came from money raised from subsequent investors, in classic Ponzi fashion.  The SEC’s complaint also alleges that Gross diverted at least $6 million to his personal use., On December 14, 2009, the SEC obtained an order (1) freezing the assets of Gross and Laser; (2) requiring accountings; (3) prohibiting the destruction of documents; and (4) granting expedited discovery; and (5) temporarily enjoining Gross and Laser from future violations of the registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  In addition to this emergency relief, the Commission’s complaint alleges that Gross and Laser violated Section 5(a), Section  5(c) and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  The Commission’s complaint also alleges that Laser violated Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act by acting as an unregistered broker-dealer.

(Dec. 16, 2009)</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against two former employees at major global financial institutions and two of their friends in a serial insider trading scheme to profit on highly confidential merger and acquisition information. , The Commission’s complaint alleges that Vinayak S. Gowrish, a former associate at multi-billion dollar private equity firm TPG Capital L.P., and Adnan S. Zaman, a former vice president and investment banker at Lazard Frères &amp; Co. LLC, stole confidential information from their firms in connection with five deals and tipped two friends - Pascal S. Vaghar and Sameer N. Khoury - in exchange for kickbacks.  Vaghar and Khoury both then traded stock and options on the basis of the nonpublic information and made nearly $500,000 in illicit profits.  Zaman, Vaghar, and Khoury have agreed to settle the charges against them by consenting to the entry of final judgments imposing the relief detailed below, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission’s complaint., According to the SEC’s complaint in the case, the illegal tips, trades, and kickback payments were structured to avoid detection.  They exchanged illegal tips through coded text messages and yellow sticky notes.  Vaghar often wrote checks made payable to himself or cash rather than to Gowrish or Zaman directly so as not to create a paper trail.  Vaghar also gave his credit card to Zaman so he could charge purchases of personal items in stores and on the Internet for himself in Vaghar’s name.  As alleged in the complaint, they also attempted to avoid drawing regulatory scrutiny to their illegal activities by deliberately trading relatively small amounts of the targeted securities.  , According to the SEC’s complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, Gowrish misappropriated and illegally tipped material, nonpublic information that TPG was in negotiations to acquire Sabre Holdings Corp., TXU Corp., and Alliance Data Systems Corp.  Gowrish illegally tipped this information to Zaman, who then tipped the inside information to Vaghar and Khoury.  The SEC further alleges that Zaman misappropriated and illegally tipped material, nonpublic information that Lazard clients were in negotiations to acquire webMethods, Inc. and Myogen, Inc.  Zaman tipped the information to Vaghar and Khoury through in-person meetings or by writing trading instructions – including the ticker symbol of the call option (or stock) and the number of contracts (or shares) to purchase – on yellow sticky notes.  Coded text messages were used to exchange trading instructions.  In exchange for the confidential information, the complaint alleges, Gowrish received cash kickbacks from Vaghar, and Zaman received kickbacks in the form of cash, free rent, and other items of value from Vaghar and Khoury totaling approximately $70,000.  , To settle today’s charges, Zaman, Vaghar, and Sameer Khoury have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Zaman and Vaghar will also be enjoined from violations of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14e-3 thereunder.  , Additionally, Zaman has consented to (i) disgorge $78,456 in ill-gotten gains and prejudgment interest thereon, and (ii) the issuance of an administrative order permanently barring him from associating with any broker or dealer.  The final judgment against Vaghar further imposes $366,001 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest thereon, but waives all but $33,000 of that amount – and does not impose a civil penalty – based on his demonstrated inability to pay.  The final judgment against Sameer Khoury imposes $198,607 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest thereon, but waives payment, and does not impose a civil penalty, based on a demonstrated inability to pay.  Finally, Elias Khoury has consented to the entry of a final judgment ordering him, as a relief defendant, to pay a total of $6,700, consisting of disgorgement of $5,836 and prejudgment interest thereon of $864.  , The Commission is seeking permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of illicit profits with prejudgment interest, and the imposition of financial penalties against Gowrish., The Commission thanks the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. for their cooperation and assistance in connection with this matter.,  ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21339.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Inter Global Technologies, Inc. and Michael E. Tomayko.</i> (U.S.D.C., Northern District of Texas, Dallas Division, Civil Action No. 3:07-CV-1397-K)</h2>]","[On December 10, 2009, the Securities and Exchange Commission obtained an Amended Final Judgment against Defendants Inter Global Technologies, Inc. (“IGT”) and Michael E. Tomayko.  The Amended Judgment adds a conduct-based injunction against Defendants, prohibiting them from offering or selling any securities, including notes, issued by Defendants or any entity owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by Tomayko.  This relief was necessary because the Defendants continued to raise funds from investors using improper means even after being enjoined last year., The SEC originally sued Defendants in August 2007, alleging that they had illegally raised millions of dollars through an unregistered offering of IGT securities to hundreds of investors worldwide.  <i>See</i> Litigation Rel. No. 20244 (August 16, 2007).  The SEC alleged that Defendants made elaborate claims about supposedly lucrative refineries that Defendants and their foreign partners planned to build in Indonesia.  The SEC charged, however, that these claims were false and completely unfounded and that Defendants instead dissipated investor funds to support Tomayko’s international jetsetter lifestyle (and to cover his house payments and other personal expenses), or sent them to mysterious foreign nationals who provided no accountability for the funds.  , Defendants consented to a Final Judgment in May 2008, which permanently enjoined them from committing securities fraud and other violations, and ordered them to pay civil penalties totaling $100,000 and disgorgement with prejudgment interest of more than $10.7 million.  Defendants, however, continued to raise money from investors even after this judgment was entered.  As detailed in the SEC’s Motion to Amend Final Injunction, Defendants raised at least $1.7 million between May 2008 and September 2009, primarily through sales of promissory notes that were often secured by shares of IGT stock.  In raising these funds, Defendants continued to regale investors with supposed developments with the purported refinery projects, which Defendants constantly characterized as being on the verge of success.  , In truth, Defendants used the additional funds primarily to pay Tomayko’s living expenses.  Defendants’ bank and credit card statements revealed that Tomayko spent more than $200,000 of investor funds on such items as house and luxury automobile payments, utilities, lawn and pool maintenance and country club dues.  An additional $43,000 went toward such sundries as restaurant meals, groceries, dry cleaning, car washes and gasoline.  Tomayko also spent more than $36,000 at luxury retailers, and donated $25,000 of investor funds to his church.  There were also $366,000 in cash withdrawals and checks to Tomayko.  Defendants also sent more than $350,000 overseas to IGT’s supposed Indonesian partner and two foreigners who were supposed to provide access to Swiss financing.  Investors, however, have nothing tangible to show for these expenditures since, as the SEC asserts in its Motion, Defendants’ purported plans to build Indonesian refineries are no closer to fruition today than when Defendants first began soliciting investors a decade ago., The additional injunctive relief granted by the Amended Judgment provides a blanket prohibition against Defendants offering or selling any securities issued by them or any company Tomayko owns or controls, regardless of whether the offering is registered or exempt from registration or involves fraud.  Future violations of this or other elements of the Amended Judgment are punishable by civil and criminal contempt.,  ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21340.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The settlements are subject to Court approval., The Commission’s complaint against Dwyer alleges, among other things, that during the relevant time period, Dwyer violated the anti-fraud provisions, and aided and abetted Bally’s violations of the reporting, record-keeping, and internal controls provisions, of the federal securities laws.  The Commission’s complaint against Noncek alleges that Noncek violated various provisions of the federal securities laws.

These materially false and misleading statements portrayed Ballys financial condition (its net worth) and its performance (its income) as being materially better than they actually were during the relevant period. , Dwyer settled the Commission case against him by consenting to permanent injunctions based on his violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5 and his aiding and abetting Bally’s violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13, payment of $250,000, a permanent officer-and-director bar, and a permanent bar from practice before the SEC in a related Rule 102(e) proceeding.

Among other things, the SEC alleges that Jacobson issued stock to family members and companies he controlled, who then resold the stock to the public and funneled the money back to the company. Similarly, the SEC alleges that when a 2003 public offering failed to raise sufficient funds before expiring, Jacobson unlawfully parked nearly 10 million shares with various friends, family members and affiliates so they could be sold at a later date.

Barton, Triton Financial, LLC (Triton), and Triton Acquisition, LP, d/b/a Triton Insurance, LP (Triton Insurance).  The Commission alleges that from July 2008 through December 2009, the Defendants raised $8.4 million from approximately 90 investors in a fraudulent offering of investor units in Triton Insurance.  The Commission further alleges that the defendants lied to investors about the use of offering proceeds and misrepresented Triton Insurances business operations., According to the Complaint, since at least 2004, Triton sponsored more than 40 limited partnerships and limited liability companies, raising over $50 million for these ventures.  The Complaint alleges that Triton used prominent former professional football players, as well as stock brokers and other sales people, to promote its investments.  Barton also actively solicited investors.  The Complaint alleges that beginning in July 2008, Barton and Triton salesmen sold Triton Insurance investor units, telling prospective investors that Triton Insurance would use the money raised to purchase an insurance company.  According to the Commission, the defendants did not use offering proceeds for this purpose but instead misapplied the funds to cover expenses and obligations of Triton and affiliates.  Investors were not told of this misuse of their funds., According to the Complaint, the Texas State Securities Board (TSSB) began examining Triton after an unflattering March 2009 Sports Illustrated article about Tritons business activities.

In addition to freezing approximately $4.2 million in assets, the Courts order: (i) provides for expedited discovery, and (ii) prohibits the defendants from destroying evidence., On December 21, 2009, Chattem, Inc., a company based in Chattanooga, Tennessee, announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by Sanofi-Aventis, a health care company located in France. Chattem manufactures and markets an array of the over-the-counter healthcare products and its shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Under the acquisition agreement, Sanofi agreed to pay $1.9 billion for 100% of Chattems outstanding shares, at a share price of $93.50 per share. According to the complaint, the acquisition share price represents a 32.6% premium above the closing price of $69.98 on the prior trading day, Friday, December 18th., The Commission further alleges that between December 7 and December 18, 2009, Condroyer, while in possession of material, nonpublic information regarding this acquisition, purchased over 1,900 out-of-the-money call option contracts for Chattem stock in a newly-opened account at an options brokerage firm in the United States. Substantially all of those contracts were set to expire on January 15, 2010, within weeks of the purchase date., The Commission similarly alleges that on December 17 and December 18, 2009, Roger, while in possession of material, nonpublic information regarding this acquisition, purchased 940 out-of-the-money call option contracts for Chattem in an account at an options brokerage firm in the United States.

Shindler, Bradley M. James, Rockwell Energy of Texas, LLC (RET), and Rockwell Energy Management, LLC (REM), alleging that they participated in two fraudulent oil-and-gas offerings. According to the complaint, from March 2008 through February 2009, Shindler created and managed two unregistered funds using variations of the name Rockwell Energy. James co-created the second Rockwell Energy fund and co-managed it for a period of several months. Together, the defendants raised $5.5 million from 139 investors based on a multitude of material misrepresentations., In particular, the complaint alleges that Shindler and James, both of Texas, made material misrepresentations and omitted material facts concerning the profitability of the funds, the nature and extent of the investments that the funds had made or intended to make, and the use of investor proceeds. Among other misrepresentations, the offering materials claimed that the funds had existing and prospective investments in oil-and-gas properties, and that investors would immediately start earning and receiving returns of 1.5% per month from production revenue., In reality, according to the complaint, the first fund owned no oil-and-gas properties when it began accepting investors, and the second fund has never acquired any producing oil-and-gas properties. Moreover, even though the oil-and-gas properties that the funds have invested in never generated sufficient production revenue to cover distribution payments to investors at the 1.5% monthly rate, Shindler made the monthly income distributions at the targeted rate for a number of months. To do so, he relied in part on investment income other than production revenue, including payments from sham transactions designed specifically to artificially create the promised returns. The complaint alleges that Shindler also converted some investor funds to personal and other improper uses, and some of the returns he paid investors were made from the principal payments of other investors (<i>i.e.</i>, Ponzi payments)., The complaint alleges that, as a result of their misconduct, Shindler, James, RET, and REM violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

McDonald of Leechburg, Pennsylvania, former President, CEO and Chairman of World Health Alternatives, Inc. (World Health), a now defunct medical staffing company previously located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Commissions complaint alleges that McDonald was the principal architect of a wide-ranging financial fraud at World Health by which McDonald misappropriated approximately $6.4 million for his personal benefit. Also named as defendants are Deanna Seruga of Pittsburgh, the companys former controller and a CPA, Marc D. Roup, of Murrysville, Pennsylvania and Miami, Florida, a former CEO of World Health, and Joseph I. Emas, of Surfside, Florida, World Healths former outside securities counsel. The complaint charges the defendants with violations of the antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws. Without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, all four defendants have agreed to settle the matter. The settlements are pending final approval by the court., The complaint alleges that, from at least May 2003 through August 2005, McDonald, along with Seruga and Roup, engaged in a wide array of fraudulent and improper conduct. A key aspect of the fraud involved the manipulation of World Healths accounting entries. McDonald and Seruga repeatedly falsified accounting entries in World Healths financial books and records, understating expenses and liabilities. This made the Company appear more financially sound, and masked McDonalds misappropriation of funds. During the relevant period, every annual and quarterly report that World Health filed with the Commission contained false financial statements., The complaint further alleges that McDonald caused World Health to make misrepresentations and omissions in documents publicly filed with the Commission concerning, among other things, the Companys financial performance, the registration of millions of shares of World Health stock, certain material financial transactions, the number of shares authorized and outstanding, and the Companys business plan. McDonald signed and certified these filings, knowing they contained misstatements., The complaint further alleges that, during his tenure as CEO, Roup also signed and certified false public filings, and did so with no basis to assess the veracity of the information contained therein. McDonald and Roup also failed to properly publicly report their personal sales of World Health stock to the Commission., As alleged in the complaint, McDonald also improperly attempted to issue and register for immediate sale millions of shares of World Health stock by misusing a Form S-8 registration statement. In addition, McDonald also caused World Health to file with the Commission two false post-effective amendments drafted by Emas, World Healths outside securities counsel., McDonald has consented to the entry of an order permanently enjoining him from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b), 13(b)(5) and 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, 13b2-2 and 13a-14 thereunder, and aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13 thereunder.

Roup consented to transfer his assets to a court-appointed receiver to satisfy payment of these amounts., Seruga has consented to the entry of an order permanently enjoining her from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and13b2-2 thereunder, and aiding and abetting violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.

The Commission’s complaint further alleged that, in reality, Bass traded no more than $1.2 million of the $14.3 million raised, generated trading losses of 19 percent, and that HomePals used the bulk of the investor funds to repay earlier investors in typical Ponzi scheme fashion., For more information on earlier actions in this case, see <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21251.htm>LR-21251</a> (Oct. 16, 2009), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21265.htm>LR-21265</a> (Oct. 29, 2009), and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21316.htm>LR-21316</a> (Dec. 1, 2009). ,  ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21354.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Jaschke</i>, United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, Case No. 6:09-CV-2178-ORL-22-KRS (filed Dec. 29, 2009).</h2>, <h2>SEC Charges Houston-Based Broker With Defrauding Florida Municipalties</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) filed an action today charging a Houston-based broker with defrauding two Florida municipalities., The Commissions complaint alleges that Harold H. Jaschke (Jaschke) reaped commissions of over $14 million by engaging in unauthorized and unsuitable trading on behalf of the City of Kissimmee, Fla. and the Tohopekaliga Water Authority (collectively, the Municipalities), and by churning their accounts.  While associated with the brokerage firm First Allied Securities, Inc., Jaschke lied to his customers about his fraudulent trading, which resulted in an aggregate, unrealized loss of approximately $60 million for a two year period., The Commissions complaint, filed in federal court in Orlando, Fla., alleges that Jaschke engaged in a high risk, short term trading strategy involving zero-coupon United States Treasury bonds, the value of which were very sensitive to interest rate changes.  For example, if interest rates were to increase by only 1%, the value of a 30-year bond would drop by 25%.  Jaschkes risky trading strategy involved buying and selling the same bond within a matter of days, and sometimes within the same day.  The complaint alleges that Jaschke exposed the Municipalities to greater risks when he leveraged their accounts using repurchase agreements.  Jaschke employed repurchase agreements to finance the bond purchases the Municipalities would not otherwise have been able to afford.  The complaint alleges this strategy dramatically increased the risks as Jaschke caused the Municipalities to borrow large sums of money to hold larger bond positions., The complaint alleges Jaschke, age 49 of Houston, Tex., knew the Municipalities ordinances prohibited his trading strategy as they required that their funds be invested with the paramount consideration to be safety of capital.  Further, the complaint alleges Jaschke knew that the Municipalities prohibited the use of repurchase agreements for investment.  According to the complaint, had the bond market not swung sharply in Jaschkes favor allowing the Municipalities to close their accounts with a modest profit, the Municipalities could have lost millions of dollars as a result of his misconduct., The Commissions complaint alleges that Jaschke violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and aided and abetted violations of the broker-dealer books and records provisions, Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 17a-4(b)(4) thereunder.  The Commissions complaint seeks a permanent injunction and disgorgement with prejudgment interest and a civil penalty., In a related action, the Commission instituted settled administrative proceedings against Jeffrey C. Young, First Allieds former vice president of supervision, for failing to reasonably supervise Jaschke.  The order found Young failed to respond adequately to red flags relating to Jaschke, and failed to take reasonable steps to ensure that First Allieds procedures regarding suitability were followed.  The Commissions order suspends Young from acting in a supervisory capacity for nine months and orders him to pay a $25,000 civil penalty.  Young consented to the entry of the order without admitting or denying the Commissions findings.

Forbes et al., 01 civ 987 (JAP) (D.N.J. filed Feb. 28, 2001).  The Commissions complaint in that action alleged that Forbes orchestrated an earnings management scheme at CUC International Inc. (CUC), a corporate predecessor of Cendant, and, subsequently, at Cendant itself.  The complaint further alleged that over a twelve-year period Forbes directed a scheme that improperly inflated the companys quarterly and annual financial results, and that for the period 1995 to 1997, CUCs operating income was improperly inflated by an aggregate amount exceeding $500 million.  When the fraud was disclosed in 1998, Cendants common stock dropped dramatically, resulting in defrauded investors losing billions of dollars., The final judgment against Forbes, to which he consented without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, enjoins him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Exchange Act Rules 10b 5, 13b2 1, and 13b2 2, and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b 20, 13a 1, 13a 13, and 14a 9.  The final judgment also bars Forbes, pursuant to Section 21(d)(2) of the Exchange Act, from serving as an officer or director of a public company., Forbes was convicted in a related federal criminal prosecution of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and making false filings with the Commission.

Later that year, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed his judgment of conviction.

In a related criminal case, the U.S. Department of Justice announced today that UTStarcom agreed to pay an additional $1.5 million fine., The SECs complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleges that UTStarcoms wholly-owned subsidiary in China paid nearly $7 million between 2002 and 2007 for hundreds of overseas trips by employees of Chinese government-controlled telecommunications companies that were customers of UTStarcom, purportedly to provide customer training. In reality, the trips were entirely or primarily for sightseeing., The SEC further alleges that UTStarcom provided lavish gifts and all-expenses paid executive training programs in the U.S. for existing and potential foreign government customers in China and Thailand. UTStarcom also purported to hire individuals affiliated with foreign government customers to work in the U.S. and provided them with work visas, when in reality the individuals did no work for UTStarcom.
