GIANCARLO PARRETTI, Civil\rAction No. 1:96CV00013 (NHJ) (D.D.C.)\r\r     The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission)\rannounced the filing today of a Complaint against Giancarlo\rParretti, formerly the Chief Executive Officer and a director of\rthe motion picture company Pathe Communications Corp. (Pathe)\rin the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.\r\rThe Commission also announced that it issued cease and desist\rorders by consent against Florio Fiorini, formerly the Chairman\rof Pathe\s Board of Directors, and Fernando Cappuccio, formerly\rPathe\s Chief Financial Officer and a director.  All three\renforcement actions concern materially false and misleading\rdisclosures regarding two transactions by Pathe: its purported\rsale of certain theater properties in 1989; and its acquisition\rof MGM/UA Communications Company in 1990.  \r\r     The complaint in the injunctive action alleges that in\rDecember 1989 Pathe entered into a transaction in which it\rpurported to sell and lease back certain theater properties to an\rentity by the name of Cinema 5 Europe N.V. for more than $200\rmillion.  The complaint alleges that transaction was a sham\rbecause Cinema 5 was not independent of Pathe, and in particular\rthat Pathe had provided the funds to establish Cinema 5, that the\rmanaging directors of Cinema 5 were Parretti\s friends and\rbusiness associates, and that Cappuccio was Cinema 5\s sole\rrepresentative in arranging the transaction.  The complaint\ralleges that Parretti directed that the transaction be recorded\rin Pathe\s books and records and disclosed in periodic filings\rwith the Commission falsely as a sale to an unrelated third\rparty.  The complaint alleges that as a result Pathe improperly\rrecognized gains of more than $100 million on the transaction,\rand that its financial statements for 1989 and the first quarter\rof 1990 were materially overstated.  The complaint further\ralleges that Parretti falsely represented to Pathe\s independent\raccountant and in news releases that Cinema 5 was not affiliated\rwith Pathe but was owned and/or controlled by a prominent Italian\rmedia magnate.  The Orders issued against Fiorini and Cappuccio\rfound that they made similar false representations to Pathe\s\rindependent accountant and others.  \r\r     The complaint alleges that in a second episode, Parretti and\rFiorini failed to record material liabilities in Pathe\s books\rand records when it acquired MGM/UA.  The complaint alleges that\rthe merger agreement with MGM/UA required Parretti and/or Fiorini\rto contribute additional equity as part of the merger financing,\rand required an opinion from an investment banking firm that the\rmerged entity was solvent.  The complaint alleges that when they\rfailed to raise the required equity financing, Parretti and\rFiorini borrowed more than $300 million of the required monies on\ra short term basis, and committed Pathe to repay the loans after\rthe merger.  The complaint also alleged that Pathe sold certain\rlicensing rights in a transaction that raised more that $100\rmillion in cash that could be used to finance the merger, but\rthat obligated Pathe to repurchase the rights at the seller\s\roption.  The complaint alleged that Parretti did not record\reither the short term loans or the contingent liability to\r\r-------------------- BEGINNING OF PAGE #2 -------------------\r\rrepurchase the licensing rights on Pathe\s books and records, or\rdisclose them to the investment banking firm rendering the\rsolvency opinion.  The order against Fiorini similarly found that\rhe failed to disclose those obligations to the investment banking\rfirm.  \r\r     The complaint alleged that as a result of that conduct\rParretti violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of\r1934 and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder. \rSimultaneously with the filing of the complaint, and without\radmitting or denying the allegations, Parretti consented to entry\rof a permanent injunction against future violations of those\rprovisions.  Fiorini and Cappuccio both consented to the entry of\rthe cease and desist orders without admitting or denying the\rfindings.  The order against Fiorini finds that he violated\rSection 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-2\rthereunder.  The order against Cappuccio finds that he violated\ror caused violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a) and 13(b)(2) of the\rExchange Act, and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13,\r13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder.  The orders require Fiorini and\rCappuccio to cease and desist from committing or causing future\rviolations of the provisions they were found to have violated.\r\r     The Commission gratefully acknowledges the significant\rcontributions made by foreign governmental and securities\rauthorities to its investigation of this matter.  In particular,\rkey information and documents were provided by foreign\rauthorities in the Netherlands, France, Switzerland and Italy. \rThe SEC obtained comprehensive assistance pursuant to the\rAgreement with the Kingdom of the Netherlands dated December 11,\r1989.  The Dutch authorities\ ability to provide assistance was\rchallenged by one of the third parties in the Netherlands from\rwhom the SEC sought information; however, in 1992, the Dutch\rCommercial Court upheld the Dutch authorities\ ability to compel\rsuch information on behalf of the SEC.  The Dutch Economic\rControl Bureau also provided the SEC with assistance in the\rNetherlands.  The SEC also obtained additional assistance,\rincluding testimony, from the Commission des Operations de Bourse\rof France.  Additional assistance was provided by the Swiss\rFederal Office for Police Matters and the Commissione Nazionale\rper le Societa e la Borsa of Italy. \r\x1a"

The Commission\s complaint alleges that during\rCal Micro\s fiscal year ended June 30, 1994, Romito, together\rwith other officers and employees of the Company, fraudulently\rinflated Cal Micro\s reported revenue by, among other things,\rknowingly recognizing revenue on certain product that had not\rbeen shipped or, in some cases, even manufactured, in violation\rof Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).  In order\rto conceal the improper revenue recognition, Romito and others\rfalsified the Company\s books and records, overrode the Company\s\rinternal accounting controls and misled its outside auditors.  As\ra result of the fraud, Cal Micro\s quarterly reports on Forms 10-\rQ for at least the periods ended December 31, 1993 and March 31,\r1994, and its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June\r30, 1994, were materially false and misleading.\r\r     The complaint also alleges that Romito engaged in illegal\rinsider trading by selling Cal Micro stock while in possession of\rmaterial non-public information.

In addition, the U.S. Attorney\rfor the District of New Jersey today filed a criminal complaint\rcharging Tropiano with mail fraud for the activities underlying\rthis civil action.\r\r     The Complaint alleges that the defendant, a resident of\rHaddonfield, New Jersey, has engaged in a scheme to defraud\rinvestors by offering and selling securities in the form of\rinvestment contracts in pools purportedly formed for the purpose\rof funding commodity futures trading.  From 1989 through 1995,\rthe defendant raised approximately $2.9 million from 118\rinvestors.  The amounts invested ranged from $2000 to more than\r$250,000.  After initially conducting some commodity futures\rtrading, the defendant in 1992 ceased all trading activity. \rTropiano thereafter generated false account statements reflecting\rfictitious profitable trades and continued to raise money from\rinvestors by falsely representing that he had engaged in\rprofitable trading.  \r\r     According to the Complaint, Tropiano deposited the invested\rmoney into bank accounts he controlled, from which he\rmisappropriated approximately $1.5 million for his own use. \rTropiano failed to register the investment contract securities\rwith the Securities and Exchange Commission, failed to register\ras a broker-dealer, and failed to maintain his commodity pool\roperator registration with the Commodity Futures Trading\rCommission.  The Complaint charged that by this conduct, Tropiano\rviolated Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933,\rSections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934\rand Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 4b(a), 4m, 4o, and 9(a)\rof the Commodity Exchange Act.\r\r     Pursuant to the Preliminary Injunction, to which he\rconsented, Tropiano is enjoined from further violations of the\rprovisions of law set forth above.

Without admitting or denying the\rallegations in the Complaint, filed on October 31, 1995, Friedman\rand Galante consented to the entry of an injunction, disgorgement\rof their profits of $19,304.00 and $2,934.24, respectively, plus\rprejudgment interest, and a one time penalty of $18,831.79 and\r$2,065.24, respectively.\r\r     The Commissions Complaint alleges that on or about March\r1991, Charles Brumfield, at the time a Vice President in AT&Ts\rHuman Resources Department, learned material, non-public\rinformation about AT&Ts plans to acquire Digital Microwave. \rBrumfield, in breach of the duty he owed AT&T, told Thomas Alger\r(his close friend and subordinate at AT&T) and Joseph Cusimano\r(Brumfields friend) about AT&Ts acquisition plans for Digital. \rAlger, in breach of the duty he owed AT&T, in turn, told his\rfriend Friedman about AT&Ts acquisition plans, and Friedman,\rwhile in possession of this information, purchased Digital stock.\r\rCusimano told his friend Alfred Volpe about AT&Ts acquisition\rplans, and Volpe told his friend Galante who purchased Digital\rstock while in possession of this information.  In or about the\rfirst week of April 1991, after Brumfield learned that AT&T had\rabandoned its planned acquisition of Digital, Brumfield told\rAlger and Cusimano that AT&T had abandoned its acquisition plans\rfor Digital.  Alger told Friedman to sell the Digital stock. \rCusimano told Volpe that AT&T had abandoned its acquisition plans\rfor Digital and Volpe, in turn, gave this information to Galante.\r\rFriedman realized a profit of approximately $472 from trading in\rDigital Microwave securities, and made payments from his profits\rto Alger.  Galante realized a profit of approximately $869 from\rtrading in Digital Microwave securities. \r\r     The Commissions Complaint also alleges that in November\r1991, Brumfield learned material, non-public information about\rAT&Ts plans to acquire Teradata through AT&Ts wholly owned\rsubsidiary NCR.  Brumfield told Alger and Cusimano, among others,\rof AT&Ts acquisition plans.  Alger, in turn, told Friedman about\rAT&Ts acquisition plans and made arrangements for Friedman to\rbuy Teradata securities for Algers benefit.

Drinkwine\s clients were\r     current and retired school teachers from Long Island who\r     maintained investment accounts that contained their\r     retirement funds.  Drinkwine made various material\r     misrepresentations and omissions concerning the unit\r     trust, including:  (a) falsely guaranteeing investors a 10%\r     annual return on their investments in the unit trust;  (b)\r\r     falsely representing that all principal invested in the\r     unit trust was guaranteed and not at risk; and (c) falsely\r     representing that the unit trust would invest in real\r     estate.  Instead of investing his clients\ funds as\r     promised, Drinkwine secretly diverted approximately $420,000\r     into his personal bank accounts and misappropriated such\r     funds for his personal benefit.  \r\r          In furtherance of his scheme, Drinkwine sent his\r     clients:  (a) letters purporting to confirm their\r     investments in the unit trust, which also contained false\r     promises to pay 10% annual interest and to repay all\r     principal; and (b) written account statements which\r     purported to reflect the investments in the unit trust. \r     In addition, Drinkwine used approximately $30,000 of\r     investors funds to make sporadic interest payments to his\r     victims in order to conceal and perpetuate his fraudulent\r     scheme. \r\r     The Complaint alleges that Drinkwine violated Section 17(a)\rof the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities\rExchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and seeks to\renjoin him from future violations of these provisions.

Damon\r(Damon), Robert M. Davis (Davis) and Kenneth C. Kolovitz\r(Kolovitz).  The Complaint alleges that Damon, Davis and Kolovitz\rmade misrepresentations and omissions to investors in order to\rsell $6.6 million worth of unregistered securities in the form of\rpromissory notes, in violation of the Sections 5(a), 5(c) and\r17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b), 15(a)(1)\rand 15(c)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules\r10b-5 and 15c1-2 thereunder.\r\r     The Complaint alleges, among other things, that from 1989\rthrough October 1990, Union Credit Corporation (UCC) issued the\rpromissory notes, which Damon, who controlled UCC, and Davis and\rKolovitz, who acted as salesmen for UCC, sold to investors.  The\rnotes were not registered as securities with the Commission.  The\rComplaint further alleges that Damon, Davis and Kolovitz made\rnumerous misrepresentations and omissions to investors in the\rsale of these notes, including that UCC would use investor funds\rto purchase business machines, UCC would lease those machines to\rvarious businesses, and investors would receive a return of their\rprincipal and between 24% and 31% interest on that principal\ramount, which was to be derived from the proceeds of the business\rmachine leases.

The defendant consented to the entry of the permanent\rinjunction without admitting or denying the allegations contained\rin the Commission\s First Amended Complaint.\r\r     The Commission\s complaint, filed on May 14, 1992, alleged\raiding and abetting violations against Zimmerman in conjunction\rwith fraud in the offer and sale of securities in customers\\rDrexel Burnham Lambert (Drexel) accounts.  Zimmerman\s\rcodefendant Karen Scherm was a registered representative\rassociated with Drexel at the time the violations occurred. \rFollowing a judgment in favor of the Commission on September 30,\r1993, an intervening change in the law as to aiding and abetting\rviolations was raised on appeal and the case was remanded to the\rtrial court.

Zimmerman was ordered to disgorge\r$290,570.60 in ill-gotten gains, but disgorgement in excess of\r$25,000 was waived based upon Zimmerman\s demonstrated inability\rto pay.  \r\r     Zimmerman is currently incarcerated at the Atlanta Federal\rPenitentiary for a tax evasion conviction arising from the same\rfacts as in the Commission\s case.

On November 30, 1995, the Court granted the requested\rrelief.  In addition, on December 11, 1995, the Court granted the\rCommission\s motion for appointment of a receiver to take control\rof the assets of the corporate and Relief Defendants, and those\rassets are being operated by the receiver for the benefit of\rinvestors. \r\r     The Commission\s complaint alleged that from early 1990 to\rthe present, Defendant Gersh and two of his wholly-owned\rcorporate entities, Defendants BMS and Devonshire, offered and\rsold securities in the form of Certificates of Participation\r(COPs) in 34 securities offerings which raised approximately\r$14 million from investors in at least six states. In connection\rwith the offer and sale of these securities, the complaint\ralleged that the Defendants engaged in continuing fraudulent acts\rwhich include the misappropriation of over $7 million in investor\rfunds.  \r\r     The complaint alleged that, to induce public investors to\rinvest in these COPs, the Defendants marketed the offerings as \r\r                              - 2 -\r\rtax-exempt municipal securities, collateralized by equipment\rleases entered into by state and local governments.

These included falsely promising that investments\rwere fully-secured by state and municipal obligations, that Gersh\rwould merely pass-through the collateral payments to investors\rand that a trustee would protect the interests of investors.  In\r\r-------------------- BEGINNING OF PAGE #2 -------------------\r\rfact, however, Gersh only used a portion of the proceeds to\rinvest in state and local government leases.  Gersh commingled\rthe proceeds of the investments and misappropriated the monies to\rinvest in a variety of personal business ventures.  The complaint\rfurther alleged that Gersh\s failure to use investor proceeds as\rrepresented deprived investors of information material to an\rassessment of the tax-exempt status of the COPs. \r\r     The complaint further alleged that Gersh falsely represented\rthat a portion of investor monies would be set aside in a debt\rservice reserve account, failed to disclose that he exercised\rcontrol over the trustee, and falsely represented that the COPs\rwere issued pursuant to the authority of state or local\rgovernment agencies.  To date, six Gersh COPs issues have\rdefaulted.  On July 1 and September 1, 1995, Gersh defaulted on\rthe State of Washington Series 1990A ($3,020,000) and the State\rof Wisconsin Series 1990A ($380,000), respectively.  In addition,\rthree other Gersh COPs issues, the State of Florida Series 1990A\r($1,250,000), the State of Wisconsin Series 1990B ($270,000) and\rthe City of Providence, Rhode Island Series 1990B ($700,000),\rdefaulted on December 1, 1995, and the Westchester County, NY\r1981 G Lane ($415,000) COPs issued by Gersh defaulted on December\r31, 1995.  Those funds have not been repaid to investors.  \r\r     Additional defaults are expected.  Two other Gersh COPs\rissues, consisting of Livingston County, NY ($400,000) and\rOnondaga County, NY ($805,000), mature on January 31 and December\r15, 1996, respectively.  Bank accounts controlled by the receiver\rcontain only about $300,000 and nearly all of the leases securing\rthe outstanding COPs have been prepaid.

The Final Order establishes a $40\rmillion claims fund to be used to compensate purchasers of\rpublic, proprietary direct investments sold by PaineWebber from\r1986 to 1992.  The claims fund will be administered by an\rindependent claims administrator, to be appointed by the Court in\rthe next seven days.

MARK CABRERRO and ROBERTA CRAMPTON, Civil Action\rNo. 96-0349 WJR (BQRx) (C.D. Cal.)\r\r     The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission)\rannounced that on January 18, 1996, it filed an emergency lawsuit\rhalting the defendants\ sale of fictitious certificates of\rdeposit which they falsely claimed were issued by Citibank in New\rYork and insured by the federal government.  The scheme, directed\rby an inmate from federal prison and executed by several paroled\rfelons living in Los Angeles and Salt Lake City, consisted of a\rnationwide newspaper and direct marketing campaign aimed at\rluring elderly investors into purchasing the bogus securities.\r  \r     Since the scheme began in October 1995, the defendants have\rdefrauded individual investors out of approximately $320,000.  In\raddition, the Commission has learned that in response to the\rdefendants\ marketing efforts, hundreds of potential victims have\rexpressed an interest in purchasing the fictitious securities. \rBy instituting this emergency legal proceeding, the Commission\rhas effectively shut down the illegal enterprise shortly after it\rbegan and before a significantly greater number of investors were\rdefrauded.\r\r     In the lawsuit, which was filed in the United States\rDistrict Court for the Central District of California, the\rCommission obtained an order temporarily enjoining the following\rentities and individuals from future violations of the antifraud\rprovisions of the federal securities laws:  Citi Financial\rServices (Citi Financial); Citi Corp Realty Partners IV\r(CCRP); Harold Goldstein (Goldstein), an inmate at the\rfederal correctional facility in Lompoc, California; Richard\rThomas Mandell (Mandell), of Los Angeles, who is currently on\rfederal parole; Robert Singleton (Singleton), of Salt Lake\rCity, Utah, who is also currently on federal parole; Mark\rBarquera of Los Angeles, a convicted felon; and Roberta Crampton\rof Silver Spring, Maryland.  The order also imposes an asset\rfreeze against defendants Citi Financial, CCRP, Goldstein,\rMandell and Singleton.\r\r     In its Complaint, the Commission alleges that inmate\rGoldstein initiated the scheme by directing parolee Mandell to\rcreate two entities, Citi Financial Services and Citi Corp Realty\rPartners IV.  The names of these entities were purposely designed\rto mislead investors into believing that the entities were\raffiliated with Citibank, and its parent holding company,\rCiticorp.  Goldstein further instructed Mandell to assume the\ridentity of Mark Morgenlender, an actual executive employed by\rCiticorp, and to create investor letters and other solicitation\rmaterials on letterhead looking like Citicorp\s.  Goldstein also \r\r                              - 2 -\r\rcaused the printing of various forms of false identification for\rMandell to allow him to pose as Morgenlender.\r\r-------------------- BEGINNING OF PAGE #2 -------------------\r\r     The Complaint also alleges that beginning in October 1995,\rMandell and Singleton ran advertisements in major newspapers\rsoliciting investors to call a CD Hot Line.  Interested\rinvestors who called the CD Hot Line were provided with\rsolicitation materials describing the investment as federally\rinsured brokered certificates of deposit offered through the top\r150 financial institutions.  The solicitation materials also\rfalsely represented that Citi Financial and CCRP were licensed\rbroker-dealers and members of the New York Stock Exchange, the\rNational Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) and the\rSecurities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC).\r \r     The Commission further alleges in its Complaint that the\rdefendants are not in any way affiliated with Citicorp. \rMoreover, the defendants did not purchase federally insured\rcertificates of deposit or any other securities on behalf of the\rvictims, but instead misappropriated investor monies for their\rown personal gain.  The Complaint seeks preliminary and permanent\rinjunctions, and other relief, including disgorgement and civil\rpenalties, against the defendants.\r\r     The Commission acknowledges the cooperation and assistance\rprovided in this matter by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\r\x1a"

In\r     the Final Order, the Court set the amount of disgorgement\r     owed by the Defendants at $826,021.63, plus interest, but\r     waived payment of that amount based on the Defendants\r     demonstrated inability to pay.  The Court previously had\r     permanently enjoined Moore and DCI from violating the\r     antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.\r\r     In its Complaint, filed on February 13, 1995, the Commission\r     alleged that Moore and DCI violated Section 17(a) of the\r     Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities\r     Exchange Act of 1934, Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder,\r     Sections 206(1), (2) and (4) of the Investment Advisers Act\r     of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-2 promulgated thereunder.  The\r     Commission alleged that Moore misappropriated money from\r     clients of DCI, a registered investment adviser which Moore\r     controlled.  The Complaint further alleged that Moore\r     solicited clients of DCI to invest in DeForest Investors\r     Inc. (DII).  The Complaint also stated that Moore did not\r     provide the investors money to DII.  Instead, Moore\r     deposited the money into a DCI account and used the money to\r     pay personal and business expenses and to pay investors who\r     wished to withdraw money from DII.\r\r     On February 13, 1995, without admitting or denying the\r     allegations in the Complaint, Moore and DCI consented to the\r     entry of an Order of Permanent Injunction (Injunction\r     Order).  The Injunction Order left open the amount of\r     disgorgement owed by the defendants.  The Final Order set\r     that disgorgement amount at $826,021.63, and closed the\r     case.\r\x1a"

In\rthe Complaint, the Commission seeks a permanent injunction\ragainst each of the defendants for violations of the foregoing\rprovisions of the federal securities laws in connection with the\roffer and sale to the public of unregistered securities of\rTelefund.  The Complaint also seeks disgorgement of investor\rfunds.  \r\r     Simultaneously with the filing of the Complaint, and without\radmitting or denying the allegations made against them, Miller,\rCRS, and Telefund consented to the entry of a Final Judgment of\rPermanent Injunction and Other Relief permanently enjoining them\rfrom future violations of Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities\rAct of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities\rExchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In addition, the\rFinal Judgment against the defendants will order them to disgorge\r$269,435.00, jointly and severally.  Miller, individually, agreed\rto the entry of a judgment against him in the amount of\r$65,869.53.  However, Miller\s disgorgement is waived based upon\rhis sworn Statement of Financial Condition and contingent upon\rthe accuracy and completeness of that statement.\r  \r     According to the Complaint, beginning in or about November\r1994, the defendants began to offer and sell to the public\rsecurities designated as general partnership units in Telefund,\ra partnership formed by defendant Miller under the laws of the\rState of California.  The Complaint charges that the partnership\runits met the definition of a security and, therefore, should\rhave been registered. \r \r     According to the Complaint, defendant CRS contracted with\rIndependent Sales Organizations to solicit prospective investors\rto purchase Telefund securities.  The Commission further alleges\rthat these solicitations were carried out through telephone calls\rto prospective investors throughout the United States by multiple\rboiler room sales organizations.  Ultimately, Telefund received a\rtotal of $1,180,000, substantial amounts of which were used to\rpay \r                               - 2-\r\r\rsales commissions and other initial start up costs, according to\rthe Complaint.\r\r     The Complaint alleges that the defendants made material\rmisrepresentations falsely stating in the offering materials and\rin telephone solicitations, that among other things, prospective\r\r-------------------- BEGINNING OF PAGE #2 -------------------\r\rinvestors could receive between a 24 percent return for a four\rmonth period to a 203 percent return for a sixteen month period\ron their investment in Telefund.

The County\rPools operated as an investment fund managed by Orange County in\rwhich the County and various local governments or districts\rinvested or deposited public funds.  The County Pools consisted\rof the Commingled Pool, the Bond Pool and Specific Investments. \rEach of the municipal securities offerings was connected to the\rCounty Pools in one or more ways:\r\r     \xf9    the proceeds from certain offerings were reinvested in\r          the County Pools to obtain interest earnings;\r\r     \xf9    the funds pledged to repay certain of the securities\r          were invested in the County Pools;\r\r     \xf9    the County Pools agreed to repurchase or repay certain\r          of the securities; and/or\r\r     \xf9    the County\s economic reliance on the County Pools\r          materially affected its ability to repay the\r          securities. \r\rMISSTATEMENTS AND OMISSIONS ALLEGED IN THE COMMISSION\S ACTIONS\r\r     As set forth below, the County, the Flood Control District,\rthe Board of Supervisors, Citron and Raabe variously made\rmaterial misstatements and omissions of fact in the Official\rStatements for the eleven offerings, regarding:  \r\r     \xf9    the County Pools, including the County Pools\\r          investment strategy and investment results,\r          manipulation of the County Pools\ yield and investment\r          in the County Pools of the funds pledged to repay the\r          municipal securities.  These matters affected the\r          issuer\s ability to repay the securities and the County\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 4======\r\r          Pools\ ability to perform under agreements to\r          repurchase or provide for repayment of the securities; \r\r     \xf9    Orange County\s financial condition, including its\r          economic reliance on interest income from the County\r          Pools as a source of funds to repay the purchasers of\r          the securities; \r\r     \xf9    the tax-exempt status of the offering; \r\r     \xf9    an undisclosed interest rate cap on certain variable\r          rate securities sold in the offerings; and \r\r     \xf9    the unauthorized use of an audit report prepared by an\r          outside accounting firm. \r\r     In addition, in connection with the offer and sale of\rcertain of the securities, misrepresentations were made to\rnational securities rating agencies concerning the County Pools. \r\r     Misstatements and Omissions Regarding the County Pools\r\r     The Official Statements for the eleven offerings\rmisrepresented or omitted to disclose material information\rconcerning the County Pools, despite their significance to each\rof the offerings.  Where the funds pledged to repay the\rnoteholders were invested in the County Pools, the issuer looked\rto that investment to satisfy its repayment obligations.  Any\rrisks that those pledged funds would decrease affected the\rissuer\s ability to repay the noteholders.  Similarly, in the\rofferings where the County Pools agreed to repurchase the\rsecurities, disclosure regarding the County Pools was important\rso that investors could evaluate the County Pools\ financial\rstrength and ability to perform under the agreement.  In\raddition, in certain Orange County offerings in which other\rCounty funds were a source of repayment, disclosure regarding the\rCounty Pools was important to investors because availability of\rsuch other funds depended upon the County Pools\ performance.  \r\r     Citron and Raabe caused the County Pools to engage in a very\rrisky investment strategy.  The strategy involved using a high\rdegree of leverage by obtaining funds through reverse repurchase\ragreements on a short-term basis (less than 180 days), and\rinvesting in securities with a longer maturity (generally two to\rfive years), many of which were volatile derivative securities.\r\r     The County Pools\ investment return was to result\rprincipally from the interest received on the securities in the\rCounty Pools.  Leverage enabled the County Pools to purchase more\rsecurities for the purpose of generating increased interest\rincome.  This strategy was profitable as long as the County Pools\rwere able to maintain a positive spread between the long-term\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 5======\r\rinterest rate received on the securities and the short-term\rinterest rate paid on the funds obtained through reverse\rrepurchase agreements.\r\r     The Official Statements variously contained false or\rmisleading disclosure regarding the County Pools in four areas:\r\r          1.   Investment Strategy and the Risks of That Strategy\r\r     The Official Statements for all eleven offerings\rmisrepresented and/or failed to disclose material information\rconcerning the County Pools\ investment strategy and the risks of\rthat strategy.  With respect to the investment strategy, the\rOfficial Statements failed adequately to disclose that the\rstrategy:  1) was risky; 2) was predicated upon the assumption\rthat prevailing interest rates would remain at relatively low\rlevels; 3) involved a high degree of leverage through the use of\rreverse repurchase agreements; 4) involved a substantial\rinvestment in derivative securities, including inverse floaters\rthat are negatively affected by a rise in interest rates; and 5)\rwas very sensitive to changes in the prevailing interest rate\rbecause of the leverage.  \r\r     During 1993 and 1994, Citron and Raabe leveraged the County\rPools to amounts ranging from 158% to over 292%.  Moreover,\rvolatile derivative securities comprised from 27.6% to 42.2% of\rthe combined County Pools\ portfolio and from 31% to 53% of the\rCommingled Pool\s portfolio.  From January 1993 through November\r1994, from 24.89% to 39.84% of the County Pools\ total portfolio\rconsisted of inverse floaters.  In contrast, the County Pools\rinvested only sparingly in securities that paid interest rates\rdirectly related to the prevailing interest rate (variable rate\rsecurities) or securities that paid interest rates that rose at\rcertain stated intervals to certain stated rates (step-up\rsecurities).  From January 1993 through November 1994, only 1.84%\rto 5.59% of the County Pools\ portfolio consisted of such\rsecurities.  Accordingly, the County Pools invested in inverse\rfloaters to speculate on the direction of short and long-term\rinterest rates.\r\r     The Official Statements also failed to adequately disclose\rthe risks of the investment strategy.  Specifically, if interest\rrates rose, as they did in 1994, it would have a substantial\rnegative impact on the County Pools and, because of its\rdependence on the County Pools, the County itself.  First, the\rreverse repurchase costs would increase and the income that the\rCounty Pools earned from the inverse floaters in the portfolio\rwould decrease, creating lower earnings for the County Pools. \rSecond, the County Pools\ securities would decline in market\rvalue.  Third, as the value of the County Pools\ securities fell,\rthe County would suffer collateral calls from broker-dealers and\rreductions in loan amounts on the reverse repurchase agreements. \x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 6======\r\rAll three events would reduce the income that Orange County would\rreceive from the County Pools, with the possible loss of\rprincipal of invested funds as well.  None of these risks were\rdisclosed.\r\r          2.   Investment Results\r\r     The Official Statements for the nine offerings conducted in\r1994 failed to disclose material information concerning the\rCounty Pools\ investment results.  During 1994, the County Pools\\rinvestment income declined because reverse repurchase costs had\rincreased while the income that the County Pools earned from\rinverse floaters had decreased.  Additionally, the County Pools\rhad suffered substantial market losses in the overall value of\rthe portfolio.  The declining market value of securities in the\rCounty Pools resulted in collateral calls and reductions in\ramounts obtained under reverse repurchase agreements and\rliquidity.  These results were not disclosed to investors in the\r1994 offerings.     \r\r          3.   Manipulation of the Yield\r\r     The Official Statements for eight offerings--the three 1994\rReinvestment Notes, the $169 Million and the $31 Million TRANs,\rthe two Teeter Notes and the Pension Bonds--misrepresented that\rthe County Pools\ yield would be distributed pro rata to the\rParticipants.  Citron and Raabe had in fact diverted interest\rincome from certain Commingled Pool Participants to an account\rfor the benefit of Orange County.  As a result, the Commingled\rPools\ yield was misrepresented in the Official Statements for\rthese offerings.  In late 1994, Citron and Raabe used a portion\rof the misappropriated funds to supplement the Commingled Pools\\ryield.  The supplemented yield was then falsely reported in the\rOfficial Statement for the Pension Bonds.  \r\r     Citron and Raabe also shifted market losses from some\rSpecific Investment Participants, including the County, to the\rCommingled Pool, causing the Commingled Pool Participants to\rsuffer losses that should have been borne by others.  This\rinformation was not disclosed and also rendered false the\rrepresentations regarding the pro rata distribution.  \r\r          4.   Investment in the County Pools\r\r     The Official Statements for the $400 Million Reinvestment\rNotes, the 1993 $50 Million Reinvestment Notes and the $299.66\rMillion Pooled TRANs stated that the funds pledged to repay the\rNotes would be invested as permitted by the resolutions\rauthorizing the issuance and sale of the Notes and by California\rlaw.  None of the Official Statements for these three offerings\rdisclosed that the issuer intended to invest such funds in the\rCounty Pools.  In fact, there is no narrative discussion of the\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 7======\r\rPools in the Official Statements for the two reinvestment\rofferings.   \r\r     Misstatements and Omissions Regarding the Financial\r     Condition of the County\r\r     The Official Statements for six of Orange County\s offerings\rfailed to disclose Orange County\s true financial condition, in\rparticular, that the County was using interest income from the\rCounty Pools as the largest single source of revenue for its\rdiscretionary budget.  These offerings are the $600 Million\rReinvestment Notes, the $169 Million and $31 Million TRANs, the\rtwo Teeter Notes and the Pension Bonds.  Further, the County\s\ruse of this interest income as a revenue source was increasing\rwhile other traditional revenue sources, such as property taxes,\rwere decreasing.  The funds invested to generate investment\rincome came from two sources, the County\s own funds and proceeds\rfrom the reinvestment offerings.  Orange County had invested\ressentially all of its liquid assets in the County Pools,\rincluding funds to repay its municipal securities.  In addition,\rthe investment of virtually all of the County\s liquid assets in\rthe County Pools exposed Orange County to the volatility of the\rCounty Pools, including the potential loss of not only interest\rincome, but of principal as well.  The failure to disclose this\rinformation rendered disclosure regarding the County\s financial\rcondition and its ability to repay its securities materially\rmisleading.\r\r     This information regarding Orange County\s financial\rcondition was important as it related to Orange County\s ability\rto repay its obligations, including the municipal securities\rdebt.  Moreover, with the exception of the Pension Bonds, these\rCounty offerings were short-term general obligations, which,\runder California law, the County could repay only with funds\rreceived or accrued during fiscal year 1994-95.  Therefore, given\rthe County\s use of interest income from the County Pools, if the\rCounty Pools\ investments performed poorly, as eventually\roccurred, the County would have a budget deficit and could not\rrepay the securities and meet its other expenses.  The County\s\rfinancial condition was also material to the County\s ability to\rperform under certain agreements to repurchase or provide for\rrepayment of the securities. \r\r     Misstatements and Omissions Regarding the Tax-Exempt Status\r     of the Offering\r\r     The Official Statements for the $169 Million and $31 Million\rTRANs represented that these securities offerings were tax-\rexempt.  These TRAN offerings were to fund the County\s cash flow\rdeficit.  In order to qualify for tax-exempt status, the\rofferings must comply with certain IRS regulations that limit the\ramount that may be raised through tax-exempt offerings.  With\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 8======\r\rrespect to both of these offerings, the County jeopardized the\rtax-exempt status of these offerings by increasing the size of\rits cash flow deficit, and, thereby, the size of the offering,\rthrough artificial means.  None of the facts relating to the\rCounty\s artificial increase of the size of its cash flow deficit\rwere disclosed in the Official Statements for these offerings.  \r\r     Misstatements and Omissions Regarding an Undisclosed Cap on\r     the Interest Rate Payable to Investors\r\r     The Official Statements for the $600 Million Reinvestment\rNotes, the $111 Million Teeter Notes and the $100 Million\rReinvestment Notes each stated that they paid a variable interest\rrate connected to the one-month LIBOR.  Undisclosed, however, was\rthe fact that the Notes for each of these offerings contained a\r12% cap on the maximum variable interest rate that would be paid\rby the County.  While the existence of this cap was indicated on\rthe face of the Notes, no disclosure was made to noteholders\rprior to purchase. \r\r     Misstatements and Omissions Regarding the Unauthorized Use\r     of an Audit Report\r\r     The Official Statements for seven offerings falsely \rrepresented that the County\s auditor consented to the inclusion\r. . . of the County\s audited financial statements. . ., together\rwith the report accompanying the audited financial statements. \rThe offerings which contained the false statement were the $600\rMillion Reinvestment Notes, the $400 Million Reinvestment Notes,\rthe two Teeter Notes, the $169 Million TRANs, the $31 Million\rTRANs and the $100 Million Reinvestment Notes.  This report and\rOrange County\s audited financial statements were included as\rexhibits to the Official Statements for these offerings. \r\r     In fact, the auditors did not consent to the inclusion of\rtheir report, did not conduct any post-audit review and were not\reven aware that the Official Statements represented that they\rconsented to the inclusion of the report until after the County\rfiled for bankruptcy.\r\r     Misrepresentations to Rating Agencies \r\r     In presentations to national rating agencies relating to\reight offerings--the $600 Million, the $100 Million and the 1994\r$50 Million Reinvestment Notes, the $169 Million and the $31\rMillion TRANs, the two Teeter Notes and the Pension Bonds--Raabe\rmisrepresented the County Pools\ holdings.  These\rmisrepresentations ultimately ran to the purchasers of these\rsecurities.  Raabe represented that only 20% of the County Pools\\rportfolio consisted of derivative securities.  In fact,\rderivative securities comprised from 27.6% to 42.2% of the\rcombined County Pools\ portfolio and from 31% to 53% of the\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 9======\r\rCommingled Pool\s portfolio.  In particular, inverse floaters\rcomprised from 24.89% to 39.84% of the County Pools\ holdings. \r\r     Raabe also misrepresented to rating agencies that money in\ran Orange County account designated the Economic Uncertainty\rFund was available to pay the principal and interest on five\rofferings--the $600 Million Reinvestment Notes, the $169 Million\rand the $31 Million TRANs and the two Teeter Notes--and omitted\rto disclose that such funds had been misappropriated from the\rCommingled Pool Participants.  \r\rREPORT OF INVESTIGATION ISSUED CONCERNING INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS OF\rTHE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS\r\r     Additionally, the Commission issued a Report of\rInvestigation pursuant to Section 21(a) of the Exchange Act with\rrespect to the conduct of the individual members of the Board of\rSupervisors in authorizing six of the Orange County offerings. \rThe individual members of the Board of Supervisors have consented\rto the issuance of the Report, without admitting or denying any\rof the statements or conclusions contained in the Report.\r\r     In 1993 and 1994, the individual members of the Board\rincluded:\r\r     \xf9    Thomas F.

Prior to\r          his resignation, Vasquez was the Chairman of the Board\r          in 1995.\r\r     \xf9    Harriett M. Wieder, age 75, who was first elected\r          Supervisor in 1978, was Chairman of the Board in 1993\r          and a member through 1994.\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 10======\r\r     The Commission is issuing this Report to emphasize the\rresponsibilities under the federal securities laws of local\rgovernment officials who authorize the issuance of municipal\rsecurities and related disclosure documents and the critical role\rsuch officials play with respect to the representations contained\rin the Official Statements for those securities.  \r\r     In authorizing the issuance of securities and related\rdisclosure documents, a public official may not authorize\rdisclosure that the official knows to be false; nor may a public\rofficial authorize disclosure while recklessly disregarding facts\rthat indicate that there is a risk that the disclosure may be\rmisleading.  When, for example, a public official has knowledge\rof facts bringing into question the issuer\s ability to repay the\rsecurities, it is reckless for that official to approve\rdisclosure to investors without taking steps appropriate under\rthe circumstances to prevent the dissemination of materially\rfalse or misleading information regarding those facts.  In this\rmatter, such steps could have included becoming familiar with the\rdisclosure documents and questioning the issuer\s officials,\remployees or other agents about the disclosure of those facts.\r\r     In this case, the Supervisors approved Official Statements\rthat, among other things, failed to disclose certain material\rinformation about Orange County\s financial condition that\rbrought into question the County\s ability to repay its\rsecurities absent significant interest income from the County\rPools.  The Supervisors were aware of material information\rconcerning Orange County\s financial condition; this information\rcalled into question the County\s ability to repay its\rsecurities.  Nevertheless, the Supervisors failed to take\rappropriate steps to assure disclosure of these facts.  In light\rof these circumstances, the Board members did not fulfill their\robligations under the antifraud provisions of the federal\rsecurities laws in authorizing the issuance of the municipal\rsecurities and related disclosure documents. \r\r     The Commission\s investigation remains ongoing.\r\x1a"

The Commission\s\renforcement action was initially filed on September 12, 1994.

(SCSI), a\rbroker-dealer formerly registered with the Commission, raised\rover $4.07 million from about 196 investors through a scheme\rinvolving the fraudulent offer and sale of unregistered limited\rpartnership interests in five oil and gas limited partnerships\r(Partnerships) managed by Buckeye Development Co. dba Western\rReserve Development Co. (Western) and operated by Grizzly\rOperating Co. dba Cherokee Operating Co. (Cherokee).  According\rto the Complaint, in the offer and sale of these securities,\rHammonds and Gross made misstatements and omissions to investors\rand prospective investors.  For example, in promoting the\rinvestments, Hammonds and Gross told investors that investor\rfunds would be used for oil and gas-related expenses, lease\racquisition costs, sales commissions, Western\s fees, working\rcapital and investing in U.S. Government obligations.  In fact,\rHammonds and Gross misused and misappropriated substantial\ramounts of investor funds to pay the overhead and operating\rexpenses of SCSI and Cherokee and to pay themselves.  Hammonds\rand Gross also failed to transfer oil and gas properties to the\rPartnerships and to invest any portion of investor funds in U.S.\rgovernment obligations, contrary to representations contained in\rthe offering documents and made orally to investors.

The Court also scheduled a contempt hearing against\rHaag on February 26, 1996 for failing to comply with a temporary\rrestraining order that was entered against her on October 26,\r1995.\rSpecifically, she has failed to file a sworn accounting,\rrepatriate investor funds and identify all investors.\r\r     Under the terms of the preliminary injunction, Haag is\rpreliminarily enjoined from continuing her fraudulent offering of\rsecurities.  The Court\s order also continues a freeze on Haag\s\rassets, requires Haag to file a sworn accounting, orders the\rrepatriation of investor funds and grants other relief.  The\rrelief was entered in connection with an enforcement action\ralleging that Haag was engaging in an ongoing, fraudulent\rsecurities offering of so-called prime bank instruments in\rviolation of the antifraud and registration provisions of the\rfederal securities laws.  \r\r     Specifically, the Commission alleges that since at least\rOctober 1994, Haag has been the central figure in a fraudulent\rscheme that has induced members of the public to invest over $1\rmillion in her programs by promising, in some cases, returns as\rhigh as 200%-420% annually.  In addition to Haag, Gene Block of\rDurham, North Carolina (Block), doing business as Block\rConsulting Services, and Robert T.

The Defendants have falsely represented\rthat the initial investment is guaranteed against loss because a\rPrime Bank Guarantee will be used as security for the\rtransaction.  In fact, there are no legitimate financial\rinstruments known as Prime Bank Guarantees.  The Defendants\rhave also fraudulently represented that investors\ funds are\rdoubled by buying and selling Bank Instruments.  However, the\rDefendants have failed to disclose the nature of the Bank\rInstruments, how the trading will generate such unrealistic\rreturns, or the risk that the returns will not be achieved.  None\rof the Defendants or their businesses are registered with the\rCommission as a broker-dealer, nor are they associated with any\rbroker-dealer registered with the Commission.\r\r     The Commission alleges that the Defendants have violated the\rantifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities\rlaws.

Holman consented to the\rFinal Judgment and Order without admitting or denying the\rallegations in the Commissions Complaint. \r\r     The Commissions Complaint, which was filed on September 20,\r1995, alleges that in 1990, Holman caused Homestead to file\rannual and quarterly reports with the Commission containing false\rfinancial information.

For the year ended\rDecember 31, 1989, Homestead reported income before taxes of $3.4\rmillion.  This figure was overstated by approximately $2.7\rmillion, inasmuch as it omitted significant provisions for\rprobable or anticipated losses within Homesteads loan portfolio.\r\rThe Complaint alleges that Holman knew, or was reckless in not\rknowing, that Homestead was not properly accounting for probable\rand estimable losses in its loan portfolio, and therefore that\rthe financial statements contained in Homesteads public filings\rwere false and misleading. \r\r     The Complaint also alleges that Homestead, at Holmans\rdirection, also failed to disclose, in the Management Discussion\rand Analysis of Financial Reports section of its 1989 Form 10-K,\rand in its Forms 10-Q for the quarters ended 3/31/90 and 6/30/90,\rHomesteads need to substantially increase its loan loss\rprovision due to a dramatic deterioration in its real estate loan\rportfolio during the last two quarters of 1989.  \x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\x0c\x1a"

Based upon the financial condition of\rCho, Cho was ordered to pay $20,000, and the remainder of\rdisgorgement was waived and no civil penalty was imposed.  Cho\rconsented to the entry of the final judgment without admitting or\rdenying the allegations in the Commission\s Complaint, which was\rfiled on August 31, 1994.  Previously, Cho pleaded guilty to\rcriminal securities fraud charges.\r\r     Specifically, the Complaint alleges that, from January 1993\rto September 1993, Robert L. Shull (Shull), Leonard E. Fiessel\r(L. Fiessel) and Colleen A. Fiessel (C. Fiessel) agreed to\racquire a controlling interest in Fairmont Resources Inc.\r(Fairmont), to manipulate the price of Fairmont\s stock and to\rsell their holdings in Fairmont at prices that were artificially\renhanced by their manipulation.  The Complaint further alleges\rthat, as part of their scheme, Shull, L. Fiessel and C. Fiessel\rpaid kickbacks in the form of cash and/or stock at prices well\rbelow market value to Cho and other defendants, each of whom was\ra registered representative of a U.S. broker-dealer.  The\rComplaint alleges that the kickbacks, the total value of which\rwere approximately six hundred thousand dollars ($600,000), were\ressentially bribes to induce Cho and other defendants to\rrecommend and sell Fairmont stock to their U.S. retail brokerage\rcustomers and resulted in the sale of over one million shares of\rFairmont stock to more than 150 residents in seventeen states. \rAccording to the Complaint, Cho and other defendants failed to\rdisclose the kickback arrangement to their customers.  Finally,\rthe Complaint alleges that the defendants\ manipulative activity\rcaused the market price for Fairmont stock to increase over one\rthousand percent (1000%) - from 30 cents (Canadian) per share to\r$3.05 (Canadian) per share - in a period of less than six months,\rand that Shull, L.

In that proceeding,\rthe Court stopped the defendants\ sale of fictitious certificates\rof deposit which they falsely claimed were issued by Citibank in\rNew York and insured by the federal government.  The preliminary\rinjunction continues to bar the defendants from committing the\rfraudulent sales.  \r\r     In its lawsuit, which was filed in the United States\rDistrict Court for the Central District of California, the\rCommission obtained an order preliminarily enjoining the\rfollowing entities and individuals from future violations of the\rantifraud provisions of the federal securities laws:  Citi\rFinancial Services (Citi Financial); Citi Corp Realty Partners\rIV (CCRP); Harold Goldstein (Goldstein), an inmate at the\rfederal correctional facility in Lompoc, California; Richard\rThomas Mandell (Mandell), of Los Angeles, who is currently on\rfederal parole; Robert Singleton (Singleton), of Salt Lake\rCity, Utah, who is also currently on federal parole; Mark\rBarquera of Los Angeles, a convicted felon; and Roberta Crampton\rof Duluth, Georgia.  The order also continues an asset freeze\ragainst defendants Citi Financial, CCRP, Goldstein, Mandell and\rSingleton.\r\r     The Commission\s Complaint alleged that the scheme was\rdirected by Goldstein, an inmate from federal prison, and\rexecuted by several paroled felons living in Los Angeles and Salt\rLake City.  In selling the fictitious instruments, the defendants\rconducted a nationwide newspaper and direct marketing campaign\raimed at luring elderly investors into purchasing the bogus\rsecurities.  Since the scheme began in October 1995, the\rdefendants have defrauded individual investors out of\rapproximately $320,000.  In addition, the Commission has learned\rthat in response to the defendants\ marketing efforts, hundreds\rof potential victims have expressed an interest in purchasing the\rfictitious securities.  \r\r     The Complaint also alleges that inmate Goldstein directed\rparolee Mandell to create two entities, Citi Financial Services\rand Citi Corp Realty Partners IV.  The names of these entities\rwere purposely designed to mislead investors into believing that\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\rthe entities were affiliated with Citibank, and its parent\rholding company, Citicorp.

Goldstein also caused the printing of various forms\rof false identification for Mandell to allow him to pose as\rMorgenlender.\r\r     The Complaint further alleges that beginning in October\r1995, Mandell and Singleton ran advertisements in major\rnewspapers soliciting investors to call a CD Hot Line. \rInterested investors who called the CD Hot Line were provided\rwith solicitation materials describing the investment as\rfederally insured brokered certificates of deposit offered\rthrough the top 150 financial institutions.  The solicitation\rmaterials also falsely represented that Citi Financial and CCRP\rwere licensed broker-dealers and members of the New York Stock\rExchange, the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD)\rand the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC).\r \r     The Commission further alleges in its Complaint that the\rdefendants are not in any way affiliated with Citicorp. \rMoreover, the defendants did not purchase federally insured\rcertificates of deposit or any other securities on behalf of the\rvictims, but instead misappropriated investor monies for their\rown personal gain.

The Complaint seeks a permanent injunction\ragainst future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), 17(a) and 17(b)\rof the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section\r10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act),\rand Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and a civil penalty.\r\r     The Complaint alleges that Frankel, conducting his business\runder the name United Broadcast Sales, produced and repeatedly\rordered the broadcast of four half-hour infomercials during 1993\rand 1994.  The Complaint alleges that the infomercials resembled\ra financial news report, featuring a moderator conducting a\rquestion and answer session with a purported industry expert or\ranalyst.  The Complaint further alleges that the infomercials\roffered prospective investors an opportunity to invest in\rsecurities, and urged viewers to telephone a toll-free number for\radditional information on how to become a part owner of a WCT or\rSMR system.  The Complaint alleges that Frankel arranged for\roperators to obtain the name, address, and telephone number of\rpersons who called the toll-free number.\r\r     The Complaint further alleges that Frankel sold investor\rleads generated by broadcasting the infomercials to\rapproximately 30 promoters of WCT and SMR investments.

In its amended complaint\rfiled in October 1995, the Commission alleged that Susan F.\rKeary, the secretary to an outside director of Hilton, and her\rboyfriend, Davies, provided material non-public information\rrelating to Hilton\s consideration of strategic alternatives to\renhance shareholder value to defendants Jeffrey C. Morris and\rGerard Murphy, who in turn purchased Hilton call options and\rcommon stock.  Morris and Murphy, both of whom are British\rnationals and were previously named in the case, sold their\rHilton securities at a profit of approximately $425,000 almost\rimmediately after Hilton announced this information on November\r17, 1994.

During or around the time of that trip,\rshe and/or Davies communicated material non-public information to\rthe other defendants.  \r\r     In October 1995, simultaneously with the filing of the\ramended complaint, Keary, without admitting or denying the\rallegations of the complaint against her, consented to the entry\rof a consent judgment enjoining her from violating Section 10(b)\rof the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.\r\rIn addition, the Court ordered Keary to pay a civil penalty of\r$10,000.00.

Pursuant to the judgment, the Court\ralso ordered Morris to disgorge $105,762.21, which represents his\rshare of the profits from his trading in Hilton securities, and\rto pay an additional $105,762.21 to the U.S. Treasury.  The Court\rpreviously granted the Commission\s application for a judgment by\rdefault against Morris\s trading partner, Murphy, ordering him to\rdisgorge $301,015.51 and pay a civil penalty of $157,443.69. \r\r     This case commenced on November 23, 1994, when the\rCommission sought and obtained a temporary restraining order,\rfreezing the proceeds of Morris\s and Murphy\s trades.

Riley, Jr.\rof St. Louis, Missouri (Riley), doing business as The Roberts\rGroup, were offering and selling the unregistered and fraudulent\rHaag + Partner programs through various methods, including\radvertisements on the Internet.  Previously, on August 8, 1995,\rthe Court entered a temporary restraining order and asset freeze\ron the Commission\s ex parte motion against Block.  On September\r14, 1995, Block consented to the entry of a preliminary\rinjunction.  On January 30, 1996, the Court entered a preliminary\rinjunction against Haag.\r\r     The Commission further alleges that as an inducement to\rpotential investors, the Defendants have represented that\rinvestors\ funds would be invested in risk-free, high-yield\rinvestment programs.  The Defendants have falsely represented\x0c\r\r\r\r\r\rthat the initial investment is guaranteed against loss because a\rPrime Bank Guarantee will be used as security for the\rtransaction.  In fact, there are no legitimate financial\rinstruments known as Prime Bank Guarantees.  The Defendants\rhave also fraudulently represented that investors\ funds are\rdoubled by buying and selling Bank Instruments.  However, the\rDefendants have failed to disclose the nature of the Bank\rInstruments, how the trading will generate such unrealistic\rreturns, or the risk that the returns will not be achieved.  None\rof the Defendants or their businesses are registered with the\rCommission as a broker-dealer, nor are they associated with any\rbroker-dealer registered with the Commission.\r\r     The Commission alleges that the Defendants have violated the\rantifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities\rlaws.  The Commission seeks the following relief:  (i) a\rpermanent injunction prohibiting the Defendants from further\rviolations of the antifraud and broker-dealer registration\rprovisions of the federal securities laws; (ii) disgorgement of\rthe Defendants\ ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest\rthereon; and (iii) civil monetary penalties in an amount to be\rdetermined by the Court.  \r\r     For further information, see Litigation Release Nos. 14598,\r14711 and 14804.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                   \r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\x0c\x1a"

The Commission\s complaint alleges that Youngman\rpurchased securities of American Biltrite Inc. (ABL) while in\rpossession of the material non-public information that ABL\rintended to enter into a joint venture agreement with Hillside\rIndustries, Inc.\s (Hillside) Congoleum Corporation\r(Congoleum).  The complaint also alleges that Marcus tipped\rYoungman the material non-public information about the joint\rventure.  Defendants are charged with violating Section 10(b) of\rthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule\r10b-5 thereunder.  Both Marcus and Youngman have consented,\rwithout admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, to\rthe entry of Final Judgments of Permanent Injunction.\r\r     During the period from approximately June 1992 through\rDecember 3, 1992, Marcus was the president, chief operating\rofficer and a member of the board of directors of ABL.  Youngman\rwas a personal friend of Marcus.  As part of his duties as\rpresident and chief operating officer, Marcus negotiated with\rHillside and Congoleum regarding the proposed joint venture\rtransaction between ABL and Congoleum.  On December 1, 1992,\rafter learning of the proposed joint venture transaction from\rMarcus, Youngman purchased 1,500 shares of ABL stock.  On\rDecember 3, 1992, ABL publicly announced its intention to enter\rinto the joint venture agreement with Congoleum.  The\rannouncement caused the price of ABL\s stock to increase four\rpoints, or approximately 25%.  Youngman realized approximately\r$9,000 in ill-gotten gains.\r\r     Marcus and Youngman consented to the entry of Final\rJudgments of Permanent Injunction against them, restraining and\renjoining them from committing further violations of Section\r10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; ordering\rYoungman to disgorge his illegal trading profits, plus\rprejudgment interest thereon; and imposing penalties on both\rYoungman and Marcus.\x0c\x1a"

Each\rdefendant consented to the entry of the final judgment against\rhim without admitting or denying the allegations in the\rComplaint.  The final judgments were entered by the Court on\rFebruary 12, 1996.\r\r     In this action, the Commission alleged that the defendants\rmanipulated the market for the securities of three issuers while\rthey were principals of a now defunct brokerage firm, Global\rAmerica, Inc. (Global).  Specifically, in February 1990, June\r1990 and September 1990, Global underwrote the initial public\rofferings (IPOs) of common stock and units of Capucino\s Inc.\r(Capucino\s), Mountaintop Corp.

The Commission alleged that Markowski and\rRiccio manipulated the market for these securities through\rGlobal\s high pressure sales tactics, its domination and control\rof the market for these securities, and its refusal to execute\rcustomer sell orders.  Global\s registered representatives, under\rthe direction and supervision of Markowski and Riccio, solicited\rpurchases of aftermarket common shares before the effective date\rof each of the IPOs and tied the purchase of aftermarket shares\rto the units, according to the Complaint.

The Court held that since Hughes\rCapital, Reifler, Beall and Knoblauch had been intentional\rparticipants in the scheme, they should be held jointly and\rseverally liable for the amount of the total which could not be\rtraced.

Earp and Silver are California residents. \r\r     Specifically, in its Complaint, the Commission alleges that\rthe defendants violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities\rAct of 1933 (Securities Act) by offering and selling to the\rpublic unregistered securities in the Ostrich Partnerships.  The\rComplaint also alleges that the defendants each violated Section\r17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities\rExchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder,\rby making untrue statements of material facts and by omitting to\rstate material facts in connection with the offer and sale of the\rOstrich Partnership securities.  In addition, the Complaint\ralleges that defendants Earp and Silver violated Section 15(a) of\rthe Exchange Act by acting as brokers in connection with the sale\rof the Ostrich Partnership securities without being registered\rwith the Commission as brokers.\r\r     The Commission alleges in its Complaint that, beginning in\rNovember 1993 and continuing into December 1994, the defendants\roffered and sold to the public investments designated as\rpartnership units (units) in the 17 Ostrich Partnerships.  The\runits, which were priced by Trans-American at between $7,500 and\r$20,000 each, were not registered as securities with the\rCommission.

Up to 50% of the proceeds from investments in the\rOstrich Partnership units were spent on sales and marketing\rrelated expenses.\r\r     The Commission also alleges that the defendants made\rmaterial misrepresentations and omissions in the offer and sale\rof at least some of the Ostrich Partnership securities.  For\rexample, a promotional brochure sent to potential investors in\rsome of the Ostrich Partnerships falsely depicts total returns on\rinvestments in the Ostrich Partnerships, rising from as high as\r45% in two years, 1,147% in five years, 5,003% in eight years,\rand up to 9,355% in ten years.  The Commission alleges that there\ris no reasonable basis for claiming that an investment in the\rOstrich Partnerships would produce such returns.  The Complaint\ralso alleges that the defendants made misleading statements\rconcerning the amount of the investors\ money that would be used\rto purchase ostriches and for working capital.  For example,\rinvestors were not informed that Silver, with Earp\s knowledge,\rdemanded and received kickbacks from a third party supplier in\rconnection with the business of Trans-American and certain of the\rOstrich Partnerships.  \r\r     The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the California\rDepartment of Corporations in this matter.\x0c\x1a"

Supp. 587 (S.D.N.Y. 1993), the\rdistrict court had found that Posner violated various provisions\rof the securities laws, repeatedly abused his position as an\rofficer and director of public corporations, and enriched himself\rat the expense of public shareholders.  Among the relief ordered\rwas an order barring Posner from serving as an officer or\rdirector of any public company and directing that Posner\s shares\rof any public company he controlled be placed in a voting trust. \rThe court of appeals affirmed the relief in a 1994 decision.  SEC\rv. Posner, 16 F.3d 520 (2d Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 115 S.Ct.\r724 (1995)(see Litigation Release No. 13977).\r\r     The voting trust order, entered March 2, 1994, provided that\rin any matter requiring a shareholder vote, the Trustee should\rvote Posner\s shares proportionately to how the other\rshareholders vote.  It provided that the Trustee could depart\rfrom proportionate voting only if necessary to carry out the\rpurposes of the final judgment against Posner and only if the\rdistrict court, after notice of the Trustee\s intention to depart\rfrom proportionate voting, did not direct otherwise.  \r\r     In June 1995, the Trustee notified the court that interest\rhad been expressed in the possible acquisition of Salem Corp., in\rwhich Posner is a controlling shareholder.  The Trustee informed\rthe court that if a merger were proposed for Salem, he\ranticipated voting the shares with respect to the merger as\rdirected by Posner, unless otherwise instructed by the court. \rThe SEC opposed that course of action and on June 30 the district\rcourt ordered the Trustee not to follow that course, but rather\rto vote the shares proportionately to how the non-Posner shares\rare voted.  That order was summarily affirmed by the court of\rappeals on March 8.\r\r     In an unpublished opinion, the court of appeals determined\rthat the district court did not abuse its discretion in entering\rthe June 30 order, which it found was entirely consistent with\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\rthe district court\s 1993 judgment against Posner and with the\rcourt of appeals\ 1994 affirmance of that order.  The court\rrelied on the district court\s well established general\requitable powers to fashion appropriate relief for violations of\rthe federal securities laws.  Moreover, the court of appeals\rheld, the order did not deprive Posner of the right to sell his\rshares, but only of the right to vote, so that his claim of\reconomic forfeiture was without merit.  The court also determined\rthat the order did not impose any economic fine or penalty on\rPosner, but only prevented him from voting, and did not violate\rthe excessive fines clause of the Eighth Amendment.  Nor was\rPosner deprived of property without due process since the order\rdid not restrict disposition of his shares and he had adequate\rnotice and opportunity to be heard.\r\r(See Litigation Release No. 11859; see also Litigation Releases\rNos. 11859, 12062, 12454, 13588, 13891.)   \x0c\x1a"

The Complaint alleges that Dankovich used high\rpressure sales tactics to convince investors to purchase various\rfeatured securities, which were actually listed securities that\rDankovich claimed to be able to sell for a below market price. \rThe Complaint alleges that T.

The Complaint alleges that investors paid at least\r$43,877 to T.

According to the Complaint, Dankovich falsely\rrepresented that the club, which did not actually exist, had\rfunds at a different brokerage firm which he intended to wire to\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\rthe newly opened investment club account.  The Complaint alleges\rthat shortly after the account was opened, and after falsely\rstating that he was wiring money into the new cash account,\rDankovich directed the brokerage firm to purchase a specified\rstock for the account.  The Complaint further alleges that\rDankovich did not intend to pay for the securities, or intended\rto pay for them solely with the proceeds from their sale.  The\rComplaint alleges that the brokerage firm incurred a loss of\rapproximately $3,964 when the value of stock declined and\rDankovich refused to pay for stock purchase he had directed.\r\r     Simultaneously with the filing of the Complaint, the\rDankoviches, without admitting or denying any of the allegations\rin the Complaint, consented to the entry of an order enjoining\rthem from violating the relevant provisions of the securities\rlaws, and requiring them to pay $51,653, an amount representing\rthe disgorgement of their illegal profits plus prejudgment\rinterest.

The\rorder comes just eight weeks after the Court specifically\renjoined the defendants from selling such unregistered investment\rcontracts.  See SEC v. Life Partners, Inc., 912 F.

VICTOR R. GOMEZ, United\rStates District Court for the Southern District of New York, 96\rCiv. No. 96-2056 (LMM)\r\r     The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission)\rannounced the filing today of a Complaint in the United States\rDistrict Court for the Southern District of New York against\rVictor R. Gomez, a former vice president in Chemical Banking\rCorporation\s (Chemical) foreign exchange trading group.  The\rComplaint alleges that in 1994 Gomez engaged in a series of\runauthorized, multi-million dollar foreign currency transactions\rinvolving the Mexican peso, and concealed his unauthorized\ractivity by creating fictitious records for certain transactions\rand by failing to record others.  According to the Complaint,\rGomez\ unauthorized currency trading placed Chemical in a multi-\rmillion dollar, unhedged position in the Mexican peso, which\rresulted in a loss of approximately $69 million for Chemical when\rthe value of the peso dramatically fell in December 1994 after\rthe Mexican government announced it would no longer support the\rcurrency.  The Complaint alleges that because of Gomez\\rfictitious records and false statements to supervisors, Chemical\rofficials initially were unaware of the open peso position.  As a\rresult, Chemical falsely reported to securities analysts that the\r\rbank had minimal exposure from the peso devaluation even as\rChemical in fact faced material, and mounting losses from Gomez\\runauthorized trading activity.  The Complaint charges Gomez with\rviolating Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange\rAct of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1\rthereunder.  \r\r     Specifically, the Complaint alleges that Gomez, to whom\rChemical assigned primary responsibility for its Mexican peso\rtransactions in 1994, entered into nine unauthorized\rconvertibility guarantee contracts, made two unauthorized fund\rtransfers and executed seventeen unauthorized and unhedged\rcurrency trades.  Each convertibility guarantee obligated\rChemical to exchange from $13 million to $175 million for pesos\rat the market rate on specified future dates.  The Complaint\ralleges that Gomez did not disclose the convertibility\rguarantees, and kept the documents associated with them in his\rdesk drawer.  The Complaint also alleges that Gomez recorded\rfictitious trades to make it appear that fees and interest earned\ras a result of the undisclosed convertibility guarantees and\rundisclosed fund transfers were profits generated from Gomez\\rtrading.  \x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\r     The Complaint alleges that in November 1994, Gomez began\racquiring a long forward position in the peso in violation of his\rtrading authority.  According to the Complaint, Gomez created\rfictitious records to make it appear that he had, as required by\rChemical, balanced his trades in the peso with offsetting trades\rin the dollar.  According to the Complaint, these fictitious\rrecords masked the fact that Gomez had placed Chemical in a net\rlong position in the Mexican peso of approximately $171.5 million\ras of the close of trading on December 19, 1994, just prior to\rthe devaluation of the peso.  \r\r     Simultaneously with the filing of the Complaint, Gomez,\rwithout admitting or denying any of the allegations in the\rComplaint, consented to the entry of an order enjoining him from\rviolating Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, and\rRules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder.  \r\r     The Commission\s action was coordinated with the United\rStates Attorney for the Southern District of New York, who today\rannounced criminal charges against Gomez, and with the Federal\rReserve Board, which also today announced the issuance of an\rOrder of Prohibition against Gomez.\x0c\x1a"

Baker of Wayland, Massachusetts, for\rinsider trading in connection with purchases of the securities of\rPurolator Products Company (Purolator).  The defendants\\rpurchases of Purolator securities occurred from September 12,\r1994 through the trading day immediately preceding the October 3,\r1994 announcement that Mark IV Industries, Inc. (Mark IV)\rintended to acquire Purolator.  Mark IV acquired Purolator by\rmeans of a tender offer conducted through a Mark IV subsidiary.\r\r     The complaint alleges that defendant Shepard obtained\rmaterial, nonpublic information about the negotiations between\rMark IV and Purolator from his business associate, who was a\rPurolator director.  Shepard\s business associate gave him the\rinformation because the associate expected to be having\rcommunications concerning the merger negotiations at the office\rthat he shared with Shepard, where he had little if any privacy. \rShepard agreed to keep the information confidential and not to\rtrade.  His assurances to his associate notwithstanding, Shepard\rlater tipped defendant Sargent, his friend and dentist, about the\rnegotiations.  After obtaining this information from Shepard,\rSargent purchased 20,400 Purolator shares over the next three\rweeks.  Sargent tipped defendant Scharn, who purchased 5,000\rPurolator shares, and defendant Baker, Sargent\s accountant, who\rpurchased 1,000 shares.  The complaint alleges that, after being\rtipped, Sargent discussed Purolator with two additional persons,\rwho thereafter purchased a total of 800 Purolator shares.\r\r     On the day of the Purolator/Mark IV announcement, the price\rof Purolator common stock closed at $24.625, up $6.625 over the\rprevious trading day\s close.

(MP)\r\rThe Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) announced\rthat, on February 20, 1996, after a trial on the merits, Judge\rMilton Pollack of the United States District Court, Southern\rDistrict of New York, issued permanent injunctions against Dennis\rLindsay Helliwell (Helliwell) and The Helliwell Group Limited\r(Helliwell Group).  The Court continued to freeze the\rdefendants\ assets despite a motion by the defendants to lift the\rCourt\s previous asset freeze.  The Court left the issue as to\rthe amount of disgorgement and civil penalties open.  The\rPermanent Injunction Orders stem from a Complaint filed by the\rCommission against the defendants on February 13, 1996, seeking,\ramong other things, injunctive relief, disgorgement and civil\rpenalties.\r\rIn granting the Commission\s request for permanent injunctions\ragainst the defendants, the Court made detailed Findings of Fact\rand Conclusions of Law (Findings).  As detailed in the\rFindings, from in or before April 1995 through the present,\rdefendants Helliwell and the Helliwell Group raised at least\r$2,580,000 from at least thirty investors for whom the defendants\rwere providing various financial services.  The Findings state\rthat Helliwell falsely told investors that he would invest their\rfunds at Marine Midland Bank (Marine Midland) in a large pool\rof funds, where the investors would receive an 18%-20% return on\rtheir investments.  The Findings further state that, in return,\rHelliwell provided investors with notes which indicated that\rtheir money was invested in this pool of money.  The Findings\ralso state that Helliwell never invested the investors\ funds in\rany pool of funds at Marine Midland.  Instead, Helliwell\rmisappropriated most of the investors\ funds.\r\rFor further information, see Lit. Rel. No. 14816.\x0c\x1a"

FREDERICK AUGUSTUS MORAN,\rET AL., Civil Action No. 95-4472 (S.D.N.Y. April 2, 1996)\r\r     On April 2, 1996, Judge Bernard Newman, sitting by\rdesignation in the United States District Court for the Southern\rDistrict of New York, issued an Opinion and Order dismissing\rinsider trading claims against all defendants and finding that\rdefendants Frederick A. Moran Sr. (Moran Sr.) and Moran Asset\rManagement Inc. (MAM) breached their fiduciary duty and defrauded\rtheir clients in violation of Section 206(2) of the Advisers Act.\r\rThe Court also found that Moran Sr. and MAM wilfully violated the\rdisclosure requirements of Sections 204 and 207 of the Advisers\rAct and Rule 204-1(b)(1) thereunder and that Moran Sr. and\rdefendant Moran & Associates Inc. Securities Brokerage (MSB)\rviolated the registration requirements of Section 15(b) of the\rExchange Act and Rule 15b3-1 thereunder.  \r\r      Moran Jr. was a telecommunications analyst at Salomon\rBrothers who worked on the Bell Atlantic/TCI/Liberty\rCommunications transaction.  Moran Sr. purchased 340,799 TCI\rClass A common shares and 203,200 Liberty Class A shares for\rmanaged, personal and family accounts on the last two days before\rthe public announcement of the transaction.  The Commission\ralleged that Moran Jr. had tipped his father about the\rtransaction and that Moran Sr. made the purchases while in\rpossession of material non-public information.  The Court found\rthe Commission had not sustained its burden of proof as to that\rcontention, although, according to the Court, [s]urely one\rpossible inference that can reasonably be drawn from the evidence\rpresented in this case is that Moran Sr. purchased cable security\rstocks based on material nonpublic information provided to him by\rMoran Jr.  But this inference, however, is not the most likely\rscenario suggested by the proof.  And the Court further states:\rthe evidence in this case, while not showing an intent on the\rpart of Moran Jr. to violate the law in order to assist his\rfather, nonetheless illustrates Moran Jr.\s willingness to\rprovide information to his father, even if doing so is contrary\rto the established policies of Salomon Brothers or the wishes of\rhis firm\s clients.  While the Court found that the Commission\rfailed to establish a tip prior to Moran Sr.\s trades,  the Court\rfound that the merger details relayed by Moran Jr. on the\revening of October 12 were still confidential non-public\rinformation  but not actionable because Moran Sr. had completed\rhis trades before then.    \r\r     With respect to the Commission\s other claims, the Court\rfound that Moran Sr. and MAM negligently allocated shares of\rtelecommunications stocks purchased in advance of the announce-\rment of the Bell Atlantic/TCI/Liberty Communications merger to\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\rhis personal, family, and firm accounts while allocating to their\rinvestment advisory clients shares of those securities purchased\rat higher prices, in violation of Section 206(2) of the Advisers\rAct. The Court also found that Moran Sr., MAM and MSB failed to\rdisclose that Moran Sr.\s sons Frederick W. Moran Jr. (Moran Jr.)\rand Clayton Moran were directors of MAM and MSB.  Judge Newman\rfound Moran Sr. acted with knowledge and intended to conceal\rthat his sons were directors.  Certainly this is an indication\rthat he was acting surreptitiously .... the fact that the sons\rwere still omitted even though the form was supposedly corrected,\rleads to the unmistakable conclusion that the omissions were\rintentional.  Accordingly, Moran Sr. and MAM violated Sections\r204 of the Advisers Act and Rule 204-1(b)(1), which require the\rprompt amendment of an investment adviser\s registration\rstatement if it becomes inaccurate, and Section 207 of the\rAdviser\s Act, which prohibits investment advisers from making\rwillful material misstatements or omissions in registrations\rfiled with the Commission.  Moran Sr. and MSB violated Section\r15(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 15b3-1 because they failed to\ramend their inaccurate broker dealer registration.\r\r     Judge Newman directed the parties to contact the Court\rwithin thirty days to establish a date for a hearing on the\rpenalty portion of this trial.  The action was commenced on June\r15, 1995 (see Litigation Release No. 14532) and was tried before\rthe Court in December 1995.\x0c\x1a"

Also beginning in 1984, certain senior managers at\rGruntal opened securities accounts at Gruntal under fictitious\rcustomer names.  Approximately $5 million of the diverted assets\rwere moved to the fictitious customer accounts and then\rtransferred to Gruntal\s profit and loss accounts or used to make\roff-books payments of Gruntal expenses.  The remaining $6 million\rof the diverted assets were embezzled by certain of the members\rof Gruntal senior management implementing the schemes.\r\r     The Order also finds that, in furtherance of these schemes,\rthe senior Gruntal managers implementing the diversions falsified\rGruntal\s books and records.

N.D.N.Y.)\r\r\r     On March 28, 1996, The Bennett Funding Group, Inc., (BFG),\ra finance company headquartered in Syracuse, New York, Patrick R.\rBennett, the chief financial officer of BFG, two of BFG\s wholly-\rowned subsidiaries, Bennett Receivables Corporation (BRC) and\rBennett Receivables Corporation-II (BRC-II), and Bennett\rManagement and Development Corporation (BMDC), were charged\rwith fraudulently offering and selling more than $570 million of\rsecurities.  The Commission\s Complaint alleges that since 1991,\rthe defendants have been engaged in a massive ongoing Ponzi\rscheme, employing misstatments and omissions of material fact. \rThe securities were supposed assignments of equipment leases\r(Lease Assignments), as well as promissory notes (Notes)\rissued by BFG, BRC, or BRC-II.   \r\r       The Commission alleges that Patrick Bennett and the other\rdefendants defrauded investors by selling tens of millions of\rdollars of Lease Assignments for office equipment leases that\rsimply did not exist, including the assignment of over $55\rmillion of fictitious and supposedly tax-exempt New York City\rTransit Authority leases.  The Commission further alleges that in\rcases where the defendants did have an underlying lease, the\rdefendants sometimes fraudulently purported to sell to investors\rleases they had already sold to other investors.   \r\r     The Commission\s Complaint alleges that Patrick Bennett, BFG\rand BMDC also engaged in numerous sham transactions that enabled\rBFG to issue audited financial statements for 1992 and 1993\rshowing it to be a profitable company, when in fact it was losing\rmoney.  In 1992 BFG reported pre-tax income in excess of $2\rmillion, when it should have shown a net loss of at least $1.5\rmillion.  Similarly, in 1993, BFG reported pretax income in\rexcess of $2.6 million, when it should have shown a net loss of\rat least $2.5 million.  The Complaint alleges that these\rtransactions were facilitated by false invoices and other\rdocuments that Patrick Bennett caused to be created, and that\rPatrick Bennett and BFG lied to the company\s auditors to conceal\rthe fraud.  The Complaint alleges that the fraudulent financials\rwere included in the offering documents provided to investors in\rconnection with the sale of an estimated $150 million in Notes. \x0c\r\r\r\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\r     Moreover, the Commission alleges that defendants failed to\rdisclose that millions of dollars collected from investors were \r\r                              - 2 -\r\rbeing diverted from BFG to Patrick Bennett and to BMDC, a shell\rcompany that he owns.  The Commission alleges that during the\rthree-year period from 1992 through 1994, a total of more than\r$900 million was transferred to BMDC from BFG\s general operating\raccount -- an account funded, in part, with the proceeds of the\rsale of BFG Lease Assignments and Notes.  The Complaint alleges\rthat since 1992, BMDC has paid Patrick Bennett over $10 million,\rand BMDC has also paid over $30 million to various people and\rentities connected to Patrick Bennett and members of his family.\r\r     The Commission seeks permanent injunctions against future\rviolations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933,\rSection 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule\r10b-5 thereunder (anti-fraud provisions), disgorgement of all\rill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. \r\r\r     On March 29, 1996, the four corporate defendants, BFG, BMDC,\rBRC and BRC-II, filed for protection pursuant to Chapter 11 of\rthe Bankruptcy Code.

B.\rBingham (Bingham), Susan McKenna Grant (Grant), and William\rJ. McClintock (McClintock), former senior executives of Alias\rResearch, Inc. (Alias).  The complaint alleges that, under the\rdirection of Bingham and with the participation of Grant and\rMcClintock, Alias recognized revenue from transactions that did\rnot meet the revenue recognition requirements of generally\raccepted accounting principles.  One of these transactions\rinvolved a purported agreement to distribute $1.5 million of\rsoftware, the fourth-largest sale ever for Alias.  The complaint\ralleges that, at the time of the transaction, the customer did\rnot have the ability to sell $1.5 million of Alias\s products,\rnor the ability to pay for the software.  Thus, according to the\rcomplaint, the parties understood that Alias would not receive\rpayment for the product unless and until the products had been\rresold to an end user.  In addition, the complaint alleges that\rAlias had significant continuing sales and support obligations,\rthat no product was shipped during the quarter in which revenue\rwas recognized, and that the size of the transactions was\rgoverned, not by the quantity of product that the customer\rrequired, but by the level of revenue needed to reach Bingham\s\rearnings targets.\r\r     With respect to the other transactions, the complaint\ralleges that Alias entered into agreements not to collect payment\rand to attempt to obtain financing for a purported purchaser that\rwas unlikely, because of its financial condition, to obtain\rfinancing.  With respect to a $1 million transaction for which\rAlias recognized revenue during the second quarter of fiscal\r1992, the complaint alleges that an Alias executive signed a side\rletter which excused the purchaser from payment of $750,000 of\rthe purchase price if the customer was not satisfied.  The\rcomplaint alleges that the Defendants knew, or were reckless in\rnot knowing, of the terms of these transactions.  The complaint\rfurther alleges that, between May 31 and July 2, 1991, Bingham,\rGrant, and McClintock, while in possession of material, nonpublic\rinformation regarding the true nature of the company\s financial\rcondition, sold shares of Alias stock and, thereby, avoided\rlosses of $1,713,000, $1,370,000, and $358,282, respectively.\r\r     According to the complaint, as a result of the improper\rrecognition of those transactions, Alias issued materially false\rand misleading financial statements for the first and second\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\rquarters of its fiscal year ended January 31, 1992.  The\rcomplaint alleges that Alias overstated revenue in the first and\rsecond quarters by $1,909,000 and $1,000,000, respectively, and\rthat Alias reported a pretax profit of $888,000 for the first\rquarter, when in fact Alias should have reported a loss of\r$906,000.  In addition, the Complaint alleges that Alias reported\ra pretax profit of $$1,164,000 for the second quarter, when Alias\rshould have reported income of $164,000.  The complaint further\ralleges that the defendants caused Alias\s materially false and\rmisleading financial statements to be included in the company\s\rForm 10-Q quarterly reports filed with the Commission and that\rthey made repeated false statements to accountants in order to\rcover up their actions.\r\r     The complaint charges that Bingham, Grant, and McClintock \rviolated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities\rAct) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934\r(Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-2 thereunder, that\rBingham and Grant violated, under a control person theory,\rSections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(a) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act\rand Rules 13a-13 and 12b-20 thereunder, and, in addition, that\rBingham and McClintock violated Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange\rAct and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder.\r\r     The Commission is seeking an order permanently enjoining the\rdefendants from future violations of those provisions, requiring\rthem to pay civil penalties and to disgorge the amount of losses\ravoided plus interest, and prohibiting them from serving as\rofficers or directors of a publicly-held issuer.\x0c\x1a"

Specifically,\rSinyard failed to obey two Court orders relating to discovery. \rAdditionally, Sinyard also failed, after being properly served,\rto appear for his deposition on two occasions, to serve answers\ror objections to interrogatories and to serve a written response\rto a document request.\r\rThe Amended Complaint alleged that between December 1987 and\rMarch 1991, Defendants Sinyard, Poulakidas, Depoister, Jarco,\rInc.

As a result, over $1\rmillion was raised from at least twenty-three investors residing\rin Illinois and Indiana.  In connection therewith, Sinyard,\rPoulakidas, Depoister, Jarco and FRA misrepresented and omitted\rto state material facts regarding the investment.  Specifically,\rinvestors were told that their funds would be used to help\rfinance Jarcos costs associated with obtaining a several billion\rdollar loan for a trust purportedly located in Mexico (Trust). \rThe defendants further represented that investors would quickly\rrecoup their principal investment funds and receive returns of up\rto 200%.  However, the loan has never closed and investors have\rneither recouped their investments nor received their promised\rreturns.

Proc.

KSR, a Massachusetts-based manufacturer of high\rperformance computer systems, is presently in a bankruptcy\rproceeding.\r\r     The Complaint, filed on April 29, 1996, alleges that the\rdefendants violated the anti-fraud, periodic reporting, books and\rrecords, and internal accounting controls provisions of the\rfederal securities laws.  The individual defendants are alleged\rto have caused KSR to issue materially false and misleading\rfinancial statements for fiscal year 1992 and the first two\rquarters of 1993, which overstated the Company\s revenues and\rearnings.  In addition, the Complaint alleges that Burkhardt,\rAppleton Jones and Wassmann sold KSR stock while in possession of\rmaterial nonpublic information regarding the Company\s true\rfinancial condition.\r\r     The Complaint alleges that the individual defendants repeat-\redly caused KSR to recognize revenue from purported sales of\rits computers that were subject to material contingencies\rrendering revenue recognition improper under Generally Accepted\rAccounting Principles (GAAP).  In a number of instances,\rpayment by KSR\s customers was contingent on the buyers\ receipt\rof outside funding from third parties.  Certain of these\rcontingencies were contained in side letters to the purported\rsales contracts.  The Complaint alleges that Burkhardt, Appleton\rJones and Wassmann failed to inform KSR\s independent auditors,\rPrice Waterhouse & Co., as well as the Company\s finance\rdepartment, that transactions upon which the Company had\rrecognized sales revenue were subject to such material\rcontingencies, or misrepresented the status of the customer\s\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\rfunding arrangements.  As a result of these improper revenue\rrecognition practices, KSR\s financial statements, as included in\rthe Company\s annual report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 1992,\rits quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the first two fiscal\rquarters of 1993 and a registration statement on Form S-1 for a\rMarch 1993 secondary offering, were materially false and\rmisleading.    \r\r     The Complaint also alleges that Burkhardt, Appleton Jones\rand Wassmann sold shares of the Company\s common stock during\rAugust 1993 while in possession of material nonpublic information\rconcerning the Company\s true financial condition and results of\roperations.  Specifically, the Complaint alleges that these\rindividuals knew or were reckless in not knowing, at the time of\rtheir trades, that a substantial portion of KSR\s reported\rrevenue during 1992 and the first two quarters of 1993 did not\rconform with GAAP requirements for revenue recognition and that\rthe Company\s controller had deemed a substantial portion of\rKSR\s receivables to be uncollectible.\r\r     With respect to KSR, the Complaint seeks a permanent\rinjunction against further violations of Section 17(a) of the\rSecurities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Sections 10(b),\r13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange\rAct of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 13a-1, 13a-13, and\r12b-20 thereunder.  The Complaint seeks the following from the\rindividual defendants: (i) a permanent injunction from future\rviolations of anti-fraud, periodic reporting, books and records\rand internal accounting controls provisions of the federal\rsecurities laws; (ii) disgorgement of a sum equivalent to losses\ravoided from the sale of KSR common stock and prejudgment\rinterest thereon; (iii) payment of civil penalties; and (iv),\rwith respect to Burkhardt and Appleton Jones, an Order that they\rbe prohibited from serving as officers or directors of any public\rcompany.\r\r     Simultaneously with the filing of the Complaint, the\rCommission submitted to the Court a proposed Final Judgment as to\rHenry Burkhardt III, consented to by Burkhardt, without admitting\ror denying the allegations contained in the Commission\s\rComplaint.

Wassmann III, consented to by Wassmann,\rwithout admitting or denying the allegations contained in the\rCommission\s Complaint.  The Final Judgment: (i) permanently\renjoins Wassmann from future violations of Section 17(a) of the\rSecurities Act and Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A),\r13(b)(2)(B), and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5,\r13a-1, 13a-13, 12b-20, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder, and (ii)\rorders Wassmann to pay disgorgement of $197,994, representing his\rlosses avoided through his sale of KSR common stock, plus\rprejudgment interest thereon in the amount of $43,554, but waives\rpayment of all but $40,000 of that amount based on Wassmann\s\rdemonstrated inability to pay a greater amount.  In conjunction\rwith this injunctive proceeding, Wassmann has consented to the\rentry of an Order, pursuant to Rule 102(2)(3)(i) of the\rCommission\s Rules of Practice, permanently denying him the\rprivilege of appearing or practicing as an accountant before the\rCommission, with the right to apply for readmission after five\ryears from the date of entry of the Order. \r\r     In a related matter, on April 29, 1996, the Commission\rinstituted and simultaneously settled a public administrative\rproceeding pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act\rof 1934 as to Thomas J.

Watley, a/k/a Ted\rWatley (Watley), a local radio personality, and two entities he\rcontrols: Power 2000 and Ted\s Neutral Corner, Inc. (Ted\s\rNeutral Corner).  The action also seeks a freeze of assets\ragainst all three defendants.\r\r     The Commission\s complaint alleges that, from at least\rNovember 1995 through the present, Watley, a convicted felon, has\rengaged in a $2.8 million fraudulent offering of securities in\rPower 2000, an entity that claims to promote the economic\rempowerment of the African-American community in Philadelphia,\rPennsylvania.  Watley specifically targeted African-American\rinvestors in communities in Philadelphia and the surrounding\rarea.  He solicited them through a local radio talk show known as\rTed\s Neutral Corner, as well as through other means. \rAccording to the Commission\s complaint, the defendants lured\rinvestors into Power 2000 by falsely claiming that over 80\rpercent of the funds would be held in interest bearing accounts\rfor a period of one year, after which time they would be\rinvested, for a profit to investors, at the discretion of an\rappointed Power 2000 board of directors.  Each investor was\rrequired to pay $1,440 in the form of twelve monthly installment\rpayments.  According to the complaint, to date, at least $61,141\rhas been raised from 162 investors, and nearly all of the money\rhas been misappropriated.  Contrary to the representations made\rto investors, Watley used the Power 2000 investor funds to pay\rpersonal expenses and purported business expenses of Power 2000\rand Ted\s Neutral Corner.\r\r     The Commission also alleges that, in furtherance of the\rscheme, Watley, Power 2000 and Ted\s Neutral Corner made\rmaterially false and misleading statements to investors\rconcerning, among other things, the degree of risk inherent in\rthe investment.  They touted the Power 2000 investment as\rprofitable, yet failed to disclose any financial information\rabout Power 2000 or Ted\s Neutral Corner, including the fact that\rTed\s Neutral Corner owed substantial obligations, and derived\rnearly all of its income from the Power 2000 investor funds.  In\raddition, although he portrayed himself as a successful\rbusinessman, Watley had a record of criminal convictions for\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\rfraud-related offenses, a fact that was never disclosed to\rinvestors.  The defendants also failed to disclose that Power\r\r                              - 2 -\r\r2000 did not have a license to conduct business in Pennsylvania.\r\r     In the action, the Commission charges Watley, Power 2000 and\rTed\s Neutral Corner with violations of Section 17(a) of the\rSecurities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities\rExchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The Government alleges that Taylor willfully and\rflagrantly violated an asset freeze order and other orders\rentered in a separate civil securities enforcement action brought\rby the Commission against Taylor and the Better Life Club of\rAmerica, Inc., a corporation founded and controlled by Taylor. \rSecurities and Exchange Commission v.

Upon\rconviction of the contempt charge, Taylor would face up to six\rmonths\ imprisonment or a fine of up to $5,000.\r\r     In the contempt proceedings, the Government alleges: \rBeginning moments after the freeze order was entered in the\rCommission\s action on September 1, 1995, and continuing for a\rperiod of seven months, Taylor used concealed bank accounts to\rengage in at least 232 prohibited banking transactions, including\r$246,000 in withdrawals and $344,000 in deposits.  The deposits\rincluded at least 172 investor checks totaling over $188,000,\rwhich Taylor failed to turn over to the SEC or the court-\rappointed special administrator as directed by Judge Hogan.  In\raddition, Taylor failed to disclose at least 15 bank accounts\rwhen ordered to do so by the Court, and went on to open -- and\rconceal -- six new accounts, in further violation of Judge\rHogan\s orders.\r\r     In the underlying civil enforcement action, the Commission\ralleges that Taylor and the Better Life Club operated a $47\rmillion Ponzi scheme in violation of the antifraud and\rregistration requirements of the federal securities laws. \rAccording to the Commission\s complaint, defendants promised to\rdouble investors\ money in 60 or 90 days allegedly through\rinvestments in advertising for the Club\s 900 telephone numbers\rand other profitable businesses, when in fact defendants used the\rinvestors\ funds almost exclusively to pay off earlier investors\rand to enrich Taylor, his children, and his live-in companion. \rThe scheme was halted by the Court pending a final determination\rof the Commission\s action.

FEHER, JR.( Feher ),\rthe former chairman and chief executive of Members Services\rCorporation, a public company located in Winter Park, Florida, \rwas convicted after a ten-day, jury trial before United States\rDistrict Judge Patricia Fawcett.  The case was prosecuted with\rthe assistance of the Commission by the United States Attorney s\rOffice for the Middle District of Florida.\r\r         FEHER, age 47, of Winter Park, Florida, was found guilty\rof twenty-seven counts of securities fraud,illegal sale of\r1,411,000 shares of unregistered common stock, mail fraud, wire\rfraud, money laundering and obstruction of a Commission\rinvestigation. \r\r         FEHER faces a maximum term of incarceration of 265 years\rand a maximum fine of $4,629,000. Sentencing is scheduled for\rAugust 26, 1996.\r\r         FEHER was convicted under an indictment which alleged\rthat between January 1992 and May 1993, FEHER engaged in a scheme\rto defraud public investors in Members common stock.  Between\rJanuary and March 1992, FEHER caused Members to issue  1,411,000\rshares of unregistered common stock, purportedly pursuant to\rRegulation S of the Securities Act of 1933, in the names of a\r95-year-old woman who lived with FEHER and his wife and seven\rBahamian companies that FEHER had secretly established.  FEHER\rand his accomplices then sold the stock into the Unites States\rmarket for approximately $5,500,000.\r\r         In order to obtain a higher price when selling the\runregistered common stock, FEHER manipulated the price of Members\rcommon stock by substantially overstating Members assets in\rMembers annual and quarterly reports filed with the Securities\rand Exchange Commission and issuing false and misleading press\rreleases concerning Members business operations.  Between March\r24, 1992 and June 3, 1992, FEHER manipulated the price of Members\rcommon stock from approximately $4.00 per share to approximately\r$12.00 per share, and thereafter maintained an artificially-high\rprice for Members common stock.\r\r         This is the first criminal prosecution involving a\rscheme to avoid the registration requirements of the Securities\rAct of 1933 through the sale of securities purportedly in\rreliance on the Regulation S exemption from such requirements.\rRegulation S provides a limited exemption from the federal\rregistration requirements for stock sold to overseas purchasers. \rRegulation S provides no exemption, however, for transactions\rdesigned as a scheme to avoid the registration requirements nor\rdoes it cover any sales of securities made in the United States. \x0c\x1a"

Erickson (Erickson), formerly Platinum\s\rChief Financial Officer, who is a certified public accountant\r(CPA), and Mark S. Tague, formerly Platinum\s Executive Vice\rPresident/Corporate Controller, who is an inactive CPA.  The\rComplaint alleges that during 1993 and early 1994, the defendants\rengaged in a fraudulent accounting scheme to overstate Platinum\s\rrevenue, earnings and cash received and understate the time the\rCompany was taking to collect its receivables, and to support\rthese misstatements and conceal them from the Company\s\rindependent auditors, among others, by backdating and withholding\rdocuments and manipulating the Company\s accounting records.  \r\r     According to the Complaint, the scheme involved, among other\rthings, the improper recording of revenue from a number of\rlicense agreements that were accompanied by an undisclosed side\rletter giving the customer the right to cancel the agreement for\ra period of time, the backdating of license agreements and\rshipping documents to record revenue prematurely, the holding\ropen of Platinum\s books for cash received, and the arbitrary\rreclassification of receivables as cash.  \r\r     In addition, the Complaint alleges, Blackie, Erickson and\rTague each sold Platinum common stock while they were in\rpossession of adverse material non-public information about\rPlatinum\s true financial condition, thereby avoiding trading\rlosses of $1,018,000, $498,000 and $960,000, respectively.  \rBlackie, Erickson and Tague also received bonuses of $128,125,\r$50,000 and $6,000, respectively, during the period of the\ralleged fraud based upon Platinum\s purportedly strong financial\rperformance.\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\r     The Commission charged that by the alleged conduct Blackie,\rErickson and Tague violated the antifraud and certain other\rprovisions of the federal securities laws, specifically, Section\r17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and\r13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5,\r13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder.  \r\r     The Commission also today entered cease and desist orders,\rby consent, as to Platinum based upon the alleged scheme, and as\rto two of its sales managers, John F. Keane and William B. Falk,\rbased upon acts that allegedly contributed to the scheme. \rFinally, Erickson and Tague have agreed to the institution of\radministrative proceedings pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the\rCommission\s Rules of Practice, upon entry of the injunctions,\rbarring Erickson permanently and barring Tague for a period of at\rleast five years from appearing or practicing before the\rCommission as an accountant. \r\r     Relief\r\r     Simultaneously with the filing of the Commission\s\rComplaint, Blackie, Erickson and Tague, without admitting or\rdenying the allegations of the Complaint, consented to the entry\rof Final Judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the\rprovisions of the federal securities laws charged against them,\rordering them to disgorge trading losses avoided and the\rpreviously noted bonuses paid to them by Platinum during the\rperiod of the alleged fraud, plus prejudgment interest thereon,\rand directing Blackie and Tague to pay civil money penalties of\r$100,000 and $50,000, respectively.

In the proposed Final Judgment to which Erickson\rconsented, the Court would not impose a civil money penalty and\rErickson\s disgorgement of trading losses avoided and bonuses\rreceived would be limited to $100,000, based upon his\rdemonstrated inability to pay and on amounts he previously dis-\rgorged in a related shareholder action.\x0c\x1a"

Named as\rdefendants were:\r\r     \xf9    Randall E. Bradbury (Bradbury), age 37, an investment\r          adviser and former resident of Syracuse, New York, who\r          fled the United States in 1994;\r\r     \xf9    The Bradbury Financial Group Inc. (BFG), a New York\r          corporation and registered investment adviser owned by\r          Bradbury, which was located in Whitesboro, New York;\r          and \r\r     \xf9    TBFG International, Ltd.

Bradbury\ralso failed to disclose material conflicts of interest with\rrespect to certain investments, recommended unsuitable\rinvestments, and acted as an unregistered broker-dealer.  Many of\rBradbury\s victims were retirees and other persons of limited\rmeans, and many of them met Bradbury through an evangelical\rchurch group.  The investments are now worthless.\r\r     Bradbury sold and recommended stock in Carib Med, Inc.\r(Carib Med), a now defunct developmental pharmaceutical company\ralso known as H. E. Stanley Pharmaceuticals, Inc., to advisory\rclients and other investors.  Among other things, Bradbury made\rfalse and misleading statements concerning the anticipated\rappreciation of the stock price and omitted material information\rconcerning Carib Med\s poor financial condition.  Bradbury failed\rto disclose to investors that he was selling them his own shares\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\rof Carib Med stock and failed to disclose his receipt of\rcommissions from the sale of securities of two other now defunct\rstart-up companies, Advanced Financial Group, Inc. (AFG) and\rInternational Consumers Bureau, as well as the fact that AFG was\rBradbury\s brother\s company.  \r\r     In addition, Bradbury and TBFG fraudulently induced\rinvestors to purchase TBFG stock, bonds, and notes by making\rfalse and misleading statements concerning TBFG\s purported plans\rto make a public offering, TBFG\s financial condition, and the\rstatus of TBFG\s purported projects -- which supposedly included,\ramong other things, gold mining, development and upgrading of\rtelecommunications systems, and the export \r\r                              - 2 -\r\rof caviar.  Bradbury and TBFG also defrauded investors by\rdisseminating financial projections which predicted millions of\rdollars in profits without any reasonable basis, and by failing\rto disclose the numerous hurdles that would have to be overcome\rbefore any of TBFG\s purported projects could result in actual\rrevenues for TBFG.  TBFG never completed arrangements for\rfinancing any of its supposed major projects, and never earned\rmore than several hundred dollars in revenue, all from\rimportation and sale of Russian craft items.\r\r     The Complaint charges all three defendants with violating\rSection 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act),\rand Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934\r(Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and charges Bradbury\rand BFG with also violating Sections 15(a) and (c) of the\rExchange Act and Rules 10b-3, 10b-10 and 15c1-2 thereunder, and\rSections 206(1), (2), and (3) of the Investment Advisers Act of\r1940, and seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement, and\rcivil penalties.\x0c\x1a"

The Court further ordered\rStuart to pay disgorgement in the amount of $735,000, including\rpre-judgment interest.  The Court waived payment of all but\r$225,000 of the disgorgement and declined to impose civil\rpenalties based upon sworn representations by Stuart concerning\rhis inability to pay the additional sum.\r  \r     In its complaint, the Commission alleged that Dan Stuart, in\rhis capacity as president of TransAmerica Wireless Systems, Inc.\r(TransAmerica), directed the use of television infomercials,\rmailings and telephone boiler rooms to sell interests in general\rpartnerships purportedly formed to develop multi-channel\rmicrowave distribution service (MMDS) wireless television\rsystems, also known as microwave pay television and wireless\rcable television.  Partnership interests were sold through\rTransAmerica, a Florida-based corporation, formerly located in\rFort Lauderdale, and  Intercontinental Telecommunications\rCorporation (ITC), a Florida corporation, formed by the\rprincipals of TransAmerica.  Each corporation is currently under\rthe control of a receiver.\r\r     The Commission alleges that agents of TransAmerica and ITC,\racting at the direction of Stuart and other principals,\rmisrepresented or failed to disclose material facts in connection\rwith the sales.  Among other misrepresentations, TransAmerica and\rITC claimed to be negotiating for FCC licenses when, in fact, no\rsuch negotiations were taking place.  Predictions were also made\rto the investors of the exorbitant profits to be made, when, in\rfact, there was no reasonable basis for the projections.\r\r     Until the appointment of a receiver, Danny Sterk was chief\rexecutive officer of TransAmerica and a principal of ITC.

The Amended Complaint\rcharges Olson with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities\rAct of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities\rExchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder for\rhis role and participation in the creation, implementation and\rmisappropriation of investor funds in connection with the offer\rand sale of interests in the Konex Roll Program, an investment\rwhich purportedly was designed to pool investor funds to purchase\rand trade in Prime Bank Instruments.   \r\r     The allegations in the Commission\s original Complaint\rcharged Joseph Polichemi (Polichemi), Lyle E. Neal (Neal), John\rD. Lauer, and their respective companies, Copol, Konex Holding\rCorp. (Konex), and Clifton Capital Investors L.P. (CCI), with\rviolations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section\r10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The\rCommission\s Complaint alleged that from January 1993 to the\rpresent, Konex raised at least $12.5 million from the Chicago\rHousing Authority (CHA) through the offer and sale of investment\rcontracts in the Roll Program.  In fact, the purported Roll\rProgram was nothing more than a scam to defraud investors.  Thus,\rthe Complaint alleged that Polichemi and Neal, through their\rrespective companies, made false and misleading statements\rregarding the use of CHA proceeds and the risks and returns\rassociated with the investment.  The Complaint further alleged\rthat Lauer, CHA\s Director of Risk Management and Benefits, among\rother things, made false and misleading statements to prospective\rinvestors concerning the rate of return the CHA earned and the\rcircumstances under which the CHA invested in the Roll Program.  \r\r     The Amended Complaint alleges that Olson created and\rinstituted the Roll Program with Polichemi, prepared and\rdisseminated to Neal and others the procedures he expected to be\rused to carry out the scheme and misappropriated investor funds\rfor his benefit and for the benefit of his partners in the\rscheme.  In the process, Olson made false and misleading\rstatements to others concerning the existence and legitimacy of\rthe Roll Program, the use of investor proceeds and the returns\rand risks of investing in the Roll Program with the knowledge and\rintent that such statements be disseminated to investors.  The\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\rAmended Complaint seeks the entry of orders of preliminary and\rpermanent injunction, \r\r                              - 2 -\r\r\rdisgorgement including prejudgment interest, an asset freeze and \rcivil penalties against Olson.\r\r     The Honorable Wayne R.

Thereafter, on July 29,\r1994, the Court entered an Order of Permanent Injunction and\rOther Equitable Relief by Default against Polichemi, Neal, Copol\rand Konex, leaving only the amount of disgorgement and civil\rpenalties at issue.  On October 24, 1995, the Court entered, by\rconsent, an Order of Permanent Injunction and Other Equitable\rRelief against Lauer and CCI.  That order required Lauer and CCI\rto disgorge $4.853 million plus prejudgment interest.  \r\r     Olson, Polichemi, Neal and Lauer are also defendants in\rcriminal actions brought by the United States Attorney\s Office\rfor the Northern District of Illinois for their involvement in\rthe Roll Program fraud.

(RPP), reflected in his Memorandum\rto the Court dated April 11, 1996.  \r\r     The settlement of the class actions, In re Salomon Inc\rSecurities Litigation, required the payment of $54.5 million from\rthe Civil Claims Fund established in the SECs civil enforcement\raction, SEC v.

Under the\rterms of the Final Judgment in the SECs action, no payment can\rbe made from the Civil Claims Fund to certain persons if the Fund\rAdministrator finds, after consultation with the Commission, that\rby reason of such persons participation in the activities\ralleged in the complaint, it would be inequitable or otherwise\rinconsistent with the purposes of the Final Judgment to permit\rthat person to receive such a payment.  On January 30, 1995, the\rFund Administrator made such a determination with respect to\rRosenfeld and thus found that he was ineligible to receive\rapproximately $681,000 from the Civil Claims Fund, which\rdetermination was subsequently approved by the District Court. \r\r     In March 1996, the Fund Administrators determination was\rvacated by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and\rthe matter was remanded to the District Court for further\rfindings by the Fund Administrator.  The Fund Administrator\rsubsequently made those findings in the April 11, 1996\rMemorandum, and again determined that Rosenfeld was ineligible to\rreceive monies from the Civil Claims Fund. \x0c\x1a"

These funds represent retainer and other payments that\rMcNair received from Taylor during the spring and summer of 1995,\rbut had not earned as of September 1, 1995, the date the court\rentered an order freezing Taylor\s and the Better Life Club\s\rassets.  See SEC Lit. Rel. No. 14624 (Sept. 5, 1995).  The monies\rto be repaid by McNair will be added to the approximately $2.7\rmillion being held by the special administrator to compensate\rinvestor losses in the event that the Commission prevails in its\raction.\r\r     In a written decision, Judge Hogan found that during the\rsummer of 1995, a period during which Taylor paid McNair $450,000\rin fees and retainers, McNair was aware of the SEC\s\rinvestigation and the potential for an asset freeze.  Although\rsome of McNair\s retainer agreements specified that the payments\rwere nonrefundable, the court invalidated those provisions as\ragainst public policy, finding that they were designed, at least\rin part, to shield some of Taylor\s assets from potential seizure\rby the SEC.  Judge Hogan said that these provisions limit[] the\rSEC\s ability to make investors whole if the illegal Ponzi scheme\rnature of Taylor\s operation is established.\r\r     As an alternative basis for ordering McNair to return the\runearned fees, the court held that McNair was not a bona fide\rpurchaser for value of the funds, since his mere promise to\rperform future services did not constitute value given in\rexchange for the funds.\r\r     Finally, Judge Hogan ruled that if McNair wishes to assert\rthat he is financially unable to repay the $380,455, he shall\rsubmit a detailed affidavit by May 30, 1996, explaining his\rinability to pay, and the court will thereafter hold an\revidentiary hearing to consider the appropriate course of action.\x0c\x1a"

The Complaint further alleges that Pate frequently told\rinvestors that they were guaranteed not to loose any principal\rwhen investing in the program.  In reality, the Mart Bonus\rProgram was nothing more than an elaborate Ponzi scheme designed\rby Pate to defraud investors and enable her to misappropriate\rfunds for her personal and business use.

During the offering period, CCLP\rinterests totaling more than $30 million were purchased by over\r700 investors residing in 28 states and the District of Columbia.\r\r     Colonial, located in West Hartford, Connecticut, was a\rsyndicator of real estate limited partnerships.  According to the\rcomplaint, Colonial salespeople, with the knowledge, approval\rand/or participation of the Defendants, solicited investors with\rnumerous false and misleading statements, and utilized high-\rpressure sales tactics, to encourage them to invest.  The\rDefendants knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that Colonial\s\roffering materials contained material misstatements and omissions\rregarding the revenues, operations, financial reserves, rental\rincome, and cash flow of Constitution Plaza, the underlying asset\rof CCLP.  Although the CCLP offering was purportedly a private\rplacement to accredited investors, Colonial sold limited\rpartnership units to far more than the 35 nonaccredited investors\rpermitted by Commission regulations.\r\r     The complaint also alleged that, with the knowledge,\rapproval and/or participation of various Defendants:  Colonial\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\rconcealed its financial problems from investors as the CCLP\roffering progressed; Defendants Googel, B. Sisti and Candelori\rsigned false certifications in connection with the sale of\rinvestor notes to financial institutions; and Colonial failed to\rdisclose that distributions to investors in its partnerships were\rfunded frequently by loans from other partnerships.  In\rSeptember 1990, shortly after the CCLP offering was suspended,\rColonial was forced into bankruptcy and CCLP limited partners\rsubsequently lost their entire investment.\r\r(For further information, See Litigation Release Nos. 14432,\r14448, 14612 and 14723) \x0c\x1a"

The Complaint further\ralleges that Rogers, Hitt and Armijo caused Comparator to file\rthese false financial statements for the purpose of enabling\rComparator common stock to remain  listed for trading on the\rNational Association of Securities Dealers\ Automated Quotation\r(NASDAQ) SmallCap Market System and to facilitate the sale of\rComparator common stock to the public. \r\r     The Complaint also alleges that the defendants made mater-\rially false and misleading statements to investors and\rprospective investors concerning Comparator\s technology,\rincluding claims that Comparator owned certain patents and\rlicenses that in fact it did not own.  According to the\rComplaint, defendants, among other fraudulent misrepresentations,\rclaimed that Comparator had developed a new generation of\rfingerprint identification technology with substantial market\rpotential, and demonstrated to prospective investors a device\rpurportedly employing that new technology.  The Complaint alleges\rthat, in fact, Rogers and Hitt had stolen a prototype of a device\rdeveloped by individuals not associated with Comparator, who were\ractively attempting to have the device returned. \x0c\r\r\r\r\r\r     On May 31, 1996, the Honorable Lourdes G.

In addition, the Commission\s complaint\ralleges that defendants\ falsification of Comparator\s books and\rrecords and failure to implement proper internal controls\rconstituted violations of Section 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of the\rExchange Act by all defendants and, in addition, violations of\rSection 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 by Rogers,\rHitt and Armijo.\r\r     The Commission seeks, from all defendants, permanent\rinjunctions against future violations of the above provisions of\rthe federal securities laws and civil penalties and, in addition,\ran order barring Rogers, Hitt and Armijo from serving in the\rfuture as an officer or director of any public corporation.  \r\r     The Commission\s investigation is continuing as to other\rissues concerning Comparator and trading in its securities.

Billings, Senior\rJudge for the United States District Court for the District of\rVermont, issued a Final Judgment of Permanent Injunction and\rOther Relief against former Vermont attorney Joseph C. Palmisano.\r\rThe Judgment, issued after the District Court granted the\rCommissions Motion for Summary Judgment against Palmisano on\rApril 30, 1996, permanently enjoins Palmisano from violations of\rthe registration and antifraud provisions of the federal\rsecurities laws.  The Final Judgment also directs Palmisano to\rpay disgorgement, representing his ill-gotten gains, plus\rprejudgment interest, totalling $9.1 million, in addition to a\rcivil penalty of $500,000. \r\rPalmisano, formerly of Barre, Vermont, was of counsel to\rPalmisano Associates, a now defunct Berlin, Vermont law firm.\r\rThe Commissions Complaint, filed on July 14, 1994, alleges that\rfrom at least December 1987 through November 1992, Palmisano\rsolicited individuals to purchase investments.  According to the\rComplaint, Palmisano raised approximately $8 million from more\rthan ninety investors.\r\rIn its decision granting the Commissions Motion for Summary\rJudgment, the District Court found that Palmisano had failed to\rdemonstrate that there was a dispute of fact to the evidence\rsubmitted by the Commission in support of its motion.  Those\rpapers show that Palmisano made false and misleading statements\rto investors, including telling investors their money would be\rpooled in a fund and used to purchase property and inventory from\rbankrupt companies at a discount, which would then be resold at a\rprofit.  The Commissions papers show that these representations\rwere false.  Not only was there no evidence that Palmisano used\rany investor money to make purchases on behalf of investors, the\revidence showed that Palmisano diverted investor money for his\rpersonal use, used investors money to make payments to earlier\rinvestors, and commingled investor money with his own.\r\rIn addition, evidence put forward by the Commission in support of\rits motion demonstrated that investors in Palmisanos scheme lost\rlarge sums of money and some faced foreclosure on their\rproperties. \x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\rOn September 5, 1995, Palmisano pleaded guilty to criminal\rcharges in connection with the above and was sentenced to 188\rmonths in prison.

OCTAGON TECHNOLOGY GROUP,\rINC., MICHAEL J. TIDD, AND JEFFREY L. PUNZEL, \rCivil Action No.\r96-1299 (JR), (D.D.C. June 11, 1996)\r\r         The Securities and Exchange Commission today sued a\rSchaumburg, IL computer software company and two of its former\rofficers for their roles in creating an elaborate sham offering\rof offshore debt securities on the World Wide Web component of\rthe Internet.  \r\r         The suit, filed in federal district court for the\rDistrict of Columbia, alleges the following:  \r\r         Michael J. Tidd and Jeffrey L. Punzel, the former CEO\rand Vice President-Technology, respectively, of Octagon\rTechnology Group, Inc., designed, drafted and linked to the\rInternet a World Wide Web homepage and related pages for the\rAgency For Interamerican Finance, a Panamanian shell subsidiary\rof Octagon, advertisingAIF Interamerican hard currency bonds\rfor sale to investors.  The offering was essentially a sham. \rAlthough no bonds ever existed and AIF had no business operations\ror assets, the Web pages falsely promised prospective investors a\rrisk-free investment with guaranteed returns of 11.75% annually\rand portrayed AIF as a successful provider of investment capital\rto Latin American businesses.  Octagon has removed the Web pages\rfrom the Internet.\r    \r         In or about late May 1995, Octagon and its officers\rlinked the AIF Web pages to the Internet through a Zurich,\rSwitzerland-based computer center.  The AIF Web pages asked\rprospective investors to send checks for the purchase of AIF\rbonds to AIF\s investor  satisfaction center, which was\ractually a rented mail drop in St. John, Antigua.  Employees at\rthe Antigua office were instructed to tell inquiring investors\rthat AIF\s fictitious director of investor satisfaction listed\ron the Web was simply off island and could not be reached by\rtelephone, and to forward all mail received for AIF to Octagon in\rSchaumburg.  \r\r         The AIF Web pages contained many false statements\rconcerning AIF and the putative bonds it offered.  The pages\rclaimed that the Interamerican bonds had a guaranteed annual rate\rof return of 11.75%, would double\ran investor\s money in six years and were risk free.  Further,\rthe pages went on to claim that Group American Pacific Financial,\rLtd., S.A. (APF), a purported independent trust company,\rguaranteed principal and interest payments on the bonds up to\r250,000 US$ per investor.  In fact, APF was another Panamanian\rshell subsidiary of Octagon which lacked assets or business\roperations.  \r\r         The AIF Web Pages also included a facsimile reproduction\rof a World Financial Report magazine article touting the\rinvestment quality of the AIF bonds, the operations of AIF, and\rthe quality of its management. In fact, World Financial Report\rwas nothing more than a fabrication of Tidd, Punzel and Octagon.\r\r         Between late May and late August 1995, Tidd, Punzel and\rOctagon publicized the AIF bond offering on the Internet and\relsewhere.  The AIF Web Pages were listed on numerous\rinvestment-related indices of World Wide Web pages, including the\rpopular Yahoo! index.   Punzel posted messages on three\rinvestment-related Internet newsgroups, giving the Web address of\rthe AIF offering and describing it as what appeared to be a\rpretty good opportunity for investors, without disclosing his\rposition with Octagon, or that the AIF bond offering was not a\rlegitimate offering.  At Tidd\s direction, Octagon engaged a\rCleveland, Ohio-based news bureau to internationally disseminate\ra press release announcing the AIF offering and guiding investors\rto the fraudulent AIF Web pages.   No sales were made by the\rDefendants.\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\r         With the filing of the Complaint, Octagon, Tidd and\rPunzel, without admitting or denying the allegations contained in\rthe Complaint, consented to the entry of Final Judgments\renjoining them from future violations of the antifraud provision\rof the Securities Act of 1933, Section 17(a).

Ill., No.\r94 C 3770, filed June 21, 1994.    \r\r     The Commission announced that on June 7, 1996, the Honorable\rWayne R. Andersen of the United States District Court for the\rNorthern District of Illinois entered, by consent, an Order of\rPreliminary Injunction and Other Equitable Relief (Order) against\rOscar William Olson, Jr. (Olson), Defendant Copol Investment\rLimited\s (Copol) General Counsel, for his role in the creation\rand implementation of the Konex Roll Program, an investment which\rpurportedly was designed to pool investor funds to purchase and\rtrade in Prime Bank Instruments, and for his misappropriation\rof investor funds in connection with the offer and sale of\rinterests therein.  The Order preliminarily enjoins Olson from\rfurther violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933\r(Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act\rof 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In addition,\rthe Order freezes Olson\s assets.   \r\r     The allegations in the Commission\s original Complaint\rcharged Joseph Polichemi (Polichemi), Lyle E. Neal (Neal), John\rD. Lauer, and their respective companies, Copol, Konex Holding\rCorp. (Konex), and Clifton Capital Investors L.P. (CCI), with\rviolations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section\r10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The\rCommission\s Complaint alleged that from January 1993 to June\r1994, Konex raised at least $12.5 million from the Chicago\rHousing Authority (CHA) through the offer and sale of investment\rcontracts in the Konex Roll Program.  In fact, the purported\rKonex Roll Program was nothing more than a scheme to defraud\rinvestors and misappropriate investor funds.  Thus, the Complaint\ralleged that Polichemi and Neal, through their respective\rcompanies, made false and misleading statements regarding the use\rof CHA proceeds and the risks and returns associated with the\rinvestment.  The Complaint further alleged that Lauer, CHA\s\rDirector of Risk Management and Benefits, among other things,\rmade false and misleading statements to prospective investors\rconcerning the rate of return the CHA earned and the\rcircumstances under which the CHA invested in the Konex Roll\rProgram.  \r\r     The Amended Complaint alleges that Olson created and\rinstituted the Roll Program with Polichemi, prepared and\rdisseminated to the promoters of the scheme the procedures he\rexpected to be used to carry out the scheme.  Olson also\rmisappropriated investor funds for his benefit and for the\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\rbenefit of his partners in the scheme.  In the process, Olson\rmade false and misleading statements to others concerning the\rexistence and legitimacy of the Konex Roll Program, the use of\rinvestor proceeds\r\r                              - 2 -\r\rand the returns and risks of investing in the Konex Roll Program\rwith the knowledge and intent that such statements be\rdisseminated to investors.  The Amended Complaint seeks the entry\rof orders of preliminary and permanent injunction, disgorgement\rincluding prejudgment interest, an asset freeze and civil\rpenalties against Olson.\r\r     Judge Andersen entered a Temporary Restraining Order against\rthe original defendants on June 21, 1994.  Thereafter, on July\r29, 1994, the Court entered an Order of Permanent Injunction and\rOther Equitable Relief by Default against Polichemi, Neal, Copol\rand Konex, leaving only the amount of disgorgement and civil\rpenalties at issue.  On October 24, 1995, the Court entered, by\rconsent, an Order of Permanent Injunction and Other Equitable\rRelief against Lauer and CCI.  That order required Lauer and CCI\rto disgorge $4.853 million plus prejudgment interest.  \r\r     Olson, Polichemi, Neal and Lauer are also defendants in\rcriminal actions brought by the United States Attorney\s Office\rfor the Northern District of Illinois for their involvement in\rthe Konex Roll Program fraud.

WILLIAM P. DILLON (United\rStates District Court for the District of Massachusetts, Civil\rAction No. 96-11265 (RGS) (D. Massachusetts, filed June 19, 1996)\r\r     The Securities and Exchange Commission announced the filing\rof a complaint, on June 19, 1996, in the United States District\rCourt for the District of Massachusetts (the Court) against\rWilliam P. Dillon (Dillon), alleging that he deceived several\rbroker-dealers in connection with a fraudulent margin trading\rscheme.  The complaint alleges that, as a result of Dillon\s 1995\rmargin trading, the broker-dealers suffered losses in excess of\r$200,000.  The Commission seeks a final judgment enjoining Dillon\rfrom further violations of certain antifraud provisions of the\rsecurities laws, disgorgement of his ill-gotten gains and\rprejudgment interest.\r\r     On July 2, 1990, Dillon, as a result of a prior Commission\renforcement action, was barred by the Court for a period of five\ryears from maintaining a margin account and from trading on\rmargin.  The complaint alleges that Dillon, in order to avoid\rthis restriction, opened margin accounts at five broker-dealers\rin January 1995 using the name and social security number of a\rmaintenance man he employed.  Dillon also submitted inflated net\rworth and income figures to the broker-dealers in order to induce\rthe firms to open the margin accounts.  Between January and June\r1995, Dillon deposited his own funds into the five accounts and,\rby impersonating the maintenance man, engaged in hundreds of\rsecurities transactions.  The Commission\s complaint alleges that\rDillon made the trades without an intention or the means to pay\rfor the trades if large losses resulted.\r    \r     In June 1995, Dillon\s scheme unraveled when he placed two\rorders, each to sell 100 call options contracts, for the common\rstock of Lotus Development Corporation (Lotus) without owning\reither the call options or the underlying Lotus stock.  On June\r5, 1995, International Business Machines announced a tender offer\rfor all of the outstanding stock of Lotus, causing a substantial\rrise in the price of Lotus.  Dillon, who became obligated to\rpurchase 20,000 shares of Lotus stock to cover his option\rposition, sustained a loss of approximately $450,000.  Dillon did\rnot have sufficient funds to purchase the necessary Lotus stock. \rConsequently, the broker-dealer through which Dillon had\rpurchased the call options became obligated to make the purchase\rand suffered a loss of approximately $219,000.\r\r     The Commission\s complaint charges Dillon with violations of\rthe antifraud provisions contained in Section 17(a) of the\rSecurities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\rAct of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

(TMB),\rfraudulently offered and sold common stock and convertible\rdebentures through seven private placement offerings to at least\r81 investors in 17 states raising at least $1.1 million. \rSpecifically, he misrepresented the intended use of investor\rproceeds.

In its Complaint, the Commission alleged that\rMcDonnell Douglas failed to recognize a material loss on the $6.6\rbillion fixed price contract between the U.S. Air Force and\rDouglas Aircraft Company (DAC), an operating division of\rMcDonnell Douglas, for the C-17 Airlifter, a military cargo jet. \rAs a result, McDonnell Douglas materially overstated its pre-tax\rincome in the financial statements that it filed with the\rCommission in its 1990 annual report.  Simultaneously with the\rfiling of the Complaint, and without admitting or denying the\rallegations, McDonnell Douglas consented to the entry of a final\rjudgment enjoining it from committing future violations of\rSection 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 12b-20, periodic reporting\rprovisions of the Exchange Act, and ordering it to pay a civil\rpenalty of $500,000.\r\r     The Complaint alleged that McDonnell Douglas knew or\rreasonably should have known that it should have recognized a\rloss at the end of 1990.  According to the Complaint, by June\r1990, several preliminary estimates of the final cost to\rcomplete the contract had been developed by DAC, ranging from\r$7.133 billion to $8.640 billion, well over the $6.644 billion\rceiling on the contract at that time.  Furthermore, in August\r1990, the Air Force told McDonnell Douglas that the $6.465\rbillion cost estimate, which the Company submitted to the Air\rForce, was not supportable and that progress payments on the\rcontract would be withheld until McDonnell Douglas submitted an\racceptable cost estimate.  Even after McDonnell Douglas increased\rits cost estimate, the Department of Defense, in November 1990,\radvised McDonnell Douglas that the increased cost estimate was a\rhigh risk estimate and not likely to be achieved.  In fact,\rduring the last half of 1990, cost overruns continued to rise and\rproduction efficiency worsened or remained flat.  Nonetheless,\rMcDonnell Douglas reported for year-end 1990 that it would\rbreak-even on the contract.  \r\r     Therefore, according to the Complaint, in light of\rinformation that McDonnell Douglas possessed at year-end 1990,\rthe cost estimates it used in preparing its financial statements\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\rwere not reasonably dependable and, as a result of using such\restimates and not recognizing a loss, the financial statements\rwere not in conformity with generally accepted accounting\rprinciples.  \x0c\x1a"

Michaels on June19, 1996.  The order issued by Judge Lourdes G. Baird found thatthe husband and wife couple, residents in Las Vegas, Nevada,participated in the fraudulent offering of $5 million ofunregistered stock of a discount start-up airline, FamilyAirlines, Inc. (Family) in 1992 and 1993, before they wereousted from the airline by a group of Family investors.       Specifically, the Court found that the Michaelses misusedfunds and made misrepresentations and/or omissions of materialfacts to investors in connection with the offer and sale ofunregistered Family stock, both orally and in Family\s PrivatePlacement Memorandum.  The misrepresentations concerned:  (1) theuse of investor proceeds; (2) Family\s financial condition; (3)the association of certain individuals with Family; (4) thelikelihood of Department of Transportation (DOT) and FederalAviation Administration (FAA) certification; and (5) the natureand status of two financial commitments in the amount $25-30million.  The Michaelses fraudulently used investor money to funda lavish lifestyle that included a $50,000 down payment on theirhome, an exclusive country club membership, lease payments onhis and hers Mercedes Benz automobiles, payment of a personaldebt of $20,000, and payments to themselves of $246,184.15.      The Court also found that in connection with applying to theDOT/FAA for Family flight certification, the Michaelses lied tothe DOT and FAA about numerous civil lawsuits and judgmentsagainst them.  The Commission presented the Court with evidencethat at least 20 civil lawsuits had been filed in Los AngelesCounty alone against the Michaelses for engaging in similarinvestment dealings.  The Commission also presented evidence thatthe California Department of Corporations issued a Desist andRefrain Order against Barry Michaels in 1983 for engaging insimilar fraudulent conduct relating to a cosmetics company.       Family investors initially became suspicious of theMichaelses\ activity after someone researched and discovered the\x0c==========================================START OF PAGE 2======Michaelses\ significant legal history and reported it to theFAA/DOT.

SHIMON GIBORI and HENRYVOGEL, United States District Court for the District of theDistrict of Columbia, Civil Action No. 94 Civ. 0607 (EGS)     The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced thaton July 5, 1996 the United States District Court for the Districtof Columbia entered a final judgment against Shimon Gibori, thefounder and former chief executive officer and president of thenow-defunct Gil-Med Industries, Inc., which enjoins him fromviolating the federal securities laws and permanently prohibitshim from serving as an officer or director of any publicly heldcompany which files reports with the Commission.     The complaint alleges that Gil-Med, a small Illinois-basedmanufacturer and distributor of plastic medical products,initially offered its common stock to the public in March 1988. According to the complaint, Gibori caused Gil-Med\s underwriterto park over twenty percent of its initial public offering incertain accounts in order to give the impression that theoffering was successfully closed.  Thereafter, Gibori used$705,000 of the offering proceeds from bona fide purchasers --over half of the actual total -- to purchase, for $475,000, theparked Gil-Med stock and to purchase $230,000 of outstandingconvertible Gil-Med debt securities.  The complaint alleges thatGibori also misappropriated related debt securities worth another$225,000 and later misappropriated from other Gil-Med investors320,000 shares of Gil-Med stock which he sold, withoutregistration, for approximately $750,000.     The complaint alleges that Gibori began issuing counterfeitGil-Med stock shortly after Gil-Med became a publicly tradedcompany.  According to the complaint, from June 1988 through1990, Gibori issued approximately 2,000,0000 counterfeit sharesand sold them to the public, without registration, forapproximately $2,500,000.  The complaint alleges that Giboricreated this stock by backdating and printing names of fictitiousnominees as well as real persons on blank, unauthorized stockcertificates which Gil-Med had used before going public.  In thisway, according to the complaint, Gibori sold approximately400,000 shares of counterfeit stock and sold approximately1,600,000 shares of nominee stock to the public through broker-dealers.  The Commission alleges that Gibori funneled substantial\x0c==========================================START OF PAGE 2======amounts of proceeds from the sales of his nominee stockimproperly into Gil-Med, accounting for these proceeds as revenuefrom sales of Gil-Med products.     The Commission further alleges that, in an effort to accountfor the counterfeit stock and fictitious revenues, and to makeGil-Med appear financially successful, Gibori created and forgeddocuments showing fictitious business entities and transactions. According to the Commission, one such fictitious transactioninvolved a purported $2.2 million loan to Gil-Med from TechnologyProducts, Ltd., one of Gibori\s shell companies, for the purchaseof equipment costing about $2 million; in fact, there had been nosuch loan and Gil-Med had only paid about $131,000 for theequipment.  This fictional transaction substantially inflatedGil-Med\s assets after Gibori, acting through his shell company,converted the fictitious debt to account for over 1,200,000shares of counterfeit stock.  According to the Commission, Giborifraudulently used this over-valued equipment as collateral toobtain two business loans in excess of $1.3 million.  Gil-Meddefaulted on both loans.       According to the complaint, Gil-Med\s public filings withthe Commission contained material misrepresentations andomissions concerning Gibori\s fraudulent activities.  DespiteGibori\s efforts to finance Gil-Med through his sales ofcounterfeit stock, Gil-Med collapsed in February 1991 and wasdissolved by the State of Illinois in March 1991.

(Fenchurch), a commodity tradingadvisor and commodity pool operator.  The Commission\s Complaintalleges that Fenchurch engaged in a scheme, accomplished throughmaterially false and misleading statements and other activities,to reduce the available supply in the repurchase (repo) marketof the cheapest-to-deliver U.S. Treasury security for the June1993 10-year U.S. Treasury note futures contract (Junecontract).  According to the Complaint, Fenchurch therebyreceived from parties who were short the June contract the nextcheapest-to-deliver, or more valuable, security in satisfactionof their delivery obligations under the June contract.More specifically, the Commission\s Complaint alleges that inJune 1993, Fenchurch held a substantial long position in the Junecontract and thus would profit from delivery of the more valuablesecurity.  By deliberately misleading counterparties in repotransactions to believe that it was short the June contract andneeded the cheapest-to-deliver security used as collateral inthose transactions returned to it to meet its own deliveryobligations under that contract, Fenchurch secured agreementsfrom the counterparties not to relend the security to the repomarket.  Through these material misrepresentations and otheractivities, Fenchurch removed from the market a significantquantity of the cheapest-to-deliver security.  As a result,Fenchurch received approximately $480 million of the morevaluable security, in satisfaction of delivery obligations underapproximately one-third of Fenchurch\s position in the Junecontract, and profited by the receipt of the more valuablesecurity.  Simultaneously with the filing of the action, Fenchurchconsented, without admitting or denying the allegations of theComplaint, to the entry of a final judgment of permanentinjunction enjoining it from violating the antifraud provisionsof the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, and requiring it topay to the U.S. Treasury $600,000, representing disgorgement,prejudgment interest thereon and a civil penalty.

Earl V. Young, United States\rDistrict Court for the Northern District of Texas, C.A. No. 3-\r96CV1985-T  (N.D. Tex. July 15, 1996).\r\r     The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that it\rfiled a civil injunctive action in the United States District\rCourt for the Northern District of Texas against Earl V. Young, a\rformer director of Automated Telephone Management Systems, Inc.\r(ATM).  In its complaint, the Commission alleges that Young\rknew, or was reckless in not knowing, that ATM\s financial\rstatements, for fiscal 1993 were materially misstated.  The\rmaterially misstated financials were included in an annual report\ron Form 10-K for 1993, filed with the Commission on January 13,\r1994.  Specifically, the Commission alleged that Young knew that\rATM had prematurely recognized revenue from a sale and signed\rATM\s Form 10-K for fiscal 1993.  Young, a member of ATM\s audit\rcommittee, also failed to notify ATM\s independent auditors of\rthe improper revenue recognition.\r\r     Without admitting or denying the Commission\s allegations,\rYoung consented to the entry of a judgment against him,\rpermanently enjoining Young from committing future violations of\rSection 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange\rAct) and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-2 thereunder, and ordering Young\rto pay a civil money penalty in the amount of $15,000.  \r\r     The Commission also announced that it has concluded a\rrelated civil injunctive action that was filed on November 1,\r1995 in the United States District Court for the Northern\rDistrict of Texas against ATM, Akhilesh Chandoke, the former\rpresident, chief executive officer, and director of ATM, Frank\rMzyk, the former controller and principal accounting officer of\rATM, and David Jacobs, the former secretary and vice president of\rsales at ATM.  Securities and Exchange Commission v. Automated\rTelephone Management Systems, Inc., Akhilesh Chandoke, Frank C.\rMzyk and David H. Jacobs, United States District Court for the\rNorthern District of Texas, Civil Action No. 395-CV-2613-X\r(Litigation Release No. 14710; Nov. 2, 1995)\r\r     In the previous action, the Commission had alleged that\rChandoke, Mzyk, and Jacobs engaged in a fraudulent scheme to\rinflate ATM\s revenue for the fiscal year ended September 30,\r1993.  The Commission alleged that the defendants arranged for a\x0c\r\r\r\r\r\rthird party to sign a fictitious sales contract, and that ATM\rrecognized $1.3 million in revenue from the transaction, which\raccounted for twenty-five percent of ATM\s revenue for fiscal\ryear 1993.  The Commission further alleged that the defendants\rconvinced an ATM customer to backdate a contract in order to\rfacilitate the inclusion of the revenue in ATM\s financial\rstatements for the fiscal year ended September 30, 1993.  In\raddition, the Commission alleged that the defendants concealed\rinventory, created fictitious invoices, and backdated ATM\rinternal documents to conceal the fraud from ATM\s auditors.  The\rCommission alleged that Chandoke, Mzyk and Jacobs were\rresponsible for material misrepresentations and omissions\rconcerning ATM\s transactions in a periodic report filed with the\rCommission.  Additionally, the Commission alleged that the\rdefendants made materially false statements and omitted to\rdisclose material information to ATM\s auditors in connection\rwith the audit of ATM\s financial statements.  \r\r     On January 30, 1996, the district court, pursuant to the\rCommission\s motion, entered a default judgment against ATM,\renjoining it from violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a),\r13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 10b-5,\r12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder.  On March 26, 1996 and\rMarch 28, 1996 respectively, the district court entered agreed\rjudgments against Chandoke and Mzyk, permanently enjoining them\rfrom committing future violations Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of\rthe Exchange Act, and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, 13b2-2 thereunder, and\rimposing a ten-year officer and director bar against each of\rthem.  The Commission agreed to waive imposition of civil money\rpenalties on the basis of Mzyk\s and Chandoke\s sworn inability\rto pay.\r\r     On April 1, 1996, the court entered a default judgment\ragainst Jacobs, enjoining him from future violations of Sections\r10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1,\r13b2-2 thereunder, and permanently prohibiting him from serving\ras an officer or director of a reporting company.\r\r     In related criminal proceedings, Chandoke, on November 13,\r1995, and Jacobs, on April 1, 1996, each pleaded guilty to one\rcount of bank fraud and, after a criminal trial, a jury acquitted\rMzyk of bank fraud.  The criminal charges against the men stemmed\rfrom fraudulently inflated ATM receivables that were provided to\rComerica Bank as collateral for a line of credit.  Chandoke and\rJacobs are awaiting sentencing.\x0c\x1a"

HUGO ALDO SALLUSTRO, ANNA\rBARONI, AND FERRUCIO CAMPONOVO, U.S. District Court for the\rSouthern District of New York, 96 Civ.5351(LAK)(July 18, 1996)\r\r     On July 18, 1996, the Commission filed a complaint charging\rHugo Aldo Sallustro, Anna Baroni, and Ferrucio Camponovo with\rinsider trading in the common stock of Skybox International,\rInc., in violation of Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities\rExchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3\rthereunder.\r\r     According to the Commission\s Complaint, in February 1995,\ran officer of Marvel Entertainment Group Inc. contacted\rSallustro, the Managing Director of Panini S.r.L., a Marvel\rsubsidiary that sells Marvel products in Europe, and discussed\rwith him whether Panini would be able to sell Skybox\ products. \rThe Complaint alleges that Sallustro deduced from that\rconversation that Marvel was evaluating a possible acquisition of\rSkybox, a North Carolina-based trading card company.  The\rComplaint alleges that Sallustro misappropriated the information\rconcerning Skybox by purchasing 15,000 shares of Skybox through\ran account at Banque Indosuez, and by tipping Anna Baroni, who\rhad a close personal relationship with Sallustro and advised\rPanini with respect to tax matters.  The Complaint further\ralleges that Baroni purchased 23,000 shares of Skybox stock\rthrough her account at Indosuez.  According to the Complaint,\rBaroni also tipped Camponovo, who acted as her and Sallustro\s\rbanking advisor at Indosuez.  Camponovo thereafter purchased\r1,500 shares of Skybox through an account he controlled at\rIndosuez.  The Complaint alleges that Marvel and Skybox announced\rthe tender offer for Skybox shares on March 9, 1995, and that\rSallustro, Baroni, and Camponovo later tendered their shares and\rrealized profits of $52,500, $94,031, and $6,187, respectively.  \r\r     Sallustro, Baroni, and Camponovo, without admitting or\rdenying the allegations of the Complaint, each have consented to\rthe entry of a Final Judgment enjoining them from future\rviolations of Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Exchange Act and\rRules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder, and requiring them to disgorge\rtheir illegal trading profits which, together with prejudgment\rinterest, totals $57,059, $102,197, and $6,724, respectively. \rThe Judgment also orders Sallustro, Baroni, and Camponovo to pay\rcivil penalties of $52,500, $47,015, and $3,093, respectively.\r\r     The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the National\rAssociation of Securities Dealers, Inc. in this matter.  \x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\r     The investigation is continuing with respect to other\rtrading in Skybox securities.  \x0c\x1a"

Balance for Life, Inc.,\rRichard K. Steele, Sr., Richard K. Steele, Jr., Peter C. Tosto,\rand Marcia Ann Coppertino, D. Colo. Civil No. 95-D-2471.\r\r   The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on July\r1, 1996, Judge Wiley Y. Daniel of the United States District\rCourt for the District of Colorado issued a Final Judgment of\rPermanent Injunction and Other Relief by consent against\rdefendant Peter C. Tosto of New York, New York enjoining him from\rfuture violations of the securities registration provisions, the\rantifraud provisions and the broker-dealer registration\rprovisions of the federal securities laws.  Tosto consented to\rthe Final Judgment without admitting or denying the allegations\rin the Commissions Amended Complaint, which was filed on October\r17, 1995.  The Final Judgement also orders Tosto to pay\rdisgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $56,791.99\rand imposes a second tier civil penalty of $15,000.\r\r   The Commissions Amended Complaint alleges that, among other\rthings, from July 1991 through December 1992, Tosto and two other\rdefendants sold shares of Balance for Life, Inc. common stock to\rat least 15 investors for proceeds of $328,000 while there was no\rregistration statement in effect or filed with the Commission and\rwithout complying with any of the available exemptions from\rregistration.  The Amended Complaint alleges that Tosto and other\rdefendants made material misrepresentations to prospective\rinvestors that Balance for Life, Inc. would soon publicly trade\ron Nasdaq, that Balance for Life, Inc. would earn $0.85 per share\rand $2.14 per share in 24 and 36 months, and claimed that the\rstock of Balance for Life would soon trade at $17 to $45 per\rshare, all without reasonable basis because in fact Balance for\rLife did not have sufficient assets for listing on Nasdaq, had no\roperations and a net loss in 1990 of $177,000.  The Amended\rComplaint also alleges that Tosto operated an unregistered\rbroker-dealer and used cold-callers and lead lists to sell the\rsecurities of Balance for Life.  \r     Tosto was enjoined from violating Sections 5(a) and (c), and\r17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 10(b) and\r15(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5. \x0c\x1a"

Gumbiner (Gumbiner) for\rinsider trading in the stock of ShowBiz Pizza Time, Inc.\r(ShowBiz).  Simultaneously with the filing of the Complaint,\rHallwood consented to the entry of the Final Judgment which\rimposes an injunction against future violations of Section 17(a)\rof the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities\rExchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. \rFurther, the Final Judgment requires Hallwood to disgorge\r$953,125.00, representing the loss avoided by its trading in\rShowBiz stock from June 7 through June 10, 1993, plus prejudgment\rinterest of $240,665.60.  Under the terms of the agreed Judgment,\rHallwood will pay $600,000 within 30 days, $300,000 by September\r30, 1996, and the remaining $293,790.60, plus accumulated\rpostjudgment interest, by December 31, 1996.  Also simultaneously\rwith the filing of the Complaint, Gumbiner consented to the entry\rof the Stipulation and Order which requires payment of a civil\rpenalty of $476,562.50 pursuant to the control person provisions\rof the Insider Trading and Fraud Enforcement Act, codified at\rSection 21A of the Exchange Act. \r\r     The Commissions complaint alleged that Hallwood sold\r100,000 shares of ShowBiz stock at $28.75 to $29.9375 per share\rbetween June 7 and June 10, 1993, prior to ShowBizs June 11\rpublic announcement of deteriorating earnings.  Following the\rnegative earnings announcement, ShowBiz stock fell precipitously.\r\r     Gumbiner is the Chief Executive Officer, chairman of the\rboard of directors, and controlling shareholder of Hallwood, as\rwell as a director of ShowBiz.  According to the complaint,\rGumbiner directed Hallwoods sales of ShowBiz stock and knew that\rthe sales would be occurring during the week of June 7.  The\rCommission alleges that on June 7, 1993, Gumbiner received\rmaterial non-public information that Showbizs quarterly earnings\rwould fall short of expectations.  The Commission contends that,\ralthough the Hallwood officer implementing Hallwoods sales was\runaware of the negative earnings information, Gumbiners\rknowledge of the material, non-public information was\rattributable to Hallwood.  The Commissions complaint further\ralleges that Gumbiner, as a control person of Hallwood, knew or\rrecklessly disregarded that the company was likely to engage in\rinsider trading and he failed to take appropriate steps to\rprevent such trading.\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\x0c\x1a"

Judge Thomas F. Hogan accepted the plea, scheduled\rsentencing for September 4, 1996, and jailed Taylor pending\rsentencing.  Taylor faces a sentence of up to 5 years\\rimprisonment on the wire fraud count.  On the contempt count, the\rcourt, in its discretion, may impose a fine or a term of\rimprisonment.  The plea agreement does not cover the fraud\rallegations underlying the Commission\s separate civil securities\renforcement action against Taylor and others.  Securities and\rExchange Commission v. The Better Life Club of America, Inc.,\rRobert N. Taylor, et al., Civil Action No. 95-1679 (TFH).\r\r     In the transactions to which Taylor pled guilty, Taylor\rdefrauded Better Life Club investors, the Commission, a mortgage\rcompany, and others by refinancing his Fort Washington, Maryland,\rhouse and dissipating over $62,000 he received from the\rtransaction.  To obtain the refinancing, Taylor signed a false\rmortgage application, which overstated his income and failed to\rreveal the existence of the Commission\s action against him.  The\rrefinancing also violated the asset freeze order entered last\ryear in the Commission\s civil action, which was designed to\rpreserve Taylor\s assets, including his house, for potential\rrecovery by the Commission to compensate defrauded Better Life\rClub investors.  In his plea, Taylor further admitted having\rviolated the asset freeze order by conducting hundreds of\rprohibited banking transactions after the freeze was ordered,\rincluding withdrawing approximately $290,000 and depositing over\r100 investor checks and money orders in undisclosed bank\raccounts.\r\r     In the underlying civil enforcement action, the Commission\ralleges that Taylor and the Better Life Club operated a $47\rmillion Ponzi scheme in violation of the antifraud and\rregistration requirements of the federal securities laws. \rAccording to the Commission\s complaint, defendants promised to\rdouble investors\ money in 60 or 90 days allegedly through\rinvestments in advertising for the Club\s 900 telephone numbers\rand other profitable businesses, when in fact defendants used the\rinvestors\ funds almost exclusively to pay off earlier investors\rand to enrich Taylor, his children, and his live-in companion. \rThe scheme was halted by the Court pending a final determination\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\rof the Commission\s action.

The Complaint\rfurther alleged that Bradstreet, Kurzweil\s former President and\rCo-Chief Executive Officer, and Campbell, Kurzweil\s former Vice\rPresident of Sales, each offered and sold equity securities in\rKurzweil\s initial public offering, knowing that the company\s\rfinancial statements were materially false and that, in 1993,\rBradstreet received an $80,000 bonus advance based on the then\rexpected financial results of operations for the fiscal year\rended January 31, 1994.  The Complaint alleged that the scheme\raffected the registration statement and periodic reports filed by\rKurzweil containing financial statements for its fiscal year\rended January 31, 1993 and the first three quarters of fiscal\ryear 1994.  The Commission\s litigation is continuing.\r\r     In a related administrative proceeding, the Commission, on\rJuly 25, 1995, instituted and simultaneously settled, by consent,\ra cease-and-desist proceeding against Kurzweil (Kurzweil Applied\rIntelligence, Inc., Exchange Act Rel.

EDWARD A. CANTOR, MICHAEL\rLEVINE AND DAVID P. SCHWARTZ, 94 Civ. 8079 (JGK) \r\r     The Commission announced today that, on July 30, 1996, the\rHonorable John G. Koeltl of the United States District Court of\rthe Southern District of New York awarded the Commission a triple\rpenalty, the maximum available under the Insider Trading and\rSecurities Fraud Enforcement Act of 1988, against defendant\rMichael Levine ( Levine ).  The Court found that Levine, a 48\ryear old resident of Weston, Connecticut, and the owner of MDM\rCopying Services, Inc., an office supply business located in New\rYork, New York, had purchased DeSoto, Inc. ( DeSoto ) stock in\rviolation of the tender offer antifraud provisions of the federal\rsecurities laws.  Levine purchased nearly $450,000 of this stock\ron November 9, 1989, the day that Sutton Holding Corp. ( Sutton )\rannounced its intention to commence a $50 per share tender offer\rfor DeSoto.  In addition to the $221,172.63 civil penalty, Judge\rKoeltl also granted the Commission s request that Levine be\rpermanently enjoined from violating Section 14(e) of the\rSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act ) and Rule 14e-3\rand be ordered to disgorge his illegal trading profits of\r$73,724.21 plus prejudgment interest on that amount.  The court\rgranted this relief following the Commission s motion for partial\rsummary judgment.  \r\r     Judge Koeltl, finding that genuine issues of material fact\rexist, declined to grant summary judgment on the Commissions\rclaims that Levine also violated Section 14(e) of the Exchange\rAct and Rule 14e-3 when he purchased DeSoto stock in October\r1989, and when he communicated material, nonpublic information to\rDavid P. Schwartz ( Schwartz ) on November 8 or 9, 1989, under\rcircumstances in which it was reasonably foreseeable that\rSchwartz would communicate that information to Edward A. Cantor\r( Cantor ), who then purchased DeSoto stock.  These claims remain\rfor trial, as does the Commissions claim that Levine violated\rSection 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 by purchasing\rDeSoto stock in October and November 1989.  \r\r     Cantor, 68, and Schwartz, 32, previously settled the action\ragainst them, without admitting or denying the allegations of the\rCommission s complaint.

These schemes included the Chicago Housing\rAuthority\s (CHA) $14 million investment in the Konex Roll\rProgram, the subject of an action previously brought by the\rCommission against Polichemi, Neal, Olson and others for\rviolations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and\rSection 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule\r10b-5 thereunder.  Specifically, Polichemi was convicted of one\rcount of conspiracy, eight counts of money laundering and fifteen\rcounts of wire fraud.  Neal was convicted of one count of\rconspiracy, five counts of money laundering, thirteen counts of\rwire fraud and three counts of perjury.  Padilla was convicted of\rthirteen counts of wire fraud and three counts of perjury. \rFinally, Olson was convicted of three counts of money laundering.\r\rThe perjury convictions against Neal and Padilla resulted from\rtheir sworn testimony in connection with Commission\s\rinvestigation concerning the Konex Roll Program.  Larry Oesterman\rand Edward Russey plead guilty to charges relating to the\rfraudulent schemes before the trial.  John DeVincens was\racquitted of all charges against him.  In a separate criminal\raction, John Lauer (Lauer), CHA\s Director of Risk Management and\rBenefits, plead guilty to wire fraud, mail fraud and obstruction\rof justice charges. \r\r     The criminal charges relating to the Konex Roll Program\rparallel the conduct alleged in the Commission\s action filed in\rthe United States District Court for the Northern District of\rIllinois on June 21, 1994, against Polichemi, Neal, their\rrespective companies, Copol Investments Limited (Copol), Konex\rHolding Corp. (Konex), and Lauer and his company, Clifton Capital\rInvestors L.P. (CCI).  The Commission\s Complaint and Amended\rComplaint, which added Olson as a defendant, alleged that from\rJanuary 1993 to June 1994, Konex, Neal\s company, raised at least\r$12.5 million from the CHA through the offer and sale of\rinvestments in the Konex Roll Program.  In fact, the purported\rRoll Program, which was designed to pool investor funds to\rpurchase and trade in Prime Bank Instruments, was nothing more\rthan a scam to defraud investors.  Thus, the Complaint alleged\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\rthat Polichemi, Olson and Neal, through, Copol and Konex, made\rfalse and misleading statements regarding the use of CHA proceeds\rand the risks and returns associated with the investment.\r\r                              - 2 -\r\r     The Complaint further alleged that Lauer, among other\rthings, failed to disclose to the CHA the role of his private\rcompany, CCI, in the administration of CHA\s investment, his\rreceipt of compensation and his resulting conflict of interest. \rMoreover, the Complaint alleged that Lauer made false and\rmisleading statements to prospective investors concerning the\rrate of return CHA earned and the circumstances under which the\rCHA invested in the Roll Program.   \r\r     On June 21, 1994, the Honorable Wayne Andersen of the U.S.\rDistrict Court for the Northern District of Illinois entered an\rorder in the Commission\s action temporarily restraining and\renjoining the defendants from future violations of the antifraud\rprovisions of the federal securities laws and, among other\rthings, froze their assets.

The Commission\s Complaint,\rfiled May 3, 1995, and amended on July 17, 1996 (the\rComplaint), alleges that Silvestri, who claims to be an\rinsurance underwriter, obtained purported guarantee bonds which\rwere provided to investors in certain bank instrument trading\rprograms offered by Kenton Capital, Ltd.  The Complaint alleges\rthat the promoters of such trading programs solicited investors\rbeginning in the middle of March 1995 through early May 1995, and\rpromised investors annual returns ranging from 34,200% to over\r1,200,000%.  \r\r     The Complaint alleges that Kenton used investor funds to\rpurchase the guarantee bonds, which purportedly guaranteed the\rrepayment of the principal amount of each investment.

The Complaint\ralleges that Atlantic Pacific, a Nevada corporation with its\rprincial office located in Santa Monica, California, and its\rpresident, Smith, provided the guarantee bonds and received\rapproximately $126,584.00 in investor funds.  \r\r     Without admitting or denying the Commission\s allegations,\rSilvestri consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently\renjoining him from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and\r17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the\rSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated\rthereunder, and ordering him to disgorge the sum of $40,970.51,\rplus prejudgment interest of $3,193.19, for a total sum of\r$44,163.70.

According to the Complaint, defendants\rartificially inflated the price of Davstar common stock during\rthe relevant period from approximately $1.00 per share to a high\rof $13.75 per share in November 1992.  The Complaint alleges that\reach defendant received Davstar stock or warrants as compensation\rto promote Davstar to the investing public and, therefore, stood\rto realize personal financial gain from an increase in Davstar\s\rstock price.\r\r     According to the Complaint, in or about May 1991, Davstar\renlisted Kern, a resident of Paradise Valley, Arizona, as a\rfinancial consultant and awarded him warrants to purchase Davstar\rstock at favorable prices.  Thereafter, Kern is alleged to have\rprepared and caused Davstar to issue several materially false and\rmisleading press releases concerning, among other things, the\rmanufacturing and distribution status of Davstar\s proprietary\rmedical products and the company\s financial prospects.\r\r     The Complaint alleges that Davstar also retained Yale Hirsch\rof Old Tappan, New Jersey, and compensated him with warrants in\rreturn for his agreement to promote Davstar, its products and its\rfinancial prospects in Smart Money and Ground Floor, two\rinvestment newsletters published by the Hirsch Organization.  The\rComplaint alleges that Hirsch thereafter published a steady\rstream of materially false and misleading information concerning,\ramong other things, the distribution, marketability and market\rresponse to Davstar\s products, as well as baseless projections\rregarding, among other things, Davstar\s business prospects,\rprofitability and the value of its stock.\r\r     As to McGuire, a stockbroker in Phoenix, Arizona, the\rComplaint alleges that he too was compensated by Davstar,\rdirectly and indirectly, to prepare and disseminate to his retail\rclients a purported research report which contained materially\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\rfalse and misleading information about Davstar, its products and\rits financial prospects.

Finally, the Complaint alleges that\rHirsch and McGuire failed to disclose that they had or would\rreceive compensation directly and indirectly from Davstar in\rexchange for promoting the Company.  These omissions misled their\rrespective readers to believe they were receiving unbiased\revaluations of Davstar when they were not, and violated Section\r17(b) of the Securities Act of 1933.\r\r     The Complaint seeks injunctive relief against all\rdefendants, as well as disgorgement of ill-gotten gains and civil\rmoney penalties.\r\r     The Commission today also filed a separate Complaint against\rJerry B.

The Complaint alleges that Beagelman, Lyman\rand Sanfellipo achieved this result by executing backdated and\rotherwise fraudulent franchise agreements, and by, directly or\rindirectly, recording improperly franchise revenue and franchise\rreceivables on Packaging Plus\s books and records.  As a result\rof the scheme, the Complaint alleges that Packaging Plus\s\rassets, revenue and income were materially overstated on its\rbooks and records and in its financial statements for the year\rended December 31, 1990 (1990 Financial Statements).  The 1990\rFinancial Statements were contained in an amendment (Form 10-K\rAmendment) to Packaging Plus\s Annual Report on Form 10-K for\rits fiscal year ended December 31, 1990 (1990 Form 10-K).

Sellin, II (Sellin), and two corporations\rhe controls, Zaitech Holdings, Inc. and Baccaratt Holdings, Inc.\r(collectively, Defendants).  The Order stems from a Complaint\rfiled by the Commission on July 24, 1996 charging violations of\rthe antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. \r  \r     The Commission\s papers filed with the Court allege that\rSellin, a convicted felon and repeat securities law violator, is\rconducting an ongoing, fraudulent offering of securities through\rnewsgroup bulletin board postings on the Internet, and through\radvertisements placed on CompuServe, an Internet access provider\rand a world-wide, subscriber-based electronic communications\rservice.  Since October 1995, Sellin has solicited investments\rthrough at least 43 advertisements in at least 21 newsgroups on\rthe Internet.  The Internet provides promoters, such as Sellin,\rwith direct access to millions of prospective investors worldwide\rwith great speed and ease, minimal expense and virtual anonymity.\r\rNo allegation of any wrongdoing has been made in this case\ragainst CompuServe or any other Internet access provider.\r\r     According to the Commission\s papers, Sellin, through\rZaitech and Baccaratt, is offering promissory notes which he\rclaims are secured and collateralized by U.S. Government\rsecurities and other assets.  Sellin represents that he can\rdeliver guaranteed returns of anywhere from 12% to 22%\rannually.  Sellin is currently offering an investment opportunity\rto make $150,000 annually, tax free.  The Commission\s papers\rallege that these representations are false and misleading in\rthat the investment is not secured or collateralized by U.S.\rGovernment securities; that Sellin fails to disclose his long\rrecord of regulatory sanctions and criminal convictions,\rincluding a Florida felony conviction for grand larceny; and that\rSellin fails to disclose the material risks associated with the\rinvestment.\r\r     The TRO restrains Defendants from violating the antifraud\rprovisions of the federal securities laws -- Section 17(a) of the\rSecurities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities\rExchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The Commission also seeks preliminary and\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\r \rpermanent injunctions, disgorgement of any ill-gotten gains and a\rmoney penalty against Defendants.

Kimberly D. Goodman, Civil\rAction No. 96-749 (LHM) (EEx) (C.D. Cal.) (Aug. 6, 1996);\r\r     On August 6, 1996, the Commission announced that it filed\rand settled various legal proceedings against Refco Securities,\rInc., a brokerage firm in New York City, and three of its former\remployees for their role in the massive investment advisory fraud\rcommitted by the former California money manager, Steven D.\rWymer.  In settling this matter with the Commission,  Refco will\rpay $3,500,000.  Of that amount, $3,250,000 will be paid to\rWymer\s defrauded clients and $250,000 will be paid as a civil\rpenalty.  \r\r     These proceedings conclude the Commission\s investigation of\rWymer and his investment advisory business.  Wymer, who is\rcurrently serving a seven year prison sentence for securities and\rmail fraud, at one time managed over $1 billion in assets for\rapproximately 65 clients, many of whom were municipalities\rlocated in California, Iowa and Colorado.  From 1987 through\r1991, Wymer perpetrated a series of schemes that resulted in 17\rof his clients losing more than $80 million.  As part of their\rinvestment advisory relationship with Wymer, these 17 clients\rheld brokerage accounts at Refco.  \r\r     The proceedings brought by the Commission include a lawsuit\rfiled in federal court in Los Angeles against one of the former\rRefco employees, Kimberly D. Goodman.  In that lawsuit, the\rCommission charged Goodman with acting as Wymer\s accomplice and\rparticipating in a scheme to conceal his misappropriation of more\rthan $80 million from client accounts at Refco.  In exchange for\rher complicity, Wymer paid Goodman approximately $183,000 in cash\rand bestowed on her approximately $130,000 in luxury gifts,\rincluding a $60,000 Jaguar convertible, a Mercedes Benz and a\rRolex watch.  In its complaint, the Commission alleged, among\rother things, that between July 1988 and November 1991, Goodman\rlied to Wymer\s clients and their auditors about the amount of\rcash and securities they had in their accounts at Refco.  For\rinstance, Goodman signed at least 20 audit confirmation letters\rverifying fictitious account balances to the auditors of Wymer\s\rclients.  In those letters, Goodman stated that the clients had\rbalances ranging from $400,000 to $75,000,000, when in fact the\rclients\ balances were often near zero.  Goodman agreed to settle\rthis matter by consenting to an injunction, without admitting or\rdenying the allegations in the Commission\s complaint, that will\renjoin her from committing future violations of the antifraud\rprovisions of the federal securities laws.  She also agreed to be\rbarred from the securities industry.  \x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\r     In addition, the Commission brought administrative\rproceedings against two other former Refco employees, Douglas L.\rBlair and Robert J. Dantone.  In those proceedings, the\rCommission found that Blair and Dantone processed transactions\rthat resulted in Wymer\s theft of approximately $2.9 million from\rhis advisory clients.  Between August 1987 and May 1988, Wymer\rinstructed Blair and Dantone to divert to him between 20% and 90%\rof the profits from certain options transactions executed on\rbehalf of Wymer\s clients.  Wymer told Blair and Dantone that\rthese payments represented advisory fees purportedly owed to him\rby these clients.  These fees were deducted from each\rtransaction in such a way that the clients could not tell that\rWymer was stealing a portion of their profits.  Further, the\rtrade confirmations provided by Refco to the clients reported\rfalse prices, effectively concealing Wymer\s theft.  In settling\rthis matter with the Commission, Blair consented to an order to\rcease-and-desist from committing or causing investment advisory\rfraud.  Dantone consented to an order to cease-and-desist from\rcausing broker-dealer books and records violations.  Refco also\rconsented to an order to cease-and-desist from violating the\rbooks and records and transaction confirmation provisions of the\rfederal securities laws.  \r\r     Further, the Commission found that Refco failed to have\radequate compliance procedures and failed reasonably to supervise\rGoodman.  In addition to the payment of $3,500,000 to settle this\rmatter with the Commission, Refco was censured and also agreed to\restablish certain compliance procedures and to retain an\rindependent consultant to review its systems and procedures.  \r\r     Refco, Blair and Dantone all consented to the above relief\rwithout admitting or denying the findings in the Commission\rorders.\r\r  \x0c\x1a"

The\rCommission\s complaint alleges that between approximately July\r1993 and August 1994, the defendants engaged in the fraudulent\rinterstate offer and sale of unregistered securities in the\rGolden Triangle Wireless Television Partnership, a California\rgeneral partnership (the Golden Triangle Partnership).  The\rcomplaint also alleges that the fraudulent offering raised $8\rmillion and that the unregistered securities were sold to 550\rinvestors in more than 35 states.  \r\r     The complaint alleges that the Golden Triangle Partnership\rwas formed for the purpose of becoming a joint venture partner in\ran entity that would own and operate a wireless television system\rin the area of Texas known as the Golden Triangle, consisting of\rthe cities of Beaumont, Port Arthur and Orange.  The complaint\ralleges that the defendants sold the units using telephone\rsolicitations and the mailing of materially false and misleading\rwritten offering materials.  For example, the complaint alleges\rthat the offering materials distributed to investors contained a\rchart showing that investors could expect a $10,000 investment to\ryield a 100% return over a three-year period, even though there\rwas no credible basis for such projections.  The complaint also\ralleges that the offering materials told investors that $5.8\rmillion of the total offering proceeds would be used to purchase\rlicenses from defendant AmeriComm when, in fact, a substantial\rportion of the $5.8 million was used to pay sales commissions,\roperating expenses and the defendants\ salaries.\r\r     The Commission\s complaint seeks permanent injunctions\ragainst each of the defendants for violations of Section 17(a) of\rthe Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b)\rof the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule\r10b-5 thereunder; against AmeriComm, Coburn, Terry, Stein and\rShiffman for violations of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the\rSecurities Act; and against AmeriComm for violations of Section\r15(a) of the Exchange Act.

Since that\rtime, the SEC has been engaged in a world-wide effort to locate\rand return Antar s ill-gotten assets to the United States. \rRecently, two foreign courts have issued decisions adverse to\rAntar s continuing efforts to retain his fraudulently-obtained\rlucre overseas rather than return it to the shareholders of Crazy\rEddie, Inc., whom he hoodwinked with financial machinations.\r\r     On July 19, 1996, the Court of Appeal of the Canton of\rZurich, Switzerland, issued a ruling whereby the court-appointed \rTrustee/Receiver in the SEC s action against Antar is entitled to\rrecover more than $9,000,000 that Antar had pseudonymously\rdeposited into bank accounts located in that Canton.  The Court\rof Appeal held that the Cantonal courts in Zurich were bound by\rthe prior decision of a Geneva, Switzerland appellate court\rrecognizing and enforcing the U.S. judgment against Antar.  The\rGeneva court decision had precedential effect outside the Canton \rof Geneva and barred Antar from challenging, in the courts of\rZurich, that the U.S. judgment was of a civil nature and did not \rimpose either a criminal sentence or an administrative measure on\rAntar.\r\r     The Trustee/Receiver is represented in Zurich by Dr. Martin \rBernet, of the firm Schellenberg & Haissly and, in the United\rStates, by A.

The English court (per the\rHonorable Mr. Justice Sachs) struck Antar s defense because it\rfound that he was in contumelious breach of a July 8, 1992 order \rof the court requiring him to freeze and disclose all of his\rassets in England.  The English court observed that nearly 50,000\rEnglish pounds worth of Antar s assets were transferred from\rLondon to Liechtenstein on August 3, 1992, less than two weeks\rafter the English court s asset-freeze and disclosure order had\rbeen served on Antar on July 21, 1992.  In response to Antar s\rexcuse that he did not disclose these assets because he had\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\r wholly forgotten  about them, the court stated it was  perfectly\rsatisfied that [Antar] has a wholly cavalier approach to Orders\rof the Court, his explanations for the breaches admitted or\rproved have no credibility.

The Complaint alleges that the\rdefendants\ trading violated Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the\rSecurities and Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Rules\r10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder.  In its Complaint, the Commission\rseeks a permanent injunction against future violations of these\rprovisions, and an order requiring the four defendants to\rdisgorge their illegal trading profits (a total of $261,894) plus\rprejudgment interest and to pay civil penalties pursuant to the\rInsider Trading Sanctions Act of 1984 (for total payments of\rapproximately $520,000).\r\r     According to the Complaint, in mid-January 1995 Mollo\rlearned during a due diligence review by Luxottica\s investment\rbankers that Luxottica was considering a merger with or\racquisition of U.S. Shoe, or its subsidiary, Lenscrafters.

The Complaint alleges that between\rFebruary 21 and March 1, 1995, Giuseppe Fiabane, while in\rpossession of the material, nonpublic information provided by his\rbrother Andrea, bought 6,000 shares of U.S. Shoe common stock and\r410 call option contracts for U.S. Shoe stock at an Italian bank.\r\rThe Complaint alleges that the Luxottica employee to whom Andrea\rFiabane recommended U.S. Shoe purchased 1,500 shares of the stock\ron February 22, 1995.\r\r     Separately, the Complaint alleges that Piccinini obtained\rmaterial, nonpublic information concerning the tender offer when\rhe overheard his immediate supervisor, Giovanni Malavasi, the\rformer Secretary to the Luxottica Board of Directors, discussing\rLuxottica\s intentions to make a tender offer for U.S. Shoe.  The\rComplaint alleges that on February 17, 1995, while in possession\rof that information, Piccinini purchased 4,000 shares of U.S.\rShoe common stock through an Italian bank.

The Defendants consented to the entry of the permanent\rinjunction without admitting or denying the Commission\s\rallegations.   \r  \r     The Commission\s Complaint and other papers filed with the\rCourt on July 24, 1996, alleged that Sellin, a convicted felon\rand repeat securities law violator, conducted an ongoing,\rfraudulent offering of securities through newsgroup bulletin\rboard postings on the Internet, and through advertisements placed\ron CompuServe, an Internet access provider and a world-wide,\rsubscriber-based electronic communications service.  Since\rOctober 1995, Sellin solicited investments through at least 43\radvertisements in at least 21 newsgroups on the Internet.

Sellin represented that he could deliver\rguaranteed returns of anywhere from 12% to 22% annually. \rSellin also offered an investment opportunity to make $150,000\rannually, tax free.

(Ulbery),\rBenjamin Weiss, Fasan Anstalt, Axteria Establishment, Anstalt\rDucata, Anstalt Nifur, Gregory Stainow, Dornford Holdings Ltd.,\rand Melilla Business Corp. in this insider trading case.  The\rfinal judgments identify these individuals and entities as having\reffected, or caused to be effected, the subject purchases of the\rcommon stock of CBI Industries, Inc. (CBI) in violation of the\rfederal securities laws.  At the time it commenced this action,\rbecause all of the trading had been effected through foreign\rfinancial institutions -- three Swiss and one German -- in a\rmanner that concealed the identities of the persons and entities\rbehind the trades, the Commission was unable to identify any of\rthe defendants.  Among other things, the final judgments\rpermanently restrain and enjoin each of the defendants from\rviolating Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act\rof 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder and order defendants\rto disgorge, in the aggregate, the sum of $1.4 million,\rrepresenting their illegal trading profits.\r\r     The Commission\s Complaint, which was filed on November 14,\r1995, alleged that defendants made highly profitable purchases of\rCBI common stock just two days before Praxair, Inc. (Praxair)\rpublicly announced for the first time that it intended to\rcommence a tender offer for the common stock of CBI.  The\rComplaint further alleged that defendants purchased the subject\rCBI stock while in possession of material, nonpublic information\rconcerning Praxair\s impending takeover of CBI.  In the\raggregate, defendants purchased 114,000 CBI shares during the\rtwo-day period before Praxair\s announcement -- representing\rapproximately 16% of the total volume of trades on those days. \rOn the same day that the Commission filed its Complaint, Judge\rPollack entered a Temporary Restraining Order freezing the\rsubject CBI shares and any proceeds from the sales of the shares.\r\rOn December 12, 1995, Judge Pollack entered a Preliminary\rInjunction continuing the asset freeze during the pendency of the\rproceeding.  (See Litigation Release Numbers 14721 and 14756.) \rAs a result of these Orders and two subsequent Orders, which had\rthe effect of substituting cash for frozen CBI shares, in excess\rof $2 million was frozen and is presently held in the Court\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\rRegistry Investment System (CRIS).\r\r     As set forth in the Commission\s papers filed in support of\rthe final judgments, Ulbery, an asset management company located\rin Zurich, effected the purchases of 63,000 of the CBI shares\rinvolved in this action, through Nordfinanz Bank Zurich, on\rbehalf of Fasan Anstalt, Axteria Establishment, Anstalt Ducata,\rand Anstalt Nifur -- all of which are believed to Liechtenstein\rentities.  Benjamin Weiss, a Nordfinanz employee and one of the\rtwo sole shareholders of Ulbery, made the decision to purchase\rthese shares and had discretionary trading authority over the\raccounts maintained by the four Liechtenstein entities.  As is\ralso described in the Commission\s papers, Stainow, a former\rbusiness associate of Weiss, directed the purchase of 1,000 CBI\rshares through an account at another foreign financial\rinstitution. The frozen funds presently on deposit with the CRIS\rrepresent the proceeds from the sale or other disposition of all\rof the CBI shares purchased by Ulbery and Stainow.\r\r     With respect to the other 50,000 CBI shares involved in this\raction, as described in the Commission\s papers, a purchase of\r15,000 shares was made on behalf of an entity known as Dornford\rHoldings Ltd., which is registered in both Panama and the British\rVirgin Islands and domiciled in Zurich; and a purchase of 35,000\rshares was made on behalf of an entity known as Melilla Business\rCorp., a Panamanian corporation domiciled in Zurich.\r\r     The final judgment as to defendants Ulbery, Weiss, Fasan\rAnstalt, Axteria Establishment, Anstalt Ducata, Anstalt Nifur,\rand Stainow provides for satisfaction of their disgorgement\robligation from the frozen funds that are on deposit with the\rCRIS.

Shull consented to the entry of the final\rjudgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the\rCommission\s Complaint.  The Court entered the final judgments\ragainst L. Fiessel and C.

(Fairmont), to manipulate the price of Fairmont\s stock\rand to sell their holdings in Fairmont at prices that were\rartificially enhanced by their manipulation.  To further this\rscheme, Shull and the Fiessels paid kickbacks in the form of cash\rand/or stock to one U.S. promoter and five U.S. stockbrokers. \rThe Complaint alleges that the kickbacks, the total value of\rwhich was approximately $600,000, were essentially bribes to\rinduce the stockbrokers to recommend and sell Fairmont stock to\rtheir U.S. retail brokerage customers and resulted in the sale of\rover one million shares of Fairmont to more than 150 residents in\rseventeen states.  The Complaint further alleges that Shull and\rthe Fiessels used several Canadian brokerage accounts in various\rnames to conduct a pattern of manipulative trades in Fairmont\rduring the spring of 1993.  As a result of their manipulative\ractivity, the price of Fairmont rose from $0.30 (Canadian) per\rshare to $3.05 (Canadian) per share in a period of less than six\rmonths.  \r\r     The federal court previously entered orders enjoining\rPatrick Collins, Mark Hamel (Hamel), Robert Raffa (Raffa),\rJeffrey Fernandez, Michael Murphy and William Cho (Cho) from\rfuture violations of the securities laws and ordering\rdisgorgement of the amounts each received as kickbacks from Shull\rand the Fiessels.

Instead, Brown\rmisappropriated approximately $1,702,031 of the monies raised\rfrom investors.

RONALD MARGOLIN, et al., 92 Civ. 6307 (PKL)\r\rNEW YORK -- The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that in a Memorandum\rOrder dated August 8, 1996, United States District Judge Peter K. Leisure of the\rSouthern District of New York found Ronald Margolin in civil contempt of a Final\rJudgment issued by the Court against him, and ordered that he be incarcerated until\rhe purges the contempt.\r\r     On January 20, 1993, the SEC obtained the Final Judgment against Margolin and\rothers that, among other things, orders Margolin to disgorge $893,410.04, and pay\rpenalties of $838,305.00.  The Final Judgment was affirmed by the United States\rCourt of Appeals for the Second Circuit on September 13, 1993.\r\r     The SEC\s complaint, filed on August 20, 1992, charged Margolin and others\rwith securities free-riding in violation of the federal securities laws.  In\rfurtherance of the free-riding scheme, which lasted from September 1991 to April\r1992, Margolin and his co-defendants made misrepresentations to brokers which\rincluded false assessments of their net worth, their ability to deliver funds or\rsecurities if the market moved adversely, their intention to settle unprofitable \rtrades, and, in some cases, their identities, in order to induce brokers to do\rbusiness with them.   Margolin and his co-defendants refused to pay for the\runprofitable trades, leaving the brokerage firms to absorb the resulting losses. \rMargolin and his co-defendants netted over $140,000 from the scheme, and avoided\rlosses of over $640,000.\r\r     In its Memorandum Opinion, the Court found that since the entry of the Final\rJudgment, Margolin has not paid any amount towards satisfying the Final Judgment,\rdespite three years of collection efforts by the SEC.  The Memorandum Opinion traced\rthe SEC\s efforts to collect from Margolin, including the SEC\s numerous requests to\rMargolin for financial information to determine his ability to satisfy the Final\rJudgment.  The Court noted that Margolin consistently claimed inability to pay,\rwhile providing the SEC with a wealth of incomplete and unsubstantiated financial\rinformation.  When subpoenaed for documents and testimony concerning his financial\rstatus, Margolin invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege, and refused to provide any\rinformation.\r\r     The Court held that Margolin is bound to comply with the Final Judgment, or\rbear the burden of showing plainly and unmistakably why compliance is impossible. \rThe Court found that Margolin failed to meet this standard.  The Court also found\rthat while Margolin is entitled to assert his Fifth Amendment privilege to financial\rdisclosure, that does not relieve him of his burden of producing evidence showing\rthat compliance is impossible.\r\r     Holding that Margolin\s failure to comply with the Final Judgment is a harm of\rsubstantial magnitude, undermining the deterrent effect of SEC enforcement actions\rand the enforceability of court orders, Judge Leisure found that any sanction of\rlesser severity than incarceration would be ineffective to coerce Margolin\s\rcompliance.  Because Margolin is presently incarcerated in an unrelated criminal\rcase, Judge Leisure ordered that Margolin be incarcerated when he is released from\rcriminal custody until such time as he purges his civil contempt.\x1a"

According to the Commission\s complaint,\roffering materials for ISA\s IPO materially misstated its net\rincome to make the company appear more profitable than it\ractually was prior to the IPO.  In particular, ISA\s revenues\rwere shifted forward in periods before the July 1990 IPO and were\rthen shifted back and decelerated in the period after the IPO. \rThe complaint alleged that, to conceal the fraud, Polansky, ISA\s\rpresident, chairman and chief executive officer, instructed\rCapps, ISA\s chief financial officer, and Guerriero, ISA\s\rassistant controller, to create two sets of contracts to provide\radvertising and other services to some of its clients.  One set\rof contracts correctly reflected the amounts, conditions and time\rperiod for which ISA\s clients had paid for services.

As a\rresult, the Commission alleges that for its year ended December\r31, 1991, JWP reported net income of $60.3 million, which was\rmaterially overstated by approximately $31.4 million; for its\rquarter ended March 31, 1992, JWP reported net income of $1.4\rmillion, which was materially overstated by approximately $14.6\rmillion; and, for its quarter ended June 30, 1992, JWP disclosed\rnet income of $393,000, which was materially overstated by\rapproximately $54 million.

The final judgment\ras to Earp was entered pursuant to Earp s consent, while the\rfinal judgment as to Trans-American was entered upon the\rCommission s motion for default judgment.  Earp is a resident of\rPalm Desert, California.  The action continues against defendant\rDavid P.

Finally, the Complaint alleged that Earp and Silver\rviolated the broker registration provision of the federal\rsecurities laws (Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act) by acting as\rbrokers without being registered as such with the Commission.\r\r     The Commission alleged in its Complaint that, beginning in\rNovember 1993 and continuing into December 1994, the defendants\roffered and sold to the public investments designated as\rpartnership units in 17 ostrich partnerships.  Defendants raised\rat least $7.45 million through the sale of the ostrich\rpartnership units to approximately 350 investors in at least 40\rstates.\r\r     The final judgment entered against Earp contains all of the\rpermanent injunctive relief requested in the Complaint. \rSpecifically, Earp is enjoined permanently from violating\rSections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section\r10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\r15(a) of the Exchange Act.

Specifically, Trans-American is enjoined permanently \rfrom violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities\rAct and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5\rthereunder.  In addition, Trans-American is ordered to pay\r$7,170,000 in disgorgement, pre-judgment interest thereon in the\ramount of $863,342.58, and a civil penalty of $7,170,000.\r\r     The Commission today also announced the institution of\radministrative proceedings pursuant to Section 15(b)(4) of the\rExchange Act against Earp based upon the entry of the injunction\rdescribed above.

The Commission\s Complaint alleges that Tudor\rviolated the short sale rule, which permits short sales only\runder certain circumstances.  Simultaneously with the filing of\rthe action, Tudor consented, without admitting or denying the\rallegations of the Complaint, to the entry of a final judgment. \rThe proposed Final Judgment requires that Tudor pay $800,000 to\rthe United States as a civil penalty under the Securities\rEnforcement Remedies and Penny Stock Reform Act of 1990.  As part\rof the settlement of this matter, Tudor simultaneously consented\rto the issuance by the Commission of an Order requiring Tudor to\rcease and desist from violations of the short sale rule.  In the\rMatter of Tudor Investment Corporation, Administrative Proceeding\rFile No. 3-9077, (September 12, 1996).\r\r     The Commission\s Complaint alleges that Tudor is the trading\radvisor for a number of investment funds.  The Complaint further\ralleges that on March 15 and 16, 1994, Tudor sold short over\r1,743,500 shares of 27 of the 30 stocks listed on the New York\rStock Exchange which comprised the Dow Jones Industrial Average\r(the Dow Stocks) in violation of the short sale rule, Section\r10(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10a-1 thereunder.  Rule 10a-1\r(the short sale rule) provides that short sales (i.e., sales of\ra security that the seller does not own) of exchange-listed\rsecurities may be effected only at a price above the price at\rwhich the immediately preceding sale was effected (plus tick),\ror at a price equal to the last sale if the last preceding\rtransaction at a different price was a lower price (zero-plus\rtick), when compared to the reported last sale price.  The\rholder of a particular security must aggregate its long and short\rpositions together pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 3b-3 to\rdetermine whether it has a net short position in a particular\rsecurity and therefore is obligated to comply with the short sale\rrule.\r\r     The Complaint alleges that on March 15 and 16, 1994, Tudor\rfailed to aggregate its long and short positions in the 27 Dow\rstocks when such aggregation would have shown that it had a net\rshort position in these stocks, and directed the sales of such\rsecurities without regard to compliance with the short sale rule.\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\rAs a result, 174 short sale transactions by Tudor on March 15 and\r16, 1994 in the 27 Dow stocks with a market value of over $98\rmillion were not effectuated on either a plus tick or a zero-plus\rtick.  These sales were a significant factor in a 16 point drop\rin the DJIA, which produced an approximate $1.5 million gain for\rTudor in its short position.  Tudor did not attempt to realize\rsuch gain and closed out its short position over a period of\rseveral months beginning in May of 1994, ultimately incurring a\rloss of approximately $3,300,000.\x0c\x1a"

Although the CCLP offering purportedly was a private\rplacement to accredited investors, Colonial sold limited\rpartnership units to far more than the 35 nonaccredited investors\rpermitted by Commission regulations.\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\r     The complaint also alleged that, with the knowledge,\rapproval and/or participation of various Defendants:  Colonial\rconcealed its financial problems from investors as the CCLP\roffering progressed; Googel, B. Sisti and Candelori signed false\rcertifications in connection with the sale of investor notes to\rfinancial institutions; and Colonial failed to disclose that\rdistributions to investors in its partnerships were funded\rfrequently by loans from other Colonial partnerships. \rAccording to the Complaint, Autuori participated in sales\rseminars and other meetings with prospective investors, assuring\rthem that Constitution Plaza would generate the revenues\rprojected in CCLP\s offering memorandum, and assisted in the\rpreparation of materially misleading sales literature.  In\rSeptember 1990, shortly after the CCLP offering was suspended,\rColonial was forced into bankruptcy and CCLP limited partners\rsubsequently lost their entire investment.  Autuori is the sole\rremaining defendant in the Commission\s civil action. \r\r(For further information, See Litigation Release Nos. 14432,\r14448, 14612, 14723 and 14916) \x0c\x1a"

Sands, et al.\rCivil Action No. 93-7510 JGD (JRx)\r\rLitigation Release No. 15046 / September 16, 1996\r\rAccounting and Auditing Enforcement \rRelease No. 814 / September 16, 1996\r\r     On August 30, 1996, the Honorable Judge John G. Davies,\rCentral District of California, issued his findings of fact,\rconclusion of law, and judgment, in which he found that\rdefendants Leonard S. Sands (Sands), First Pacific Bancorp\r(Bancorp), and PacVen, Inc., violated the anti-fraud and\rdisclosure provisions of the federal securities laws in\rconnection with three financing schemes: (1) the fraudulent\rfunding of the Bancorp offering, (2) the improper recording of\rresidual interest wrap notes (RIWNs) as assets and as income on\rthe consolidated financial statements of the Bancorp, and (3) the\rimproper recording of unfunded certificates of deposit issued by\rthe National Bank of Liberia, the central bank of that country,\rand then offering them to the public for sale. \r\r     1.   THE 1987 BANCORP OFFERING\r\r     In 1987, the Bancorp offered for sale, pursuant to a\rregistration statement filed with the Commission, $2.55 million \runits in a mini-max offering.  The prospectus called for a\rminimum funding level of $1.5 million. The prospectus also\rrequired the refund of subscriptions if the minimum funding did\rnot occur. \r\r     In November 1987, one month after the minimum was to have\rbeen raised and one month prior to closing, a check in the amount\rof $1 million, drawn on the Bank of Montreal through its branch\rin the Bahamas, was returned through international banking\rchannels.  Instead of refunding subscriptions proceeds, as\rpromised by the prospectus, defendant Sands, Chairman of both the\rBancorp and the Bank, bought the $1 million position to save the\roffering from failing.  \r\r     Because Sands, a control person, bought in the offering to\rsave it, the Court found that defendant Sands\ purchase was not a\rbona fide investment and accordingly held that Sands and Bancorp\rhad violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933\r(Securities Act), and Section 10(b) and Rules 10b-5 and 10b-9\rof the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act.).  The\rCourt also found that defendant Sands had failed to file the\rrequisite Form 4, as required by Section 16(a) of the Exchange\rAct and Rule 16a-3 thereunder, and an amendment to Schedule 13D,\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\ras required by Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13d-2\rthereunder, for having increased his ownership in Bancorp by over\r1%.\r\r     Moreover, the Court found that defendant Sands had schemed,\ralong with defendant Charles W. Knapp (Knapp), to divert\r$500,000 of offering proceeds of PacVen into the Bancorp\roffering. Defendants Sands and Knapp diverted the PacVen offering\rproceeds, purportedly in exchange for commercial paper issued\rby Trafalgar Holdings, Ltd., a Knapp company, through several\rother affiliated companies of Trafalgar and into the Bancorp\roffering to help reach the minimum.  By diverting the funds\rthrough Knapp\s companies and into the failed Bancorp offering,\rthe Court held that defendants Sands and Bancorp violated Section\r17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act\rand Rules 10b-5 and 10b-9 thereunder. (Defendant Knapp settled\rthe first day of trial.)  The Court also held that Sands violated\rSection 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) and Rule\r10b-5 thereunder because he caused the diversion of PacVen\s\roffering proceeds into an affiliated company.  The registration\rstatement prohibited affiliated party transactions.  Sands was\rChairman of both the Bancorp and Pacven, and he was CEO of both\rcompanies.  \r\r     Further, the Court found that PacVen\s annual report for\r1987 and its first two quarterly reports for 1988 contained the\rmaterially false and misleading statement that PacVen had loaned\r$500,000 of the proceeds to an unrelated party, at nine percent\rinterest, in exchange for a secured promissory note.  These\rperiodic reports were materially false and misleading because the\rmonies had been diverted (not loaned), the promissory note was\rnot secured, and the note was continuously extended without\rever being required to be repaid to PacVen.  Moreover, these\rreports failed to disclose the material fact that the $500,000\roffering proceeds had been diverted and failed to disclose the\raffiliate transaction between Bancorp and PacVen.  Accordingly,\rdefendants Sands and PacVen were held to have violated Section\r10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  PacVen and\rSands were also held to have violated, without a showing of\rscienter, Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20,\r15d-1 and 15d-3 thereunder, Sands for having failed to correct\rthe accuracy of those reports.   Further, Sands was held to have\rviolated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. \r\r     Finally, the Court held that PacVen violated Section\r13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act for failing to maintain accurate\rbooks and records of the disposition of the funds.  Sands was\rheld to have violated Section 13(b)(2)(A) and Rule 13b2-1 and\rSection 20(a) of the Exchange Act because he knew or was reckless\rin not knowing that PacVen had inaccurately recorded the\rdiversion as a loan and failed to have the records corrected. \x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 3======\r\r     See also Exchange act Release No. 33295 (December 7, 1993). \r\r     2.   THE RESIDUAL INTEREST WRAP NOTES \r\r     In September and October 1989, in another effort to make it\rappear the Bank was healthy, Bancorp and the Bank acquired eight\rRIWNs in exchange for $766,000 cash from the Bank and eight\rseries of perpetual preferred stock, 100 shares per series, of\rthe Bancorp.  RIWNs are all-inclusive purchase money notes which\rwrap around and are subordinate to a HUD mortgage note, the\rprincipal financing instrument for low-income housing projects. \rIn valuing these RIWNs, however, the Court found that the\rmethodology and assumptions employed to calculate the present\rvalue of the RIWNs were flawed, among other reasons, because the\rdefendants relied on inflated appraisals reports on the\runderlying HUD projects written at an earlier point in time, for\ra different company, and for a different purpose; and because\rdefendants built into a set of agreed-upon procedures to be\rapplied by Touche Ross, an outside accounting firm, assumptions\rdesigned to overstate the present value of the RIWNs. \rNevertheless, it was these values which formed the basis for the\rBancorp\s reporting of the eight RIWNs as assets.  \r     In December 1989, the Bank acquired three additional RIWNs\rin exchange for unearned fees from a real estate development\rproject, which consisted of $1,060,000 in up-front consulting\rfees and $968,000 in back-end success fees (i.e., 50% of the\rprojected net profit on sale of the completed housing project). \rHowever, Deloitte, Haskins & Sells (DH&S), the Bancorp\s\rindependent auditors, advised defendants Sands and Bancorp that\rthese fees could not be recognized as income because the earnings\rprocess was not complete (i.e., there was little documentary\revidence to show that the services had been performed by year-end\ras represented, and there was a question as to their\rcollectability.)  To circumvent these problems, the Bank\rcombined and re-packaged the consulting and success fees\runder a new label, called development fees, which the Bancorp\rdefined in its filings with the Commission as residual profit\rinterests in real estate developments.  The Bank then swapped\rthese fees for the three additional RIWNs.  By this maneuver, the\rBank recorded revenue in the amount of $1,968,709 -- the exact\ramount of consulting and success fees -- on the 1989 Bancorp\rfinancial statements.  \r\r     The Court found that the Bancorp filed periodic reports with\rthe Commission which contained materially false and misleading\rstatements regarding the transaction by which it and the Bank\racquired RIWNs, the description and value of the RIWNs, and the\rfinancial condition of those entities.  In addition, the Court\rfound that the improper inclusion of the RIWNs in the financial\rstatements in the 1989 10-K and March 1990 10-Q allowed Bancorp\rto convey the false impression that Bancorp\s financial condition\rwas improving when, in fact, it had deteriorated materially. \x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 4======\r\r     The Court found that defendants Sands and Bancorp pumped up\rshareholders\ equity and assets simply by issuing the perpetual\rpreferred stock of the Bancorp.  In the consolidated financial\rstatements incorporated in its annual report for the fiscal year\rending December 31, 1989 (1989 10-K) and in a quarterly report\rfor the period ended March 31, 1990 (March 1990 10-Q), Bancorp\rrecorded and reported as assets $5,618,000 purportedly\rrepresenting the value of eleven (11) RIWNs.  In fact, the eleven\rRIWNs had a value of no more than approximately $766,000, the\rcash consideration paid by Bank for the first eight (8) of the\rRIWNs.  The inclusion of the RIWNs  in the consolidated financial\rstatements, however, increased shareholders\ equity by over 150%,\r\rfrom approximately $3.3 million in 1988 to $8.35 million for 1989\rand at March 31, 1990.  In fact, Bancorp\s shareholders\ equity\rhad decreased materially in 1989 and at March 31, 1990.   \r\r     The Court further found that the periodic reports were\rmaterially false and misleading by improperly recognizing the\r$1.968 in development fees as income upon the exchange of\rconsulting and success fees for three of the RIWNs.  There were\rno actual consulting fees paid to the Bank. Instead, the\rconsulting fees were simply added to the outstanding amount of\rthe loans made to the developer and straw borrowers by the\rBank.  Moreover, the loans were structured so that all loan fees\rand interest would be funded by lines of credit, requiring no\rdebt service by the borrowers. \r\r     Prior to resigning as auditors in May 1989, DH&S had\rdetermined that the upfront consulting fees could not be\rrecognized as income because the fees were inextricably linked\rto the loans. DH&S had also determined that the loan arrangements\rconstituted a joint venture, and as such, the consulting fees\rwere equity kickers (i.e., an advance payments against overall\rexpected residual profits).  As such, income recognition was\rimpermissible. \r\r     Therefore, the Court concluded that the Bank\s recording of\rthese development fees, merely by swapping unearned consulting\rand success fees for three RIWNS, resulted in a material\roverstatement of pretax income of $18,146 (instead of a loss of\rapproximately $2 million). \r\r     Thus, the Court held that defendants Sands and Bancorp\rviolated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5\rthereunder.  Moreover, the Court held that defendant Bancorp\rviolated Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-\r1 and 13a-13 thereunder.  Further, the Court held that defendant\rSands was liable with and to the same extent, under Section 20(a)\rof the Exchange Act, as the Bancorp for these violations.\r\r     See also  Exchange Act Release No. 33296, Accounting and\rAuditing Enforcement Release No. 511; and Litigation Release No.\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 5======\r\r14051,  Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release No. 549\r(April 13, 1994). \r\r     3.   THE CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT ISSUED BY THE NATIONAL Bank\r          OF LIBERIA\r\r          a.   False and Misleading Periodic Reports \r\r      In a further attempt to cure the Bank\s and Bancorp\s\rdeteriorating capital base and to relieve pressure from bank\rregulators, defendants Sands, Geiger and Bancorp obtained six\runfunded certificates of deposit issued by the National Bank of\rLiberia (NBL) with face value of $3 million, for which these\rdefendants agreed to swap an additional 100 shares of Bancorp\s\rperpetual preferred stock.  \r\r     The Court found that, in 1990, Bancorp filed periodic\rreports with the Commission which contained materially false and\rmisleading statements about the value of the six CD\s and the\rtransaction in which Bancorp acquired them.  In the consolidated\rfinancial statements contained in its 1989 10-K and March 1990\r10-Q, Bancorp reported as an asset the $3 million face value of\rsix CD\s.  In fact, the CD\s had a value of zero; they were never\rfunded by NBL or by any other entity. \r\r     By recording and reporting the six CD\s as assets of $3\rmillion, the defendants not only overstated working capital from\roperations for year-end 1989, but in addition, inflated\rshareholders\ equity by 57% -- up from $5.3 million to $8.3\rmillion. \r\r     The Court held that defendant Sands and Bancorp had violated\rSection 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act because, prior\rto filing the 1989 10-K and March 1990 10-Q, Sands and Bancorp\rknew or were reckless in not knowing that the six CD\s had no\rvalue, but permitted the filing of false periodic reports anyway.\r\r\r     The Court also held that defendants Sands and Bancorp\rviolated Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule s 12b-20,\r13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder for the material omissions and\rmisstatements.   Defendant Sands was further held liable, under\rSection 20(a) of the exchange Act, with and to the same extent as\rdefendant Bancorp. \r\r     [See Exchange Release No. 33296;  Accounting and Auditing\rEnforcement Release No. 511.  See also Exchange Act Release No.\r33294; Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release No. 509.]  \r\r          b.   The Offer to Sell Liberian CDs\r\r     The Court found that, from January through May 1990,\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 6======\r\rdefendants Bancorp, Sands and Geiger, together with defendant\rDass, acting through defendant Apex, attempted to sell all forty\r(40) of the unfunded CD\s both within the United States and\rabroad.  This included the six CD\s acquired by Bancorp.  \r\r     The Court first concluded that a Liberian CD was an evidence\rof indebtedness and thus a security because, among other\rthings, investors were not accorded the same level of protection\rprovided to CDs issued in the United States; Liberia was\rvirtually bankrupt and had been blacklisted from the IMF; and\rLiberia was experiencing a civil war. \r\r     The Court then found that defendants Bancorp, Sands and\rGeiger, when offering the CD\s for sale, knew that the CD\s had\rno value.  Nevertheless, they made materially false and\rmisleading statements, and omitted material facts, regarding the\rCD\s to the investing public.  \r\r     Accordingly, the Court held that defendant Bancorp violated\rSection 17(a) of the Securities Act.  Defendant Geiger had yet to\rbe tried on these same allegations. \r\r     4.   RELIEF\r\r     Even though the conduct occurred in 1987 through 1990, the\rCourt held that injunctions were appropriate against defendants\rSands, Bancorp and PacVen.  The Court found evidence of a high\rlevel of scienter in this case, numerous violations of the\rfederal securities laws, including a pattern of untimely filing\rof periodic reports and reports which contained numerous\rmaterials misstatements or omissions, and the lack of recognition\rof any wrongdoing. \r\r     The Court also found defendant Sands substantially unfit to\rserve as an officer or director of a public company.  The Court\rfound that Sands engaged in conflicts of interest, breached his\rfiduciary duties to the shareholders of both Bancorp and PacVen,\rmade false representations to auditors, denied auditors access to\rcrucial information, extracted large fees (both legal and\rconsulting) from the Bank under a management service contract\rbetween the Bank and the Bancorp, received interest payment on\rthe debentures he unlawfully purchased, and engaged in a pattern\rof late and misleading filings.  Accordingly, Court held that\rdefendant Sands, though a lawyer, should be permanently and\runconditionally barred from ever acting as an officer or director\rof a public company. \r\r     Further, defendant Sands and Bancorp were jointly and\rseverally ordered to make restitution of $688,000 in connection\rwith their fraudulent funding of the 1987 Bancorp offering.  That\ramount represented the $500,000 diverted from PacVen, and the\r$188,000 raised from the public.  The Court also ordered\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 7======\r\rprejudgment interest from the date of December 1987, the closing\rof the Bancorp offering, to date of entry of judgment.  \r\r     See also Litigation Release No. 13904 (December 14, 1993);\rand Release No. 1401 (April 13, 1994).   \x0c\x1a"

The Commission filed a motion seeking leave\rof the court to file the brief.  In O Hagan, a three-judge panel\rof the court of appeals rejected the  misappropriation  theory of\rinsider trading under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and the\rCommission s Rule 10b-5.  In so holding, the panel rejected the\rdecisions of the Second, Seventh and Ninth Circuit Courts of\rAppeals, which have all accepted the misappropriation theory, and\rfollowed the recent decision of the Fourth Circuit Court of\rAppeals in United States v. Bryan.\r\r     The panel also invalidated, as beyond the Commission s\rauthority, the Commission s Rule 14e-3, which prohibits insider\rtrading in connection with tender offers.  This holding conflicts\rwith the decisions of three other circuit courts--the Second,\rSeventh, and Tenth Circuit Courts of Appeals--which have upheld\rthe validity of Rule 14e-3.\r\r     The Commission s brief urges the Eighth Circuit to rehear\rthe O Hagan case en banc and to follow the decisions of those\rcourts which have upheld the use of these important tools in the\rCommission s attack on insider trading.\x0c\x1a"

FUTREX, INC., FUTREX\rMEDICAL INSTRUMENTATION, INC., AND ROBERT D. ROSENTHAL, Civil\rAction No. 96-CV-02192  (D.D.C.)\r\r     On September 23, 1996, the Securities and Exchange\rCommission filed a fraud action in the United States District\rCourt for the District of Columbia against Futrex, Inc., Futrex\rMedical Instrumentation, Inc. (collectively, Futrex), and\rRobert D. Rosenthal (Rosenthal), Futrex\s Chairman of the\rBoard, Chief Executive Officer, President, and Treasurer.  The\rCommission\s complaint alleges that Futrex and Rosenthal made\rmaterially false and misleading statements in connection with a\r$1.85 million private placement (private placement) of debt\rsecurities in May and August 1994, and a proposed initial public\roffering (IPO)  of 1.8 million shares of common stock at an\ranticipated price of $10 per share.\r\r     The complaint alleges that in connection with both the\rprivate placement and the IPO, Futrex and Rosenthal stated\rfalsely that Futrex\s hand-held Dream Beam analyzer could\rmeasure and accurately predict a person\s blood glucose level by\rpassing infrared light through a finger.  However, neither the\rDream Beam nor any other infrared blood glucose analyzer tested\rby Futrex has ever been capable of predicting blood glucose\rlevels accurately.  The complaint further alleges that not one of\rFutrex\s top scientific and technical employees has ever reviewed\ror analyzed any data that would support claims made by Rosenthal\rand Futrex that the blood glucose analyzer, as configured by\rFutrex, actually works.\r\r     The complaint further alleges that Rosenthal selectively\rused data from a study Futrex conducted in 1991 at Mount Sinai\rMedical Center to make the results of the study appear to show a\rhigh correlation, unsupported by the data, between infrared scans\rand blood glucose levels.  In fact, the complaint alleges, the\rMount Sinai study failed to demonstrate any correlation between\rblood glucose and infrared scans.\r\r     The complaint further alleges that, in the fall of 1992,\rFutrex conducted unsuccessful studies which tested both a device\rcalled the Futrex 9000 and a version of the Dream Beam, the\rportable, hand-held analyzer.  According to the complaint, the\rdata from the fall 1992 studies was analyzed on a supercomputer\rand showed no correlation between infrared scans and blood\rglucose levels.  Futrex failed to disclose the adverse results of\rthe fall 1992 studies in its registration statement and\x0c\r\r\r\r\r\rprospectus.  The complaint further alleges that during the course\rof another field study conducted in 1995, Rosenthal knew that the\rdata being generated in the tests was useless because of a\rmanufacturing defect in all of the Dream Beams.  Nevertheless,\rRosenthal directed his staff to proceed with the tests in order\rto avoid the embarrassing disclosure of the manufacturing defect\rto participants in the studies.\r\r     The complaint further alleges that Rosenthal made materially\rfalse and misleading statements to investors during the marketing\rof the IPO.  During some of these meetings, Rosenthal\rdemonstrated a Dream Beam which he said had been custom\rcalibrated for him.  After the Dream Beam gave a reading,\rRosenthal stated that it appeared to be his correct blood glucose\rlevel based on his knowledge, as a diabetic, of what his blood\rsugar level should be.  Before the meetings, however, Rosenthal\rdirected a Futrex employee to program a Dream Beam to function as\rif it were giving a glucose reading, when in fact the reading had\rnothing to do with the results of the infrared scan. \rAccordingly, the complaint alleges, the Dream Beam readings\rRosenthal demonstrated at investor meetings were meaningless and\rintended solely to deceive potential investors.\r\r     The complaint further alleges that, in 1994, Futrex and\rRosenthal made materially false and misleading statements to\rinvestors in a private placement of debt securities.  The\rcomplaint also alleges that, at meetings with potential\rinvestors, Rosenthal stated falsely that Futrex had shown that\rthe infrared measurement of blood glucose levels was feasible\rwith a laboratory instrument, and that Futrex had perfected such\ran instrument.  In addition, according to the complaint,\rRosenthal stated falsely that the Dream Beam measured blood\rglucose more accurately than conventional finger-poke tests.\r\r     The complaint seeks permanent injunctions against Futrex,\rInc., Futrex Medical Instrumentation, Inc., and Rosenthal,\renjoining them from future violations of antifraud provisions of\rthe federal securities laws.  The complaint also seeks an order\rthat Futrex, Inc., pursuant to a plan to be proposed by the\rCommission and approved by the Court, offer to investors in the\rprivate placement rescission of their purchases of Futrex debt\rsecurities.  In addition, the complaint seeks civil monetary\rpenalties from Rosenthal. \x0c\x1a"

By reason of the foregoing, the\rcomplaint charges that HSG violated Section 17(a) of the\rSecurities Act and HSG and McCartney violated Section 10(b) of\rthe Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.\r\r     The complaint alleges that, although HSG received written\rcancellation notices concerning 41 facilities during the initial\rphase of the offering and notices concerning an additional 66\rfacilities during the pendency of the over allotment phase of\rHSG\s July 1990 public offering, at the closing of both the\rinitial and over-allotment phases of the offering, the Company,\rin a statement signed by Cook, represented to the primary\runderwriter for the offering that: There has not been any\rmaterial adverse change, or any development involving a\rprospective material adverse change, in the condition, financial\ror otherwise, or in the earnings, business or operations of the\rCompany... from that set forth in the registration statement. \rThe complaint alleges that, in so doing, Cook violated Section\r10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.\r\r          HSG Improperly Accounted for Cancellation Fees as\r          Income in the Financial Statements Incorporated in Its\r          July 1990 Form S-2, Its Form 10-Q for the Second\r          Quarter of 1990, and Its 1990 Form 10-K\x0c\r\r\r\r\r\r     In September 1988, HSG purchased American Services Company\r(ASC), a subsidiary of Southmark Corporation, in exchange for\r950,000 shares of HSG common stock and $8.5 million in\rdebentures.  ASC\s principal assets were service agreements with\rnursing and retirement facilities operated or owned by Southmark-\rcontrolled limited partnerships for the provision of housekeeping\rand laundry services over a term of twenty years.  The service\ragreements provided that cancellation by the facilities without\rcause was subject to a substantial penalty.  According to the\rCommission\s complaint, in 1989, a change in management occurred\rat Southmark and new management informed HSG of its intention to\rterminate HSG\s services to the facilities Southmark controlled. \r\r\r     In January 1990 Southmark and HSG executed an Amended\rAgreement, reflecting terms agreed to in June 1989, that\rprovided, among other things, that the HSG stock transferred to\rSouthmark would be allocated to the various partnerships, which\rcould then, should they decide to cancel the HSG agreements,\rsatisfy the cancellation penalties by release of their allocation\rof HSG stock.  The Amended Agreement closed on July 16, 1990.   \r\r     In the financial statements incorporated in its Form 10-Q\rfor the second quarter of 1990, and in its consolidated statement\rof income for the six months ended June 30, 1990, included in its\rJuly 1990 Form S-2, the Company recognized as pre-tax income\rapproximately $1 million in cancellation fees from the release of\rHSG stock pursuant to the Amended Agreement.  This $1 million\rfigure was derived primarily by multiplying the number of shares\rceded to HSG with respect to cancelling facilities by the\rincrease in market price of HSG stock between the date of the\roriginal American Services transaction and the cancellation\rdates.  The cancellation fees increased HSG\s pre-tax income for\rthe second quarter of 1990 from $1.16 to $2.18 million.\r\r     The Commission\s complaint alleges that HSG was not\rpermitted under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)\rto recognize income from the above-described transactions in its\rown stock.  Moreover, the $1 million in cancellation fee income\rwas not identified as a distinct component of income, separate\rfrom service revenues, even though it represented a material\ramount of HSG\s income for the second quarter, six month period\rand year, and was derived from a source outside HSG\s standard\rbusiness activities.  See Regulation S-X, \x15 210.5-03(b)7 (Non-\roperating Income).  By reason of the foregoing, the complaint\rcharges that HSG violated Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and\rRules 13a-1, 13a-13 and 12b-20 thereunder and that McCartney and\rCook, as controlling persons of HSG for purposes of Section 20(a)\rof the Exchange Act at all relevant times, are liable for HSG\s\rviolations of these provisions.\r\r          HSG Improperly Accounted for Cancellation Fees as\r\r                   \r==========================================START OF PAGE 3======\x0c\r\r\r\r\r\r          Income in the Financial Statements Incorporated in Its\r          Form 10-Q for the Third Quarter of 1990\r\r     In the financial statements included in its Form 10-Q for\rthe third quarter of 1990, HSG reported $302,672 in income before\rtaxes from service agreements cancelled.  The inclusion of this\ramount increased HSG\s third quarter income by 13%.  In the notes\rto its quarterly financial statements, HSG stated that it had\rdeferred approximately $3,150,000 of potential pre-tax gain\r[from cancellation fees] and has elected to recognize it in the\rfuture on a cash recovery basis.  In all instances, the\rfacilities were deemed to have paid the cancellation fees through\rthe release of HSG stock in connection with the unwinding of the\rASC acquisition.  According to the complaint, this accounting\rtreatment was not in conformity with GAAP. \r\r          HSG Improperly Recognized Gain From Appreciation in\r          Market Value of HSG Stock in Its 1990 Form 10-K\r\r     During the fourth quarter of 1990, although no cancellation\rfee income was recognized in the income statement, $2,577,000 in\rgain from the appreciation in market value of HSG stock allocated\rto the cancelling facilities was credited by HSG to equity to\roffset charges against stockholders\ equity on its balance sheet,\rrather than recorded as expenses in the income statement for\rDecember 31, 1990.  According to the complaint, this accounting\rtreatment was not in conformity with GAAP.  The charges included\r$1,673,000 in income taxes payable on cancellation fee income,\r$700,000 for a reserve against uncollectible receivables due from\rthe cancelling facilities, and $204,000 of legal and accounting\rfees relating to cancellations.  Further, HSG made no disclosure,\rin its 1990 Form 10-K, that its net income for 1990 had been\rmaterially increased by recording expenses in its stockholders\\requity accounts and then offsetting those expenses with gain from\rthe release of HSG stock.  \r\r     According to the Commission\s complaint, the financial\rstatements incorporated in HSG\s 1990 Form 10-K were not prepared\rin conformity with GAAP because they reflected the accounting\rtreatments described above with respect to HSG\s quarterly\rfinancial statements for the last three quarters of 1990.  As\rAccounting Principles Board Opinion No. 9 (Reporting the Results\rof Operations),   17, states, inter alia, ...net income should\rreflect all items of profit and loss recognized during the\rperiod; and as   28 (Capital Transactions) states, inter alia,\rthe following should be excluded from determination of net\rincome or the results of operations under all circumstances: (a)\radjustments or charges or credits resulting from transactions in\rthe company\s stock...  Based on the foregoing, the complaint\rcharges that HSG violated Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and\rRules 13a-1, 13a-13 and 12b-20 thereunder, and that McCartney and\rCook, as controlling persons of HSG, are liable for HSG\s\r\r                   \r==========================================START OF PAGE 4======\x0c\r\r\r\r\r\rviolations of those provisions.\r\r          HSG\s Failure to Properly Accrue for Loss Contingencies\r          From Workers\ Compensation Claims\r\r     The Commission\s complaint alleges that, from the first\rquarter of 1986 through the third quarter of 1991, HSG materially\roverstated its net income by improperly accounting for costs\rrelated to workers\ compensation, auto and general liability\rclaims.  Under its arrangement with its insurance carrier, HSG\rwas liable for the full cost of each workers\ compensation claim,\rand up to $250,000 for each auto and general liability claim. \rGAAP requires that an accrual be made for loss contingencies. \rSee Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5.  The\rcomplaint alleges, however, that HSG failed to record the proper\rliability for estimated settlement amounts for known claims and\rincurred but unreported claims, but instead primarily expensed\rclaims as they were paid.\r\r     By reason of the foregoing, the complaint charges that HSG\s\rfinancial statements, as incorporated in its Commission quarterly\rand annual reports from the first quarter of 1986 through the\rthird quarter of 1991, were materially false and misleading, in\rviolation of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1,\r13a-13 and 12b-20, and that thereunder, and that Cook, as a\rcontrolling person of HSG, is liable for HSG\s violations of\rthose provisions.\r\r          HSG\s Inadequate Valuation Allowance for Accounts\r          Receivable\r\r     The total amount of HSG\s accounts receivable, including\rnotes receivable from HSG customers, increased from approximately\r$17 million at year-end 1989 to $28 million at year-end 1990,\rrepresenting the largest asset on HSG\s balance sheet.  During\rthat year, receivables over 120 days old, some of which had been\rsold to a financial institution with full recourse against HSG,\rincreased from $7.5 million to $11.3 million, while HSG\s\rallowance for bad debts increased by $300,000.  With respect to\rapproximately $27 million (of a total of approximately $28\rmillion) in receivables as to which no probable loss was\rspecifically identified, HSG maintained no allowance.  \r\r     According to the Commission\s complaint, HSG\s policies and\rprocedures for determining an adequate valuation allowance for\raccounts receivable were materially weak.  The complaint alleges\rthat HSG did not consider the age of a receivable in evaluating\rits potential collectibility and did not attempt to evaluate the\rfinancial ability of individual customers to pay their\robligations. \r\r     The complaint further alleges that this method was\r\r                   \r==========================================START OF PAGE 5======\x0c\r\r\r\r\r\rinadequate to represent accurately the level of probable and\restimable loss inherent in HSG\s accounts receivable, as required\rby GAAP.  As Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5\r(Accounting for Contingencies),   84, states: the condition[s]\rfor accrual [of an estimated loss]... are not intended to be so\rrigid that they require virtual certainty before a loss is\raccrued.  They require only that it be probable that an asset has\rbeen impaired... and that the amount of loss be reasonably\restimable.\r\r     According to the Commission\s complaint, as a result of its\rfailure to provide adequate procedures to provide reasonable\rassurances that its valuation allowance for accounts receivable\rwas established in accordance with GAAP, HSG, in the financial\rstatements incorporated in its 1990 Form 10-K and its Forms 10-Q\rfor the first three quarters of 1990, materially overstated its\rincome for those periods, in violation of Section 13(a) of the\rExchange Act and Rules 13a-1, 13a-13 and 12b-20 thereunder.\r\r          HSG\s Inadequate Disclosure and Improper Accounting for\r          Customer Laundry Installations\r\r     During the fourth quarter of 1990 and continuing through the\rfourth quarter of 1991, HSG provided funds to certain (primarily\rnew) customers for the purpose, according to HSG\s Commission\rfilings, of purchasing the customers\ on-site laundry\rinstallations.  Such transactions that occurred in the last\rquarter of 1990, for example, totalled approximately $4 million,\rthree times the amount previously carried on HSG\s balance sheet.\r\rIn these transactions, HSG would include a component in its price\rstructure to those customers reflecting such provision of funds.\r\r     The complaint alleges that these transactions were\rconcessions made to customers in contract negotiations. \rAccording to the complaint, HSG did not disclose this conduct as\ra material change in the mode of conducting business, as\rrequired pursuant to Regulation S-K, Item 101(a)(1), or disclose\rthe purpose of these concessions, or record these transactions in\raccordance with their substance, as required under GAAP.  The\rcomplaint charges that HSG thereby violated Section 13(a) of the\rExchange Act and Rules 13a-1, 13a-13 and 12b-20 thereunder, and\rthat McCartney and Cook, as controlling persons of HSG, are\rliable for HSG\s violations of those provisions.\r\r          HSG\s Improper Accounting for Laundry Installation\r          Sales\r\r     During the first three quarters of 1991, HSG recorded $2.0\rmillion in gross profits on laundry installation sales of $2.6\rmillion.  The effect of these transactions on earnings reported\rin the financial statements incorporated in its 1991 Forms 10-Q\rwas to increase the first quarter by 12%, the second quarter by\r\r                   \r==========================================START OF PAGE 6======\x0c\r\r\r\r\r\r67%, and the third quarter by 18%.  On the largest such\rtransaction, HSG recognized a profit of $664,638.  In that\rinstance, HSG passed to its customer legal title to equipment\ralready in place, with a depreciated cost basis of $23,299. \rHSG\s periodic billings to this facility were no different after\rthe sale from what they had been before.\r\r     The Commission\s complaint alleges that, because HSG\s\rlaundry installation sales were intertwined with other aspects of\rHSG\s customer relationships, HSG\s recognition of revenue on\rthese transactions did not comport with the GAAP requirement that\rrevenue should be recognized when it is both realized or\rrealizable and earned.  See Statement of Financial Accounting\rConcepts No. 5,   83 (Recognition and Measurement in Financial\rStatements of Business Enterprises).  By reason of the foregoing,\rthe complaint charges that HSG\s financial statements included in\rits filings on Form 10-Q for the first three quarters of 1991\rwere materially false and misleading in violation of Section\r13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13a-13 thereunder, and that\rMcCartney and Cook, as controlling persons of HSG for purposes of\rSection 20(a) of the Exchange Act at all relevant times, are\rliable for HSG\s violations of those provisions.\r\r          HSG\s Failure to Disclose Payments to Vendors for No\r          Valid Business Purpose\r\r     According to the Commission\s complaint, between 1988 and\rearly 1992 HSG paid approximately $400,000 in improper payments\rto certain vendors for the benefit of two nursing home customers,\rmade for no valid business purpose, and the books and records of\rHSG did not reflect the true purpose of these payments.\r\r     The complaint charges that HSG\s failure to disclose the\rtrue purpose of these payments in its annual reports on Form 10-K\rand quarterly reports on Form 10-Q during the period from year-\rend 1988 to year-end 1991 violated Section 13(a) of the Exchange\rAct and Rules 13a-1, 13a-13 and 12b-20 thereunder.  The complaint\rfurther charges that, because Mason knew or was reckless in not\rknowing that HSG\s Commission filings were materially false and\rmisleading, Mason and, through Mason, HSG also violated Section\r10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The\rcomplaint further alleges that Mason was instrumental in causing\rHSG to record these payments inaccurately in its books and\rrecords as legitimate business expenses.  By reason of the\rforegoing, the complaint charges that Mason violated Section\r13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                   \r==========================================START OF PAGE 7======\x0c\x1a"

Bernard F. Bradstreet, et\ral.  (D. Mass., No. 95-11647-DPW)\r\r     The Commission announced that, on September 24, 1996,\rDefendants Bernard F. Bradstreet (Bradstreet), Thomas E.\rCampbell (Campbell) and Debra J. Murray (Murray), former\rmembers of senior management of Kurzweil Applied Intelligence,\rInc. (Kurzweil), consented, without admitting or denying the\rallegations of the Commission\s complaint (Complaint), to the\rentry of a final judgment.  The final judgment enjoins each of\rthem from future violations of the antifraud provisions of the\rfederal securities laws and those provisions relating to the\rfalsification of an issuer\s books and records and the making of\rfalse statements to auditors.  The judgment also bars each of\rthem from serving as an officer or director of any public\rcompany, waives disgorgement by Bradstreet and Campbell, and does\rnot assess penalties against Bradstreet, Campbell and Murray,\rbased on their demonstrated inability to pay.  The consents have\rbeen submitted to the court for approval.  The Commission\s\rlitigation is continuing as to a fourth defendant, David R. Earl.\r\r\r     The Complaint in this matter was filed on July 26, 1995, and\ralleged that, from at least January 1992 through May 1994, the\rdefendants engaged in a fraudulent revenue recognition scheme\rwhich inflated Kurzweil\s revenues and earnings as reported by\rthe company in financial statements filed with the Commission and\rdisseminated publicly.  The Complaint further alleged that\rBradstreet, Kurzweil\s former President and Co-Chief Executive\rOfficer, and Campbell, Kurzweil\s former Vice President of Sales,\reach offered and sold equity securities in Kurzweil\s initial\rpublic offering, knowing that the company\s financial statements\rwere materially false and that, in 1993, Bradstreet received an\r$80,000 bonus advance based on the then expected financial\rresults of operations for the fiscal year ended January 31, 1994.\r\rThe Complaint alleged that the scheme affected the registration\rstatement and periodic reports filed by Kurzweil containing\rfinancial statements for its fiscal year ended January 31, 1993\rand the first three quarters of fiscal year 1994.\r\r     Simultaneous with the filing of the Complaint, the U.S.\rAttorney announced the criminal indictments of Bradstreet and\rCampbell.  Bradstreet and Campbell were subsequently found guilty\rby a jury of five counts of conspiracy, securities fraud and\rfalsification of corporate books and records.  Bradstreet and\rCampbell are scheduled to be sentenced on October 22, 1996.  In\raddition, on June 20, 1996, Murray was sentenced to three years\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\rprobation and to perform 200 hours of community service based on\rher guilty plea to a two count information alleging conspiracy to\rcommit securities fraud.  Murray testified at the criminal trial\rpursuant to a cooperation agreement with the government.\r\r     In a related administrative proceeding, the Commission, on\rJuly 25, 1995, instituted and simultaneously settled, by consent,\ra cease-and-desist proceeding against Kurzweil (Kurzweil Applied\rIntelligence, Inc., Exchange Act Rel.

The\rCommission\s Order found that, as a result of the scheme,\rKurzweil filed a fraudulent registration statement and periodic\rreports with the Commission and issued false press releases which\rmaterially overstated its revenue and earnings during the fiscal\ryear ended January 31, 1993 and the first three quarters of\rfiscal 1994.  The order required Kurzweil to cease-and-desist\rfrom future violations of the antifraud, periodic reporting and\rissuer books and records and internal controls provisions of the\rfederal securities laws. \r\r     Also on July 25, 1995, the Commission announced the entry of\ra cease-and-desist order, by consent, against Tracy Spadaro\rMaynard, Norma A.

The\rcomplaint charges S&C and Selheimer with violations of Section\r17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and\rSections 10(b), 15(c)(1), 15(c)(3) and 17(a) of the Securities\rExchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 15c1-2,\r15c3-1, 17a-3 and 17a-4 thereunder.\r\r     According to the complaint, from January 1989 until December\r1994, Selheimer, through S&C, misappropriated approximately $1.6\rmillion from ten S&C customers.  Selheimer persuaded the\rcustomers to permit S&C to take custody of their securities,\rostensibly, to increase the firm\s net capital to enable it to\rexpand its operations.  Selheimer led the customers to believe\rthat, while the securities would be recorded as assets of S&C,\rthey would continue to be held for the benefit of the customers,\rand would not be liquidated without their prior consent. \rAccording to the complaint, Selheimer also promised to forward to\rthe customers the dividends and interest earned on the\rsecurities.  As a further incentive, he promised to pay many of\rthe customers an additional six to ten percent interest.\r\r     The Commission alleges that, once he obtained custody of the\rsecurities, Selheimer sold them and used the proceeds to pay his\rbusiness and personal expenses.  Most of the money was used to\rpay the dividends and interest promised to the customers. \rSelheimer also pledged some of the securities as collateral for a\rbank loan, which was later placed in default status.  Moreover,\rin addition to liquidating securities, on at least two occasions,\rSelheimer misappropriated funds tendered to S&C for the purchase\rof securities.  \r\r     The Commission\s complaint further alleges that, in\radvancing the scheme, Selheimer and S&C made materially false and\rmisleading statements to the customers, and sent them fabricated\rdocuments, which misrepresented the value, quantity and existence\rof the securities.  Additionally, by failing to properly record\rthe customers\ securities on its books and records, S&C failed to\rcomply with net capital and recordkeeping provisions of the\rExchange Act.

Crow was the former president and chief executive\rofficer of Wilshire Technologies, Inc. (Wilshire), a public\rcompany located in Carlsbad, California.  The Commission\s\rcomplaint alleges that Crow violated the federal securities laws\rby causing Wilshire to materially overstate its earnings, to\rissue materially misleading press releases and to file materially\rmisleading periodic financial reports with the Commission.  The\rCommission further alleges that Crow engaged in insider trading\rby selling 75,000 shares of Wilshire stock in November and\rDecember 1993, avoiding losses of about $1.2 million. \r\rThe Commission alleges in its complaint that Crow caused Wilshire\rto overstate its fiscal 1993 second and third quarter financial\rstatements by causing Wilshire to recognize revenue on\rconditional sales of two new and untested products.  One product,\rcalled the TrimPatch, was designed as an over-the-counter\rappetite suppressant administered through a patch applied to the\rskin.  The other product, a pipe plug, was designed to clean\rtubing in clean rooms in manufacturing facilities.  The\rCommission further alleges that Crow caused Wilshire to overstate\rits fourth quarter and fiscal 1993 financial results by causing\rWilshire to recognize additional revenue on other conditional\rsales, and by causing Wilshire to improperly recognize a gain on\ra related party asset sale and an expense deduction on a disputed\rclaim against a vendor.  The Commission alleges that, in\rperpetrating this scheme, Crow violated the antifraud provisions\rof Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934\r(Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, the reporting\rprovisions of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20\rand 13a-13 thereunder, the  recordkeeping provisions of Section\r13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder, the\rinternal control provisions of Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the\rExchange Act and the lying to the auditors provision of Rule\r13b2-2 under the Exchange Act.\r\rThe Commission also alleges that Crow engaged in insider trading\rin Wilshire\s stock in violation of the antifraud provisions of\rSection 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of\rthe Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In November and\rDecember 1993, Crow sold 75,000 shares of Wilshire stock.

WYE RESOURCES, INC.

Wye is a Canadian corporation\rheadquartered in Toronto, Ontario and claims to own interests in\rvarious gold and diamond mining properties.  Rehan Malik\r(Malik), a resident of Labrador City, Newfoundland, served as\rWye\s President from June 24, 1993 through March 25, 1994.  The\rcomplaint alleges that during 1993 and early 1994, Wye and Malik\rengaged in a fraudulent promotional campaign targeted towards\rU.S. investors and improperly distributed Wye stock to those\rinvestors.  \r\r     The Commission\s complaint specifically alleges that Wye and\rMalik engaged in a scheme to distribute approximately 5.3 million\rshares of Wye stock that were not properly issued under Canadian\rlaw nor properly registered with the Commission.  According to\rthe complaint, Wye directly distributed approximately 2.5 million\rof these improperly issued shares to U.S. investors.  As of\rFebruary 1, 1994, approximately 4 million shares, or 28.9 percent\rof the Wye stock then outstanding, was held by U.S. investors.   \r\r  \r\r     The complaint alleges that Wye and Malik specifically\rtargeted U.S. investors by placing advertisements in U.S.\rpublications and placing messages over the Internet through a New\rOrleans-based computer bulletin board service (BBS) called the\rEmerging Growth Stock BBS.  The complaint alleges that certain\rof these advertisements and messages were false and misleading in\rthat they misrepresented, among other things, the status of Wye\s\rongoing exploitation of certain Zairian mining properties.  For\rexample, starting in March 1993, prior to the time that Malik\rbecame Wye\s President, Wye falsely claimed that it had\rsuccessfully completed a sampling program during which it\rrecovered 10 gem-quality diamonds from its Zairian concessions. \rIn reality, Wye\s contractors had not set foot on the concessions\rthemselves and purchased the diamonds from Zairian vendors\rlocated elsewhere.    \r\r     The Commission\s complaint seeks a permanent injunction\ragainst Wye and Malik for violations of Section 5 of the\rSecurities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\rExchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint\ralso seeks civil penalties against Malik.  \r\r     The Commission also today announced the institution of\radministrative proceedings against two U.S. residents, Murray\rAaron Huberfeld and Broad Capital Associates, Inc., in connection\rwith the unregistered distribution of Wye securities.  Without\radmitting or denying the Commission\s findings, both Broad\rCapital and Huberfeld consented to the issuance of an order\rfinding that they violated Section 5 of the Securities Act.  In\raddition, they agreed to the entry of an order requiring them to\rdisgorge a total of $426,790.05, representing profits made as a\rresult of transactions in Wye stock and prejudgment interest\rthereon.

The\rComplaint alleges that the defendants violated the federal\rsecurities laws in connection with the offer and sale to the\rpublic of securities designated as partnership units in IBG, a\rpurported general partnership formed to develop a wireless cable\rsystem in Muskegon, Michigan and acquire a hardwired private\rcable system in Mesa, Arizona.  The other defendants named in the\rComplaint are Internet Wireless Communications, Inc. (IWC),\rCalifornia Financial Services, Inc.(CFS), One Touch Marketing,\rInc. (OTM), Commonwealth Communications Group (CCG), Capital\rResources Group Inc. (CRG), John C. Trimpin, Richard B.\rParnell, John Larson and Michael Green.  According to the\rComplaint, at all relevant times, defendant Trimpin controlled\rdefendants IBG, IWC and CFS.  \r\r     Additionally, the Complaint names as relief defendants\rInteractive Communications Network, Ltd., Able Private Cable and\rSatellite Corporation, Greg E. Parker, Michael Kittay, James\rOsborn and William Trower.  The Complaint alleges that the relief\rdefendants received funds unlawfully raised from investors, and\rhold these funds in a constructive trust for the benefit of\rinvestors.  \r\r     More specifically, the Complaint alleges that from April\rthrough September 1994, defendants engaged in the offer and sale\rof $2.1 million of IBG securities to approximately 186 investors\rnationwide, many of whom invested funds from their Individual\rRetirement Accounts.  The sales techniques used included high\rpressure boiler room telephone sales tactics and mailings of\rpromotional and other documents that contained false and\rmisleading statements and omitted to state material facts.  When\rsales ceased, and to date, the IBG investors obtained no rights\rin either the Muskegon, Michigan or the Mesa, Arizona cable\rsystems.  Despite that, according to the Complaint, the\rdefendants received approximately  66%, and the relief defendants\rreceived approximately 27%, of the investors\ funds.  \r\r     The Complaint alleges that all the defendants except IBG\rviolated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section\r10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5\rthereunder.  The Complaint further alleges that since the IBG\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\rsecurities were never registered with the Commission, and were\rnot exempt from registration, the defendants violated Sections\r5(a) and (c) of the Securities Act.  Additionally, the Complaint\ralleges that defendants OTM, CCG, CRG, Parnell, Larson and Green\ralso violated Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act by engaging in\rbroker-dealer activities without being registered with the\rCommission.  The Complaint seeks permanent injunctions and\rdisgorgement, together with prejudgment interest, from all the\rdefendants and civil money penalties from all the defendants\rexcept IBG.  The Complaint also seeks an order and judgment\rdirecting the relief defendants to disgorge the funds they hold\rin trust for investors.\r\r     Simultaneously with the filing of the action, Trimpin, IWC\rand IBG consented, without admitting or denying the allegations\rof the Complaint, to the entry of a final judgment of permanent\rinjunction, enjoining each of them from further violations of the\rcharged provisions of the federal securites laws.  The final\rjudgment also requires IBG to disgorge $175,688, which is the\ramount of IBG investor funds on deposit, and frozen by court\rorder, in a bank account in IBG\s name, and requires Trimpin and\rIWC to disgorge, jointly and severally, the sum of $125,000.  The\r$125,000 disgorgement to be paid by Trimpin and IWC in this\rmatter is part of an aggregate disgorgement of $500,000 to be\rmade by Trimpin and companies he controls to settle this case and\rtwo previously-filed Commission actions alleging violations of\rthe federal securities laws in connection with the offer and sale\rof securities purportedly to raise money for the development of\rwireless cable systems.

CHRISTOPHER KENT\rBAGDASARIAN AND SAM LANCE WHITE  Civil Action No. \r96-CV-7306 (S.D.N.Y.)\r\r     The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a civil\rfraud action against Christopher Kent Bagdasarian and Sam Lance\rWhite in the United States District Court for the Southern\rDistrict of New York.  The Commissions complaint alleges that\rBagdasarian, Normandy America Inc.s CEO and Chairman of the\rBoard, and White, a tax partner in Deloitte & Touche LLPs Los\rAngeles office at the time of the fraud, engaged in a fraudulent\rscheme to fabricate Bagdasarians investment track record that\rwas included in the registration statement for Normandys $200\rmillion initial public offering.  Normandy was a reinsurance\rcompany with no financial or operating history whose business\rplan depended on its ability, through Bagdasarian, successfully\rto invest reinsurance premiums in equity securities.  Normandys\rstock commenced trading on the NASDAQ National Market System on\rAugust 15, 1995.  One day later, Normandy withdrew its offering\rfrom the market and rescinded all trades.\r\r     The Commissions complaint alleges that the underwriters\rtold Bagdasarian, White and others that the offering could not be\rsold without substantial disclosure concerning Bagdasarians past\rinvestment results.  Normandys registration statement\rrepresented that Bagdasarian, a thirty-year old money manager,\rhad achieved a ten-year average annual return of 29.1%, managing\rassets ranging from $250.6 million in 1990 to $731.3 million\rduring 1994.  The registration statement also represented that\rBagdasarians performance results were based on all of the assets\rthat he managed and resulted solely from his own investment\rdecisions.  The complaint alleges that each of these statements\rwas materially false and misleading because Bagdasarian and White\rfabricated the assets and the investment results.\r\r     According to the complaint, Bagdasarian and White told the\runderwriters that the $731 million in assets managed by\rBagdasarian were located in offshore structures that Deloitte\rcreated.  When the underwriters requested further information\rconcerning the offshore structures, White refused to provide it,\rmaintaining that to do so would reveal information proprietary to\rDeloitte.  The complaint alleges that, in fact, there were no\rsuch offshore structures managed by Bagdasarian or created by\rDeloitte.\r\r     The complaint further alleges that in order to enhance the\rcredibility of his claimed investment results, Bagdasarian\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\rengaged White and Deloitte to verify those results.  The\rcomplaint alleges that White accepted the engagement for\rDeloitte, in violation of Deloittes internal policies, and\rissued four letters to the underwriters which represented that\rDeloitte had verified Bagdasarians investment results disclosed\rin Normandys registration statement.  According to the\rcomplaint, White also disregarded Deloittes internal policies in\rissuing the letters.  The complaint alleges that Bagdasarian and\rWhite knew that the disclosed assets did not exist, and that\rneither White nor any other Deloitte personnel performed any work\rto verify their existence.\r\r     According to the complaint, between 1991 and 1995,\rBagdasarian obtained over twelve million dollars in unsecured\rlines of credit from a New York bank by making false statements\rconcerning his ownership of securities.  White verified\rBagdasarians false statements in quarterly letters to the bank. \rBagdasarian used the lines of credit to purchase a jet airplane,\rfurnish his six million dollar home and fund his investment\ractivities.  \r\r       The complaint further alleges that, after the underwriters\rinformed Bagdasarian that they wanted to interview an investor\rwho had substantial assets under his management, Bagdasarian\rarranged a sham interview and directed an employee of one of his\raffiliated entities to impersonate one of his investors.  The\runderwriters conducted the interview, but the real person whom\rBagdasarian had described as the investor never spoke with any of\rthe underwriters representatives and had never heard of\rNormandy.  The complaint alleges that, in fact, the employee of\rBagdasarians affiliated entity impersonated the investor.\r\r     According to the complaint, Bagdasarian and White falsely\rrepresented that all of the assets Bagdasarian managed had been\rincluded in Normandys registration statement, and that\rBagdasarian had sole authority to make investment decisions for\rthose assets.  In fact, the complaint alleges, as of December 31,\r1994, Bagdasarian managed approximately $45 million about which\rthe registration statement failed to disclose anything at all,\rand in particular failed to disclose that Bagdasarian made\rinvestment decisions with other individuals regarding assets he\rmanaged through Criterion Holdings Inc. and its affiliates.\r\r     The complaint requests the Court to enter permanent\rinjunctions against future violations by the defendants of the\rantifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, to impose\rcivil monetary penalties against Bagdasarian and White, and to\rbar Bagdasarian from acting as an officer or director of any\rpublic company.\r\r     On September 26, 1996, the United States Attorney for the\rSouthern District of New York announced criminal proceedings\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 3======\r\ragainst Bagdasarian and White arising from the Normandy America\roffering and from Bagdasarians receipt of bank loans based on\rfalse statements about his assets and investment returns.

In its Complaint, the\rCommission alleges that from September 1992 to December 1993,\rGoodman fraudulently offered and sold securities for two Florida\rcorporations for which he was sales manager, Junction Financial\rCorporation (Junction Financial) and U.S. Ostrich Corporation\r(U.S. Ostrich), in an ostrich breeding and marketing venture to\rat least 1100 investors in 48 states, the District of Columbia\rand Canada raising a total of over $3.2 million.  In December\r1993, Junction Financial and its promoters were permanently\renjoined in SEC v. Junction Financial et al (93 CV 7082 S.D.\rFla.) from further violations of the registration and antifraud\rprovisions of the federal securities laws for their roles in the\rsame scheme which culminated in the allegations against Goodman. \r\r     Specifically, the Commission alleges that Goodman, while\racting as an unregistered broker, raised money from investors by\rmisrepresenting the use of investor funds and the potential\rreturn on their investment.  Investors were told that the\rmajority of the funds raised would be used to purchase and breed\rostriches and that they could expect a 50% to 75% return on their\rinvestment.  In reality, most of the investor funds went to pay\rthe salaries of Junction Financial and U.S. Ostrich employees and\rto extend loans, which were never repaid, to the principals of\rJunction Financial and U.S. Ostrich.  Goodman also failed to\rdisclose his own regulatory background, the regulatory\rbackgrounds of Junction Financial and its principals and his own\rfinancial interest in the venture.

The Commission alleges in its complaint that, between\rOctober 1987 and August 1994, Thomas conducted a fraudulent\rscheme to misappropriate funds from clients of his wholly-owned\rcompany, Pension & Retirement.  Thomas misrepresented Pension &\rRetirement as a legitimate investment adviser and fraudulently\rsolicited at least 23 individuals to become investment advisory\rclients of the company.  He falsely represented to prospective\rclients that Pension & Retirement was registered in Pennsylvania\ras an investment adviser, and that the company also operated as a\rbroker-dealer and financial consultant.  The complaint further\ralleges that Thomas fraudulently induced those clients to invest\rover $418,000 in Pension and Retirement investment programs, one\rof which constituted an offering of securities in the form of\rinvestment contracts.  Specifically, he led them to believe that\rthe funds they invested in those programs would be used to\rpurchase certain assets and securities.  Although Thomas invested\rclient funds as promised for a short time, in January 1990, he\rbegan to liquidate the assets held for clients and to\rmisappropriate the proceeds.  By the time the entire scheme\rcollapsed, Thomas misappropriated over $300,000 of the client\rfunds, and used the money to finance his own investments and pay\rhis personal expenses.\r\r     According to the complaint, in furtherance of the scheme,\rThomas made materially false and misleading statements to his\rclients to induce them to invest in two individual retirement\raccount investment programs sponsored by Pension & Retirement. \rAmong other things, in order to conceal his misappropriation,\rThomas sent the clients account statements, which falsely\rreflected the existence of assets in their accounts.

September 27, 1996) (TBR)\r\r     The Securities and Exchange Commission today sued four\rindividuals currently or formerly associated with an Albany, KY\roil exploration company for their roles in selling working\rinterests in the company\s oil properties.\r\r     The suit, filed in Federal District Court for the Western\rDistrict of Kentucky, alleges the following:\r\r     Russell S. Smith, president of Smitco Oil, Inc. (Smitco),\rJames O. Foust, a former principal of Smitco, and two salesmen\rformerly employed by Smitco, John E. Burse and James E. Fisher,\rover a period extending from fall of 1992 to the fall of 1993,\rused, or directed others to use, high-pressure telephone calls to\rsell investors working interests in oil wells then being drilled\rby Smitco.  These techniques, employed by Burse and Fisher under\rthe supervision of Smith and Foust, included the use of written\roffering materials that portrayed the working interests in a\rmisleading fashion and failed to adequately state the risks of\rthe ongoing offering, and oral sales presentations which\rsimilarly failed to adequately discuss the risks of the\rinvestment and included misstatements of material fact about the\roffering and Smitco.  For example, according to the Complaint,\rcertain individuals solicited by Smitco were told that an\rinvestment in a Smitco working interest was similar to an\rinvestment in a savings account or a certificate of deposit. \rProspective investors were also sent written materials describing\rtheir prospective investments which contained numerous false and\rmisleading statements, including a discussion of investment risk\rthat likened the risk of a Smitco investment to the risk of\rdriving your car everyday [sic].   \r  \r     Using responses received from direct-mail postcards, Burse\rand Fisher, acting under the direction and supervision of Smith\rand Foust, telephoned individuals and delivered a sales\rpresentation from an outline prepared by Burse.  These oral sales\rpresentations included false and misleading information about\rinvestment risks (including overstated estimates of yield from\rSmitco\s various drilling projects), misrepresented the cost of\rdrilling wells, and made false assurances that the offering was\rregistered with the Securities and Exchange Commission and met\rthe legal requirements imposed by the various states in which\rprospective investors resided.  Potential investors were not\rinformed that a number of state securities regulatory agencies --\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\rincluding the Kentucky Department of Financial Institutions --\rhad issued orders barring Smitco from selling securities in their\rstates.   According to the Complaint, Burse, Fisher, and, later,\rthe other salemen hired by Burse, also told potential investors\rthat Smitco held oil rights in large tracts of land in\rQueensland, Australia, rights which Smitco never, in fact, held. \r \r     In the event that an oil well drilled by Smitco did strike\roil, investors who held working interests in that well were, in\rmany cases, recontacted by Smitco salesmen and quoted initial\rproduction figures, figures which the Defendants knew or had\rreason to know would decline rapidly over the near term, and\rgiven misleading projections of financial yield from the well in\rwhich they had invested.  This was frequently done in order to\rsolicit additional investments from individuals who had already\rinvested in Smitco. \r\r     Over the course of the offering, approximately ninety\rindividuals located in 20 states made investments aggregating\rsome $1.4 million in Smitco\s oil drilling venture.  These funds\rconstituted virtually the entirety of Smitco\s revenues during\rthe offering period.\r\r     The Commission\s Complaint seeks injunctive relief barring\rthe defendants from future violations of Sections 5 and 17(a) of\rthe Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities\rExchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Complaint\ralso seeks disgorgement of investment proceeds from Smith,\rdisgorgement of commissions and fees from Burse and Fisher, and\rcivil money penalties against all Defendants.  Smitco is\rcurrently in Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings.\r\r     The litigation is pending.\r\r     The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the state\rsecurities regulators of Arizona, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa,\rKansas, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Missouri, Nevada, Pennsylvania,\rSouth Dakota, Vermont and Wisconsin in investigating this matter.\x0c\x1a"

The Commission\s complaint alleges that Hall\rand Porter violated the fraud, reporting, books and records and\rinternal control provisions of the federal securities laws.  In\raddition, the complaint alleges that Hall sold unregistered Eagle\rstock, and traded Eagle securities while in possession of\rmaterial nonpublic information that Eagle\s financial statements\rwere grossly overstated.\r\r     Specifically, the Commission\s complaint alleges that Hall\rand Porter caused Eagle to acquire and record on its financial\rstatements three purported assets which they knew or should have\rknown were materially overvalued.  The first, a note acquired\rfrom a company controlled by Hall, was secured by real estate\rworth approximately $367,000 but valued on Eagle\s financial\rstatements at $2.5 million.  The second, an undivided one-half\rinterest in undeveloped land in Oklahoma which was acquired from\ra company controlled by Porter, was worth approximately $200,000\rbut valued on Eagle\s financial statements at $1.3 million.  The\rthird, a debenture obtained pursuant to an agreement to lease\rrestricted stock to offshore insurance companies, was improperly\rlisted as a $10.5 million asset.\r\r     The complaint alleges that, while Eagle\s false financial\rstatements were being publicly disseminated, Hall generated over\r$2 million in proceeds from sales of Eagle stock, most of which\rwas unregistered.  The complaint also alleges that, as part of\rthe scheme, Hall and Porter made false and misleading statements\rto Eagle\s independent auditor concerning the transactions in\rwhich the company acquired the purported assets.  \r\r     The Commission\s complaint seeks an injunction prohibiting\rfurther violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the\rSecurities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b), 13(a) and 13(b)(2) of\rthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 13a-1, \x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\r13a-11, 13a-13, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder by Hall, and an\rinjunction prohibiting further violations of Section 17(a) of the\rSecurities Act, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(2) of the Exchange Act\rand Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 by Porter.

(CNC), Charles N. Cugliari (Cugliari),\rCindy J. Myers (Myers), Frank R. Sommerer (Sommerer), and\rMarvin Sherman (Sherman), and relief defendant Oscar R. Sierra\r(Sierra).  According to the Commission\s Complaint, Cugliari\rperpetrated a fraudulent scheme through CNC, a purported food\rbrokerage formerly based in Marlton, New Jersey, which Cugliari\rowned and controlled.  Beginning in 1985 and continuing until\rFebruary 1995, Cugliari directed the fraudulent sale of\rapproximately $70 million of CNC securities in the form of\rinvestment contracts to over 2,000 investors.  Cugliari, Myers,\rSommerer, Sherman and others under Cugliari\s direction,\rsolicited investors by representing that CNC would use their\rfunds to purchase food products such as meat or poultry, and then\rresell that product to a food distributor or retailer.  They\rfurther represented to investors that, through these purported\rtransactions, CNC would earn profits that would yield investors\rreturns of 3 1/2 percent monthly or 42 percent annually.\r\r     The Complaint alleges that, contrary to these\rrepresentations, Cugliari and CNC did not purchase and resell\rfood products with investor money.  Instead, Cugliari engaged in\ra Ponzi scheme whereby he used investor funds to pay the promised\rreturns to other investors.  Cugliari also used investor funds to\rpay himself an annual salary of $500,000 and to support a lavish\rlifestyle, including frequent gambling trips to Atlantic City. \rCugliari also paid Myers, Sommerer and Sherman substantial sales\rcommissions using investor funds.  In 1994, Sommerer received\rcommissions of approximately $3.5 million, Myers received\rcommissions of approximately $300,000, and Sherman received\rcommissions of approximately $200,000.  In addition, the\rComplaint alleges that Sierra, although not involved in the\rfraudulent scheme, received approximately $52,000 in illegally\robtained CNC investor proceeds.\r\r     The Complaint also alleges that, in furtherance of the\rscheme, Cugliari, Myers, Sommerer and Sherman made numerous\rmisrepresentations and omissions of material fact to investors in\rconnection with the sale of CNC securities.  Among other things,\rCugliari and Myers misrepresented the profitability of CNC\s food\rbrokering operation and CNC\s financial condition.  In addition,\rCugliari, Myers, Sommerer and Sherman misrepresented to investors\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\rthe degree of risk involved in the purchase of CNC securities,\rand failed to disclose to investors that they received\rsubstantial commissions from the sale of CNC securities.  The\rComplaint further alleges that the fraudulent scheme collapsed in\rFebruary 1995 when Cugliari fled to the Cayman Islands.   \r\r     The Complaint charges CNC, Cugliari, Myers, Sommerer, and\rSherman with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the\rSecurities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities\rExchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, promulgated thereunder.  The\rComplaint also charges Cugliari, Myers, Sommerer, and Sherman\rwith violations of Section 15(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange\rAct of 1934.

Among\rother things, the Order will permanently enjoin CNC, Cugliari and\rMyers from future violations of the antifraud and registration\rprovisions of the federal securities laws and will order Cugliari\rto pay disgorgement of approximately $600,000, which is currently\rheld in an escrow account. \x0c\x1a"

Among\rother things, he overstated TVI\s revenues and income during 1992\rand 1993, falsely represented that TVI had contracts to build\rtank gunnery ranges that would generate revenues exceeding $2.5\rmillion, and falsely stated that TVI held patents for low-cost\rstealth material and thermal targets used in military\rapplications.\r\r     According to the complaint, Molovinsky took advantage of the\rincreased demand generated by his false and misleading statements\rby selling almost all of the 14 million shares of TVI stock\rissued in the offering without regard to restrictions imposed by\rthe reorganization plan.  Among other things, he sold more shares\rthan permitted, and sold shares outside the prescribed 60 day\rsales period.  In addition, at least 8.7 million of the shares\rwere neither registered with the Commission nor subject to the\rexemption from registration provided by the Bankruptcy Code\rbecause they were sold to persons who were neither existing\rcreditors nor shareholders of TVI.\r\r     The Commission also alleges that Molovinsky misappropriated\rover $1 million of the proceeds by withdrawing funds from TVI\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\rcorporate bank accounts and diverting investor checks to bank\raccounts he controlled.  According to the complaint, he used the\rfunds to pay his personal living and business expenses, including\ralimony payments to his first wife, a downpayment on a house for\rhis son, and installments on his personal credit cards and a\rtime-share he owned in Cancun, Mexico.\r\r     Based on the foregoing, the complaint alleges that\rMolovinsky violated Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the\rSecurities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of\rthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.\x0c\x1a"

The Commission\s complaint alleges\rthat from December 1992, until at least April 1994, the\rdefendants engaged in a scheme to defraud investors by offering\rand selling securities in the form of purported guaranteed\rinsurance contracts (GICs), which they falsely claimed were\rissued and guaranteed by a consortium of European insurance and\rreinsurance companies.  The complaint alleges that the GICs did\rnot exist.  The complaint also alleges that the defendants\rpromised prospective investors returns at an annualized rate of\ralmost 840% for investing in the GICs, and that the defendants\rhad no authority to act on behalf of the purported issuers and\rguarantors of the GICs for any purpose whatsoever.  At least five\rinvestors lost approximately $712,000 as a result of the GIC\rscheme.  The complaint alleges that the defendant\s conduct\rviolated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.\r\r     In addition, the complaint alleges that M.T.L. International\rFinance Inc. and Robinson violated Section 207 of the Investment\rAdvisers Act of 1940 by willfully filing a false registration\rform with the Commission in an attempt to register M.T.L.\rInternational Finance as an investment adviser.  Specifically,\rthe complaint alleges that the false registration statement\rincluded a balance sheet listing assets totalling in excess of\r$62 million.  According to the complaint, the balance sheet was\rfalse and misleading in that M.T.L. International Finance did not\rthen have, nor had it ever had, assets in excess of $10,000.  \r\r     The Commission also instituted related administrative\rproceedings against Stires & Co., Inc., Sidney H.

In the complaint, the Commission seeks a permanent\rinjunction and civil penalties against the defendants for\rviolations of the antifraud provisions of the Investment Advisers\rAct of 1940 (Advisers Act).  In addition, the Commission seeks\ra court order to enforce compliance with an Order Making Findings\rand Imposing Remedial Sanctions and Cease-and-Desist Order\rentered by the Commission in August 1994.  As part of this\rrelief, the Commission requests additional civil penalties\rpursuant to Section 209(e)(4), the Special Provision Relating to\ra Violation of a Cease-and-Desist Order.\r\r     According to the Commission\s complaint, from January 1995\rthrough July 1995, Seaboard, aided and abetted by Hansen, engaged\rin a scheme to defraud Seaboard\s investment advisory clients by\rsending them false and misleading advertisements.  These\radvertisements, which were in the form of letters that reviewed\reach client\s investment portfolio, falsely represented that\rSeaboard\s accounts had outperformed various well-known market\rindices, including the Lipper Analytical Services, Standard &\rPoors 500 and Lehman Brothers Government/Corporate Bond indices. \rAt the time that this conduct occurred, both Seaboard and Hansen\rwere subject to a prior administrative order entered by the\rCommission on August 3, 1994, less than six months prior to the\rconduct at issue.  In accordance with the terms of that order,\rSeaboard and Hansen were required, among other things, to cease\rand desist from committing or causing any future violations of\rcertain antifraud provisions of the Advisers Act.  The complaint\ralleges that, by engaging in the present conduct, Seaboard and\rHansen have violated the terms of the Commission\s order as well\ras other antifraud provisions of the Advisers Act.\r\r     The complaint further alleges that, in accomplishing the\rscheme, Hansen deliberately circumvented Seaboard\s internal\rprocedures regarding the use of advertisements.  These\rprocedures, which were implemented pursuant to certain\rrequirements of the August 3, 1994 administrative order, were\rdesigned to prevent the dissemination of false and misleading\radvertisements.  Among other things, the procedures required that\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\rall advertising materials be reviewed and approved by Seaboard\s\rVice President of Compliance.\r\r     The complaint charges Seaboard with committing, and Hansen\rwith aiding and abetting, violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2)\rand 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-1(a)(5),\rthereunder.  The complaint also charges the defendants with\rviolating the terms of the August 3, 1994 administrative order.\r\r     The prior administrative order contained findings that\rSeaboard and Hansen had violated the antifraud provisions of the\rAdvisers Act by publishing, circulating and distributing\radvertisements, which contained false and misleading performance\rfigures for the period from 1984 though 1991.  The Order also\rcontained findings that Seaboard had falsely advertised that its\rperformance results were audited, and had violated certain\rrecordkeeping requirements of the Advisers Act.

The indictment\ralleges that Bennett\s conduct resulted in losses of $135,000,000\rand in the filing for bankruptcy protection by New Era in May,\r1995. The indictment also alleges that Bennett operated the New\rEra Concepts program at New Era.  New Concepts offered individual\rbenefactors a chance to double their gifts to charity.  The funds\rto double the gifts allegedly came from anonymous donors. \rLater in the scheme, non-profit organizations were offered the\ropportunity to double funds by submitting them to New Era.  These\rorganizations could send money to New Era and have the funds\rmatched by the anonymous donors and returned.  The matching\rallegedly occurred after a three to nine month holding period. \rThe indictment alleges that the operation of this scheme brought\rin approximately $354,000,000.  The indictment says that, in\rorder to obtain funds from benefactors and nonprofit\rorganizations, Bennett made various representations about the\roperation of New Era, all of which were false.  Some of these\rrepresentations are: 1) that the anonymous donors existed, that\rthey provided matching funds, and that there were trust\ragreements with these anonymous donors, when, in fact, there were\rno anonymous donors and money from later donors provided the\rmatching payments for earlier donors; 2) that Bennett was not\rpaid for his work at New Era, when, in fact, he transferred over\r$3.3 million from New Era accounts to the accounts of Bennett-\rrelated entities; 3) that money from benefactors and non-profits\rwas being held in escrow or quasi-escrow accounts at Prudential\rSecurities, Inc. during the holding period, when, in fact, the\rfunds were being used to secure a large loan at Prudential, and\rsome of the funds used to repay contributors to New Era were paid\rfrom the loan account; and 4) that New Era had a board of\rdirectors of prestigious individuals, when, in fact, Bennett was\x0c\r\r\r\r\r\rthe only director.

Freitag\rtold investors that he could obtain immediate returns of up to\r10% by pooling their funds and subsequently using the pool to\rinvest in certain unspecified mutual funds.  Freitag gave an\radditional incentive for investment by telling prospective\rinvestors that the mutual funds offered guaranteed annual returns\rof up to 25% and had no risk of loss.  Contrary to his\rstatements, Freitag never invested any of the money he received\rin any mutual fund.  Instead, he deposited the money in his own\rbank accounts and used it to pay returns to earlier investors and\rfor personal expenses.\r\r     The complaint also alleges that the securities that Freitag\roffered were not registered with the Commission.  Additionally,\rFreitag acted as a broker by transacting in securities for his\rclients accounts.  However, he was not registered with the\rCommission.  Finally, the pool of money that Freitag was to have\rused to invest in mutual funds constituted an investment company,\rwhich was not registered with the Commission.\r\r     In its complaint, the Commission seeks an order permanently\renjoining Freitag from committing future violations of Sections\r5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections\r10(b), 15(a) and 15(c) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-\r5 and 15c1-2 promulgated thereunder.\x0c\x1a"

Additionally, in order to protect investor funds,\rthe Court placed a freeze on Bush\s assets for 10 days pending a\rhearing to determine the full extent of his fraudulent conduct. \rThe Commission told the Court that Bush is commingling and\rmisappropriating client funds and preparing false account\rstatements to conceal his misappropriation.  Bush has also used\rforged brokerage statements to solicit clients\ business.  In\raddition, Bush induced several of his clients to purchase\rBrazilian bonds of uncertain value issued in 1902 and 1915 which\rBush keeps in his safety deposit box at his local bank. \r\r     Bush, through his firm, Ben Bush Investment Management, Inc.\rlocated in Pacific Palisades, California, manages approximately\r$10 million for wealthy and sophisticated clients nationwide. \rThe Commission\s complaint alleges, among other things, that from\rJanuary 1995 through the present, Bush has misappropriated at\rleast $450,000 of his clients\ funds.  In executing his scheme,\rBush allegedly accepts money from clients to purchase investments\ron their behalf, but does not purchase the investments.  Instead,\rBush commingles client funds with his own funds in a single\rcorporate bank account which he uses like a private checking\raccount to pay his own expenses, such as rent, alimony and car\rinsurance, and to purchase such personal items as hockey tickets\rand jewelry.  Bush then sends his clients false account\rstatements, fraudulently showing that he had purchased\rinvestments on their behalf.  \r\r     In the lawsuit, which was filed in the United States\rDistrict Court for the Central District of California, the\rCommission obtained an order temporarily enjoining Bush and Ben\rBush Investment Management, Inc. from future violations of\rSection 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act),\rSection 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange\rAct) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of\rthe Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers Act), antifraud\rprovisions; Section 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-2\rthereunder, custody and possession violations; Section 204 of the\rAdvisers Act and Rules 204-1(b)(2), 204-2(a) and 204-2(b)\rthereunder, books and records violations; and Section 207 of the\rAdvisers Act, registration filings violations.

Specifically, through three separate\rinvestment scams, Berus, Harper, Gale and Swoffer offered and\rsold fictitious certificates of deposit (CDs) issued by a\rpurported international bank, Century Security Bank and Trust,\rLtd. (Century Security), and interests in two investment clubs,\rthe Profit Masters Group (Profit Masters) and Meca International,\rInc. (Meca).\r\r     In connection therewith, CD investors were told that they\rwere purchasing variable rate CDs, with their money to be used by\rCentury Security to finance various business ventures. \rInvestment club investors were told that their funds would be\rpooled to purchase common stocks.  Depending on the investment\rscam, investors were promised annual returns ranging from 8% to\r24%.  In return for the investments, Berus and Harper generally\rsent investors confirmations for the funds invested and\rfictitious monthly and/or annual account statements which lulled\rinvestors into believing the legitimacy of the investments.  In\raddition, Berus and Harper sometimes paid investors purported\rmonthly interest on their investments, and, in some instances,\rreturns of portions of their principal.\r\r     Despite the above representations regarding Century\rSecurity, Profit Masters and Meca, however, Berus and Harper did\rnot invest the money as represented.  Instead, Berus and Harper\rsimply operated three separate ponzi schemes, with Gale and\rSwoffer their willing agents.  In connection with each of the\rthree schemes, investor money was deposited into brokerage\raccounts, bank accounts and a credit union account, all of which\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\rBerus and/or Harper controlled.  Undisclosed to investors, Berus\rand Harper then used investor funds to pay personal and business\rexpenses, including commissions to Gale and Swoffer, to make\rpayments to prior investors and to unsuccessfully trade in\rspeculative investments, including commodity futures and options.\r\rConsequently, returns to existing investors were dependent upon\rthe ability of Berus, Harper, Gale and Swoffer to continually\rraise additional funds from new investors.  Thus, in connection\rwith the offer, purchase and sale of securities,\rmisrepresentations and omissions of material fact were made\rregarding the legitimacy of the investments, the returns to be\rexpected, the risks involved, the commissions received and the\ruse of investor proceeds.  The complaint also names Harper\s\rwife, Marilyn Harper, as a relief defendant.\r\r     Simultaneous with the filing of the Commission\s complaint,\rthe Commodity Futures Trading Commission filed an action against\rBerus, Gale and Meca for violations of the Commodity Exchange\rAct.\x0c\x1a"

However, as of July 1996, only 42 ATMs\rwere operational even though the defendants had sold 195 ATMs,\rand only 2 of the 42 ATMs made enough money to cover their\rassociated monthly lease payments and expenses.  Consequently,\rthe defendants were using new investor funds to pay existing\rinvestors their monthly lease payments.\r\r     The Complaint also alleges that the defendants solicited\rinvestors nationwide through private investment seminars, mass\rmailings, cold calling and over the Internet.  Defendants\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\rprovided investors with offering materials which misrepresented\rthe number of ATMs operating and the amount of money the ATMs\rmade.

The Complaint seeks\rpreliminary and permanent injunctions, and other relief,\rincluding disgorgement and civil penalties, against the\rdefendants.\r\r     The Complaint alleges that the defendants violated Sections\r5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the\rSecurities Act), the registration provisions, and Section 17(a)\rof the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities\rExchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and Rule\r10b-5 thereunder, the antifraud provisions.

Monzione\r(Monzione), James D. Rocco (Rocco) and Arthur R. Lapka (Lapka). \rThe Complaint alleges that Monzione, Rocco and Lapka made\rmisrepresentations and omissions to investors in order to sell at\rleast $24 million worth of unregistered securities in the form of\rinterests in a stock investment fund, interests in a real estate\rinvestment fund, and certificates of deposit, in violation of\rSections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and\rSections 10(b), 15(a)(1) and 15(c)(1) of the Securities Exchange\rAct of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 15c1-2 thereunder.\r\r     The Complaint alleges, among other things, that from\rapproximately 1983 through August 1992, Monzione and Rocco used\rFirst Chicago Group Inc. (First Chicago Group), an unincorporated\rentity, to issue and promote the sale of at least $10 million in\runregistered securities in the form of interests in a stock\rinvestment fund called Capital Appreciation Portfolio (CAP) and,\rfrom 1988 through August 1992, to issue and promote the sale of\rat least $600,000 in the form of unregistered securities in the\rform of interests in a real estate investment fund named Unified\rIncome Properties (UIP).  The Complaint also alleges that from\rFebruary 1991 through August 1992, Monzione and Rocco used First\rChicago Group to issue and promote the sale of at least $14\rmillion of unregistered securities in the form of certificates of\rdeposit (FCG CD\s).  It alleges that Lapka acted as a salesmen\rfor First Chicago Group and, along with Monzione and Rocco, sold\rthese securities to investors.  The complaint also alleges that\rthe Defendants falsely told investors that CAP was a private\rlimited partnership investment club that used investor funds to\rpurchase blue chip stocks.  In addition, the Complaint alleges\rthat the Defendants falsely told investors that UIP would pool\rinvestor funds and reinvest them in prime residential income\rproducing properties.  Further, it alleges that the Defendants\rfalsely told FCG CD investors that their funds would be used to\rpurchase interests in FDIC insured jumbo certificates of deposit.\rIn fact, the Complaint alleges, Monzione and Rocco operated a\rPonzi scheme and did not use CAP investor funds to invest in\rstock, UIP investor funds to purchase income producing real\restate or FCG CD investor funds to purchase FDIC insured jumbo\rcertificates of deposit.  It alleges that, instead, Monzione and\rRocco used investor funds to pay other investors, for their\rpersonal purposes and to purchase Monzione a residence. \x0c\x1a"

CURTIS (Curtis), age 36, of Danville, California;\r\r     LEO J. MANGAN (Mangan), age 40, of Lindenhurst, New York\r     and Pompano\r          Beach, Florida;\r\r     TIMOTHY H.

NEAREN (Nearen), age 43, of Lighthouse Point,\r     Florida\r\rwith one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and two\rcounts of securities fraud.\r\r     This criminal prosecution involves a scheme to avoid the\rregistration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 through\rthe sale of securities purportedly in reliance on the Regulation\rS exemption from such requirements.  Regulation S provides a\rlimited exemption from the federal registration requirements for\rstock sold to overseas purchasers.  Regulation S provides no\rexemption, however, for transactions designed as a scheme to\ravoid the registration requirements nor does it cover any sales\rof securities made in the United States.\r\r     The 3-count indictment alleges that from in or about 1990\rthrough the present, Curtis, Mangan, and Masley controlled the\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\rbusiness affairs, including authority over issuance and transfer\rof the common stock, of COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL SYSTEMS, INC.\r(Comprehensive), and ALTER SALES CO., INC.

Alter is a public company with offices in\rLighthouse Point, Florida, and is now known as ICIS MANAGEMENT\rGROUP, INC.\r\r     The indictment further charges that the control by Curtis,\rMangan and Masley was not disclosed to the public, with the\rexception of Mangan\s position as an officer of Comprehensive. \rThe indictment further contends that Curtis and Mangan engaged in\refforts to conceal from co-workers, regulatory authorities, and\rthe investing public, material information about their personal\rbackgrounds, namely, Curtis\ 1994 federal bank fraud conviction\rand Mangan\s 1979 and 1991 federal drug trafficking convictions.\r\r     The indictment alleges that Curtis, Mangan and Masley\rengaged in an illegal scheme to defraud public investors in the\rstock of Comprehensive and Alter.  Specifically, the indictment\rcharges that Curtis, Mangan, and Masley caused Comprehensive and\rAlter to issue over 3,000,000 shares (approximately 2,300,000 of\rAlter and 700,000 of Comprehensive) of unregistered and/or\rfraudulently issued stock, purportedly in reliance on exemption\rfrom registration under Regulation S and Rule 144, as well as\rreduced disclosure permitted by registration pursuant to Form S-\r8.  This stock was generally issued at a discount to market price\rand in some cases pursuant to purported acquisitions of other\rcompanies.  This stock was issued to Gomez, Irangy, and other\rpersons and entities controlled by the defendants.  Some of these\rrecipients did not exist, were not aware that they were being\rissued stock, or were acting under the direction and control of\rthe defendants.  Gomez, Irangy, and others, at the direction of\rCurtis, Mangan, and Masley, then caused such stock to be\rtransferred from the initial recipients to international and\rdomestic brokerage accounts under the control of the defendants. \rIn some cases, the defendants prepared or directed the\rpreparation of fraudulent documents to effect such transfers. \rThese shares were then available to the defendants to be sold for\rprofit at the prevailing market price.\r\r     The indictment also charged that the defendants engaged in\refforts to inflate and maintain the market price of Comprehensive\rand Alter so that they would be able to reap profits by selling\rthe discounted shares that they fraudulently issued.  In\rfurtherance of the conspiracy, the defendants prepared or caused\rto be prepared fraudulent documents, including consulting\rservices contracts and documents filed with the SEC and the\rNASDAQ Stock Market regulators.  The purpose of these fraudulent\rdocuments was, among other things, to justify the issuance of\rstock, conceal the true nature of the companies\ acquisitions,\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 3======\r\rand conceal the defendants\ control of Comprehensive and Alter. \rThe indictment also charges that the defendants prepared or\rcaused to be prepared false and misleading press releases\rconcerning the business operations of both Comprehensive and\rAlter.\r\r     The indictment further charges that within weeks of the\rtermination of defendant Nearen\s employment as an attorney with\rthe SEC, Curtis and Mangan hired Nearen to provide legal services\rto Comprehensive and Alter.  The indictment charges that, in\raddition to his participation in the fraudulent activities\rdescribed above, Nearen revealed non-public information about SEC\rinvestigations that he had obtained during the course of his\remployment as an attorney with the SEC.  The indictment further\rcharges that Mangan and Curtis also told a person that people who\rinformed the SEC about their activities would be killed.\r\r          The SEC\s investigation of this matter continues.\x0c\x1a"

Anthony Sarivola also concealed his\rcontrol of the companies in order to avoid disclosing his prior\rrecord of securities violations and criminal fraud charges.  In\rfurtherance of the scheme, Anthony Sarivola and Donna Sarivola\rfalsified books and records of the Sarivola Companies and\rprovided fraudulent documents to an independent auditor.

The Commission\s complaint\ralleges that each of the defendants engaged in securities fraud\rby making misrepresentations in issuing or selling securities.  \r\r     The complaint alleges that from July 1994 through January\r1995, Edwards sold over  $3 million of prime bank securities in\rthree separate, but related, schemes.  In the schemes at issue,\rinvestors\ money was purportedly to be used to trade actively in\rthe off-balance sheet debt obligations of unnamed prime banks\rto generate profits of between 100 percent a year to 570 percent\rover a 19 week period.  In each case, investors were  also told\rthat their funds were completely safe, as the underlying\rinvestment was secured by gold, treasury bills or letters of\rcredit.  In reality, the off-balance sheet debt obligations\rpurportedly being traded do not exist, and the securities sold to\rinvestors a sham.\r\r     The complaint further alleges that the first of the three\rinvestments sold by Edwards, with assistance from Chedester,\rinvolved $1.2 million of debentures issued by First American, led\rby Luna and assisted by Morehouse.  The debentures offered\rreturns of 100 percent per year, with no risk to principal as the\rdebentures were secured by gold or gold certificates.  In the\rsecond scheme, Edwards induced investors to place $700,000 with\ran entity operating out of Switzerland for trading in prime\rbank debt.  In the third, Edwards devised his own Private\rInvestment Program for which he and Chedester raised\rapproximately $1.1 million.  Of the $3 million raised,\rapproximately $2.5 million has not been returned.\r\r     The complaint alleges that each of the defendants knew, or\rwas reckless in not knowing, that the representations each made\rin issuing and selling the respective securities were false.\rThe Commission seeks an order permanently enjoining (i) Edwards\rfrom violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities\rAct of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange\rAct of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; (ii) Chedester from\rviolating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections\r10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule\r10b-5 thereunder; and Luna, Morehouse and First American from\x0c\r\r\r\r\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\rviolating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of\r1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and\rRule 10b-5 thereunder.

King,\rUnited States District Court Judge for the Central District of\rCalifornia, signed a Temporary Restraining Order (Order)\rhalting a Ponzi scheme involving investment contracts for the\rsale and leaseback of automated teller machines (ATMs).  The\rdefendants offered the ATM investment program over the Internet\rto the public and raised over $3.49 million from at least 132\rinvestors nationwide.  This is the first lawsuit involving ATMs\rand the largest lawsuit involving Internet investment fraud\rbrought by the Commission to date.\r\r     In its Complaint, the Commission alleges that the defendants\rhave operated a Ponzi scheme from at least September 1995, when\rthey began offering and selling investments involving the sale\rand leaseback of privately owned ATMs (ATMs not affiliated with\rbanks).  Through simultaneously executed agreements with both WEG\rand Cash Systems, investors purchased ATMs from WEG for $23,950\rand immediately leased them back to Cash Systems.  Investors were\rguaranteed monthly lease payments for five years which payments\rwould allegedly return all of the investors\ principal and a\ryield of 17.4% per year.  However, as of July 1996, only 42 ATMs\rwere operational even though the defendants had sold 195 ATMs,\rand only 2 of the 42 ATMs made enough money to cover their\rassociated monthly lease payments and expenses.  Consequently,\rthe defendants were using new investor funds to pay existing\rinvestors their monthly lease payments.\r\r     The Commission obtained an order temporarily enjoining the\rfollowing entities and individuals from future violations of the\rantifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities\rlaws: Western Executive Group, Inc.

Parrish (Parrish) of Gilmer, Texas;\rRobert J. Struth (Struth) of Southern California; and R.\rStephen Edgel (Edgel) of Carmichael, California.  The order\ralso imposes an asset freeze against WEG and Cash Systems and\rappoints a temporary receiver over WEG and Cash Systems.  A\rhearing to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not be\rgranted will be held on October 21, 1996.\r\r\r\r\r\r     The Complaint also alleges that the defendants solicited\rinvestors nationwide through private investment seminars, mass\rmailings, cold calling and over the Internet.  Defendants\rprovided investors with offering materials which misrepresented\rthe number of ATMs operating and the amount of money the ATMs\rmade.  Additionally, the offering materials failed to disclose\rthat Rietz and Struth had previous orders entered against them\rfor violating certain securities laws.  The Complaint seeks\rpreliminary and permanent injunctions, and other relief,\rincluding disgorgement and civil penalties, against the\rdefendants.\r\r     The Complaint alleges that the defendants violated Sections\r5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the\rSecurities Act), the registration provisions, and Section 17(a)\rof the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities\rExchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and Rule\r10b-5 thereunder, the antifraud provisions.

October 10, 1996)\r\r     On October 15, 1996, the Commission filed an action against\rKent Ahrens, a trader at First Capital Strategists, an investment\radviser located in York, Pennsylvania.  The complaint alleged\rthat, from 1992 through 1995, Ahrens knowingly engaged in\runauthorized trading that resulted in a loss of $137.6 million to\rFirst Capitals client, The Common Fund.  The Common Fund, a\rWestport Connecticut firm, manages investment money for\rapproximately 1,400 colleges and universities in the United\rStates.  \r\r     According to the complaint, Ahrens was primarily responsible\rfor First Capitals equity index arbitrage program, a low-risk\rmarket-neutral strategy in which options or futures contracts are\rbought or sold and hedged with an offsetting position in stocks. \rIn its complaint, the Commission alleged that, sometime in 1992,\rAhrens incurred a loss in The Common Funds account and, without\rdisclosing the loss to First Capital or The Common Fund,\rattempted to recoup the loss by putting on uncovered short\rpositions in the hopes the stock market would decrease in value. \rFrom 1992 through June 1995, the stock market average continued\rto rise, pushing The Common Funds ultimate loss to $137.6\rmillion, according to the complaint.  Ahrens allegedly concealed\rhis unauthorized trading and the massive losses from First\rCapital and The Common Fund.  As a result of his alleged\rfraudulent activity, Ahrens earned approximately $455,465 in\rcommissions he was not entitled to receive.\r\r     Kent Ahrens consented, without admitting or denying the\rallegations, to the entry of a permanent injunction against\rviolations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of\r1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and (2) of\rthe Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Ahrens also consented to\rdisgorge $182,000 of the $455,465 he earned in commissions on the\runauthorized trading.  Pursuant to the settlement, the Court\rwould waive some of Ahrens disgorgement obligations and is not\rordering Ahrens to pay a civil penalty based upon his\rrepresentations to the Commission concerning his financial\rcondition.  As part of his settlement, Ahrens has agreed to\rconsent to the entry of an order permanently barring him from\racting as a broker, dealer, investment adviser, or municipal\rsecurities dealer.  \r\r     In related matters, the United States Attorney for the\rMiddle District of Pennsylvania filed today a felony information\rcharging Ahrens with one count of wire fraud, and the Commodity\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\rFutures Trading Commission filed a civil action in the Middle\rDistrict of Pennsylvania.

Arcara, United\rStates District Court Judge for the Western District of New York,\rwhich enjoins Harrington from future violations of Section 17(a) of\rthe Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-\r5 thereunder.  Harrington was also ordered to pay disgorgement of\r$933,188.28, prejudgment interest in the amount of $99,633.63, and a\rcivil penalty of $100,000.  \r\rThe Complaint in the above action alleged, among other things, that,\rfrom at least March 1991 through June 1995, Harrington, the president\rand sole owner of Harrington Securities Corporation (HSC), a\rregistered broker-dealer, misappropriated at least $982,992.83 from\reighteen of his customers by using an elaborate scheme involving,\ramong other things, material misrepresentations, forged endorsement\rsignatures on clearing firm checks, and fabricated confirmation\rstatements.  To induce investors to invest with him, Harrington\rfalsely told investors that he would invest their funds in\rcertificates of deposit (CDs) issued by various banks.  He falsely\rrepresented that the CDs paid 10% interest; were insured by the\rFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC); and were a completely\rriskless investment.  However, Harrington never purchased CDs for his\rcustomers with the funds which they entrusted to him for that purpose. \rInstead of investing these customers\ funds in CDs, Harrington\rdeposited his customers\ funds into several of his personal bank\raccounts.  Furthermore, to conceal the misappropriation of his\rcustomers\ funds, Harrington prepared and mailed letters to the\rcustomers titled Confirmation, which purported to confirm that funds\rremitted by the customers had been invested in CDs.  In addition,\rHarrington, without his customers\ knowledge, consent, or\rauthorization, placed orders to sell the securities of his customers\rbeing held in their HSC brokerage accounts.  Harrington\rmisappropriated the proceeds from the unauthorized sales of these\rcustomers\ securities by forging the customers\ signatures on the\rproceeds checks and then depositing these checks into his personal\rbank accounts.\r\rFor further information see Lit.

At the time of the\rtrading, Jonsson was an executive with Olicom.  He effected the\rtrades through Luxembourg banks for his own account and for OIH,\rwhose account he controlled.  The Complaint alleged that while in\rpossession of material, nonpublic information concerning Olicom\s\rexpected operating loss and the impending public announcement of\rOlicom\s bad news, the defendants sold a total of 28,000 shares\rof Olicom common stock and purchased a total of 800 Olicom put\roptions.  Defendants avoided losses of approximately $88,000 by\rselling the shares of Olicom stock, and reaped a profit of\rapproximately $99,000 through the exercise of the put options and\raccompanying transactions in Olicom\s common stock.\r \r     The Commission applied for emergency relief, which included\rthe asset freeze, to prevent the defendants from removing assets\rfrom the United States.  The Commission acted when it did\rbecause, as noted in documents filed in support of its\rapplication for the emergency relief, on October 16, 1996,\rJonsson, who resides in Denmark, ordered the liquidation of\rcertain positions held in a brokerage account in the United\rStates, apparently with the intention of removing assets out of\rthe United States.  The proceeds from this account would have\rbeen available for immediate transfer overseas on Friday, October\r18, 1996.  As a result of the Temporary Restraining Order, this\raccount as well as all other assets of the defendants are frozen\rin place.\r\r     In its Complaint, the Commission alleged that the trading of\rJonsson and OIH in Olicom stock and put options violated Section\r10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5\rthereunder.

During this same period of time, Bunsis\r     practiced law and accounting at Bunsis & Bunsis, located in\r     Garden City, New York.  Bunsis and Berbun raised\r     approximately $2.9 million from investors by representing to\r     prospective investors that: (a) Berbun would invest in\r     secondary residential mortgages; (b) Berbun would pool\r     investors\ monies so that each individual investor\s monies\r     would not be invested in any one second mortgage; and (c) an\r     investment in Berbun was low risk.  Bunsis and Berbun\r     offered prospective investors interest payments ranging from\r     8 - 12% on their investment.\r\r          The representations by Bunsis and Berbun were false\r     because Bunsis diverted investor monies to repay certain\r     favored investors, make payments to himself and his firm,\r     make loans to Briarhall Country Club, a business in which\r     Bunsis was a 50% owner, and make an investment in Movie\r     Moguls, Inc., a business in which Bunsis was a part-owner. \r     The Briarhall and Movie Moguls loans were never repaid.  As\r     a result, Berbun failed to repay the investments made by\r     many of its investors.\r\r     The Complaint alleges that Berbun and Bunsis violated\rSections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933,\rSection 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule\r10b-5 thereunder and seeks to enjoin him from future violations\rof these provisions.

Don\rPace co-founded Pace American in 1988 and helped to take it\rpublic in 1992 through an offering of common stock which raised\rover $18 million.  \r\r     The Commission s complaint alleges that Don Pace committed\rantifraud violations by failing to disclose in Pace American s\rannual reports, proxy materials and registration statements filed\rwith the Commission that he received over $480,000 in related\rparty transactions.  The transactions allegedly involved his\rundisclosed receipt between 1990 and 1994 of over $450,000 in\rcommission payments made by Pace American to Commercial Surety\rBond Agency, a Pace American surety bond agency owned by Ralph\rEidem, and of a portion of payments which Pace American surety\rbond holders made to shell corporations which he helped to\restablish and had an undisclosed interest.\r\r     The Commission s complaint also asserts that Don Pace\rcommitted financial fraud by causing Pace American to issue\rconsolidated financial statements which failed to disclose that\rhe caused Pace American to convert an equity interest made by\rcertain investors into a debt which Don Pace obligated Pace\rAmerican to repay.  Don Pace also caused Pace American to\runderstate the companys loss reserves on surety bonds\routstanding at year-end 1992.  \r\r     The Commission also alleges that Don Pace misled Pace\rAmericans auditor in connection with its audit of and issuance\rof reports on the company s financial statements for its fiscal\ryears ended December 31, 1989 through 1992, by providing to the\rauditor financial statements which falsely recorded a total of\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======   \r                                      2\r          \r\r$443,375 of interest expenses on the debt to certain investors as\rreinsurance expenses and failed to include a significant\rliability for the conversion of equity to debt.  The complaint\ralleges that Don Pace also misled the auditor by providing to it \ra management representation letter in connection with the 1992 \r\raudit which stated that unpaid losses on the companys insurance \rportfolio were adequate when he had serious concerns at the time \rwhether the companys loss reserves on surety bonds written in\r1992 should have been significantly increased.  The Commission\ralso alleges that Don Pace caused Pace American to maintain false\rbooks and records because he failed to have the company s books\rand records reflect the existence of Pace American brokerage\raccounts he exercised control over in Mexico as well as his\rmisappropriation from those accounts of $42,589 in corporate\rassets stemming from bond proceeds.\r\r     The complaint further asserts that after his dismissal from \rPace American, Don Pace filed with the SEC a Schedule 13D\rconcerning his beneficial ownership of common stock which\rfraudulently disclosed that he had no plans or proposals to have \rthe company effect a change in management or an extraordinary\rcorporate transaction.

The preliminary injunction\rcontinues to bar the defendants from committing their fraudulent\ractivities.  \r\r     In its lawsuit, which was filed in the United States\rDistrict Court for the Central District of California, the\rCommission informed the Court that Bush had been commingling and\rmisappropriating client funds and had prepared false account\rstatements to conceal his misappropriation.

Cal.)\r\r     The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission)\rannounced that on October 22, 1996, the Honorable George H. King,\rUnited States District Court Judge for the Central District of\rCalifornia, signed a Preliminary Injunction (Order) halting a\rPonzi scheme involving investment contracts for the sale and\rleaseback of automated teller machines (ATMs).  The defendants \roffered the ATM investment program over the Internet to the\rpublic and raised over $3.49 million from at least 132 investors \rnationwide.  This is the first lawsuit involving ATMs and the\rlargest lawsuit involving Internet investment fraud brought by\rthe Commission to date.\r\r     In its Complaint, the Commission alleges that the defendants\rhave operated a Ponzi scheme from at least September 1995, when\rthey began offering and selling investments involving the sale\rand leaseback of privately owned ATMs (ATMs not affiliated with\rbanks).  Through simultaneously executed agreements with both WEG\rand Cash Systems, investors purchased ATMs from WEG for $23,950\rand immediately leased them back to Cash Systems.  Investors were\rguaranteed monthly lease payments for five years which payments\rwould allegedly return all of the investors\ principal and a\ryield of 17.4% per year.  However, as of July 1996, only 42 ATMs \rwere operational even though the defendants had sold 195 ATMs,\rand only 2 of the 42 ATMs made enough money to cover their\rassociated monthly lease payments and expenses.  Consequently,\rthe defendants were using new investor funds to pay existing\rinvestors their monthly lease payments.\r\r     The Commission obtained an order enjoining the following\rentities and individuals from future violations of the antifraud \rand registration provisions of the federal securities laws:\rWestern Executive Group, Inc. (WEG) headquartered in Reno,\rNevada; Cash Systems USA, Inc. (Cash Systems) headquartered in \rReno, Nevada; Charles R. Rietz (Rietz) of Mesa, Arizona; Robert\rR. Parrish (Parrish) of Gilmer, Texas; Robert J. Struth\r(Struth) of Southern California; and R. Stephen Edgel (Edgel)\rof Carmichael, California.  The Order also imposes an asset\rfreeze against WEG and Cash Systems and appoints a receiver over \rWEG and Cash Systems.\r\r     The Complaint also alleges that the defendants solicited\rinvestors nationwide through private investment seminars, mass\rmailings, cold calling and over the Internet.  Defendants\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\rprovided investors with offering materials which misrepresented\rthe number of ATMs operating and the amount of money the ATMs\rmade.  Additionally, the offering materials failed to disclose\rthat Rietz and Struth had previous orders entered against them\rfor violating certain securities laws.  The Complaint seeks a\rpermanent injunction, and other relief, including disgorgement\rand civil penalties, against the defendants.\r\r     The Complaint alleges that the defendants violated Sections \r5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the\rSecurities Act), the registration provisions, and Section 17(a)\rof the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities\rExchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and Rule\r10b-5 thereunder, the antifraud provisions.

Cal.)   \r\rThe Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) filed a\rfirst amended complaint on November 1, 1996, in the United States\rDistrict Court for the Southern District of California against\rMichael W. Crow (Crow) and Peter F. Kuebler (Kuebler).  Crow\rwas the former president and chief executive officer of Wilshire\rTechnologies, Inc. (Wilshire), a public company located in\rCarlsbad, California.  Kuebler was Wilshire\s vice president,\rsecretary and chief financial officer.  The Commission\s amended\rcomplaint alleges that both Crow and Kuebler violated the federal\rsecurities laws by causing Wilshire to materially overstate its\rearnings, to issue materially misleading press releases and to\rfile materially misleading periodic financial reports with the\rCommission.  The Commission further alleges that Crow engaged in\rinsider trading by selling 75,000 shares of Wilshire stock in\rNovember and December 1993, avoiding losses of about $1.2\rmillion. \r\rThe Commission alleges in its amended complaint that Crow and\rKuebler caused Wilshire to overstate its fiscal 1993 second and\rthird quarter financial statements by causing Wilshire to\rrecognize revenue on conditional sales of two new and untested\rproducts.  One product, called the TrimPatch, was designed as an\rover-the-counter appetite suppressant administered through a\rpatch applied to the skin.  The other product, a pipe plug, was\rdesigned to clean tubing in clean rooms in manufacturing\rfacilities.  The Commission further alleges that Crow and Kuebler\rcaused Wilshire to overstate its fourth quarter and fiscal 1993\rfinancial results by causing Wilshire to recognize additional\rrevenue on other conditional sales, and by causing Wilshire to\rimproperly recognize a gain on a related party asset sale and an\rexpense deduction on a disputed claim against a vendor.  The\rCommission alleges that, in perpetrating this scheme, Crow and\rKuebler violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the\rSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5\rthereunder, the reporting provisions of Section 13(a) of the\rExchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-13 thereunder, the \rrecordkeeping provisions of Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange\rAct and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder, the internal control provisions\rof Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and the lying to the\rauditors provision of Rule 13b2-2 under the Exchange Act.\r\rThe Commission also alleges that Crow engaged in insider trading\rin Wilshire\s stock in violation of the antifraud provisions of\rSection 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of\rthe Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In November and\rDecember 1993, Crow sold 75,000 shares of Wilshire stock.  At the\x0c==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\rtime he sold the stock, Crow knew material, nonpublic information\rconcerning Wilshire\s overstatement of its 1993 second and third\rquarter financial results.  By selling the Wilshire stock, while\rin possession of this inside information, Crow avoided losses of\rabout $1.2 million.\r\r\rThe Commission requests that the Court permanently enjoin both\rCrow and Kuebler from any further violations of the securities\rlaws, prohibit Crow from serving as an officer or director of any\rcorporation that has securities registered with the Commission or\rthat is required to file reports with the Commission, and order\rCrow to disgorge all benefits obtained by virtue of his illegal\rconduct. \x0c==========================================START OF PAGE 3======\r\r\r                               -2-\x0c\x1a"

The fraudulent statements included\rrepresentations that the pay telephones would earn a 25 percent\rreturn; that the company had installed 1,800 pay telephones; that\rthe average pay telephone earns $250 a month; and that Quarter\rCall Inc. would repurchase the pay telephones from investors in 5\ryears.  Mr. Kendall and others also failed to tell investors that\rThomas C. Yost, the former vice president of Quarter Call, Inc.\rhad a criminal conviction, and that Maryland had entered a cease\rand desist order against the company in March 1994 for violations\rof the states securities laws.\r\r     Based on its findings that Mr. Kendall had violated the\ranti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws, the Court\rordered him to pay disgorgement of $631,747.51 and prejudgment\rinterest of $151,649.78.  The amount of disgorgement was set\rbased on a portion of Mr. Kendalls salary, all executive\rdisbursements, and money that Quarter Call Inc. had paid to\ranother company owned by Mr. Kendall.  Mr. Kendall is to pay the\rdisgorgement and prejudgment interest into the bankruptcy estate\rof Quarter Call Inc., which is filed with the United States\rBankruptcy Court for the District of Maryland, so that it will\rbenefit the investors who are creditors of the bankruptcy estate.\r\r\r\r     In a separate order entered by consent on October 24, 1996,\rthe United States District Court for Colorado ordered Thomas C.\rYost, to disgorge $783,000, the compensation he had received from\rthe conduct alleged in the SECs complaint, and prejudgment\rinterest.  Mr. Yosts payment of the disgorgement and prejudgment\rinterest was waived based on his demonstrated inability to pay.\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\r     In May 1994, the Court had previously enjoined Mr. Kendall,\rMr. Yost and others, based on their consent in which they neither\radmitted nor denied the allegations of the SECs complaint, from\rselling unregistered securities, making false statements or\romitting material information in connection with the offer and\rsale of securities, and acting as unregistered broker-dealers.  \rThe complaint alleged that they violated the securities\rregistration provisions of Section 5(a) and(c) of the Securities\rAct, the anti-fraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities\rAct and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5, and the\rbroker-dealer registration provisions of Section 15(a) of the\rExchange Act in connection with their offer and sale of pay\rtelephone sale and lease back agreements to 520 investors, who\rinvested approximately $9,400,000 between July 1993 and April\r1994.

Merryday, United\rStates District Judge for the Middle District of Florida,\rreversed and remanded a bankruptcy court order of summary\rjudgment against the Commission with instructions that the\rbankruptcy court enter summary judgment in favor of the\rCommission.  The Commission had moved for summary judgment that\rits securities fraud judgment against debtor Paul A. Bilzerian\rwas nondischargeable as a debt for money obtained by fraud,\rrelying on the collateral estoppel effect of its securities fraud\rjudgment.  The bankruptcy court had denied the motion and sua\rsponte had entered summary judgment against the Commission on the\rground that the Commission\s failure to prove reliance (which is\rnot an element of a Commission action) doomed its claim that the\rjudgment was nondischargeable.  The Commission appealed the\rsummary judgment to the district court, arguing that, having\rproved the elements of material misrepresentation and causation\rin its action, it had met any applicable reliance standard.  The\rdistrict court agreed, and, finding all elements of issue\rpreclusion to be amply present in this record, ordered the\rbankruptcy court to enter summary judgment in favor of the\rCommission. \r\r     This is the second successful appeal by the Commission in\rBilzerian\s bankruptcy case.  In May 1995, the district court\rreversed the bankruptcy court\s ruling that the Commission lacked\rstanding to object to the discharge in bankruptcy of its\rdisgorgement judgment.  On remand, the Commission filed the\rsummary judgment motion that resulted in the instant appeal.\r\r     Bilzerian was criminally convicted of securities fraud in\r1989, and his conviction was upheld on appeal in 1991.  He was\renjoined in 1991 and in 1993 was ordered to disgorge $33 million\rin illegal profits, and $29 million in prejudgment interest. \rThose orders were upheld on appeal in 1994.  Bilzerian\s criminal\rand civil liability arose from two schemes in which he made false\rand misleading filings with the Commission in two purported\rtakeover attempts of public companies.  The schemes were directed\rat, and succeeded in, enticing friendly bidders -- white\rknights -- to take over the target companies and purchase\rBilzerian\s shares at a huge profit to Bilzerian.    \x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\r     For further information, see Litigation Release No. 14526.\x0c\x1a"

The\rComplaint seeks an order of permanent injunction against them,\rdisgorgement including prejudgment interest and civil penalties. \r\r\r     Specifically, the Complaint alleges that from at least\rDecember 1994 to October 1995, Shaner and Shaner & Co. raised at\rleast $2.65 million in the offer and sale of limited partnership\runits in the Shaner Fund, L.P.

The\rCommission alleges that Huttoe secretly distributed millions of\rSOE shares to his family members and corporations, manipulated\rthe market by issuing false favorable information concerning SOE\rand its business, and then sold his shares into the inflated\rmarket.\r\r     In particular, according to the Commission, as the first\rpart of that scheme Huttoe executed an unregistered distribution\rof tens of millions of shares of SOE stock by causing a series of\rfalse purported Form S-8 registration statements to be submitted\rto SOE\s transfer agent begining in March, 1995.  Huttoe secretly\rissued millions of those unregistered but unrestricted and free\rtrading SOE shares to various Huttoe family members and entities\rthat served as Huttoe\s nominees, including defendants Word\rCorporation, NTSI, Purvis (his wife), Brooks (his mother) and\rPerkins (his niece).  According to the Commission, as the second\rstep in the scheme, Huttoe artificially inflated the price of SOE\rshares by issuing a series of materially false and misleading\rpress releases that, among other things, announced nonexistent\rmultimillion dollar sales of SOE products, an acquisition that\rhad not occurred, and revenue projections for SOE that were\rwithout any basis.  The Complaint also alleges that as further\refforts to inflate the price of SOE securities, Huttoe caused SOE\rto fail to file required periodic reports and to file false\rperiodic reports with the Commission, and bribed SGA with stock\rto recommend SOE to subscribers to SGA\s electronically\rdisseminated tout sheet.  The Commission alleges that Huttoe\rcaused unregistered but free trading shares to be issued to\rMelcher and Terry, SGA\s principals, some of which were issued in\rthe names of Alpha and Dunbar, entities they control.  The\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\rComplaint further alleges that as the third step in the scheme,\rHuttoe, Melcher, and Terry then took advantage of the inflated\rmarket for SOE stock that they had created by dumping their own\rSOE stock on unwitting investors.  The Commission alleges that\rthose sales were timed to take advantage of the false news\rconcerning SOE, and were heaviest when SOE stock reached its\rhighs in June, 1996.  The Commission alleges that as a result of\rthis scheme, the defendants obtained illegal proceeds of more\rthan $10 million.\r\r     The complaint further alleges that Huttoe engaged in a\rmassive coverup after SOE\s auditors discovered evidence of his\runregistered distribution of securities, and raised questions\rconcerning it in mid-September, 1996.  The Complaint alleges that\rover the course of the weekend of September 21-22, 1996, Huttoe\rorchestrated the fabrication and forgery of fraudulent\rconsulting agreements that purported to be the consideration\rfor nearly 40 million shares that had been issued pursuant to\rpurported Form S-8 registration statements.  The Complaint\ralleges that Huttoe retained a new auditor for SOE that Saturday,\rand that on the same day the new auditor rendered a clean opinion\ron SOE\s financial statements.  The Complaint alleges that on\rMonday, September 23 SOE filed a materially false Form 10-K that\rincluded the false accountant\s report, and a materially false\rForm 10-Q.  The Complaint alleges that the following day SOE\rfiled sixteen materially false registration statements on Form S-\r8 that purported to cover the shares distributed months before,\rand that included as attachments the forged consulting\ragreements.\r\r     As a result, the Complaint alleges that Huttoe violated\rSections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities\rAct), Sections 10(b), 13(b)(5), and 16(a) of the Securities\rExchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1,\r13b2-2, 16a-2, and 16a-3 thereunder; Huttoe & Associates, Inc.,\rWord Corporation, and NTSI violated Sections 5 and 17(a) of the\rSecurities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule\r10b-5 thereunder; Purvis, Perkins, and Brooks violated Section 5\rof the Securities Act; SGA, Melcher, Terry, Dunbar, and Alpha\rviolated Sections 5, 17(a) and 17(b) of the Securities Act and\rSection 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act; and SOE\rviolated Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act and Sections\r10(b), 13(a), and 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange\rAct, and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13\rthereunder.  The Commission applied to the Court for orders that\rwould, among other things, temporarily restrain defendants from\rviolating the federal securities laws; temporarily freeze assets\rand accounts of defendants other than SOE; require Huttoe to\rtemporarily surrender his passport and refrain from foreign\rtravel; and direct defendants, other than SOE, to file an\raccounting.  The Complaint seeks permanent injunctions against\rviolations of the relevant provisions of the securities laws by\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 3======\r\rdefendants and disgorgement by defendants of illegal gains,\rtogether with prejudgment interest.\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 4======\r\r\r     On October 7, 1996, the Commission issued an Order\rsuspending trading in SOE securities for ten days.

Further, Cowan allegedly told customers that he would\rpool these funds with monies obtained from other investors and\rpurchase a portfolio of safe, high-yielding debt instruments, and\rthat CSI would pay an above-market, fixed rate of return for a\rone-year period, and provide investors with the option to roll-\rover investments at a newly calculated, above-market fixed rate.\rIn fact, according to the complaint, CSI does not exist, apart\rfrom Cowan\s misrepresentations and created records, and does not\rhold securities or funds for customers; rather, Cowan used\rcustomers\ funds for his personal expenses, and to satisfy\rperiodic payments and redemptions for his customers as part of a\rponzi scheme. \r\r     The complaint also seeks disgorgement from Cowan, CSI, and\rCAMI of all illegal gains as a result of the violative conduct\ralleged in the Commission\s complaint, and civil money penalties.\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\r  \x0c\x1a"

Fernandez, an investment adviser, misappropriated\rover $64 million in client funds, using forgeries and falsified\rinstructions to broker-dealers.  \r\r     The Complaint alleges as follows:  \r\r     Fernandez, age 49, operated a registered investment advisory\rfirm, Wharton Investments, Inc., from her home in Tenafly, New\rJersey.  Her clients were mostly wealthy residents of the\rPhilippines, many of whom were relatives and family friends. \rThey entrusted a total of over $100 million to Fernandezs\rmanagement.  Fernandez placed client funds in brokerage accounts\rat Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. from 1986 to 1990 and, from mid-\r1990 onward, at Bear Stearns & Co.  Fernandez had authority to\rbuy and sell securities in these accounts, but did not have\rauthority to withdraw funds or securities from the accounts.\r\r     Beginning in 1990, Fernandez ensured that her clients would\rnot receive brokerage statements revealing the true status of\rtheir accounts by submitting forged letters to Bear Stearns\rdirecting that the statements be sent to her own home, and to her\rmothers home in the Philippines.  From September 1990 through\rMarch 1995, Fernandez created and distributed fake Bear Stearns\rstatements that reported securities trades that had not in fact\roccurred in the accounts.  These statements, and Fernandezs own\rquarterly statements to clients, reported net equity that\rexceeded the true account balances by 50% to 90%.\r\r     From December 1986 through September 1995, Fernandez stole\rat least $64,036,612 by submitting falsified Letters of\rAuthorization directing that the broker-dealers transfer client\rfunds to accounts under Fernandezs own control.  Fernandez\rdistributed the misappropriated funds to various persons and\rentities, including previously defrauded clients, many of whom\rwere her relatives and friends.

Montague, for fraud in\rthe offer and sale of $110 million in Series B Pension Obligation\rBonds issued by Orange County in September 1994.  This lawsuit is\rthe Commission\s third enforcement action in its ongoing\rinvestigation relating to the financial collapse of Orange\rCounty.  The Commission is seeking permanent injunctions and\rcivil penalties against each of the Defendants.\r\r     The Commission alleges in its Complaint that CS First\rBoston, Nowlin, and Montague misled investors concerning the\rOrange County Investment Pools (County Pools), particularly the\rCounty Pools\ investment strategy, the risks of that strategy,\rand the County Pools\ investment losses.    \r\r     The Complaint alleges that while participating in drafting\rand preparing the offering document known as the Official\rStatement, CS First Boston, Nowlin, and Montague knew, or were\rreckless in not knowing, significant negative information about\rthe County Pools that was misrepresented in or omitted from the\rOfficial Statement.  Specifically, CS First Boston, Nowlin, and\rMontague knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that: \r\r     *   the County Pools\ investment strategy was premised on\r          the assumption that interest rates would remain\r          relatively low for at least three years;\r\r     *   the County Pools employed a high degree of leverage\r          through reverse repurchase agreements, which magnified\r          the County Pools\ risk of loss in the event of a rise\r          in interest rates;\r\r     *   the County Pools invested heavily in certain risky\r          derivative securities that reacted negatively to a rise\r          in interest rates; \r\r     *   the maturities of the reverse repurchase agreements\r          were not matched with the maturities of the securities\r          purchased with the proceeds of those agreements, which\r          exposed the County Pools to investment risk;\r\r     *   as a result of rises in interest rates during 1994, the\r          County Pools had suffered significant market losses and\r          collateral calls; and \x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\r                              - 2 -\r\r     *   critics had charged that the County Pools\ investment\r          strategy was too risky for public funds.\r\r     Despite this knowledge, CS First Boston, Nowlin, and\rMontague failed to diligently inquire into these matters and\rotherwise take steps to assure that the Official Statement\s\rdisclosure concerning the County Pools was not false or\rmisleading.  To the contrary, CS First Boston, Nowlin, and\rMontague participated in the preparation of the Official\rStatement which cast the County Pools in a false light by\rconveying the impression of safety and security.  \r\r     Information about the County Pools\ investment strategy,\rrisks and investment losses was material to investors in the $110\rmillion Series B Pension Bonds because the County Pools\rguaranteed liquidity of these bonds.  Investors in the Series B\rBonds had the right to liquidate their investment upon seven-\rdays\ notice.  If the Series B Bonds could not be resold in seven\rdays, the County Pools agreed to purchase the bonds up to the\ramount of Orange County\s unrestricted funds in the County Pools.\r\r     As a direct result of the undisclosed risks of the County\rPools\ investment strategy, by December 1994 the County Pools\rsuffered market losses of $1.7 billion.  In response to these\rlosses, in early December 1994, the County and the County Pools\rfiled Chapter 9 bankruptcy, and the County Pools defaulted on\rtheir obligation to purchase the Series B Bonds.  \r\r     The Commission has charged CS First Boston, Nowlin and\rMontague with fraud in the offer and sale of the Series B Pension\rBonds in violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933\rand Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule\r10b-5 thereunder and with deceptive, dishonest and unfair\rpractices in violation of Rule G-17 of the Municipal Securities\rRulemaking Board.  The Commission has also charged CS First\rBoston with fraud by a broker-dealer in violation of Section\r15(c) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 15c1-2.  The\rDefendants named in this action are:\r\r     CS First Boston Corporation, a broker-dealer\r     headquartered in New York.

According to the Complaint, the defendants have\rdiverted overseas more than $1.7 million of the money that they\rillegally obtained from investors, including residents of New\rHampshire, Indiana, and a group of cadets at the United States\rMilitary Academy at West Point.  Named in the Complaint were:\r\r     Joseph A.

Although the prime bank securities described\rby the defendants do not exist, Joseph A. Bremont, using language\rthat had been provided to him by Jimmy B.

The Commission\s complaint also charges Montedison\rwith violating the corporate reporting, books and records, and\rinternal control provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of\r1934 (Exchange Act).\r\r     Montedison, an Italian corporation with headquarters in\rMilan, has interests in the agro-industry, chemical, energy and\rengineering sectors.  Since July 1987, American Depositary\rReceipts (ADRs), each representing ten shares of the company\s\rcommon stock, have been listed on the New York Stock Exchange. \rThe ADRs are registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act,\rand the company files reports with the Commission in Washington,\rD.C. pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act.  The company\rfiles annual reports with the Commission on Form 20-F.\r\r     The Commission\s complaint alleges that Montedison violated\rthe antifraud provisions of the Exchange Act by engaging in a\rfraudulent scheme to materially misstate its financial condition\rand results of operations on its books and records and in its\rreports filed with the Commission and disseminated to the\rinvesting public.  This fraudulent scheme continued from at least\r1988 through the first half of 1993.  The complaint alleges that\rthe scheme was designed to conceal hundreds of millions of\rdollars of payments that, among other things, were used to bribe\rpoliticians in Italy and other persons.  The scheme concealed\rlosses of at least $398 million.  The complaint alleges that as a\rresult of the scheme, Montedison\s assets were materially\roverstated on its books and records and in its financial\rstatements for its 1988, 1989, 1990 and 1991 fiscal years. \r\r     The complaint alleges two examples of Montedison\s\rfraudulent conduct:  the Exilar Loan and the ENIMONT Affair. \rAccording to the complaint, the Exilar Loan was a fraudulent\raccounting entry used to disguise and aggregate as an asset on\rthe company\s balance sheet numerous questionable payments or\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\rbribes that had been made from at least December 1988 through May\r1993.  In the latter half of 1993, Montedison determined that the\rExilar Loan was uncollectable, and took a write-down in the\ramount of 435 billion lire (approximately $272 million, at $1 =\r1,600 lire) for the company\s 1992 fiscal year.  The complaint\ralleges that The ENIMONT Affair involved fraudulent accounting\rentries involving overstated real estate values to disguise\rnumerous bribes on the company\s books and records from at least\r1990 through 1992.  The fraudulent entries resulted in a write-\rdown on the company\s 1993 financial statements of 202 billion\rlire (approximately $126,250,000). \r\r     In its complaint, the Commission requests that the court: \r(i) enter findings that Montedison violated Exchange Act Sections\r10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20\rand 13a-1 thereunder; (ii) grant a permanent injunction\rrestraining and enjoining Montedison from violating such\rprovisions; and (iii) order Montedison to pay a civil penalty\rpursuant to Exchange Act Section 21(d)(3).\x0c\x1a"

Hegarty for trading in\rStandard & Poor\s 100 Index options.  The Complaint alleges that,\rbetween October and December 1992, the defendants caused the loss\rof all but $1.1 million of client funds under management, and\rthat these losses included losses in excess of account equity of\rover $650,000 in the accounts of 21 clients.  The Complaint seeks\rpermanent injunctions, disgorgement and civil penalties.\r\r     The Complaint alleges that the Hegartys solicited clients\rfor Hyannis Trading with materially misleading promotional\rmaterials and verbal statements that misrepresented the principal\rrisk management features of the trading strategy and J. Hegarty\s\rpast trading performance.  According to the Complaint, J. Hegarty\rand M. Hegarty, who was a registered representative of a broker-\rdealer at which most of Hyannis Trading\s client accounts were\rmaintained, represented that Hyannis Trading\s program included\rtrading safeguards -- such as risking only a portion of an\raccount\s equity, making infrequent trades, engaging in hedging\rstrategies, and adhering to stop-loss instructions -- that would\rlimit the risk of loss in client accounts.  The Complaint alleges\rthat, between October 1 and December 31, 1992, J. Hegarty and M.\rHegarty disregarded these safeguards, and, without disclosure of\rthe changed trading strategy to clients, dramatically increased\rthe number, size, frequency and risk of the options trades.  The\rComplaint alleges that the changed trading strategy resulted in\rthe defendants\ execution of unsuitable trades for many Hyannis\rTrading clients. \r\r     In addition, the Complaint alleges that Hyannis Trading, J.\rHegarty and M. Hegarty, variously, entered into investment\radvisory contracts charging performance fees to all clients,\rfailed to file required annual reports with the Commission for\r1994 and 1995, and failed to deliver Hyannis Trading\s Form ADV\rPart II or a brochure equivalent, which are required disclosure\rdocuments, to clients.\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\r     The Commission charged that Hyannis Trading violated, and J.\rHegarty and M.

Mackie, Jr.  The Judgment (i) permanently restrains and\renjoins Mackie from violating the anti-fraud provisions of the\rfederal securities laws as well as provisions prohibiting the\rsale of unregistered securities; and (ii) orders Mackie to pay a\rcivil penalty of $100,000 as a result of his violations of\rSections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section\r10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  \r\r     Judgment was entered against Mackie due to his failure to\rcontest the Commissions Complaint which alleged the following:\r\r     In the period from late 1991 through late 1992, Mackie\rfraudulently obtained securities from three different entities:\r(1) the Bank of Keetoowah, a bank located in Oklahoma, (2) Sigma\rAlpha Entertainment Group, Ltd., a Philadelphia-based record\rcompany and (3) Command Credit Corporation, a financial services\rcompany located in Rockville Center, New York.  In each case,\rMackie acquired the securities by falsely stating that he\rrepresented a Liechtenstein trust named Stirling Trust and by\rmisrepresenting the size of the trusts assets and, accordingly,\rhis ability to pay for the securities.  In addition to numerous\rfalse statements and omissions, Mackies fraudulent activity\rincluded the creation and use of false and misleading financial\rstatements for Stirling Trust and the use of a forged certificate\rof deposit and falsified account statements. (See Litigation\rRelease No. 14732).\r\r     Mackie is currently serving a sentence of more than 11 years\rin federal prison.  That sentence was imposed earlier this year\rin a case prosecuted by the United States Attorney for the\rEastern District of Louisiana and was based, in part, on Mackies\rfraud on Command Credit Corporation.  Defendant Andrew S. Fink\rsettled the Commissions case against him at the time the\rComplaint was filed.  The Commission is actively pursuing its\rcase against defendant Peter M. Stanley.  The Complaint alleges\rthat Stanley participated in Mackies fraud on Command Credit by,\ramong other things, misrepresenting Mackies relationship with\rStirling Trust and the size of the trusts assets.\x0c\x1a"

ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICALS\rGROUP, INC., CURTIS A. YOUNTS, JR., CALVIN SHENKIR, Jr., and\rCALVIN MOERBE, Civil Action No. SA 96 CA 1319 (W.D. Texas, San\rAntonio Div.) \r\rSECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION v. CURTIS A. YOUNTS, JR.,\rRONALD E. HENDRIX and LITTLEFIELD, ADAMS & COMPANY, SA 95 CA 1100\r(OLG) (W.D. Texas, San Antonio Div.) \r\rThe Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission)\rannounced today that it filed a civil injunctive action in the\rUnited States District Court for the Western District of Texas,\rSan Antonio Division, charging Environmental Chemicals Group,\rInc. (EnChem), Curtis A. Younts, Jr. (Younts), Calvin\rShenkir, Jr. (Shenkir) and Calvin Moerbe (Moerbe) with\rnumerous violations of the antifraud, registration and record-\rkeeping requirements of the federal securities laws.  \r\rEnChem, a Delaware corporation with headquarters in Andrews,\rTexas, is purportedly engaged in the development and sale of\renvironmentally friendly pesticides, fertilizers and safety\rproducts.  EnChem\s common stock is registered with the\rCommission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act and is\rtraded over-the-counter on the OTC Bulletin Board.  \r\rThe Commission\s Complaint alleges that between 1992 and May\r1996, Younts, Shenkir and Moerbe -- as officers and directors of\rEnChem  -- filed periodic reports with the Commission and\rdistributed press releases and other materials that contained\rmaterially false and misleading representations about the\rcompany\s revenues, product lines and business prospects.  \r\rFor example, the Complaint alleges that EnChem touted its\rprincipal product, a fire ant pesticide marketed under the name\rRapid Kill, to investors as a newly-developed, highly\reffective, cost-efficient and environmentally safe product that\rhad been approved for sale by the Environmental Protection\rAgency.  In fact, Younts had learned in 1992 that the EPA had\rrejected EnChem\s application to commercially distribute Rapid\rKill.  The Complaint similarly alleges that EnChem repeatedly\rrepresented that it had owned a patent for Rapid Kill when, in\rfact, the patent application for Rapid Kill had been rejected\rby the United States Patent and Trademark Office.\r\rThe Complaint also alleges that Younts and Moerbe issued press\x0c\r\r\r\r\r\rreleases that falsely represented that EnChem reached lucrative\ragreements with two purchasers to sell its fertilizer product --\rwith anticipated revenues totalling over $62,000,000.  In fact,\rthe Complaint alleges, EnChem had never had a formal, firm or\rbinding contract to sell any product to either purported\rpurchaser. \r  \r\rThe Commission also alleges that Younts invented and documented a\rseries of fictitious transactions with a related entity owned by\rShenkir -- and then caused those transactions to be recorded as\rrevenue on EnChem\s financial statements filed with the company\s\rForm 10-Q for the third quarter of 1995.  Those transactions\rtotalled 82% of reported quarterly revenues.\r\rThe Commission\s Complaint further alleges that Younts and\rShenkir realized over $150,000 from the sale of EnChem stock\rwhile in the possession of material non-public information.  \r\rMoreover, the Complaint alleges that Younts, Shenkir and Moerbe\rused solicitation materials containing false and misleading\rinformation to sell EnChem stock to individual investors through\rprivate placements.  The Complaint alleges that Shenkir and\rYounts told these investors that they were purchasing freely-\rtrading EnChem stock -- when, in fact, the stock was newly-\rissued, restricted and unregistered.  The Commission\s Complaint\rfurther alleges that EnChem used newly-issued, unregistered,\rrestricted stock to purchase assets, settle lawsuits, compensate\remployees and pay for other goods and services, thereby flooding\rthe public market with hundreds of thousands of shares of\runregistered EnChem stock. \r\rIn connection with the Commission\s allegations of violations of\rthe antifraud and reporting provisions of the federal securities\rlaws by Littlefield, Adams & Company (LFA), Shenkir consented\rin October 1995 to an Order by the Commission requiring him to\rcease and desist from further violations of Sections 10(b) and\r13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act). \rSee In re Calvin Shenkir, Jr., Exchange Act Release No. 36446\r(Oct. 31, 1995).  The Commission\s Complaint in SEC v.\rEnvironmental Chemicals Group, Inc. et al. alleges that Shenkir\rviolated that cease and desist Order by engaging in the conduct\routlined above.  \rWithout admitting or denying the allegations, Younts, Shenkir and\rMoerbe consented to the entry of an order permanently enjoining\rthem from further violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of\rthe Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(5) of\rthe Exchange Act, and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder.  \r\rIn addition to the permanent injunction, Shenkir consented to an\rOrder imposing $45,000 in disgorgement, and pre-judgment interest\rthereon, and barring him from acting as an officer or director of\rany issuer required to file reports with the Commission, pursuant\rto Section 21(d)(2) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. \x15 78u(d)(2)]. \x0c\r\r\r\r\r\rBased on Shenkir\s demonstrated inability to pay, the Order\rwaives payment of all but $15,000 in disgorgement.  \r\rIn addition to the permanent injunction, Moerbe consented to an\rOrder imposing $10,000 in civil penalties.\r\rIn addition to the permanent injunction in SEC v. Environmental\rChemicals Group, Inc., Younts agreed to entry of an Order\rimposing $114,547 in disgorgement of ill-gotten gains.  The Order\rwaives payment of disgorgement and pre-judgment interest thereon,\rbased on (i) Younts\ demonstrated inability to pay; and (ii) the\radditional relief that Younts has consented to in connection with\r\rSEC v. Younts, et al., SA 95 CA 1100 (OLG) (NSN) (W.D. Texas, San\rAntonio Div.), discussed below.  \r\rThe Commission also announced that Younts simultaneously\rconsented to an Order entering final judgment against him in SEC\rv. Younts, et al.  That Order permanently enjoins him from\rviolations of the antifraud, issuer reporting, registration, and\rbooks and records provisions of the federal securities laws.  The\rOrder further permanently bars Younts from serving as an officer\ror director of any issuer required to file reports with the\rCommission, pursuant to Section 21(d)(2) of the Exchange Act [15\rU.S.C. \x15 78u(d)(2)], and imposes $400,000 in civil penalties and\r$781,000 in disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, with payment of\r$581,000 in disgorgement being waived based on Younts\\rdemonstrated inability to pay.  \r\rThe Commission\s Complaint in SEC v. Younts, et al. alleged that\rYounts, former president, chairman and chief executive officer of\rLittlefield, Adams & Company (LFA) violated the antifraud,\rcorporate reporting and registration requirements of the federal\rsecurities laws by, among other things, misappropriating more\rthan $1.15 million from LFA and engaging in various schemes and\rfraudulent accounting practices designed to inflate artificially \rLFA\s income and otherwise manipulate LFA\s stock price.

The\rfirst complaint alleged that, from in or before February 1986\rthrough February 1996, Helliwell and the Helliwell Group raised\rat least $2.58 million from at least thirty investors for whom\rthey were providing various financial services.  However,\rHelliwell, Georgia Helliwell and the Helliwell Group\rmisappropriated most of the investors\ funds, utilizing the money\rfor personal and business expenses, including the purchase of\rautomobiles and artwork.

The proposed amended Complaint also adds additional\rclaims against defendants SGA Goldstar Research, Inc., Theodore\rMelcher, Shannon B. Terry, Alpha Securities Ltd. and Dunbar\rHoldings, Ltd. (collectively the Goldstar defendants).  \r\r     The Commission has previously alleged that the Goldstar\rdefendants were bribed with stock to recommend SOE to subscribers\rto the SGA Goldstar Whisper Stock report, a tout sheet that they\rdisseminated over the internet and otherwise.  The Commission\ralso alleged that they took advantage of the inflated market for\rSOE stock that they had created by dumping their own stock on\runwitting investors.  In the proposed amended Complaint, the\rCommission alleges that from in or around 1991 and continuing\rthrough the present, the Goldstar defendants engaged in a\rsystematic practice of publishing  promotional coverage for other\rissuers in exchange for compensation.  The proposed amended\rComplaint alleges that the Goldstar defendants failed to disclose\reither their compensation or whether they were selling their own\rshares while they were recommending that subscribers to their\rnewsletter invest.

In addition,\rBradstreet was ordered to pay restitution of $2.3 million, and\rBradstreet and Campbell were each sentenced to two years\rprobation upon release from prison and to pay a special\rassessment of $250.  Bradstreet and Campbell, former members of\rsenior management of Kurzweil Applied Intelligence, Inc.\r(Kurzweil), were found guilty by a jury in May 1996 of five\rcounts of conspiracy, securities fraud and falsification of\rcorporate books and records in violation of Sections 10(b) and\r13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and 18\rU.S.C. \x15\x15 2 and 371.\r\r     On July 26, 1995, simultaneously with the U.S. Attorney\s\rannouncement of the indictment of Bradstreet and Campbell, the\rCommission filed a complaint in the U.

The Complaint also\rsought an order requiring that all defendants pay appropriate\rcivil money penalties.\r\r     The Complaint alleged that, from at least January 1992\rthrough May 1994, the defendants engaged in a fraudulent revenue\rrecognition scheme which inflated Kurzweil\s revenues and\rearnings as reported by the company in financial statements filed\rwith the Commission and disseminated publicly.  The Complaint\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\rfurther alleged that Bradstreet, Kurzweil\s former President and\rCo-Chief Executive Officer, and Campbell, Kurzweil\s former Vice\rPresident of Sales, each offered and sold equity securities in\rKurzweil\s initial public offering, knowing that the company\s\rfinancial statements were materially false and that, in 1993,\rBradstreet received an $80,000 bonus advance based on the then\rexpected financial results of operations for the fiscal year\rended January 31, 1994.  The Complaint alleged that the scheme\raffected the registration statement and periodic reports filed by\rKurzweil containing financial statements for its fiscal year\rended January 31, 1993 and the first three quarters of fiscal\ryear 1994.  \r\r     On September 24, 1996, Defendants Bradstreet, Campbell and\rMurray settled the Commission\s civil action by consenting,\rwithout admitting or denying the allegations of the Complaint, to\rthe entry of a final judgment.  The final judgment enjoins each\rof them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of the\rfederal securities laws and those provisions relating to the\rfalsification of an issuer\s books and records and the making of\rfalse statements to auditors.  The final judgment also bars each\rof them from serving as an officer or director of any public\rcompany, waives disgorgement by Bradstreet and Campbell, and does\rnot assess penalties against Bradstreet, Campbell and Murray,\rbased on their demonstrated inability to pay.

Koeltl of the United States District Court\rof the Southern District of New York granted the Commission\s\rmotion for entry of a final judgment (Final Judgment) against\rdefendant Michael Levine ( Levine ).  The Final Judgment includes\ran injunction against future violations of Section 14(e) of the\rSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 14e-3,\rand orders Levine to pay disgorgement of $73,724.21, prejudgment\rinterest at the rate used by the Internal Revenue Service to\rcalculate interest on tax underpayments (IRS rate) of\r$63,855.87, and a penalty of $221,172.63, the maximum available\ragainst him under the Insider Trading and Securities Fraud\rEnforcement Act of 1988.\r\r     The Final Judgment embodies the relief awarded the\rCommission on partial summary judgment this past July.  In ruling\rin the Commission\s favor, the Court held that Levine, a 48 year\rold resident of Weston, Connecticut, and the owner of MDM Copying\rServices, Inc., an office supply business located in New York,\rNew York, had violated the tender offer antifraud provisions of\rthe federal securities laws by purchasing DeSoto, Inc. ( DeSoto )\rstock.  Levine purchased nearly $450,000 of this stock on\rNovember 9, 1989, the day that Sutton Holding Corp. announced its\rintention to commence a $50 per share tender offer for DeSoto. \rHe sold those shares the next day for a profit of $73,724.21. \rJudge Koeltl, finding that genuine issues of material fact exist,\rdeclined to grant summary judgment on the Commission\s claims\rthat Levine also violated Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and\rRule 14e-3 when he purchased DeSoto stock in October 1989, and\rwhen he communicated material, nonpublic information to David P.\rSchwartz ( Schwartz ) on November 8 or 9, 1989, under\rcircumstances in which it was reasonably foreseeable that\rSchwartz would communicate that information to Edward A. Cantor\r( Cantor ), who then purchased DeSoto stock.  On December 13,\r1996, these claims, as well as the Commission\s claim that Levine\rviolated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 by\rpurchasing DeSoto stock in October and November 1989, were\rdismissed by the Court without prejudice at the Commission\s\rrequest, thus concluding this insider trading action.\r\r     The Court, in its opinion granting the motion for entry of\rthe Final Judgment, rejected Levine\s arguments that he should be\renjoined only from the specific provisions of Section 14(e) and\rRule 14e-3 that he was found to have violated.  The Court also\rrejected Levine\s objection to calculating prejudgment interest\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\rat the IRS rate.\r\r     Cantor, 68, and Schwartz, 32, previously settled the action\ragainst them, without admitting or denying the allegations of the\rCommission s complaint.

(Gitano), Robert Reiss\r(Reiss), formerly Gitano\s executive vice president and Stanley\rA. Greenstein (Greenstein), formerly Gitano\s CFO; and\rfinancial fraud by Greenstein and David Keery (Keery) the\rsenior financial officer reporting to him.  As part of the\rsettlement the defendants have agreed to pay disgorgement,\rprejudgment interest and penalties totalling $1,060,190.80.\r\r     The Commission\s Complaint alleges that in early 1992, Dabah\rand Reiss traded Gitano stock through accounts at foreign banks\rwhile they were in possession of material nonpublic information\rconcerning Gitano\s earnings.  In particular, the Complaint\ralleges that by at least February 16, 1992, Dabah learned that\rGitano\s 1991 losses could be materially greater than analysts\\rpredictions.  The Complaint alleges that between February 20 and\rMarch 12, 1992, Dabah caused the sale of 20,500 shares of Gitano\rcommon stock through an account he owned at a Luxembourg bank and\rother accounts at that bank in the names of other individuals. \rOn March 16 Gitano announced it had lost $71 million in 1991. \rThe Complaint alleges that Reiss purchased 10,000 shares of\rGitano common stock through an account he owned at a Swiss Bank\ron May 4, 1992, the day before Gitano announced favorable first\rquarter earnings of $6 million.  The Complaint further alleges\rthat Dabah, Reiss and Greenstein all sold Gitano stock before\rGitano disclosed on June 16, 1992 that a lender to its Hong Kong\rsubsidiary requested security equal to other lenders as a\rcondition to the continuation of its credit facility.  According\rto the Complaint, Dabah, Reiss and Greenstein knew the lender had\rthreatened to terminate the line of credit when they sold.  The\rComplaint alleges that in addition to trading though foreign\rbanks, Dabah and Reiss concealed their trades by failing to file\rrequired Forms 4 with the Commission.\r\r     According to the Complaint, in a separate incident Keery, at\rGreenstein\s direction, failed to establish a reserve on a timely\rbasis for losses he knew Gitano had incurred on a transaction\rwith Skiva International.  As a result Gitano improperly deferred\rrecognition of $3.3 million in losses.  The Complaint further\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\ralleges that Greenstein directed Keery to falsify Gitano\s\raccounts receivable aging reports to conceal the uncollected\rSkiva receivable from Gitano\s auditors.  The Complaint alleges\rthat, as a result of Greenstein\s and Keery\s falsification of\rGitano\s records, the company\s financial statements filed with\rthe Commission for the second and third quarters of 1991, and for\rthe first quarter of 1992 were materially false, and Gitano\s\rForm 10-K for the year 1991 was also false.   \r  \r     The Complaint alleges that Dabah\s, Reiss\s, and\rGreenstein\s trading violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act\rof 1933 (Securities Act), Sections 10(b) of the Securities\rExchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. \rThe Complaint also alleges that Dabah and Reiss violated Section\r16(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 16a-3 thereunder by failing to\rfile with the Commission Forms 4 disclosing their Gitano\rtransactions.  The Complaint further alleges that Greenstein\s\rand Keery\s falsification of Gitano\s books and records and\rperiodic reports violated Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the\rExchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder.  In\rits Complaint, the Commission seeks a permanent injunction\ragainst future violations of these provisions, disgorgement with\rprejudgment interest and civil penalties. \r\r     Simultaneously with the filing of the Complaint, the four\rdefendants, without admitting or denying the allegations of the\rComplaint, consented to the entry of Final Judgments that enjoin\rthem from future violations of the provisions the Complaint\ralleges they violated; require Dabah and Greenstein to disgorge\rlosses illegally avoided as a result of sales of Gitano stock\rwhich, together with prejudgment interest, total $266,236.90 and\r$236,982.44, respectively; require Reiss to disgorge both his\rillegal profits and losses illegally avoided which, together with\rprejudgment interest, total $97,831.47; and order Dabah, Reiss,\rGreenstein, and Keery to pay civil penalties of $186,877.50,\r$79,825, $167,437.50, and $25,000, respectively. \r  \r     The Commission received substantial assistance in its\rinvestigation from foreign authorities. \x0c\x1a"

In its Complaint, the\rCommission alleged that Ferber failed to adequately disclose a\rcontract with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated\r(Merrill Lynch) to three of Lazard\s financial advisory clients\rthat were serviced by Ferber and that selected Merrill Lynch to\rprovide underwriting, interest rate swap or other financial\rservices.

Ferber also agreed\rto pay disgorgement of $553,000, which represents his portion of\rthe financial advisory fees that he received, plus prejudgment\rinterest of $97,000, for a total of $650,000.\r\r     The Complaint alleged that Ferber, on behalf of Lazard,\rnegotiated a lucrative contract with Merrill Lynch, which\rprovided that Lazard and Merrill Lynch would jointly market\rinterest rate swaps and that Lazard would be a consultant to\rMerrill Lynch.  Pursuant to the contract, between September 1990\rand November 1992, Merrill Lynch paid Lazard nearly $5.8 million,\rwhich resulted in a substantial financial benefit to Ferber.\r\r     The Complaint further alleged that the contract with Merrill\rLynch was a material fact that should have been disclosed to\rLazard\s financial advisory clients that were serviced by Ferber\rand were considering the selection of Merrill Lynch as a provider\rof financial services - the Massachusetts Water Resources\rAuthority (MWRA), the District of Columbia (the District) and\rthe United States Postal Service (USPS).  The contract created\rat least a potential conflict of interest for Ferber in that it\rgave rise to a significant risk that Ferber would not provide\rimpartial advice to the financial advisory clients that were\rconsidering the selection of Merrill Lynch as a provider of\rfinancial services.  Thus, the contract created the potential for\rFerber to abuse his influence over the financial advisory\rclients.\r\r     The Complaint further alleged that Ferber knowingly or\rrecklessly failed to adequately disclose the contract to the\rMWRA, the District and the USPS, all of which selected Merrill\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\rLynch to provide underwriting, interest rate swap or other\rfinancial services in connection with municipal securities\rofferings and/or the purchase and sale of securities.  As a\rresult, Ferber defrauded these financial advisory clients and the\rpurchasers of their municipal securities in violation of Sections\r10(b) and 15B(c)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Rule\r10b-5 thereunder and rule G-17 of the Municipal Securities\rRulemaking Board.  \r\r     The Commission investigation that led to this action was\rconducted in close mutual cooperation with the Offices of the\rUnited States Attorney for the District of Massachusetts and the\rAttorney General of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\x0c\x1a"

In addition, the Court ordered Olson to\rdisgorge $575,000 plus prejudgment interest of $168,000.  Payment\rof disgorgement was waived and Olson was not ordered to pay a\rcivil penalty, based on his financial inability to pay.  Olson\rconsented to the entry of the order without admitting or denying\rthe allegations in the Complaint.  \r\r     The allegations in the Commission\s Complaint charged Joseph\rPolichemi (Polichemi), Lyle E. Neal (Neal), John D. Lauer, and\rtheir respective companies, Copol, Konex Holding Corp. (Konex),\rand Clifton Capital Investors L.P. (CCI), with violations of\rSection 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the\rExchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder in connection with the\roffer and sale of interests in the Konex Roll Program, an\rinvestment which purportedly was designed to pool investor funds\rto purchase and trade in Prime Bank Instruments.  The\rCommission filed an Amended Complaint which added Olson as a\rdefendant and charged him with violations of the above-mentioned\rantifraud provisions for his role in the Roll Program.  \r\r     The Commission\s Complaint alleged that from January 1993 to\rJuly 1994, Konex raised at least $12.5 million from the Chicago\rHousing Authority (CHA) through the offer and sale of investment\rcontracts in the Roll Program.  In fact, the purported Roll\rProgram was nothing more than a scam to defraud investors.  Thus,\rthe Complaint alleged that Polichemi and Neal, through their\rrespective companies, made false and misleading statements\rregarding the use of CHA proceeds and the risks and returns\rassociated with the investment.  The Complaint further alleged\rthat Lauer, CHA\s Director of Risk Management and Benefits, among\rother things, made false and misleading statements to prospective\rinvestors concerning the rate of return the CHA earned and the\rcircumstances under which the CHA invested in the Roll Program.  \r\r     The Amended Complaint alleged that Olson, an attorney, ran\rthe operations of Copol\s London office.  He created and\x0c\r==========================================START OF PAGE 2======\r\rinstituted the Roll Program with Polichemi and prepared and\rdisseminated to Neal and others the procedures he expected to be\rused to carry out the scheme.  He also misappropriated investor\rfunds for his benefit and for the benefit of his partners in the\rscheme.  In the process, Olson made false and misleading\rstatements to others concerning the existence and legitimacy of\rthe Roll Program, the use of investor proceeds and the returns\rand risks of investing in the Roll Program with the knowledge and\rintent that such statements be disseminated to investors.  \r\r     On June 21, 1994, Judge Andersen entered an order\rtemporarily restraining and enjoining the defendants from future\rviolations of the federal securities laws and, among other\rthings, froze their assets.

The action remains\rpending to determine the appropriate amount of disgorgement and\rcivil penalties to be assessed against Polichemi, Copol, Neal and\rKonex and to collect and distribute disgorged funds to investors.\r\r     In a related criminal action, On October 22, 1996, the\rHonorable William T.
