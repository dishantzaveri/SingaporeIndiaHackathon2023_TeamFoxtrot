Stern and Online-Registries, Inc. (d/b/a Online Medical Registries) (OMR) and relief defendant Michele Ritter.  The court entered final judgment by consent against Stern on December 5, 2012 and entered a stipulation of dismissal of the claims against the relief defendant on December 27, 2012.  The court previously had entered a final judgment by default against OMR on September 25, 2012., The Commissions complaint alleged that Stern and OMR made false and misleading statements to investors in OMR, a web-based company founded and controlled by Stern, in connection with investors purchase of stock in OMR.  The misrepresentations generally related to OMRs business ventures, the status of its technology, its number of customers, and Sterns personal background, consisting of disbarment from the practice of law and a prior criminal conviction in federal district court in Massachusetts relating to financial wrongdoing.  Based upon these and other allegations, including the misuse of investor funds, the Commission obtained a temporary restraining order and asset freeze on October 20, 2010, and a stipulated preliminary injunction on February 28, 2011 against Stern and OMR.  On April 3, 2012, the court held Stern in contempt for violations of the preliminary injunction., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, Stern agreed to the entry of a final judgment that: (i) permanently enjoins him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; (ii) holds him liable for disgorgement of $197,875, representing amounts received as a result of the conduct alleged in the Commissions complaint, together with prejudgment interest thereon in the amount of $27,800.71, for a total of $225,675.71; and (iii) waives the payment of disgorgement and prejudgment interest and does not impose a civil penalty based upon the representations in Sterns sworn statement of financial condition.  The final judgment by default entered against OMR (i) enjoins OMR from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and (ii) orders OMR to pay disgorgement of $197,875 and prejudgment interest in the amount of $24,997.22.

Carlton highlighted test results produced by two small labs that used unconventional methods to test the ore for gold, but he withheld from investors other tests conducted by different firms that suggested the Nekekim mine site held little if any gold.  The small labs reliability also had been called into doubt by geologists and a government study.  Yet as Nekekim failed to produce any mining revenue, Carlton gave shareholders false hope that the company was close to perfecting the custom method it supposedly needed to extract gold from its special ore., Carlton agreed to settle the SECs charges., According to the SECs complaint filed in federal court in Fresno, Calif., Nekekim succeeded in attracting investors from 2001 to 2011 in such U.S. states as California, Florida, and New Jersey as well as foreign countries including Canada, Australia, and Singapore.  Carlton falsely represented to investors that a physicist who in reality had no scientific training helped develop a confidential gold extraction technique licensed by Nekekim.  Carlton also promoted a series of other supposedly promising extraction methods in frequent reports to shareholders.  In one newsletter, he touted: A NEW GOLD RECOVERY PROCESS IS SUCCESSFUL.  As each of these methods actually failed, Carltons reports grossly overstated Nekekims progress toward profitability while prompting shareholders to invest more money in the company., Carlton, who lives in Clovis, Calif., agreed to a judgment requiring him to pay a $50,000 penalty and prohibiting him from selling securities for Nekekim or managing the company.  He also will be prohibited from further violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Nekekim, based in Madera, Calif., agreed to a judgment prohibiting the same violations and requiring disclosure of these sanctions in any offering of securities for the next three years.  Carlton and Nekekim neither admitted nor denied the SECs allegations., This case was investigated by Thomas Eme and Tracy Davis of the SECs San Francisco office., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2013/comp22585.pdf>SEC Complaint</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2013/lr22585.htm</i><br/>]"

MOSKOWITZ</h3>, <h3>Status of the  Commission’s <em>Spongetech</em> Litigation</h3>, <h3>The Parallel  Criminal Action</h3>]","[The Securities  and Exchange Commission announced that on December 18, 2012 and June 12, 2012,  the Honorable Judge Dora L. Irizarry, United States District Judge for the  Eastern District of New York, entered Judgments against, respectively, Michael  E. Metter (“Metter”), the former Chief Executive Office of Spongetech  Delivery Systems, Inc. (“Spongetech”), and Steven Y. Moskowitz (“Moskowitz”), Spongetech’s former Chief Financial Officer.  The judgments permanently enjoin Metter and Moskowitz from violating antifraud and securities  registration provisions of the federal securities laws, as well as reporting,  recordkeeping, and internal controls provisions.  The Judgments also bar Metter and Moskowitz from serving as an officer or director of a  public company, bar them from engaging in any offering of penny stock, and  order them to pay penalties and disgorgement in amounts to be determined by the  court, upon motion by the Commission.  On  September 20, 2012, the Commission instituted a settled administrative  proceeding suspending Moskowitz from appearing or  practicing before the Commission as an accountant.   , The Commission’s complaint, filed on May 5, 2010, alleged  that Metter, Moskowitz, Spongetech,  and others engaged in a scheme to increase demand illegally for, and profit  from, the unregistered sale of publicly-traded Spongetech  stock by, among other things, “pumping” up demand for the stock through false  public statements about non-existent customers, fictitious sales orders, and  phony revenue.  They also repeatedly and fraudulently understated the  number of Spongetech’s outstanding shares in press  releases and public filings.  The  purpose of flooding the market with false public information was to  fraudulently inflate the price for Spongetech shares  so the defendants and others could then “dump” the shares by illegally selling  them to the public through affiliated entities in unregistered  transactions.  Among other things, the  complaint further alleged that Spongetech, at the  direction of Metter and Moskowitz, filed periodic  reports with the Commission that contained materially false and misleading  statements and materially overstated revenues, created materially false  purchase orders, invoices, and other documents, and failed to ensure that Spongetech maintained accurate books and records or  implemented effective internal controls.   Metter and Moskowitz consented to the entry of  the Judgments without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commission’s complaint.  , The Commission previously  obtained judgments against other defendants in this action.  On  November 10, 2011, the court entered a judgment by consent against Spongetech.  The  judgment imposed full injunctive relief and ordered Spongetech  to pay penalties and disgorgement in amounts to be determined by the  court, upon motion by the Commission.  , On March 6, 2012, the court  entered final judgments against RM Enterprises International, Inc. (“RM  Enterprises”), a Spongetech affiliate, and George Speranza, a stock promoter.   The final judgments imposed full injunctive relief against both, ordered  Speranza to pay penalties, disgorgement, and prejudgment  interest totaling $135,883.40, and barred Speranza  from participating in any penny stock offering.   The court deferred ruling on monetary remedies against RM Enterprises  until the claims against other defendants are resolved. , On March 14, 2011,  the court issued an order granting the SEC’s motion for preliminary injunctions  against six defendants, and granted the SEC’s requests for asset freezes  against Metter, Moskowitz, and RM Enterprises.   An asset freeze was not entered against Spongetech because the company  filed for bankruptcy in July 2010, and has since been controlled by a  court-appointed bankruptcy trustee.  The  asset freezes entered against Metter, Moskowitz, and  RM, as subsequently modified by the court, remain in effect, as does the  preliminary injunction entered against defendant Joel Pensley., On March 27, 2012,  the court granted the Commission’s motion to add BusinessTalkRadio.net, Inc. (“BTR”)  and Blue Star Media Group, Inc. (“Blue Star”) as relief defendants.  The amended complaint alleges that in 2009,  RM Enterprises transferred illicit proceeds from the Spongetech fraud to  satisfy a judgment that had been entered against Metter, these entities, and  others.  , The Commission’s action remains pending against BTR, Blue  Star, and two of Spongetech’s  former attorneys,  Pensley  and Jack Halperin, who are charged with violating the  antifraud provisions by authoring false and misleading opinion letters to  improperly remove the restrictions on trading shares of Spongetech  stock. , On December 19, 2011, in a  separate action, the court entered a Final Judgment permanently enjoining Myron  Weiner from violating the securities registration provisions in connection with  his purchase and sale of Spongetech’s stock, imposing  a one-year penny stock bar, and ordered him to pay disgorgement and penalties  totaling over $1.3 million.  <em>SEC v.

Woodard, Jr., who was the CEO, President and Chairman of the Board at Norfolk, Virginia-based Bank of the Commonwealth and its publicly-traded parent, Commonwealth Bankshares, along with Chief Financial Officer and Secretary Cynthia A. Sabol, a CPA, and Executive Vice President and Commercial Loan Officer Stephen G. Fields understated the banks loan-related losses as well as losses on real estate repossessed by the bank (other real estate owned or OREO)., The SECs complaint alleges that, from in or about November 2008 through August 2010, the consistent message in Commonwealths SEC filings and public statements was that its portfolio of loans, which comprised approximately 94% and 81% of the companys total assets in 2008 and 2009, respectively, was conservatively managed according to strict underwriting standards aimed at keeping Commonwealths reserved losses low during a time of unprecedented economic turmoil.  In reality, internal practice deviated so much from what the investing public was told that, from November 2008 through August 2010, Commonwealth understated its ALLL by approximately 17% to 25% with a corresponding understatement to its reported loss before income taxes for fiscal year 2008 of approximately 64%; understated its OREO in two quarters by approximately 19% to 20%, which resulted in a corresponding understatement of Commonwealths reported loss before income taxes in the first quarter of 2010 of approximately 35%; and underreported its total non-performing loans throughout the entire period by at least 30%., The SECs complaint further alleges that Woodard, as CEO, knew of the true state of Commonwealths loan portfolio, was involved in the activity to hide the deterioration of many of the loans at issue and was responsible for the misleading public statements and in particular those in earnings releases.  Sabol, as CFO, knew of the activity to mask the problems with the companys loan portfolio and the corresponding effect these masking practices had on the banks financial statements and disclosures, yet signed the disclosures and certified to the investing public that they were accurate.  Fields oversaw the banks largest portfolio of construction and development loans and was involved in the masking practices., The SECs complaint charges Woodard and Sabol with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder, and aiding and abetting violations of Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13 thereunder.

The SEC’s complaint alleged that over nearly seven years, Kapur and ThinkStrategy engaged in a pattern of deceptive conduct designed to bolster their track record, size, and credentials. In particular, Kapur and ThinkStrategy materially overstated the performance of their ThinkStrategy Capital Fund, giving investors the false impression that the fund’s returns were consistently positive and minimally volatile. The complaint also alleged that Kapur and ThinkStrategy repeatedly inflated the firm’s assets, exaggerated the firm’s longevity and performance history, and misrepresented the size and credentials of ThinkStrategy’s management team.  , With respect to a second hedge fund they managed, the TS Multi-Strategy Fund, the complaint alleged that Kapur and ThinkStrategy misstated the scope and quality of due diligence checks on certain managers and funds selected for inclusion in the fund-of-funds’ portfolio.  As a result, the TS Multi-Strategy Fund made investments in certain hedge funds that were later revealed to be Ponzi schemes or other serious frauds, including Bayou Superfund, Valhalla/Victory Funds, and Finvest Primer Fund.  , The Commission charged Kapur and ThinkStrategy with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.

(Volt or the Company), a company located in New York, New York.  , In its complaint against Jack J. Egan, Jr. Volt’s former Chief Financial Officer, the Commission alleges that Egan participated in a scheme to materially overstate revenue.  For Volt’s fourth quarter and fiscal year ended October 28, 2007, Egan signed and filed financial statements reporting $7.55 million of revenue that had not been earned and was not recognizable under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.   The $7.55 million of improper revenue caused Volt’s net income for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended October 28, 2007, to be materially overstated.  The complaint further alleges that the scheme relied on fabricated paperwork purporting to be a contract selling software to a customer.   Egan knew that any sale of the software was impossible because Volt intended to lease the same software to the same customer the following year.   Nevertheless, Egan authorized that the $7.55 million in improper revenue be included in the Company’s consolidated income statement for 2007, which were included in Volt’s:  (1) 2007 Form 10-K filed with the Commission on January 11, 2008, as amended by Form 10-K/A filed with the Commission on February 25, 2008; and (2) earnings release on Form 8-K furnished to the Commission on December 20, 2007.  Egan signed the fraudulent 2007 Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings that included the same overstatement of revenue.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Egan mislead Volt’s external auditors and he signed one or more certifications required by Section 302 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act that were false and misleading.  , The Commission’s complaint charges Egan with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”); Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”); and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, 13b2-2, and 13a-14.  The complaint further charges Egan with aiding and abetting violations by the Company.  The Commission seeks that Egan be permanently enjoined, be ordered to pay a civil money penalty, and be prohibited from acting as an officer or director.    , In addition to the complaint against Egan, the Commission filed a settled civil action against Volt and Debra L. Hobbs (“Hobbs”), the former chief financial officer of the Volt subsidiary where the fraud originated.  Without admitting or denying the complaints allegations, Volt agreed to be enjoined from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act , and Sections 10(b),13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-11.  The Company cooperated during the Commission’s investigation and has undertaken significant remediation efforts., Without admitting or denying the complaint’s allegations, Hobbs agreed to be enjoined from violating Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B), and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-11.  The judgment further provides that the Court later will determine issues relating to civil money penalty and other remedies.

In its Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, issued on January 7, 2013, the court concluded that although it was probable that certain of the several Defendants no longer before the Court may indeed have engaged in a manipulative scheme to artificially increase the stock price for Exotics.com, Inc., the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to prove that defendants Chapman, Flanagan, and Ericksteen committed the violations alleged in the complaint., For additional information, see Litigation Release Nos. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr19207.htm>19207</a> (April 28, 2005) [civil injunctive action filed], <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19645.htm>19645</a> (April 7, 2006) [judgment by default against Exotics.com], <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19699.htm>19699</a> (May 15, 2006) [judgment by consent against Barry F.

Martel, a resident of Chelsea, Massachusetts, in a case originally filed by the Commission in June 2012.  The Commission charged Martel, who conducted business under the names Martel Financial Group and MFG Funding, with selling fictitious investment products and using the funds raised for purposes other than making the investments he promised.  The Court froze Martels assets at the time the Commission filed the case.  Among other things, the final judgment recently entered by the Court ordered Martel to pay over $7.2 million in disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties., According to the Commissions complaint, over the course of several years, Martel raised money from investors in Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, New York and Florida by promising to invest their money in certain pass through bonds with favorable interest rates, as well as by promising to make pooled investments in mortgage-related securities or, more recently, Facebooks initial public offering.  The Commissions complaint alleged that Martels bonds and investment pools were fictitious, and instead of investing his clients funds on their behalf as he promised, Martel used the funds for other purposes, including to make payments to earlier investors.  The complaint charged Martel with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws., The final judgment entered by the Court came in response to a Commission motion for default judgment and permanently enjoined Martel from violating:  Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933; and Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  The final judgment also ordered Martel to pay disgorgement in the amount of $3,261,438, representing profits gained as a result of the conduct alleged in the complaint, plus pre-judgment interest on the disgorgement in the amount of $695,806, and a civil penalty in the amount of $3,261,438., On December 12, 2012, Martel pled guilty to criminal charges brought by the United States Attorney for the District of Massachusetts, based on the same conduct.  On January 4, 2013, the Commission instituted related administrative proceedings against Martel to determine what, if any, remedial action is appropriate and in the public interest.  Among the relief that could be imposed in the administrative proceedings is a bar prohibiting Martel from involvement in certain parts of the securities industry., For further information, please see Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22396.htm>22396</a> (June 20, 2012).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2013/lr22591.htm</i><br/>]"

22594,2013,[<h3>SEC OBTAINS SIGNIFICANT RELIEF IN SUMMARY JUDGMENT WIN AGAINST DEFENDANTS CHARGED WITH DEFRAUDING INVESTORS IN FICTITIOUS OFFERINGS</h3>],"[On December 17, 2012, the United States District Court for the Central District of California granted the Securities and Exchange Commissions motion for summary judgment against all defendants and relief defendants in a civil action arising from two prime bank or high yield investment schemes that defrauded investors out of more than $11 million.  The judgment permanently enjoins Francis E. Wilde, Steven E. Woods, Mark A. Gelazela, Bruce H. Haglund, and entities they control, from violations of the antifraud and other securities law provisions.  The judgment also requires the defendants to pay disgorgement and penalties, and bars Wilde and Haglund from acting as officers or directors of any public company.  In addition, the court issued a separate judgment requiring relief defendants IBalance LLC, Maureen Wilde, and Shillelagh Capital Corporation to disgorge illegally-obtained profits., The Commissions complaint, filed on February 24, 2011, alleged that Wilde, through his company Matrix Holdings LLC, orchestrated two fraudulent investment schemes.  The first scheme began in April 2008 when Wilde obtained a U.S. Treasury bond with a market value of nearly $5 million from an investor by making false and misleading promises of outsized returns from what he claimed was a private placement program.  Wilde (through Matrix) then used the bond to secure a line of credit that he drew down to pay personal expenses, to pay investors, creditors and debt holders of his public company, and to make failed attempts to acquire fictitious prime bank instruments or to invest in high yield programs.  Wilde eventually exhausted all of the funds obtained with the investors bond and never produced a return for the investor., The Commission further claimed that, beginning in October 2009, Wilde concocted another fraudulent scheme with Woods and Gelazela in the form of a bank guarantee funding program using the services of Haglund as escrow attorney.  Between October 2009 and mid-March 2010, Woods (through BMW Majestic LLC) and Gelazela (through IDLYC Holdings Trust (IDLYC) and IDLYC Holdings Trust LLC (IDLYC LLC)) signed contracts with 24 investors who sent over $6.3 million to Haglunds trust account.  Wilde never successfully acquired or leased a single legitimate financial instrument and exhausted all $6.3 million of the investors funds, much of which was taken by the defendants in the form of undisclosed fees.   The Commission alleged that Haglund aided the fraud by receiving and sending wires of investors funds in and out of his trust account according to instructions from Wilde, thus allowing Wilde to utilize funds for undisclosed purposes.  Haglund also knowingly made, and Wilde knowingly authorized, Ponzi-like payments to old investors using new investor deposits., The court found that Wilde, Woods, Gelazela, Matrix, BMW Majestic, IDLYC, and IDLYC LLC violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; that Woods and Gelazela also violated Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act; and that Haglund and Wilde aided and abetted the other defendants violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5., The judgment permanently enjoins Wilde, Woods, Gelazela, Matrix, BMW Majestic, IDLYC, and IDLYC LLC from violating Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; Woods and Gelazela from violating Section 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act; and Haglund from violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court ordered Wilde and Matrix to pay, jointly and severally, disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains in the amount of $12,106,810.75 plus pre-judgment interest, for a total of $13,589,505.56.  The court further ordered Wilde and Matrix to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of disgorgement plus prejudgment interest.  In addition, the court ordered Woods, Gelazela, Haglund, BMW Majestic, IDLYC and IDLYC LLC to pay, jointly and severally, disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains in the amount of $6,195,908 plus pre-judgment interest, for a total of $6,744,083.49.  The courts order also required Woods, Gelazela, Haglund, BMW Majestic, IDLYC and IDLYC LLC to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of disgorgement plus prejudgment interest.  The judgment also permanently bars Wilde and Haglund from acting as an officer or director of a public company., The court also ordered several relief defendants, all of which are related to defendants, to disgorge a total of $2,153,000 in ill-gotten gains that they received:  , For further information, please see Litigation Release Number <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr21866.htm>21866</a> (February 28, 2011).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2013/lr22594.htm</i><br/>]"

Gilchrist, alleging that he effected the unregistered offer and sale of shares of The Alternative Energy Technology Center, Inc. and engaged in a stock manipulation scheme in violation of the registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  , The Commission’s complaint alleges that in December 2007, Gilchrist, acting as the president and chairman of Mortgage Xpress, Inc. (subsequently renamed The Alternative Energy Technology Center, Inc.), authorized the unregistered offer and sale of six million company shares at a deep discount to himself and two entities he controlled, improperly  maintaining that the offer and sale were exempt from registration under Rule 504 of Regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933.  The complaint alleges that the company could not claim a Rule 504 exemption from registration because it was a development stage company which, at the time, planned to merge with another entity.  The complaint further alleges that the shares issued to the two entities controlled by Gilchrist should have been subject to restriction on resale based on Gilchrist being an affiliate of the company, but were not.  As a result, according to the complaint, the share issuance improperly gave Gilchrist control over at least 94% of the public float.  , The complaint further alleges that from January through March 2008, Gilchrist effected 25 wash trades in company securities through brokerage accounts he controlled and, in March 2008, arranged for promoters to tout the company.  Gilchrist allegedly thereby drove the per share price from $1.00 per share immediately after the reverse stock split on January 18, 2008 to $3.75 per share on April 1, 2008, the day before the Commission suspended trading in the stock.  During this time period, Gilchrist made unregistered sales of 229,661 shares, resulting in illicit proceeds of $692,146.38., Based on the facts alleged, the Commission charged Gilchrist with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder.

The SEC’s complaint, filed April 11, 2012, alleges that AutoChina, a company based in the People’s Republic of China, two Virgin Island companies, and nine individuals residing in China fraudulently traded AutoChina’s stock to boost its daily trading volume.   , Determining that “[t]he proper question is not just where the defendants acted, but whether the defendants knew or had reason to know that the misleading manipulation would be communicated to and relied upon by market participants within the forum,” the Court found that the defendants’ trading scheme, as alleged by the SEC, had a significant relationship to Massachusetts, and therefore, denied AutoChina’s motion to dismiss.  In the alternative, AutoChina also moved to transfer the case to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, which the Court also denied.     , According to the SEC’s complaint, the defendants and others deposited more than $60 million into U.S.-based brokerage accounts and engaged in hundreds of fraudulent trades over the next three months through these accounts and accounts with a Hong Kong-based broker-dealer. The fraudulent trades included matched orders, where one account sold shares to another account at the same time and for the same price, and wash trades, which resulted in no change of beneficial ownership of the shares. According to the complaint, AutoChina and the other defendants engaged in the scheme after lenders offered AutoChina unfavorable terms for a stock-backed loan due to low trading volume in its stock., The SEC complaint further alleges that in the three months before the defendants opened the U.S.-based brokerage accounts, the average daily trading volume of AutoChina’s stock was approximately 18,000 shares. From November 1, 2010 through January 31, 2011, the average daily trading volume increased to more than 139,000 shares. On some days, the defendants and related accounts’ trading accounted for as much as 70% of the trading of AutoChina’s stock., According to the SEC’s complaint, several of the defendants are related to AutoChina’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, who at the time of the scheme owned more than 57% of the company. Three of the defendants are siblings of AutoChina’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and another is married to one his siblings., The SEC’s complaint charges AutoChina; Hui Kai Yan; Rui Ge Dong; Victory First Limited; Rainbow Yield Limited; Yong Qi Li; Ai Xi Ji; Ye Wang; Zhong Wen Zhang; Li Xin Ma; Yong Li Li; and Shu Ling Li with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 9(a) and 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.

When negotiating the sale of MBS, Litvak often represented to a customer that Jefferies had paid a particular price for the security, and therefore could sell it to the customer at a slightly higher price.  In order to negotiate a higher sale price to his customers, Litvak misled them into believing that Jefferies had paid a higher price for the MBS than it actually had.  On some occasions, Litvak also pretended to be actively negotiating with an outside party to buy a security that he would then re-sell to his customer.  But none of these negotiations were taking place; instead, Litvak fabricated the existence of the seller and every detail about active negotiations with it.  In fact, as Litvak knew, Jefferies had purchased these bonds days before and already held them in its inventory., The SECs complaint charges Litvak with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, particularly Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.  The complaint seeks a final judgment permanently enjoining Litvak from future violations of the above provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and order him to pay civil penalties., The SECs investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Kerry Dakin, James Goldman, Rachel Hershfang, and Kevin Kelcourse in the Boston Regional Office.  Mr. Goldman is a member of the Structured and New Products Unit.

22603,2013,[<h3>SEC SUES TO HALT HOUSTON-AREA INVESTMENT SCHEME TARGETING LEBANESE AND DRUZE COMMUNITIES</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a day trader in Sugar Land, Texas, with defrauding investors in his supposed high-frequency trading program and providing them falsified brokerage records that drastically overstated assets and hid his massive trading losses., The SEC alleges that Firas Hamdan particularly targeted fellow members of the Houston-area Lebanese and Druze communities, raising more than $6 million over a five-year period from at least 33 investors.  Hamdan told prospective investors that he would pool their investments with his own money and conduct high-frequency trading using a supposed proprietary trading algorithm.  Hamdan promised annual returns of 30 percent and assured investors that his program was safe and proven when in reality it was a dismal failure, generating $1.5 million in losses.  As he failed to deliver the promised profits, Hamdan told investors that his funds were tied up in the Greek debt crisis and the MF Global bankruptcy among other phony excuses., According to the SECs complaint filed in federal court in Houston, Hamdan is well-known in the Lebanese and Druze communities in the Houston area and is a former treasurer of the Houston branch of the American Druze Society.  Hamdan found investors for his trading program by talking with his friends and family in these communities.  As word spread about his purported trading success, he asked existing investors to solicit their friends for investments., The SEC alleges that Hamdan misrepresented to investors that he generated positive returns in 59 of 60 months between 2007 and 2012.  He showed them phony documentation to support his false claims.  For instance, a purported brokerage statement he provided investors for the first quarter of 2010 showed an opening balance of more than $2.3 million with quarterly trading gains of $2.7 million for a closing balance above $5.1 million.  An actual brokerage statement obtained by SEC investigators for Hamdans account during that same period shows the opening balance at just $27,970.76 and the closing balance at $148,210.02, with quarterly trading losses of $7,452.80. , According to the SECs complaint, Hamdan made several other false claims to potential investors.  For instance, he lied about the existence of a cash reserve account that secured their investments.  Hamdan falsely stated that investments were further secured by a $5 million key-man insurance policy.  He also falsely claimed that a well-known hedge-fund manager in the Dallas area had made a million-dollar investment with him and promised to invest more based on Hamdans continuing success.  , The SECs complaint charges Hamdan with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC is seeking various relief including a temporary restraining order, preliminary and permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and financial penalties., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2013/comp-pr2013-13.pdf>SEC Complaint</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2013/lr22603.htm</i><br/>]"

In addition, the Court barred Zigdon from participating in an offering of penny stock.  Zigdon consented to the entry of the final judgment without admitting or denying any of the allegations of the Commissions Complaint., According to the Commissions complaint filed in February of 2011, the defendants coordinated misconduct enabled them to sell CO2 Tech stock at artificially inflated prices, resulting in profits of over $7 million.  In the complaint, the Commission alleged that CO2 Tech Ltd. was a sham company without significant assets or operations whose stock prices were quoted in the Pink Sheets.  According to the complaint, among other things, Zigdon provided the paper work necessary to establish the account that was used to dump the shares of CO2 Tech on to the market.  The complaint also stated that he caused materially false and misleading information about CO2 Tech to be disseminated in press releases and on its website.  In particular, the complaint alleged that CO2 Tech falsely touted business relationships that the company had not formed, including a relationship with the Boeing Company when, in fact, there had been no communications, correspondence or understandings between CO2 Tech and Boeing., For more information about this matter, see Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr21862.htm>21862</a>, WL 576828 (February 18, 2011) and Release No. <a href=/litigation/admin/2011/34-65799.pdf>34-65799</a>, WL 5834265 (November 21, 2011).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2013/lr22604.htm</i><br/>]"

Coleman, former Chief Accounting Officer David W. Schwarz and former Sales Directors Barry J. Graham and Ricky Lynn Stokes, conducted a multi-year scheme to defraud investors who purchased units at Cay Clubs resort locations in Florida and Las Vegas, Nevada.  Clark, Coleman, Graham and Stokes solicited investors directly and through a network of hundreds of sales agents touting the profitability of Cay Clubs investments by promising investors immediate income from a guaranteed 15% return; instant equity in undervalued properties; historic appreciation; development of a network of luxury destination resorts at its nationwide locations; at least $30,000 of unit upgrades; and, a future income stream through the rental program Cay Clubs managed., The SEC alleges that Cay Clubs, through Clark and Schwarz, used a web of entities and bank accounts to conceal a Ponzi scheme that commingled investors funds and used new investor deposits to pay leaseback returns to earlier investors.  Clark and the other executives paid themselves exorbitant salaries and commissions in excess of $30 million and failed to fulfill their promises.   Additionally, Clark and Coleman misappropriated millions of dollars of investor funds to purchase airplanes, boats, and to pay for unrelated business ventures that included investments in precious metals and a liquor distillery that produced Pirates Choice Rum., The SEC further alleges that Cay Clubs representations about investors profitability and instant equity were false because the purported triple-digit returns were the result of undisclosed insider transactions among Cay Clubs and Coleman, Graham, and Stokes to make it appear that the units had enormous rates of appreciation over a short period of time when in fact the transactions were part of an insider flipping scheme.  Cay Clubs continued to solicit new investors despite the fact that the companys financial condition had deteriorated so significantly that it did not have sufficient funds to make guaranteed leaseback or rental payments to investors.  Clark and Coleman left the United States and now reside in the Cayman Islands., The SECs complaint alleges that Clark, Coleman, Graham, and Stokes violated Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Additionally, the SECs complaint alleges that Graham and Stokes violated Section 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act, and that Schwarz violated Section 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5(a) and (c) of the Exchange Act.   The SEC complaint seeks from all defendants disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, injunctive relief to enjoin them from future violations of the federal securities laws, an accounting, civil money penalties from Clark, Coleman and Stokes, and an order to repatriate assets., The SECs investigation was conducted in the Miami Regional Office by Linda S.

Investors were solicited to transfer assets to We The People in exchange for what it called a charitable gift annuity.  The Commission alleges that We The People – through the Olives – lured investors by making various false and misleading statements regarding, among other things, the value of the products sold and the safety and security of the investments.  The complaint also alleges that the Olives failed to disclose to investors indictments and regulatory sanctions issued against them for fraudulently selling similar products.  In addition to the misrepresentations, the Commission alleges that the Olives misappropriated investor funds for personal use.  , The complaint alleges that, based on this conduct, Richard and Susan Olive violated, or aided and abetted the violation of, Sections 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”), and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint also claims that the Olives violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act, and Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act.  The Commission seeks that the Olives be permanently enjoined, and be ordered to pay disgorgement plus pre- and post-judgment interest, and third-tier civil money penalties.  , In addition, the Commission filed settled actions against We The People and William Reeves, We The People’s in-house counsel.

Roth to 151 months (12 years and 7 months) of incarceration followed by supervised release of 3 years and ordered Roth to pay $16,151,964 in restitution to his victims.  Roth, a former investment adviser associated with Comprehensive Capital Management, Inc. (“Comprehensive”), pleaded guilty to one count of mail fraud and one count of money laundering in connection with his misappropriation of over $16 million worth of mutual funds from the accounts of eleven clients between 2004 and 2011.  Roth, 56, of Stonington, Illinois, transferred the shares without the clients’ authorization into an account he controlled, sold them, and used the proceeds to form and support several companies he owned or controlled and to fund his own securities trading.  , The criminal charges arose out of the same facts that were the subject of an emergency civil action that the SEC filed against Roth on March 21, 2011.  On that same day, the Court issued an order freezing Roth’s assets and those of several companies he controlled.  On March 31, 2013, the Court appointed a Receiver over Roth’s assets and those of the companies he controlled.  The SEC’s complaint alleged that Roth worked for Comprehensive, a New Jersey-based registered investment adviser.  The SEC’s complaint alleged that from October 2010 through February 2011, Roth stole more than $6 million worth of mutual fund shares from several deferred compensation plans (“Plans”) for whom he provided investment advice.  Roths theft of client assets was later determined to have been over $16 million.  The SEC alleged that Roth, who worked out of Comprehensive’s office near Urbana, Illinois, secretly caused his victims’ mutual fund shares to be transferred to an account under his control, even though no such transfer had been requested or authorized by the clients.  The SEC alleges that after selling the clients’ shares, Roth funneled the cash proceeds to various accounts and companies under his control or for his benefit.  According to the SEC’s complaint, at the time he was engaging in his scheme, Roth did not tell the clients about the transfers.     , As a result of his conduct, the SEC’s complaint charged Roth with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and Rule 206(4)-2 thereunder.  , For additional information, see Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr21895.htm target=_top>21895</a>  (March 23, 2011). ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2013/lr22609.htm</i><br/>]"

In addition to ordering permanent injunctions from violating antifraud and registration statutes and rule, each defendant was ordered to disgorge, jointly and severally, $5,181,135.82, along with prejudgment interest of $1,171,110.54, and pay a penalty of $5,181,135.82 for a total of $11,533,382.18.  Relief defendants Melissa Morton and the Prophecy Research Institute, the Mortons nonprofit religious organization, were ordered to disgorge $468,281 plus prejudgment interest of $105,847.23, for a total of $574,128.23., On March 4, 2010, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York charging Morton and his corporate shell entities for engaging in a multi-million offering fraud.  According to the Commissions complaint, Morton fraudulently raised more than $5 million from more than 100 investors for his investment group, which he called the Delphi Associates Investment Group (Delphi Investment Group)., Beginning in or around the summer of 2006, the complaint alleged, Morton solicited individuals to invest in one of several companies he and Melissa Morton controlled under the umbrella of the Delphi Investment Group.  According to the Commissions complaint, Morton used his monthly newsletter, his website, his appearances on a nationally syndicated radio show called Coast to Coast AM, and appearances at public events, to promote his alleged psychic expertise in predicting the securities markets, and to solicit investors for the Delphi Investment Group.  During these solicitations, Morton made numerous materially false representations.  For example, Morton falsely told potential investors that he has called all the highs and lows of the stock market, on their exact dates, over a fourteen year period.  Morton further falsely asserted that the alleged profits in the accounts were audited and certified by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PWC) who he claimed certified that the accounts had profited by 117%.  Morton also falsely asserted that the investor funds would be used exclusively for foreign currency investments, and that any other use of the funds would be considered a criminal act.  Morton further falsely claimed that he would use the pooled funds to trade in foreign currencies and distribute pro rata the trading profits among the investors.  In private one-on-one correspondence with potential investors, Morton was even more aggressive in his solicitation.  For example, Morton wrote to a potential investor urging he invest more money in the Delphi Investment Group RIGHT NOW[Because] [o]nce the DOLLAR starts to DROP, which will happen soon, we are set to make a FORTUNE! , However, the complaint alleged, Morton lied to investors about his past successes, and about key aspects of the Delphi Investment Group, including the use of investor funds and the liquidity of the funds.  According to the complaint, Morton did not have the successful track record picking stocks in which he claimed, and that he in fact was simply wrong in many of his securities predictions.  Further, PWC never audited the Delphi Investment Group, let alone certify any profits.  Also, unbeknownst to the investors, instead of investing all of the funds into foreign currency trading firms, the Mortons diverted some of the investor funds, including nearly half a million dollars to themselves through their own shell entities., The defendants never properly answered the allegations in the complaint.  Instead, the Mortons filed dozens of papers with the Court claiming, for instance, that the Commission is a private entity that has no jurisdiction over them, and that the staff attorneys working on the case do not exist., On February 11, 2013, United States District Judge Forrest issued default judgments against all of the defendants and relief defendants.  With the entry of the default judgments, the Commission received full relief requested in its complaint.  The complaint charged each of the defendants with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint further charged that the relief defendants were unjustly enriched by receiving investor funds.  The complaint sought a final judgment permanently restraining and enjoining the defendants from future violations of the above provisions of the federal securities laws., The SECs litigation team was led by Bennett Ellenbogen, Alexander Vasilescu, Todd Brody, Elzbieta Wraga, and Roshonda Ledbetter.  Amelia Cottrell, Stephen Johnson, Jacqueline Fine, and Elizabeth Baier assisted during the investigation., For further information about the case, see Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2010/lr21433.htm>21433</a> (March 4, 2010).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2013/lr22619.htm</i><br/>]"
22621,2013,[<h3>District Court Enters Judgment against New Mexico Ponzi Schemer</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) announced today that on February 14, 2013, the U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico entered a consent judgment against Douglas F. Vaughan (Vaughan), a Ponzi schemer who was convicted of fraud in a related criminal case.  In addition to enjoining Vaughan from violating federal securities antifraud, broker-dealer, and securities offering registration laws, the court ordered Vaughan to disgorge $43,658,821 in ill-gotten gains. The court deemed the disgorgement order to be satisfied by an order of restitution for the same amount and an order of forfeiture in the criminal prosecution., On March 22, 2010, the Commission filed an emergency civil action in the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico charging Vaughan and his companies, The Vaughan Company, Realtors, Inc. (Vaughan Realtors), and Vaughan Capital, LLC (Vaughan Capital) with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Vaughan and Vaughan Realtors were also charged with violations of Section 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act. The complaint alleged that Vaughan used the companies, which he controlled, to operate a Ponzi scheme that relied on new investors funds to pay above-market returns to existing investors. The complaint alleged that Vaughan began selling promissory notes, which were securities, sometime in 1993 and continued offering the notes to investors until at least January 31, 2010. The scheme collapsed when Vaughans obligations to pay returns to investors became greater than his ability to raise new funds., On March 24, 2010, the court entered an order temporarily restraining Vaughan and his companies, prohibiting the destruction or alteration of documents, freezing funds and other assets, providing for expedited discovery, and requiring an accounting of investor funds. Three weeks later, the court entered a preliminary injunction against Vaughan, Vaughan Capital, and Vaughan Realtors that granted all of the relief that the Commission requested., On February 24, 2011, a federal grand jury in New Mexico handed up an indictment charging Vaughan with, among other charges, mail and wire fraud and making false statements to the Commission. Vaughan pleaded guilty and, on September 5, 2012, was sentenced to 12 years in prison, ordered to pay restitution of $43,658,821 under the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act, and directed to forfeit $74,745,724 to the United States., The Commission has also resolved its claims against Vaughan Capital, which is now defunct, and Vaughan Realtors, which no longer has operations and is under the control of an independent bankruptcy trustee. On March 2, 2011, the district court entered a judgment against Vaughan Realtors with the consent of the Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Trustee. On January 7, 2013, the court entered a default judgment against Vaughan Capital. The judgments against Vaughan Realtors and Vaughan Capital permanently enjoin them from violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The  judgment against Vaughan Realtors also enjoins the company from violating the broker-dealer provisions of Section 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act., For further information about the case, see Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2010/lr21459.htm>21459</a> (March 24, 2010).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2013/lr22621.htm</i><br/>]"

Price used the tagline Your Flight to Safety in marketing one of those funds.  However, Price was actually investing in one the riskiest tranches of CMOs on the market, and the investments failed to achieve the returns that Price promised and sometimes even lost money.  Price concealed the actual performance of these risky bonds by providing fake monthly statements to investors that inflated the value of the investments., The SEC further alleges that Price, who regularly co-hosted a radio show in the San Diego area called The Wealth Weekend Hour and recommended that listeners invest in one of his funds, also stole a half-million dollars of fund assets in the form of purported fees, and grossly inflated the assets under his management to misrepresent his prominence as an investment manager as he solicited investors., The SECs complaint charges Price and ABS Manager with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rules 206(4)-8(a) thereunder.  Prices three investment funds (ABS Fund, LLC [Arizona], ABS Fund, LLC [California], and Capital Access, LLC) are named as relief defendants along with his company Cavan Private Equity Holdings LLC and his wifes company Lucky Star Events LLC because they hold cash or other assets acquired from the fund assets., Concurrent with filing the complaint, the SEC also sought a temporary restraining order, asset freeze, receiver, order prohibiting the destruction of documents, and an accounting.  The SEC sought to file the action under seal.  In an Order dated February 11, 2013, United States District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel denied the requests at this time., The SECs investigation was conducted by Morgan B.

The Commissions complaint also alleges that during this period Landan and certain other executives backdated stock option exercises and made fraudulent disclosures concerning Mercurys backlog of sales revenues to manage its reported earnings., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, Landan consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating and/or aiding and abetting violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, as well as the financial reporting, record-keeping, internal controls, false statements to auditors, and proxy provisions of the federal securities laws.  Landan also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of any public company for five years.

Pursuant to Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Landan will also reimburse Mercury, or the parent company that acquired it after the alleged misconduct (Hewlett-Packard Company), $5,064,678 for cash bonuses and profits from the sale of Mercury stock that he received in 2003.  Under the terms of the settlement, Landans Section 304 reimbursement shall be deemed partially satisfied by his prior return to Mercury of $2,817,500 in vested options., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, Smith consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Section 17(a)(2) and (a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933.

Pursuant to Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Smith will also reimburse Mercury or its parent company $2,814,687 for profits received from the sale of Mercury stock in 2003 and a cash bonus received for 2003.  Under the terms of the settlement, all of Smiths disgorgement and all but $250,000 of his Section 304 reimbursement shall be deemed satisfied by his prior repayment to Mercury of $451,200 and his foregoing of his right to exercise vested options with a value of $2,113,487., The settlements are subject to the approval of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California., The Commission previously filed settled charges in this matter against Mercury and three former outside directors of Mercury.  On May 31, 2007, the Commission filed civil fraud charges against Mercury based on the stock option backdating scheme and other fraudulent conduct noted above.  Mercury, which was acquired by Hewlett-Packard Company on Nov. 8, 2006, after the alleged misconduct, settled the matter by agreeing to pay a $28 million penalty and to be permanently enjoined.

22625,2013,[<h3>SEC Charges Connecticut Hedge Fund Managers With Securities Fraud</h3>],"[On February 26, 2013, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut against Connecticut-based hedge fund managers David Bryson and Bart Gutekunst (“Gutekunst”) and their advisory firm, New Stream Capital, LLC, (“New Stream”) for lying to investors about the capital structure and financial condition of their hedge fund.  New Stream was an unregistered investment adviser based in Ridgefield, Connecticut that managed a $750-plus million hedge fund focused on illiquid investments in asset-based lending.  The SEC also charged New Stream Capital (Cayman), Ltd. (“Cayman Adviser”), a Caymanian adviser entity affiliated with New Stream, Richard Pereira (“Pereira”), New Stream’s former CFO, and Tara Bryson, New Stream’s former head of investor relations, for their role in the scheme.  Tara Bryson has agreed to a proposed settlement relating to her conduct in this matter.  , According to the SEC’s complaint, in March 2008, David Bryson and Gutekunst, New Stream’s lead principals and co-owners, decided to revise the fund’s capital structure to placate their largest investor, Gottex Fund Management Ltd. (“Gottex”), by giving Gottex and certain other preferred offshore investors priority over other investors in the event of a liquidation.  Gottex had threatened to redeem its investment in the New Stream hedge fund because a wholesale restructuring of the fund just a few months earlier had created two new feeder funds and -- without Gottex’s knowledge -- granted equal liquidation rights to all investors, thereby eliminating the preferential status previously enjoyed by Gottex.  Gottex’s investment totaled nearly $300 million at the time., The SEC alleges that, even after revising the capital structure to put Gottex ahead of other fund investors, David Bryson and Gutekunst directed New Stream’s marketing department, led by Tara Bryson, to continue to market the fund as if all investors were on the same footing, fraudulently raising nearly $50 million in new investor funds on the basis of these misrepresentations.  The marketing documents failed to disclose the March 2008 revisions to the capital structure to the new investors.  In addition, Pereira, New Stream’s CFO, falsified the hedge fund’s operative financial statements to conceal the March 2008 revisions to the capital structure.  , As further alleged in the complaint, disclosure of the March 2008 changes to the capital structure would have made it far more difficult to continue to raise money through the new feeder funds and would have spurred further redemptions from existing investors in the new feeder funds.  As such, disclosure of the March 2008 changes would have adversely affected the defendants’ own pecuniary interests by, among other things, jeopardizing the increased cash flow from a new, lucrative fee structure that they had implemented in the fall of 2007.  The defendants also misled investors about the increased level of redemptions after Gottex submitted its massive redemption request in March 2008.  When asked by prospective investors about redemption levels, New Stream did not include the Gottex redemption and others that followed.  For example, Gutekunst falsely told one investor in June 2008 that there was nothing remarkable about the level of redemptions that New Stream had received and that there were no liquidity concerns., The SEC further alleges that by the end of September 2008, as the U.S. financial crisis worsened, the New Stream hedge fund was facing $545 million in redemption requests, causing it to suspend further redemptions and cease raising new funds.  After several attempts at restructuring failed, New Stream and affiliated entities filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy petitions in March 2011.  Based on current estimates, the defrauded investors are expected to receive approximately 5 cents on the dollar -- substantially less than half the amount that Gottex and other investors in its preferred class are expected to receive., The SEC’s complaint charges New Stream, David Bryson and Gutekunst with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”) and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.  The Cayman Adviser is charged with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.  The SEC’s complaint charges Pereira and Tara Bryson with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC also contends that David Bryson, Gutekunst and Pereira are each also liable pursuant to Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act as a controlling person for New Stream’s violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and David Bryson and Gutekunst are each further liable pursuant to Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act as a controlling person for the Cayman Adviser’s violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Finally, the SEC charges that David Bryson, Gutekunst, Pereira, and Tara Bryson are each also liable pursuant to Section 20(e) of the Exchange Act for aiding and abetting each other’s violations, and New Stream and the Cayman Adviser’s violations, of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; David Bryson and Gutekunst are each further liable pursuant to Sections 209(d) and 209(f) of the Advisers Act for aiding and abetting each other’s violations, and New Stream’s violations, of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Advisers Act; and, in addition, David Bryson, Gutekunst, Pereira and Tara Bryson are each also liable pursuant to Sections 209(d) and 209(f) of the Advisers Act for aiding and abetting violations of Section 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder by New Stream, the Cayman Adviser, David Bryson and Gutekunst., The complaint seeks a final judgment permanently enjoining the defendants from committing future violations of these provisions, ordering them to disgorge their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposing financial penalties., In offering to settle the SEC’s charges, without admitting or denying the allegations, Tara Bryson consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.

Dynkowski and others engaged in market manipulation schemes involving at least four separate stocks. The complaint alleges that Rosengard violated Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 by acting as a nominee account holder in one of the schemes., As alleged in the complaint, the schemes generally followed the same pattern: Dynkowski and his accomplices agreed to sell large blocks of shares for penny stock companies in exchange for a portion of the proceeds. The shares were put in nominee accounts that Dynkowski and his accomplices controlled. The defendants artificially inflated the market price of the stocks through wash sales, matched orders and other manipulative trading, often timed to coincide with false or misleading press releases, and then sold shares obtained from the issuers and divided the illicit proceeds. , As alleged in the complaint, Dynkowski orchestrated the manipulation scheme involving Xtreme Motorsports of California, Inc. stock in 2007. The complaint alleges that in this scheme Dynkowski and an accomplice engaged in wash sales, matched orders and other manipulative trading. As alleged in the complaint, Rosengard acted as a nominee account holder in the scheme. Specifically, he gave Dynkowski access to a brokerage account for the purpose of selling shares of Xtreme Motorsports stock.  The complaint alleges that this scheme generated approximately $257,646 in illicit profits. , To settle the SEC’s charges, Rosengard consented to a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating Section 5 of the Securities Act; orders disgorgement of $165,646 with prejudgment interest of $21,297; and bars Rosengard from participating in any offering of a penny stock.  No civil penalty was imposed, and part of the disgorgement obligation was waived, in light of Rosengard’s financial condition., The SEC thanks the following agencies for their cooperation and assistance in connection with this matter: the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Delaware; the Delaware State Police; United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Department of Homeland Security, Homeland Security Investigations; and the Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service, Criminal Investigation., For further information, see Litigation Release Nos. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21053.htm>21053</a> (May 21, 2009), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2010/lr21463.htm>21463</a> (March 29, 2010), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22256.htm>22256</a> (Feb. 10, 2012), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22421.htm>22421</a> (July 25, 2012).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2013/lr22626.htm</i><br/>]"

Montano, of Albuquerque, New Mexico, with engaging in a fraudulent scheme to manipulate the market for Falcon Ridge’s common stock.  Falcon Ridge is a New Mexico real estate company, headquartered in Albuquerque.  The United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania separately announced criminal charges involving the same conduct.  , The Commission’s action, filed in federal district court in Philadelphia, alleges that, from at least August through November 2008, Montano, who claimed to control Falcon Ridge’s common stock, arranged with an individual (the “Cooperator”) he believed had connections to corrupt registered representatives to generate purchases of the company’s stock in exchange for cash kickbacks.  In reality, the Cooperator was, at all times, secretly cooperating with the FBI.  The Commission alleges that, in furtherance of the scheme, Montano paid $1,000 to orchestrate the purchase of 625,000 shares of Falcon Ridge common stock by the Cooperator, in part, through a matched trade designed by Montano to ensure that he received proceeds from the purchases.<strong>  </strong>In addition, Montano shared nonpublic news releases and a confidential shareholder list with the Cooperator, and coordinated the release of news with the illegal purchases in the stock., The complaint further alleges that Montano engaged in several telephone conversations with the Cooperator in which Montano described his intent and confirmed his involvement in the manipulation.  Through these activities, Montano created artificial trading activity, injected artificial information into the marketplace, and created a false impression of supply and demand for Falcon Ridge’s stock., The complaint alleges violations of Section 17(a)(1) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder against Falcon Ridge and Montano.  The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, together with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against both defendants, and penny stock and officer and director bars against Montano., The Commission acknowledges and appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in connection with this matter., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2013/comp22630.pdf>SEC Complaint</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2013/lr22630.htm</i><br/>]"

Additionally, the complaint alleges that the primary function of the Defendants scheme was to convince investors to invest in fraudulent pooled investments that purportedly traded in options and futures on the S&amp;P 500 Index and in equities, then the Defendants siphoned off the invested funds for the Defendants own purposes.  The complaint also alleges that, in furtherance of their fraud, Defendants engaged in schemes to defraud investors and made material misrepresentations to investors and others., The Commissions complaint alleges that all of the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of the securities laws in Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.

Thrash, Jr., United States District Judge for the Northern District of Georgia, entered a final judgment on February 26, 2013, permanently enjoining Gerald D. Kegley (Kegley).  The final judgment restrained and enjoined Kegley from future violations of Sections 5(a) and (c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.  The order also restrained and enjoined Kegely from aiding and abetting future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Kegley was ordered to pay disgorgement of $99,940, prejudgment interest of $9,851.93, and a civil penalty of $99,940, for a total of $209,731.92., The Commissions complaint, filed on May 8, 2012, alleged that from at least April 8, 2010 through at least August 20, 2010, the defendants were directly responsible for introducing six individuals, who invested $1.95 million, to the fraudulent scheme.  The complaint alleges that in furtherance of the scheme, the defendants forwarded misrepresentations made by others to investors.  These misrepresentations included:  1) that investors could draw upon bank issued guarantees worth millions of dollars without having to repay the withdrawn funds; and 2) that investor funds would be held in escrow until the bank guarantees were issued.  The complaint alleges that defendants knew or were reckless in not knowing that both of these representations were false because no such bank guarantees existed and investor funds were misappropriated immediately upon receipt., Defendants also misrepresented that they would be paid commissions only once the investor received the bank guarantee.  In fact, defendants were paid commissions relatively soon after the investors transferred the money.  Defendants further told investors that they had previously worked on a successful bank guarantee program.  Defendants, however, had actually reported this purportedly successful bank guarantee program to the Federal Bureau of Investigation because they believed it was a fraud., See also L.R. 22361,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2013/lr22634.htm</i><br/>]"

Hayden of the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey entered a final judgment against defendant Scott I. Kupersmith.  The final judgment imposes on Kupersmith a permanent injunction against future violations of certain antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and orders that his obligation to pay disgorgement of $640,000 and prejudgment interest thereon be deemed satisfied provided that the combined restitution orders in the related criminal federal and state proceedings against him exceeded such amount., In its Complaint, the Commission alleged that Kupersmith orchestrated a “free-riding” scheme of selling stocks before paying for them during 2009 and 2010 that allowed him to reap approximately $640,000 in illicit profits, while causing approximately $2 million in losses to the victim broker-dealers that he used to operate the scheme.  According to the Complaint, Kupersmith interchangeably bought and sold the same quantity of the same stock in different brokerage accounts with the intention of profiting on swings up or down in the stock price.  Unbeknownst to broker-dealers, Kupersmith did not have sufficient securities or cash on hand to cover the trades, and instead used proceeds from stock sales in one brokerage account to pay for the purchase of the same stock in another brokerage account.  The scheme unraveled when Kupersmith failed to deliver shares to settle or cover long sales., The final judgment permanently enjoins Kupersmith from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 10b-21 thereunder.  In addition, the final judgment orders that Kupersmith’s obligation to pay disgorgement of $640,000 and prejudgment interest thereon be deemed satisfied provided that he was ordered to pay restitution in excess of such amount on a combined basis in the parallel criminal proceedings against him.  Kupersmith consented to the entry of the final judgment., On May 29, 2012, Kupersmith pleaded guilty to federal criminal charges for securities fraud in a parallel criminal action before the District Court for the District of New Jersey in <i>United States v. Kupersmith</i>, 2:12-cr-00375 (D.N.J.).  On March 4, 2012, Kupersmith was sentenced to 33 months in prison followed by three years of supervised release and ordered to pay $1,796,151 in restitution., In a related state criminal action, on May 7, 2012, Kupersmith pleaded guilty to criminal charges, including securities fraud under New York penal law, before the Supreme Court of the State of New York for the County of New York in <i>State of New York v.

On June 6, 2011, after the end of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange, International Paper Company announced that it had made a $3.31 billion hostile takeover bid for Temple-Inland, Inc. and had offered $30.60 per share, a 46% premium to Temple-Inland’s closing share price that day of $21.01 a share.  As a result, Temple-Inland stock rose to $30.40 by 4:26 p.m. on June 6, 2011, and opened on June 7, 2011 at $29.97 per share.    , According to the SEC’s complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee, Lackey learned about International Paper Company’s potential acquisition of Temple-Inland during a private conversation with an International Paper Company Executive while attending a charity event on April 30, 2011.  The complaint alleges that between May 2, 2011 and June 1, 2011, based on this material, non-public information, Lackey made multiple purchases of Temple-Inland stock totaling 9,000 shares in two of his brokerage accounts.  The complaint also alleges that on June 7, 2011, Lackey sold all 9,000 shares of Temple-Inland stock for a profit of $56,533.89.

The Commissions complaint, filed April 20, 2012 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that the Hunters were just 16 years old when they began disseminating subscription-based e-mail newsletters through a pair of websites they created to tout stocks selected by a “stock picking robot,” which they described as a highly sophisticated computer trading program that was the product of extensive research and development.  Some investors paid an additional fee for the “home version” of the robot software.  , The Commission’s complaint also alleges that the brothers separately created a third website where they marketed their newsletter subscriber list to penny stock promoters and boasted, “One email to this list of people rockets a stock price.”  The Hunters were in turn paid to send selected penny stock ticker symbols to their subscribers, who were misled to believe that the stock “picks” were the product of the robot.  The Hunters sent out their newsletters near the beginning of the trading day, and the price and volume of the promoted stocks spiked dramatically as newsletter subscribers rushed to purchase shares.  However, the stocks typically fell precipitously shortly thereafter, leaving investors in most cases with shares worth less than they had purchased them for earlier in the day., According to the SEC’s complaint, the Hunters also offered subscribers a downloadable version of the stock picking robot for an additional fee of $97.  Rather than performing the analysis advertised, the software was actually designed to deliver users a stock pick supplied by the brothers., The Commission’s complaint alleges that by virtue of the conduct described above, the Defendants violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws., Under todays announced settlement, the Hunter brothers, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission’s complaint, consented to the entry of a judgment requiring Alex Hunter to pay a $100,000 penalty, requiring Tom Hunter to pay a $75,000 penalty, and enjoining both brothers individually from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. , The Commission acknowledges the assistance of FINRA in this matter., See Also: Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22339.htm>22339</a>, April 20, 2012,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2013/lr22641.htm</i><br/>]"

Brown has raised more than $3 million from investors who were falsely promised high profits for investing in his companies that were purportedly funding commercial and residential rental properties in California and other western states.  Brown and his companies - First Choice Investment and Advanced Corporate Enterprises (ACorp) - instead used investor funds to make Ponzi-like payments to pre-existing investors, and Brown routinely withdrew cash for personal use.  The ACorp website prominently displayed the seals of the SEC and the State of California as well as the NYSE, NASDAQ, and the Better Business Bureau to falsely imply to investors that these investments were endorsed by these organizations.  In reality, the investment offerings were not registered with the SEC under the federal securities laws., According to the SECs complaint unsealed today in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, Brown particularly targeted an elderly investor suffering from a stroke and dementia.  After the investor made a $30,000 initial investment, his daughter advised ACorp to stop contacting her father because she had power of attorney, but Brown nonetheless e-mailed him forms to close his brokerage account and move the money to an IRA account that would then invest in ACorp.  The investors daughter replied to Brown again to remind him that she had power of attorney and he should cease-and-desist from contacting her father.  But ACorp eventually succeeded in circumventing the daughter to get the investors signature as well as an additional $45,000 investment.  The investors daughter requested the return of her fathers money, but it was never returned., The SEC alleges that Brown and First Choice lured investors beginning in January 2011 by falsely promising 10 percent annual returns and a planned initial public offering (IPO) at the end of 2012 that would net investors 150 percent of their original investment.  They touted Browns management experience but failed to disclose to investors that he had twice filed for personal bankruptcy.  Brown also falsely stated that ACorps assets guaranteed the investments and misled investors into believing their money was safe and secure., According to the SECs complaint, the promised IPO and accompanying investment returns never materialized.  Besides making Ponzi-like payments to earlier investors, Brown routinely drains First Choices bank accounts each month.  Therefore, Brown and First Choice have relied on capital infusions from business cash advance providers as lenders of last resort to keep the scheme afloat., The Honorable Audrey B. Collins for the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California granted the SECs request for a temporary restraining order and asset freeze against Brown, ACorp, and First Choice, and appointed Krista Freitag as a temporary receiver over the companies.  A court hearing has been scheduled for March 18, 2013, on the SECs motion for a preliminary injunction., The Commissions complaint alleges that Brown, ACorp, and First Choice violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions, appointment of a permanent receiver, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and financial penalties, against each of them., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2013/comp22642.pdf>SEC Complaint</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2013/lr22642.htm</i><br/>]"

The Commission alleged that he used deceptive practices to evade blocks by mutual fund companies on his market timing trading. In issuing the final judgment, the Honorable Laura Taylor Swain, United States District Court Judge for the Southern District of New York, ordered O’Meally to pay over $763,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty., On December 14, 2011, a federal jury returned a verdict in the Commission’s favor on securities fraud charges against O’Meally, a resident of Bay Shore, New York. O’Meally is a former registered representative of broker-dealer Prudential Securities Inc. The jury found O’Meally liable for violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and/or (3) of the Securities Act of 1933. The verdict against O’Meally followed a month-long trial in Manhattan before the Honorable Judge Swain., The Commission filed its Complaint on August 28, 2006 against four registered representatives formerly employed by Prudential Securities, Inc. The Complaint alleged that, between 2001 and 2003, certain mutual fund companies detected market timing activity by the defendants and attempted to block the defendants and their hedge fund customers from further trading in their funds. The Complaint further alleged that the defendants used fraudulent and deceptive trading practices to conceal their and their customers’ identities to evade these blocks. Cases against the three other defendants had been resolved previously by settlement.

(Fountain Group).  , In its Complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah, the Commission alleges that Wilson raised approximately $11 million from at least 60 investors through the fraudulent and unregistered sale of securities in Fountain Group.  The Complaint alleges that beginning in September 2005, Wilson, through his company Fountain Group, offered and sold securities for the stated purpose of providing funding for real estate development.  Wilson told investors that for a fee of either $80,000 or $150,000, Fountain Group would leverage a bond backed by senior life settlement policies to generate funding in the tens of millions of dollars for each proposed real estate project.  Wilson assured investors their fee would be used to pay expenses to “activate” the funding.  Instead of using investors’ funds as represented, Wilson transferred investor funds to other entities he owned and controlled where the funds were spent on expenses related to those businesses.  In addition, Wilson used investor funds for his own personal purposes.  Wilson was assisted in his solicitation of investors by Ross., The Commission alleges that by engaging in this conduct Wilson and Ross violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Wilson violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

(Tradeshow). , According to the SECs complaint, Canadian stock promoters John Kirk, Benjamin Kirk, Dylan Boyle, James Hinton, and their associates, used false and misleading promotions to pump up trading in the stock of the two microcap companies and made millions when they secretly dumped their own shares.  Microcap companies typically have limited assets and low-priced stock that trades in low volumes. The SEC alleges that the promoters sent investors false and misleading emails about the companies through two websites they controlled, Skymark Research and Emerging Stock Report, and used boiler room sales calls to tout the stocks, falsely claiming that the recommendations were based on independent research by Skymark and Emerging Stock Report., The SEC alleges that San Diego-based attorneys Luis Carrillo and Wade Huettel were central participants in the scheme, who helped the promoters conceal their ownership interests in the companies, drafted misleading public filings, and provided misleading legal opinions.  As part of the scheme, their law firm, Carrillo Huettel LLP, secretly received proceeds of stock sales in the form of a sham loan. , The SECs complaint also alleges that Gibraltar Global Securities, a Bahamian broker-dealer, provided false affidavits and misleading statements that allowed Benjamin Kirk to secretly sell shares of the companies he was promoting.

22648,2013,[<h3>SEC OBTAINS ASSET FREEZE AGAINST MASSACHUSETTS-BASED INVESTMENT ADVISER STEALING MONEY FROM CLIENTS</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced an asset freeze against a Massachusetts-based investment adviser charged with stealing money from clients who were given the false impression they were investing in a hedge fund., In a complaint unsealed today in federal court in Boston, the SEC alleges that Gregg D. Caplitz and Insight Onsite Strategic Management in Wilmington, Mass., raised at least $1.1 million from clients that was used for purposes other than investing in the hedge fund they purported to manage.  Investor money was merely transferred to the firms chief investment officer and other members of her family who spent it on personal expenses.  The firm reported in SEC filings that it has $100 million in assets under management, however the purported hedge fund actually has no assets., U.S. District Judge Mark L. Wolf granted the SECs request for an emergency court order to freeze the assets of Caplitz and his firm as well as others who received investor money and have been named as relief defendants for the purposes of recovering investor funds in their possession. , According to the SECs complaint, Caplitzs scheme began around 2009.  For example, Caplitz convinced one client and his wife to invest $275,000 in the hedge fund that Caplitz claimed would generate them about $1,000 per month in returns.  Caplitz also solicited a 20-year client who after considering his sales pitch decided not to invest in the hedge fund because she considered it too risky of an investment for someone her age. But Caplitz apparently took action to obtain funds from the clients IRA account and wired thousands of dollars to an Insight Onsite Strategic Management bank account.  The client was not aware of the transfers and did not authorize them., The SEC alleges that instead of using investor funds to purchase shares in a hedge fund or to manage or develop a hedge fund, Caplitz transferred control of client money to Rosalind Herman, his friend who works at the firm.  Investor funds also were transferred to her sons Brad and Brian Herman, daughter-in-law Charlene Herman, and a company called Knew Finance Experts.  The Hermans, who all live in Las Vegas, own that company.  The Hermans used investor money to pay legal bills and other personal expenses at gas stations, drugstores, and restaurants., The SEC alleges that as part of his scheme, Caplitz obtained funds from a real estate investment trust (REIT) by falsely representing that a hedge fund he operated was interested in making an investment in that trust.  The public, non-traded REIT gave $135,000 to Caplitz so he could conduct due diligence on the REIT as a precursor to his making a $5 million investment that never materialized.  , The SEC alleges that Caplitz and Insight Onsite Strategic Management violated Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  The Complaint seeks a permanent injunction plus disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a penalty against Caplitz and his firm.  The complaint also names the four Hermans and Knew Finance Experts as relief defendants and seeks disgorgement plus prejudgment interest., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2013/comp-pr2013-43.pdf>SEC Complaint</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2013/lr22648.htm</i><br/>]"

The default judgments entered by the Honorable Mark L. Wolf require the two defendants to pay a total of more than $2.3 million in disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties, and permanently enjoin them both from future violations of the antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws.  The Commissions action against three other defendants remains pending., The Commissions complaint alleged that 211 Ventures purported to offer direct investments in fraudulent and non-existent trading programs, promising high returns and guarantees against loss.  The Court ordered 211 Ventures to pay $1,074,000 in disgorgement, $206,502.91 in prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty in the amount of $650,000.  The Commission alleged that Anderson offered investors fictitious trading programs through an entity called E-Trust, based on gold or precious metals, medium term notes, or other assets, and received investor funds that he used for his personal gain.  The final judgment against Anderson requires him to pay $252,719.53 in disgorgement, $34,574.13 in prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty in the amount of $150,000.

In November 2012, Martel pled guilty to three counts of mail fraud and to wire fraud.  The criminal information filed against Martel alleged that, from 2004 to 2012, he defrauded his investment advisory clients by diverting funds that he received from them for investments for his own personal use rather than investing the funds as he represented that he would., The Commission previously filed a related civil enforcement action against Martel in June 2012.  In January 2013, the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts entered a final judgment of default in that case against Martel, who conducted business under the names Martel Financial Group and MFG Funding.  The final judgment enjoins Martel from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933; and Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  The final judgment also orders Martel to pay $3,957,244 in disgorgement and pre-judgment interest, and a civil penalty in the amount of $3,261,438.  According to the complaint the Commission filed against Martel on June 19, 2012, the former investment adviser raised money from investors in Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, New York, and Florida by promising to invest their money in pass through bonds with favorable interest rates, as well as by promising to make pooled investments in mortgage-related securities and Facebooks initial public offering.   The complaint alleged that Martels bonds and investment pools were fictitious, and instead of investing his clients funds on their behalf as he promised, Martel used the funds for other purposes, including making payments to earlier investors.  A preliminary injunction prohibiting Martel from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and freezing his assets was entered by the district court on June 20, 2012., The Commission has barred Martel from the securities industry.

Rengan Rajaratnam nevertheless profited by more than $100,000 in his personal brokerage account and more than $230,000 for Galleon hedge funds based on trades in Clearwire securities., The SECs complaint charges Rengan Rajaratnam with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.  The complaint seeks a final judgment permanently enjoining Rajaratnam from future violations of these provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and ordering him to pay financial penalties., The SEC has now charged 33 defendants in its Galleon-related enforcement actions, which have exposed widespread and repeated insider trading at numerous hedge funds and by other traders, investment professionals, and corporate insiders located throughout the country.

Bertini then used that information to acquire 8,000 shares of Del Monte stock in his mothers brokerage account and reap illicit profits of approximately $16,035., The SEC alleges that Bertini caused false information to be supplied to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), which requested information about the trades from Del Monte.   In the course of FINRAs investigation, Bertini provided inaccurate information regarding his involvement in the trades to Del Montes counsel.  He told counsel that he learned of his mothers purchases of Del Monte shares after she purchased them and after the acquisition was announced in late November 2010.  Bertini also told counsel that his mother purchased the Del Monte shares after she read articles suggesting that Del Monte was going to be acquired.  In truth, Bertini was responsible for the trading that had occurred in his mothers brokerage account., Without admitting or denying the SECs allegations, Bertini agreed to settle the case against him.  The settlement is pending final approval by the court.

Teeples source was Foundrys chief information officer David Riley, a friend who he had previously given investment advice.  Teeple then caused the San Francisco-based hedge fund advisory firm where he works to buy Foundry shares in large quantities in the days leading up to the public announcement, and the hedge funds managed by the firm reaped millions of dollars in profits when Foundrys stock value increased upon the news.  Teeple also tipped a Denver-based investment professional John Johnson who he befriended through a previous working relationship, and Johnson made illegal trades based on the nonpublic information.  Riley also tipped Teeple in advance of at least two other major announcements by Foundry, and Teeples firm traded on the nonpublic information to make profits or avoid losses., In a separate action, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York announced criminal charges against Teeple, Riley, and Johnson., According to the SECs complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan, Riley tipped Teeple on the morning of July 16 about Brocades impending acquisition of Foundry.  Teeple immediately shared this information with colleagues at his firm as well as Johnson and several others who purchased Foundry stock, often within minutes of communicating with Teeple.  Foundry stock climbed approximately 32 percent after the public announcement of the merger on July 21., The SEC alleges that Riley, who lives in San Jose, Calif., continued to provide material nonpublic information to Teeple about key events throughout the process of Foundrys acquisition by Brocade, which was not fully completed until Dec. 18, 2008.  Teeples firm continued to profitably trade Foundry securities based on this inside information.  For example, Riley tipped Teeple in advance of an October 24 announcement that Foundrys shareholder vote to approve the acquisition would be delayed given recent developments related to the transaction.  Earlier in 2008, Riley tipped Teeple in advance of Foundrys April 11 earnings forecast so Teeples firm could profitably trade in advance of the announcement., The SECs complaint charges Teeple, Riley, and Johnson with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.  The complaint seeks a final judgment ordering them to disgorge their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, ordering them to pay financial penalties, and permanently enjoining them from future violations of these provisions of the federal securities laws.  The complaint also seeks to permanently prohibit Riley from serving as an officer or director of a public company., Since October 2009, the SEC has charged more than 430 individuals and entities with insider trading.

The settlements were approved by the Honorable Harold Baer of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on March 28, 2013., The SEC’s case, borne out of its ongoing investigation into expert networks and the trading activities of hedge funds, began last year with charges against several hedge fund managers and analysts including Jon Horvath, a former analyst at Sigma Capital. Horvath agreed to a settlement in March 2013 in which he admitted liability., In a complaint filed on March 15, 2013 along with the proposed settlements, the SEC charged Sigma Capital in the insider trading scheme and named two affiliated hedge funds - Sigma Capital Associates and S.A.C. Select Fund - as relief defendants that unjustly benefited from Sigma Capital’s violations. S.A.C. Select Fund is affiliated with S.A.C. Capital Advisors., The SEC’s complaint alleged that Horvath provided Sigma Capital portfolio managers with nonpublic details about quarterly earnings at Dell and Nvidia after he learned them through a group of hedge fund analysts with whom he regularly communicated. Based on the confidential information, Sigma Capital traded Dell and Nvidia securities in advance of earnings announcements in 2008 and 2009 for $6.425 million in gains for its hedge fund affiliates., Without admitting or denying the charges, Sigma Capital agreed to pay disgorgement of $6.425 million plus prejudgment interest of $1,094,161.92 and a penalty of $6.425 million. Sigma Capital is also permanently enjoined from future violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws., According to the SEC’s complaint, the key inside information that Horvath obtained about upcoming earnings announcements by Dell and Nvidia often differed significantly from the predictions of market analysts, who only had access to publicly available information. Based on this inside information, Sigma Capital traded Dell and Nvidia securities in advance of four quarterly earnings announcements and reaped more than $5.2 million for its hedge fund Sigma Capital Associates. Horvath’s inside information also enabled S.A.C. Select Fund to execute trades and avoid losses of more than $1 million.

The action alleges that Miller, alone or in concert with others, concocted a scheme to personally profit from placing a series of unauthorized orders to buy a total of more than 1.6 million shares of Apple, Inc. stock on October 25, 2012. , According to the Commissions complaint, after receiving a customer order to purchase 1,625 shares of Apple stock as part of the fraudulent scheme, Miller instead entered a series of orders to purchase a total of 1,625,000 shares of Apple (at a cost of almost $1 billion) on October 25, 2012. Miller planned to share in the customers profit from selling the 1,625,000 shares if Apples stock price increased following Apples expected earnings announcement later that day. Alternatively, if Apples stock price decreased, Miller planned to claim that he inadvertently misinterpreted the size of the customers order, and planned for Rochdale to take responsibility for the unauthorized purchase and suffer the losses. Miller misrepresented to Rochdale and its principals and employees that one of Rochdales customers had authorized the Apple orders and assumed the risk of loss on any resulting trades. Apples stock price decreased after Apples earnings release was issued on October 25, the customer denied buying all but 1,625 Apple shares, and, as Miller planned, Rochdale took responsibility for the unauthorized purchase. Rochdale then sold the Apple stock at an approximately $5.3 million loss, causing the value of Rochdales available liquid assets to fall below limits required by SEC rules applicable to broker-dealers. Rochdale effectively ceased operations shortly thereafter., The Commissions complaint charges Miller with violations of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 and seeks a permanent injunction and a civil monetary penalty.  , The Commissions complaint charges Miller with violations of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 and seeks a permanent injunction and a civil monetary penalty.  , To settle the Commissions charges in the injunctive action and related administrative proceedings that the Commission will separately institute, Miller has consented to be barred from any future association with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, transfer agent, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization, and to be barred from participating in any offering of penny stock. Miller also has consented, subject to court approval, to be enjoined from future violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. The amount of any civil monetary penalty will be determined at a later date by the court upon the SECs motion. , In a parallel criminal proceeding, Miller pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit securities and wire fraud and one count of wire fraud.

Richard Bruce Moore</u>, 13-cv-2514 (HB) (S.D.N.Y.). Moore is a Canadian citizen and a former investment banker at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC). , The SEC alleged in its complaint that Moore purchased American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) of Tomkins plc, a United Kingdom engineering and manufacturing company, ahead of an announcement that the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) and a Canadian private equity firm had approached Tomkins with a takeover offer. According to the complaint, Moores job at CIBC included pitching investment ideas to the CPPIB. During 2010, in the course of his efforts to get CIBC a role in CPPIB transactions, Moore came to learn information that allowed him to conclude that the Board was working on an offer to acquire Tomkins. The complaint further alleges that, on June 28, 2010, Moore misappropriated that information from CIBC by purchasing 51,350 Tomkins ADRs on the New York Stock Exchange. Â On July 19, 2010, the day the offer was announced, the closing price of Tomkins ADRs rose 27 percent, from $13.87 to $17.67 a share. The complaint alleges that, through his purchase of the ADRs, Moore realized illicit gains of more than $163,000., The SECs complaint charged Moore with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, except for his admission of jurisdiction and certain facts agreed to in a parallel settlement with the Ontario Securities Commission, Moore consented to the entry of a proposed final judgment enjoining him from future violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, ordering him to pay $163,293 in disgorgement plus $14,905 in prejudgment interest thereon, and imposing a $163,293 penalty. The settlement is subject to approval by the district court. , Moore has also agreed to an SEC administrative Order that would be based on entry of an injunction against him in the insider trading civil action and would bar him from association with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, or transfer agent, and from participating in any penny stock offering., Moore also purchased a large number of Tomkins common shares on the London Stock Exchange ahead of the acquisition offer announcement.

According to the complaint, Bozora and Redpath failed to make any meaningful disclosure of the default by the Funds sole borrower, the Funds subsequent foreclosure on the borrowers assets, and the resulting loss of any significant investment income to the Fund. The complaint also alleged that Bozora made unsuitable recommendations for investors to purchase a note issued by CS Financing Corporation, an entity at which Bozora served as the President., The final judgments against Bozora, Redpath, CSD, and CSM imposed permanent injunctions prohibiting these Defendants from violating Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933., The final judgments also ordered: i) Bozora to pay disgorgement of $538,529 and prejudgment interest of $76,236, and a $130,000 civil penalty; (ii) Redpath to pay disgorgement of $606,424 and prejudgment interest of $79,545, and a $130,000 civil penalty; (iii) CSD to pay disgorgement of $2,819,015 and prejudgment interest of $408,585, and a $130,000 civil penalty; and (iv) CSM to pay disgorgement of $1,342,581 and prejudgment interest of $166,896, and a $130,000 civil penalty., For further information, please see Litigation Release Number <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2010/lr21657.htm>21657</a> (Sept. 21, 2010).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2013/lr22675.htm</i><br/>]"

The settlement resolves the Commissions civil action against Sharef for  his role in Siemens decade-long bribery scheme to retain a $1 billion  government contract to produce national identity cards for Argentine  citizens. The final judgment, to which  Sharef consented, enjoins him from violating the anti-bribery and related  internal controls provisions of the FCPA and orders him to pay a $275,000 civil  penalty, the second highest penalty assessed against an individual in an FCPA  case., On December 13, 2011, the Commission filed a civil action  against Uriel Sharef and six other defendants, alleging that between 2001 and  2007, Sharef, along with other Siemens executives, paid bribes to senior  government officials in Argentina in connection with a government contract to  provide national identity cards to all Argentine citizens. The officials included two Argentine  presidents and cabinet ministers in two presidential administrations. During this period, Sharef was a member of  Siemens Managing Board, or “Vorstand,” and was the most senior officer charged  in connection with the scheme. Sharef  met with payment intermediaries in the United States and agreed to pay $27  million in bribes to Argentine officials.  Sharef also enlisted subordinates to conceal the payments by  circumventing Siemens internal accounting controls., According to the SECs complaint, approximately $31.3  million of the $100 million in bribes paid were made after March 12, 2001, when  Siemens became a U.S. issuer subject to U.S. securities laws. As a result of  the bribe payments it made, Siemens received an arbitration award in 2007  against the government of Argentina of more than $217 million plus interest for  the contract. In August 2009, after settling bribery charges with the U.S. and  Germany, Siemens waived the arbitration award., The final judgment permanently enjoins Sharef from violating  Sections 30A and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 13b2-1  thereunder, and from aiding and abetting Siemens violations of Exchange Act  Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and13(b)(2)(B).

Often used in residences, tankless water heaters are generally designed to instantly heat water as it passes through pipes rather than in large containers like traditional water heaters. Stebbins and Jones personally told investors that all of the money they raised would be used to develop the tankless water heater venture. Instead, they diverted nearly 30 percent of the funds they raised to pay unrelated business expenses and support their lavish lifestyles, including the lease of luxury automobiles., According to the SECs complaint, Stebbins and Jones solicited investors for the tankless water heater project during a three-year period by offering securities through a variety of companies. Besides misappropriating $1.8 million for themselves, they fraudulently duped certain shareholders in one of the companies, Noble Systems, to swap their private shares for publicly-traded shares in another company, Noble Innovations. This turned out to be nothing more than fraudulently orchestrated stock swap enabling Stebbins and Jones to reap more than $6 million worth of Noble Innovations stock at the expense of these shareholders who were left with almost nothing. Stebbins and Jones also deprived early investors in the water heater venture of more than $1 million of Noble Innovations stock that rightfully belonged to them. Throughout much of this time, Stebbins and Jones traded Noble Innovations stock by using 28 accounts in 18 different names with 14 separate brokers to ultimately profit by more than $557,000. Stebbins and Jones never reported their significant holdings in Noble Innovations as they were required to do under the securities laws., Stebbins and Jones are charged with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b), 13(a), 15(a) and 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 13d-1, 13d-2 and 16a-1 thereunder. The SECs complaint seeks an injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, financial penalties and a penny stock bar against Stebbins and Jones. Â , In a related action, the Commission issued a settled Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making Findings, and Revoking Registration of Securities revoking registration of each class of Noble Innovations, Inc.s securities due to the companys failure to make required periodic filings.

Lee tipped Chen, his longtime college friend with the confidential information, and Chen traded heavily on the basis of the nonpublic details that Lee had a duty to protect. Chen made more than $600,000 in illicit profits, which was a 237 percent return on his initial investment. Bank records reveal a pattern of large cash withdrawals by Lee followed by large cash deposits by Chen, who then used the money for the insider trading., According to the SEC’s complaint, Lee was first privy to information about Leerink’s client Syneron Medical Ltd., which was negotiating an acquisition of Candela Corporation in 2009.  He later learned that Leerink’s client Somanetics Corporation was in the process of being acquired by Covidien plc. in 2010. As Lee collected nonpublic details about each of the deals, he communicated with Chen repeatedly and exchanged dozens of phone calls and text messages. Some of the calls took place from Lee’s office telephone at Leerink. Lee had a duty to preserve the confidentiality of the information that he received in the course of his employment at Leerink., The SEC alleged that in the days leading up to the public announcements of each of these deals, Chen made sizeable purchases of stock and call options in Candela and Somanetics and made unusual trades in the securities of each of these acquisition targets. Chen had never previously bought securities in these companies, yet he suddenly spent a significant portion of his available cash to buy the Candela and Somanetics securities. Chen proceeded to sell most of his Candela and Somanetics holdings once public announcements were made about the transactions. Because Chen made some of his trades in his sister Jennifer Chen’s account, the SEC’s complaint also names her as a relief defendant for the purposes of recovering the illegal profits in her account. , As a result of their conduct, the SEC’s complaint charged Lee and Chen with violations of Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder. The SEC, whose case is still pending, is seeking disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and permanent injunctions against Lee and Chen.  , For additional information, see Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22497.htm>22497</a> (September 27, 2012). ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2013/lr22678.htm</i><br/>]"

Mancuso, a former proprietary trader at the registered broker-dealer Schottenfeld Group, LLC, charging him with using inside information to trade ahead of five separate corporate acquisition announcements in 2007, resulting in illicit profits of approximately $350,000., The SECs complaint alleges that Mancuso used material, nonpublic information he was tipped by his good friend and colleague, Zvi Goffer, also a former proprietary trader at Schottenfeld, to trade ahead of the announced acquisitions of Avaya, Inc., 3Com Corp., Axcan Pharma Inc., Hilton Hotels Corp. and Kronos Inc.  As alleged in the complaint, the inside information Goffer tipped Mancuso concerning the 3Com, Axcan and Avaya acquisitions was misappropriated by two attorneys at the law firm Ropes &amp; Gray, Arthur Cutillo and Brien Santarlas.  The SEC alleges that Cutillo and Santarlas had access to inside information about potential acquisitions involving their firms clients, and that Goffer paid them kickbacks in exchange for the information, using their mutual friend Jason Goldfarb as a conduit.  As alleged in the complaint, Goffer traded on this inside information and tipped the information to Mancuso and others who also traded., The SECs complaint alleges that the inside information Goffer tipped to Mancuso concerning the Hilton and Kronos acquisitions came through Gautham Shankar, another former proprietary trader at Schottenfeld.  As alleged in the complaint, Shankar was tipped the inside information by Thomas Hardin, a managing director at the hedge fund adviser Lanexa Management.  The complaint alleges that Hardin was tipped the information by Roomy Khan, a consultant to a New York-based investment adviser, who had received the inside information from her friend, a credit rating company analyst.  The SEC alleges that Goffer also paid kickbacks in exchange for this information.  As alleged in the complaint, Goffer traded on this inside information and tipped Mancuso and others who also traded., The SECs complaint charges Mancuso with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a final judgment permanently enjoining Mancuso from future violations of these provisions and ordering disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest., The SEC previously charged Goffer, Cutillo, Santarlas, Goldfarb, Shankar, Hardin, and other defendants in connection with this insider trading scheme.

(Iridium).  According to the filing, the SEC is investigating possible market manipulation in connection with transactions in the securities of Chimera Energy Corporation (Chimera), whose shares were traded on the over-the-counter market.  Pursuant to subpoenas issued in December 2012, Farmer and Iridium Capital, Ltd. were obligated to produce documents to the Commission, but have failed to do so.  Accordingly, the SEC filed its Application for an Order Requiring Compliance with Administrative Subpoenas., The SEC’s application explains that beginning in July 2012, Chimera commenced a promotional campaign that caused a dramatic increase in the trading volume and price of its stock.  The SEC is investigating, among other things, whether the claims in Chimera’s press releases are materially false or misleading.  On October 25, 2012, the SEC temporarily suspended trading in the securities of Chimera because of questions concerning the accuracy and adequacy of publicly disseminated information about, among other things, Chimera’s business prospects and agreements., As part of its investigation, the staff in the SEC’s Fort Worth Regional Office issued subpoenas to Farmer and Iridium in December 2012 seeking, among other things, materials related to their transactions in Chimera securities and to Chimera’s business.  According to the SEC’s court papers, Farmer played an integral role in Chimera’s transition from a privately held to a publicly traded company.  And, before Chimera’s securities became available for purchase to the public on the over-the-counter market, entities controlled by Farmer or for which Farmer acted as agent acquired millions of Chimera shares in private transactions, while Iridium, which Farmer also controlled, assisted in effectuating these transactions.  According to the court papers, once Chimera’s promotional campaign was under way, entities controlled by Farmer sold to the public a substantial number of their privately obtained Chimera shares, generating hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of dollars in profits., Pursuant to its application, the SEC is seeking an order from the federal district court compelling Farmer and Iridium to produce all materials responsive to the subpoenas and compelling Farmer to provide sworn testimony.

Zufelt (“Zufelt”). , Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, the Deckers each consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining them from directly or indirectly violating Sections 5, 17(a)(2), and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Â The final judgment against David Decker orders him to pay disgorgement of $141,000 and prejudgment interest of $39,582. The final judgment also orders David Decker to pay a civil penalty of $25,000. The final judgment against Cache Decker orders him to pay disgorgement of $43,000 and prejudgment interest of $9,395 over three years. The Court did not order Cache Decker to pay a civil penalty based on his sworn statement of financial condition. , The Commission filed a complaint on June 23, 2010, alleging that from approximately June 2005 through June 2006, Zufelt operated a Ponzi scheme through his company Zufelt, Inc.

The Complaint alleges that, in connection with these schemes, the Deckers each made materially false and misleading statements to investors about, among other things, the profitability of ZI and SLI, the ability of ZI and SLI to repay investors, the use of investor funds, and the security of the investments. The Order finds that the Deckers acted as unregistered broker-dealers and sold unregistered ZI and SLI securities., The Commissions action against Zufelt and others is still pending., For more information, see <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2010/lr21570.htm>Litigation Release No. 21570</a> (June 25, 2010).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2013/lr22684.htm</i><br/>]"

Peterson and his company USA Real Estate Fund 1 promised investors that they could reap spectacular returns from an upcoming offering in a “secured” product backed by prominent financial firms. Peterson repeatedly told investors that the 2012 JOBS Act would enable him to raise billions of dollars by advertising the offering to the general public, and produce big profits for early investors. He preyed upon investors sense of patriotism by promising to invest the proceeds of the offering in exclusively American businesses, and help assist in Washington States economic recovery. The SEC alleges that Peterson used investors money for personal expenses, and is continuing to solicit investors and may be preparing to tout the offering through investor seminars and public advertising., According to the SECs complaint filed in federal court in Spokane, Peterson sold common stock in USA Real Estate Fund from November 2010 to June 2012 to more than 20 investors in Washington and at least five other states. In e-mails and in periodic e-newsletters that he used to solicit USA Real Estate Fund investors, Peterson claimed that he was preparing to raise billions of dollars in a second offering of additional preferred securities, which he claimed would be “secured” and have 10-year returns of up to 1,300 percent. Peterson claimed that two prominent Wall Street financial firms had partnered with him to bring his offering to market, and that the firms had conducted due diligence on USA Real Estate Fund and were structuring sales agreements and pricing. Peterson promised the early investors they would profit massively once the purported future offering was underway. , Petersons claims were false. He has no guaranteed investment product to offer, the projected returns were either fictitious or based on implausible and unsupported analyses, and he has no affiliation with any financial firm to underwrite his purported future offering, the SEC alleged., The SEC alleges that Peterson used investor money to pay for his rent, food, entertainment, vacations, and a rented Mercedes Benz SUV. He also used investor funds on clothing for friends, luggage for his wife, and expenses at a Las Vegas casino., The SECs complaint charges USA Fund and Peterson with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC seeks disgorgement and financial penalties as well as a preliminary injunction restraining USA Real Estate Fund and Peterson from engaging in conduct that would allow them to continue their scheme, and restraining them from further violations of the securities laws. , David Berman and Tracy Davis of the SECs San Francisco Regional Office investigated the case.

In addition, the court found relief defendants Constantin Resource Group, Inc. (CRG) and Domestic Applications Corp. (DAC) jointly and severally liable with Constantin and Windham for over $760,000 and $532,000, respectively, of disgorgement and pre-judgment interest. , On July 6, 2011, the SEC filed its complaint. The complaint alleged that Windham, Windhams owner and principal Constantin, and former Windham managing director Solomon fraudulently induced investors to provide more than $1.25 million to Windham for securities investments. The complaint alleged that defendants made false claims to the investors about the intended use of the investors funds and about Windhams investment expertise and past returns. Instead of purchasing securities for the investors, the defendants misappropriated the investors funds and then provided false assurances to the investors to cover up their fraud. The SECs complaint charged Windham, Constantin, and Solomon with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also named CRG and DAC, entities Constantin owned and/or controlled, as relief defendants. Â , On July 3, 2012, the SEC moved for summary judgment against each of the defendants and relief defendants on all of the SECs claims. On April 2, 2013, the court issued an opinion granting the SECs motion in its entirety and finding defendants liable for fraud. Based on the undisputed evidence, the court found that [t]he litany of misrepresentations that Solomon and Constantin made to their clients is striking; that Constantin diverted [investors] funds to his own purposes; and that both Solomon and Constantin provided clients with misleading documents to cover up the fraudulent nature of their investment scheme. The court concluded that permanent injunctions, disgorgement, and civil penalties were warranted against each of the defendants and that the relief defendants would be required to disgorge any assets they received through the defendants misconduct. , On April 25, 2013, the court issued a supplemental order finding Windham, Constantin, Solomon, CRG, and DAC collectively liable for more than $2.74 million in disgorgement, pre-judgment interest, and civil penalties. , For further information about the SECs action in <em>SEC v.

Metzler, KND owner J. Jeffrey Kinsell, and KND Vice President Janees L. Williams were responsible for false and misleading statements made in the Airport Authoritys 2008 bond offering, the SEC alleged. It also charged that KND, working through a related party, misused more than $2.7 million of bond proceeds to keep itself afloat. , The SEC alleges the Airport Authority, which is controlled by the City of Victorville, undertook a variety of redevelopment projects, including the construction of four airplane hangars on a former Air Force base. It financed the projects by issuing tax increment bonds, which are solely secured by and repaid from property-tax increases attributable to increases in the assessed value of property in the redevelopment project area. , According to the SECs complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, by April 2008, the Airport Authority was forced to refinance part of the debt incurred to construct the hangars, and other projects, by issuing additional bonds. The principal amount of the new bond issue was partly based on Metzler, Williams, and Kinsell using a $65 million valuation for the airplane hangars even though they knew the county assessor valued the hangars at less than half that amount. The inflated figure allowed the Airport Authority to issue substantially more bonds and raise more money than it otherwise would have. It also meant that investors were given false information about the value of the security available to repay them. , In addition, the SECs investigation found that Kinsell, KND, and another of his companies misappropriated more than $2.7 million in bond proceeds that were supposed to be used to build airplane hangars for the Airport Authority. According to the SECs complaint, the scheme began when Kinsell learned of allegations that the contractor building the hangars had likely diverted bond proceeds for his own personal use. When the contractor was removed, Kinsell stepped in to oversee the hangar project through another company he owned, KND Affiliates, LLC, even though Kinsell had no construction experience. , The SEC alleges that the Airport Authority loaned KND Affiliates more than $60 million in bond proceeds for the hangar project and agreed that as compensation for the project, KND Affiliates would receive a construction management fee of two percent of the remaining cost of construction. However, Kinsell and KND Affiliates took an additional $450,000 in unauthorized fees to oversee the construction and took $2.3 million in fees that the Airport Authority was unaware of and never agreed to, purportedly as compensation to “manage” the hangars. The SEC alleges that Kinsell and KND Affiliates hid these fees from the Airport Authority representatives and from the auditors who reviewed KND Affiliates books and records. , The SECs complaint alleges that the Airport Authority, Kinsell, KND, and KND Affiliates violated the antifraud provisions of U.S. securities laws and that KND violated 15B(c)(1) of the Exchange Act and Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board Rules G-17, G-27 and G-32(a)(iii)(A)(2). The complaint also alleges that Victorville, Metzler, KND, Kinsell, and Williams aided and abetted various violations. The SEC is seeking the return of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, financial penalties, and permanent injunctions against all of the defendants, as well as the return of ill-gotten gains from relief defendant KND Holdings, the parent company of KND. , The SECs investigation was conducted by Robert H. Conrrad and Theresa M. Melson in the Municipal Securities and Public Pensions Unit, and Lorraine B. Echavarria, Todd S. Brilliant, and Dora M. Zaldivar of the Los Angeles Regional Office. Sam S.

Waters of Milton, Massachusetts, a principal of a broker-dealer and investment adviser who is a defendant in a securities fraud action filed by the Commission in May 2012, was sentenced to 17 years in federal prison in a separate criminal action for orchestrating a securities fraud and for defrauding rare coin investment customers.  Waters was also sentenced to three years of supervised release and $9,025,691 in restitution and forfeiture.  The criminal charges were brought by the U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts. Waters guilty plea to securities fraud and other charges occurred on November 29, 2012, and followed an earlier guilty plea by Waters in October 2012 to criminal contempt charges for violating a preliminary injunction order obtained by the Commission in its case.  The Commissions Order barring Waters from the securities industry was issued on December 3, 2012., The Commission filed an emergency enforcement action against Waters on May 1, 2012, alleging that he and two companies under his control, broker-dealer A.L. Waters Capital, LLC and investment adviser Moneta Management, LLC, defrauded investors from at least 2009-2012 by, among other things, misappropriating investor funds and spending it on personal expenses.  On May 3, 2012, the Court entered a preliminary injunction order that, among other things, froze Waters assets and required him to provide an accounting of all his assets to the Commission.   On August 7, 2012, the Commission filed a civil contempt motion against Waters, alleging that he had violated the courts preliminary injunction order by establishing an undisclosed bank account, transferring funds to that account, dissipating assets, and failing to disclose the bank account to the Commission, as required by the Courts order.  On August 9, 2012, the U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts filed a separate criminal contempt action against Waters based on the same allegations.  On October 2, 2012, Waters pleaded guilty to the criminal contempt charges, and the Court ordered him detained pending sentencing., On December 3, 2012, the Commission barred Waters from the securities industry, based on his October 2, 2012 guilty plea to criminal contempt.  The Order bars Waters from association with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, transfer agent, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization, and from participating in any offering of a penny stock, including: acting as a promoter, finder, consultant, agent or other person who engages in activities with a broker, dealer or issuer for purposes of the issuance or trading in any penny stock, or inducing or attempting to induce the purchase or sale of any penny stock., The U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts charged Waters with an array of securities fraud and other violations on October 17, 2012.  On November 29, 2012, Waters pleaded guilty to sixteen counts of securities fraud, mail fraud, money laundering, and obstruction of justice.  The counts of the criminal information to which Waters pleaded guilty alleged that, from at least 2007 through 2012, he used fictitious investment-related partnerships to draw in investors, misappropriate their investment money, and spend the vast majority of it on personal and business expenses and debts.  Waters raised at least $839,000 from at least thirteen investors, including $500,000 from his church in March 2012.  Waters also pleaded guilty to engaging in a criminal scheme to defraud clients of his rare coin business.  Under this scheme, Waters defrauded coin customers out of as much as $7.8 million by selling coins at prices inflated, on average, by 600% and by inducing coin purchasers to return coins to him, on the false representation that he would sell those coins on the customers behalf, when, in fact, he sold most or all of the coins and kept the proceeds for himself.  The criminal information to which Waters pleaded guilty further alleged that he engaged in money laundering through two transactions totaling $77,000.  Finally, Waters pleaded guilty to allegations that he made multiple misrepresentations to Commission staff, including that there were no investors in his investment-related partnerships, in order to conceal the fact that investor money was misappropriated in a fraudulent scheme.  Waters was charged with obstruction of justice related to this conduct., The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the United States Attorneys Office for the District of Massachusetts, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and FINRA in this matter., For further information, see Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22356.htm>22356</a> (May 4, 2012) [Commission emergency enforcement action filed and preliminary injunction issued]; Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22512.htm>22512</a> (October 18, 2012) [criminal charges filed against Waters]; Exchange Act Release No. <a href=/litigation/admin/2012/34-68334.pdf>34-68334</a> (December 3, 2012) [Waters barred from securities industry]; Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22558.htm>22558</a> (December 4, 2012) [Waters pleads guilty to criminal charges].,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2013/lr22692.htm</i><br/>]"

According to the Complaint, however, the Defendants made very few real loans to borrowers, and instead used investors funds largely to make payments to earlier investors and to pay for the Palladino familys substantial personal expenses, including cash withdrawals and hundreds of thousands of dollars spent on gambling excursions, vacations, luxury vehicles, and tuition. , The Commissions Complaint alleges that the Defendants conduct violates Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.

Crane, its former Chief Financial Officer and a U.S. citizen believed to be recently living in southern California, with engaging in a fraudulent scheme during 2010-2011.  The Commission alleges that Subaye and Crane misrepresented the company’s business and operations, deceived the company’s auditors, and misled investors about the company’s true status and revenues.  According to the complaint, Subaye claimed to be operating a cloud computing business but investigations found no evidence of such a business.  Subaye has offered to settle the case, while the action against Crane is unsettled. , The Commission’s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that Subaye began promoting itself during 2010 as a provider of cloud computing services to Chinese businesses.  According to the complaint, Subaye claimed to have over 1,400 sales and marketing employees in 2010, with reported revenues of $39 million that fiscal year and projected revenues of more than $71 million for 2011.  However, by May 2011, according to the complaint, and Subaye was revealed to be a company with no verifiable revenues, few, if any, real customers, and no infrastructure to support its claimed cloud computing business.  The complaint alleges that the business that Subaye had presented to investors and described in filings with the Commission was imaginary and non-existent., The complaint further alleges that Crane signed Subaye’s materially misleading filings with the Commission that contained false statements about Subaye’s revenues, business, number of employees, and number of paying customers.  According to the complaint, Crane also falsified the books, records, and accounts of Subaye and provided false information to Subaye’s outside auditors.  The Commission’s complaint also charges Crane with violating a bar from the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB).  According to the complaint, in January 2011, Crane and his Cambridge, Massachusetts-based accounting firm were sanctioned by the PCAOB, which permanently revoked his firm’s registration and barred him from being associated with a registered accounting firm or being associated with any public company in an accounting or financial management capacity.  The complaint alleges that, in violation of the January 2011 PCAOB order, Crane remained as the CFO of Subaye until March 2011<i>,</i> even after the PCAOB denied his request to remain as Subaye’s CFO for those two months., The complaint alleges that Crane violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder, and Section 105(c)(7)(B) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; and that Crane aided and abetted Subaye’s violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, thereunder.  The Commission is seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  It also seeks an order prohibiting Crane from serving as an officer or director of a public company., The complaint alleges that Subaye violated Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-11 thereunder.  Subaye has agreed to settle this matter, subject to Court approval, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission’s complaint, by consenting to the entry of a final judgment that would permanently enjoin it from future violations of the above law sections., The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Ontario Securities Commission and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board., The Commission’s investigation was conducted by John Kaleba, Matthew Jacques and Rachel Hershfang of the Boston Regional Office.  The Commission’s litigation will be conducted by Ms. Hershfang and Mr. Kaleba., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2013/comp22698.pdf>SEC Complaint</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2013/lr22698.htm</i><br/>]"
22699,2013,"[<h3>SEC Charges RINO, Its CEO, and Its Chairman of the Board with Scheme to Overstate Revenues and Divert Money for Personal Use</h3>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged RINO International Corporation, its Chief Executive Officer, Dejun “David” Zou, and its Chairman of the Board, Jianping “Amy” Qiu with engaging in a scheme to overstate RINO’s revenues and divert proceeds from a securities offering for their personal use in violation of the anti-fraud, reporting, books and records, and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws.  RINO, Zou, and Qiu have agreed to settle the SEC’s claims against them., RINO, a holding company for subsidiaries that manufacture, install, and service equipment for the Chinese steel industry, became a China-based U.S. issuer through a reverse merger in October 2007.  According to the SEC’s complaint, Zou, a Chinese national living in China, and Qiu, a Chinese national living in California, diverted some of the proceeds from an offering of securities by RINO in December 2009.  Zou and Qiu are alleged to have used the proceeds to purchase a $3.5 million family home for personal use.  RINO, Zou, and Qiu initially failed to disclose this diversion, and conflicting information was provided to RINO’s outside auditor about the expenditure.  Zou and Qiu also used offering proceeds to pay for automobiles as well as designer clothing and accessories without recording them as personal expenses or otherwise disclosing them in RINO’s public filings.  , The Commission further alleges that RINO’s SEC filings contained materially false and misleading statements and omissions concerning RINO’s revenue and operations between 2008 and 2010.  According to the complaint, RINO maintained two conflicting sets of financial records – one set of books for filings in China and another set of books for filings in the U.S.  The Chinese books reflected sales of approximately $31 million from the first quarter of 2008 through the first three quarters of 2010.  But the U.S. books that formed the basis for RINO’s SEC filings contained false contracts and portrayed sales revenues of approximately $491 million during that same time period – more than 15 times greater than the revenues recorded in the Chinese books.  The complaint alleges that Zou and Qiu knew or were reckless in not knowing that the U.S. books were supported by false contracts and, nonetheless, signed and certified RINO’s public filings containing false and misleading statements and omissions about RINO’s revenue and operations., The Commission’s complaint, which was filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., charges RINO with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”); Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder.  The SEC’s complaint charges Zou and Qiu with violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; Section 17(a) of the Securities Act; Sections 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder; Exchange Act Rule 13a-14; and aiding and abetting RINO’s violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder. , Without admitting or denying the claims against them, RINO, Zou, and Qiu consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining them from violations of the respective provisions of the Securities Act and Exchange Act.  Zou and Qiu agreed to pay civil penalties of $150,000 and $100,000, respectively.  Zou and Qiu also agreed to pay $3.5 million disgorgement into a related class action settlement.  In addition, Zou and Qiu consented to entry of an order prohibiting them from serving as officers and directors of a public company for a period of ten years.  The proposed settlement is subject to approval by the court., The SEC’s investigation was primarily conducted by Tom Swiers, Sarah Nilson, Kam Lee, and Melissa Hodgman., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2013/comp-pr2013-87.pdf>SEC Complaint</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2013/lr22699.htm</i><br/>]"

Fowler and US Capital instead misappropriated investor funds for personal and business uses. Fowler was actively soliciting additional investors for his scheme, the complaint alleged. , According to the complaint, Fowler targeted foreign-born small business owners with little or no experience in finance or investing. In exchange for investors initial down payment” for a stand-by letter of credit (SBLC) or bank guarantee to be issued by US Capital, Fowler offered to assist in the procurement of commercial loans to companies owned or operated by the investors, and to control the investment of at least a portion of the eventual (fictitious) loan proceeds, sometimes using affiliated traders” and trading platforms” in unspecified instruments,” in order to derive substantial profits. Fowler and US Capital did not use the investor proceeds as represented; rather, shortly after US Capitals bank accounts received investors funds, Fowler spent the funds at restaurants, grocery stores, gas stations, and clothing stores, and also withdrew thousands of dollars through ATM transactions., In its complaint, the Commission alleges that US Capitals website misrepresented that it has assets valued in the Trillions,” and had a triple A” credit rating by Standard and Poors .

22703,2013,[<h3>SEC Charges Chicago-Area Father and Son Conducting Cherry-Picking Scheme At Investment Firm</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) filed a civil injunctive on May 16, 2013, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois relating to a fraudulent cherry-picking scheme conducted by Charles J. Dushek (Dushek Sr.) of Warrenville, Illinois and his son Charles S. Dushek (Dushek Jr.) of Wheaton, Illinois. The Commission charged Dushek Sr., Dushek Jr., and their Lisle, Illinois-based investment advisory firm, Capital Management Associates, Inc. (CMA), with securities fraud, among other violations of the securities laws, for defrauding CMA clients in a cherry picking scheme that garnered the Dusheks nearly $2 million in illicit profits. , The Commission alleges that the Dusheks placed millions of dollars in securities trades without designating in advance whether they were trading personal funds or client funds. They delayed allocating the trades so they could cherry pick winning trades for their personal accounts and dump losing trades on the accounts of unwitting clients at CMA. Meanwhile, CMA misrepresented the firm’s proprietary trading activities to clients, many of whom were senior citizens., According to the Commission’s complaint filed in federal court in Chicago, the scheme lasted from 2008 to 2012 at CMA. The Dusheks made more than 13,500 purchases of securities during that period totaling more than $350 million. The Dusheks typically waited at least one trading day - and often several days - before allocating the trades to client accounts or their personal accounts, and by that time they knew whether the trades were profitable. The Dusheks ultimately kept most of the winning trades and assigned most of the losses to clients. At the time of the trading, they did not keep any written record of whether they were trading client funds or personal funds. , The Dusheks’ extraordinary trading success reflects the breadth of their scheme. For 17 consecutive quarters from 2008 to 2012, the Dusheks reaped positive returns at the time of allocation while their clients suffered negative returns during those same 17 quarters. One of Dushek Sr.’s personal accounts increased in value by almost 25,000 percent from 2008 to 2011 while many of his clients’ accounts decreased in value. , The Commission alleges that the illicit trading profits from his personal accounts were Dushek Sr.’s only source of regular income outside of Social Security. It alleges that he drew no salary or other compensation as president of CMA and relied on profits from the scheme to make mortgage payments on his 6,500 square foot luxury home featuring separate equestrian facilities. He also spent the money on luxury vehicles including a Mercedes Benz SL550, membership in a luxury vacation resort, and vacations abroad. Dushek Jr. is alleged to have used trading profits to pay for a boat slip and vacations to ski resorts and Hawaii., According to the Commission’s complaint, CMA misrepresented its proprietary trading activities to clients in a brochure that is part of the firm’s Form ADV. The brochure falsely claimed that Dushek Sr. maintained “reports” of his proprietary trading activities that he submitted to an associate for review, when in fact he did not maintain such reports nor have any associate review his trades. The brochure further stated, “We do not merge or aggregate any client order with any employee order.” That claim also was false. When the Dusheks placed orders, there were no client orders or employee orders, but instead merely block purchases in CMA’s brokerage accounts that were later allocated to client accounts or personal accounts. , The Commission’s complaint alleges that all of the defendants violated the antifraud provisions in Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, that Dushek Sr. and Dushek Jr. aided and abetted those violations, and that Dushek Sr. is liable for those violations as a control person of CMA. The complaint also alleges that CMA and Dushek Sr. violated the antifraud provisions in Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and that Dushek Sr. and Dushek Jr. aided and abetted those violations. The Commission’s complaint seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and other relief against all defendants. The complaint also names Margaret Dushek as a relief defendant and seeks from her disgorgement of ill-gotten gains and prejudgment interest., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2013/comp-pr2013-90.pdf>SEC Complaint</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2013/lr22703.htm</i><br/>]"

Stilwell in turn shared this nonpublic information with his friend, Dr. Michael C. Moore, and his sister-in-law, Jillian M. Murphy. Moore and Murphy each tipped another person who purchased ACAP shares. The four tippees purchased ACAP stock based on confidential information about the impending sale in the months leading up to a public announcement.

To conceal the trades, Bergin made them through his wife’s brokerage accounts.  The complaint alleges that, as a Cushing trader, Bergin was privy to material, non-public information regarding the size and timing of trades that Cushing intended to make for its clients. According to the complaint, Bergin used this confidential information to personally trade in his wife’s brokerage accounts in the same securities and on the same day he placed Cushing client trades approximately 400 times, reaping illegal profits of at least $1.7 million.  , The SEC’s complaint names Bergin’s wife Jacqueline Zaun as a relief defendant for the purpose of recovering Bergin’s illegal trading profits in her accounts., To halt Bergin’s ongoing scheme, the Commission sought and the District Court granted an emergency court order freezing Bergin and Zaun’s assets., The SEC’s complaint alleges that Bergin violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 as well as Section 17(j) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and Rule 17j-1.

The complaint alleges that Gist invested none of the customer funds, but, instead, used the funds for his personal expenses, for the payment of purported dividends and proceeds from securities sales that he falsely claimed to have purchased on behalf of his customers, and for the operation of a company that he controlled until early 2013 known as ENCAP Technologies, LLC.  The complaint further alleges that Gist regularly created and provided the customers of Gist Kennedy with fictitious account statements., The complaint alleges that Gist used at least $2.2 million of the converted customer funds for the operation of ENCAP Technologies, LLC (“ENCAP”) during the time that he controlled ENCAP, and that the company gave nothing of value in return for the money.

22711,2013,[<h3>SEC Charges Fortune 200 Company for Accounting Deficiencies</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a Bellevue, Wash.-based commercial truck manufacturer and a subsidiary for various accounting deficiencies that clouded their financial reporting to investors in the midst of the financial crisis., The SEC alleges that PACCARs internal accounting controls included ineffective procedures that kept the company from adhering to various accounting rules. PACCAR failed to report the operating results of its aftermarket parts business separately from its truck sales business as required under segment reporting requirements, which are in place to ensure that investors gain the same insight into a company as its executives. PACCAR and its subsidiary also failed to provide complete information about their respective loan and lease portfolios, and PACCAR overstated some loan and lease originations and collections at two foreign subsidiaries in its statement of cash flows., PACCAR and its subsidiary PACCAR Financial Corp. agreed to settle the SECs charges., According to the SECs complaint filed in federal court in Seattle, PACCAR is a Fortune 200 company that designs, manufactures, and distributes trucks and related aftermarket parts that are sold worldwide under the Kenworth, Peterbilt, and DAF nameplates. From 2008 through the third quarter of 2012, PACCAR failed to report the results for its parts business as a separate segment from its truck sales as required under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). For example, PACCARs 2009 annual report showed $68 million in income before taxes for its truck segment. However, PACCAR documents and board materials reviewed by senior executives depicted the trucks business with a $474 million loss and the parts business with $542 million profit to arrive at the net income before taxes of $68 million. By at least 2008, PACCAR should have been reporting aftermarket parts as a separate segment in its SEC filings, but failed to do so until year-end 2012., The SECs complaint further alleges that PACCAR and PACCAR Financial Corp. failed to maintain accurate books and records regarding their impaired loans and leases, causing them to improperly identify and disclose loans and leases for impairment. As a result, they understated the amounts of their impaired receivables and the specific reserve associated with the receivables in footnotes to their respective 2009 Form 10-K filings. PACCAR understated the amount of its impaired receivables by 65 percent and the amount of the specific reserve associated with the receivables by 78 percent. PACCAR Financial Corp. understated the amounts by 64 percent and 37 percent. As a result of these deficiencies, PACCAR also made inaccurate statements to the SECs Division of Corporation Finance regarding its processes for calculating the specific reserves on its impaired receivables., According to the SECs complaint, PACCAR also overstated equal and offsetting amounts in two lines within its statement of cash flows in the second and third quarters of 2009. PACCAR identified these errors during the first quarter of 2010 and reported corrected figures in its second and third quarter filings in 2010., The SECs complaint charges PACCAR with violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder, and charges PACCAR Financial Corp. with violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act. Without admitting or denying the charges, they agreed to the entry of a permanent injunction, and PACCAR agreed to pay a $225,000 penalty. The settlement, which is subject to court approval, takes into account that PACCAR and PACCAR Financial Corp. have implemented a number of remedial measures to enhance their internal accounting controls and improve their compliance with GAAP., The SECs investigation was conducted by Jason Habermeyer and Cary Robnett of the SECs San Francisco Regional Office, and Peter J.

The Commission alleges that Morrow caused DMP to issue approximately $19 million in fraudulent promissory notes and to sell $4.5 million in equity interests. DMP, which purported to be in the business of operating cemeteries, made material misrepresentations and omissions to investors who purchased the promissory notes and equity interests. Most significantly, DMP and Morrow misrepresented that it owned various cemetery properties and that the notes would be secured by those properties in Michigan. In fact, DMP did not own any cemetery properties and none of the notes were secured. Defendants also misrepresented that the proceeds from the notes would be used to acquire and manage cemeteries. In fact, significant amounts of the proceeds were used to fund Morrows personal equity interest in DMP, for high risk trading in securities and to pay interest owed to other DMP note holders. Morrow also falsely told the equity investors that DMP was debt free, while knowing that DMP had incurred substantial obligations to the note holders. , The complaint further alleges that DMP failed to register the note offering with the commission in violation of the registration provisions of the securities laws., The notes were sold by Morrows long-time business associate Angelo Alleca through his investment advisory firm, Summit Capital. Alleca and Summit are the subjects of another lawsuit brought by the Commission charging them with operating a massive Ponzi scheme. See, SEC v. Alleca, et al., Lit. Rel.

22714,2013,[<h3>SEC Charges Penny Stock Company and Ceo for Illegal Stock Offering and Insider Trading</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a microcap company that was ensnared in an SEC trading suspension proactively targeting questionable penny stocks, and also charged the CEO who illicitly profited from selling his shares while investors were unaware of the companys financial struggles., According to the SECs complaint, Laidlaw Energy Group and its CEO Michael B. Bartoszek sold more than two billion shares of Laidlaws common stock in 35 issuances to three commonly controlled purchasers at deep discounts from the market price. Laidlaw did not register this stock offering with the SEC, and no exemptions from registration were applicable. Bartoszek knew that the purchasers were dumping the shares into the market usually within days or weeks of the purchases to make hundreds of thousands of dollars in profits. Laidlaws $1.2 million in proceeds from these transactions was essentially the sole source of funds for the companys operations during most of its existence. Laidlaw, which is based in New York City, purports to be a developer of facilities that generate electricity from wood biomass., The SEC alleges that these transactions diluted the value of shares previously purchased by common investors in the market, who were not told about the huge blocks of cheap stock Laidlaw was selling. Investors also were not aware that Laidlaw relied on these transactions to fund its operations entirely. The <a href=/news/press/2011/2011-120.htm>SEC suspended trading in Laidlaw stock in June 2011</a>., According to the SECs complaint, Bartoszek also violated insider trading laws when he personally sold more than 100 million shares of Laidlaw common stock from December 2009 to June 2011, and he made more than $318,000 in profits. Bartoszek was in possession of material, non-public information while making these trades on the basis of his insider knowledge about Laidlaws poor financial condition, the illegal fire sale of more 80 percent of Laidlaws stock, and adverse developments about Laidlaws business prospects. As a result of the volume of Bartoszeks sales and the lack of current, publicly available information about the company, these sales also violated the registration requirements of the federal securities laws., The SEC further alleges that Laidlaw and Bartoszek made subsequent false statements about the ownership of Laidlaw shares in SEC filings to register certain common stock following the trading suspension. Laidlaw and Bartoszek misled investors to believe that the purchasers of the two billion unregistered shares had acquired them to hold as an investment in the company. The filings falsely represented that these purchasers were the current beneficial owner of more than 80 percent of Laidlaws common stock, an assertion that only could have been true if the purchasers had not sold any of their Laidlaw stock. In fact, as Laidlaw and Bartoszek knew, the purchasers had long ago dumped all of the stock. , The SECs action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging violations by Laidlaw and Bartoszek of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The SEC action also charges Bartoszek with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and secondary liability under Sections 20(a) and 20(e) of the Exchange Act for Laidlaws violation of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5. The complaint seeks, among other things, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, with interest, financial penalties, and injunctive relief, as to both defendants. The SEC also seeks to bar Bartoszek from participating in future penny stock offerings and from serving as public company officers or directors., The SECs investigation has been conducted by Michael Paley, Haimavathi Marlier, and Todd Brody of the New York Regional Office with assistance from the Microcap Fraud Working Group.

The court had previously entered a final judgment by consent against another defendant, Thomas Fisher, Nicors former Chief Executive Officer, in 2010., Pursuant to their consents, without admitting or denying the allegations in the remaining count of the Commissions complaint against them, Halloran agreed to the entry of a final judgment that orders her to pay disgorgement of $177,064.06, together with prejudgment interest thereon in the amount of $114,011.92, for a total of $291,075.98, and Behrens agreed to the entry of a final judgment that orders him to pay disgorgement of $87,980, together with prejudgment interest thereon in the amount of $64,725.95, for a total of $152,705.95., The Commissions complaint alleges that from at least 1999 through 2002, the defendants materially overstated Nicors revenues under the companys performance-based rate (PBR) program and thereby materially overstated Nicors financial performance. The defendants are alleged to have misrepresented Nicors actual performance under the PBR program by, among other things, making or authorizing false and misleading statements about Nicors performance in multiple filings with the Commission. Based on these allegations, the complaint asserts claims against Halloran and Behrens for violating Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act)., The Commission initially alleged that Halloran and Behrens also violated Section 17(a)(1) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and aided and abetted Nicors violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.

The complaint further alleges that an EMA advisory subcommittee, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), began assessing the application and communicating with InterMune. By mid-November 2010, in the course of his employment, Tomlinson allegedly had become privy to material non-public information about the increasing probability that the CHMP would render a positive opinion and faster than had been publicly anticipated by InterMune. The complaint alleges that on November 17, 2010, Tomlinson emailed Sarkesian that, amongst other things, the European regulatory review process appeared to be moving faster and better than anticipated and that this impacted on Company wide strategic decisions. On the basis of that information, Sarkesian allegedly directed the purchase of 400 out-of-the-money call options on InterMune common stock through a brokerage account held in the name of Quorne Limited in advance of a December 17, 2010 announcement that the CHMP had rendered a positive opinion.

In such an all-or nothing payout structure, investors  betting on a stock price increase face two possible outcomes when the contract  expires: they either receive a pre-determined amount of money if the value of  the asset increased over the fixed period, or no money at all if it decreased., The SEC alleges that Banc de Binary Ltd. has been offering  and selling binary options to investors across the U.S. without first  registering the securities as required under the federal securities laws. The company has broadly solicited U.S  customers by advertising through YouTube videos, spam e-mails, and other Internet-based  advertising; and Banc de Binary representatives have communicated with investors  directly by phone, e-mail, and instant messenger chats. Banc de Binary also has been acting as a broker  when offering and selling these securities, but failed to register with the SEC  as a broker as required under U.S. law., According to the SECs complaint against Banc de Binary, the  company began offering and selling binary options to U.S. investors in 2010. Banc de Binary induced investors to create  accounts with the company, deposit money into those accounts, and then purchase  binary options whose underlying assets include stock and stock indices. The SECs complaint alleges that Banc de  Binarys solicitation of U.S. investors has been quite successful and attracted  some customers with very modest means. For  example, one investor had a monthly income of $300 and a net worth of less than  $25,000, and another customer was encouraged to deposit additional funds into  his Banc de Binary trading account even after he informed the Banc de Binary  representative that he was unemployed with less than $1,000 in his checking  account., The SECs complaint seeks disgorgement plus prejudgment  interest, financial penalties, and preliminary and permanent injunctions  against Banc de Binary among other relief.

The SEC also alleged that in the fourth quarter of 2008, China Natural Gas paid $19.6 million to acquire a natural gas company, but did not timely and properly report the transaction in its SEC filings. , To settle the SECs charges, China Natural Gas agreed to pay a penalty of $815,000, and Ji agreed to pay a penalty of $100,000.

22720,2013,[<h3>SEC Charges Top Officials At Investment Adviser in Scheme to Hide Theft from Pension Fund of Detroit Police and Firefighters</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) today charged the leader of a Detroit-based investment adviser for stealing nearly $3.1 million from the pension fund that the firm manages for the citys police officers and firefighters so he could buy two strip malls in California. The SEC charged four other top officials at the firm for helping him try to cover up the theft., The SEC alleges that Chauncey C. Mayfield, who is the founder, president, and CEO of MayfieldGentry Realty Advisors, took the money from the Police and Fire Retirement System of the City of Detroit without obtaining permission. He used it to purchase the shopping properties and title them in the name of a MayfieldGentry affiliate. Other executives at MayfieldGentry gradually became aware that Mayfield had siphoned money away from their biggest client. Rather than come clean about the theft and risk losing the sizeable business the firm received from the pension fund, MayfieldGentry officials instead devised a plan to secretly repay the pension fund by cutting costs at the firm and selling the strip malls. Their plan ultimately failed when MayfieldGentry could not raise enough capital to put the stolen amount back into the pension fund., Mayfield and his firm agreed to settle the charges by paying back the stolen amount., The other MayfieldGentry executives charged in the SECs complaint are chief financial officer Blair D. Ackman, chief operating officer Marsha Bass, chief investment officer W. Emery Matthew, and chief compliance officer and general counsel Alicia M. Diaz., According to the SECs complaint filed in federal court in Detroit, Mayfield took the money from a trust account for the pension fund in 2008. The stolen money could have provided a year of benefits for more than 100 retired police officers, firefighters, and surviving spouses and children. Shortly thereafter, Mayfield told Ackman about the misappropriation, and by May 2011 the other principals at MayfieldGentry were aware of the misdeed. They proceeded to hide the theft by affirmatively misleading the pension fund, The SEC alleges that during a critical budget meeting with fund trustees in 2011, Diaz stressed MayfieldGentrys success in generating a cash return for the pension fund. He stated that the cash we deliver at the end of the day is the ultimate testimony in terms of what we do. Diaz touted a projection that MayfieldGentry would remit $4.96 million to the pension fund in 2012. Diaz never told the pension fund trustees that the cash remittance would be reduced by more than 60 percent once the stolen money was taken into account. At the same meeting, Matthews claimed that MayfieldGentry had achieved a benchmark-beating 6.8 percent return for the pension fund. He didnt explain that the 6.8 percent return would be materially impacted by the $3.1 million theft., According to the SECs complaint, MayfieldGentry and its executives continued to cover up the theft until they finally informed the pension fund on the evening before the <a href=/news/press/2012/2012-88.htm>SEC filed a complaint against Mayfield and his firm</a> in May 2012 for their participation in a pay-to-play scheme involving the former mayor and treasurer of Detroit. Upon learning of the theft, the pension fund promptly terminated its relationship with MayfieldGentry., The SECs complaint alleges that MayfieldGentry and Chauncey  Mayfield violated Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of  1940, and Ackman, Bass, Matthews, and Diaz aided and abetted those violations. Mayfield and his firm agreed to pay  disgorgement in the amount of $3,076,365.88 and be permanently enjoined from  violating Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Advisers Act. They neither admit nor deny the allegations  in the settlement, which is subject to court approval. In a parallel criminal matter, Mayfield is  awaiting sentencing in connection with his guilty plea for participation in the  pay-to-play scheme., The SECs investigation was conducted jointly by the Chicago Regional Office, the Division of Enforcements Asset Management Unit, and the Municipal Securities and Public Pensions Unit. The investigation was conducted by Brian D. Fagel, Eric A. Celauro, Peter K.M. Chan, and John J. Sikora, Jr. The SECs litigation against the remaining four defendants will be led by Timothy S.

In its complaint, the SEC charged nine defendants, including Goffer, a former proprietary trader at the broker-dealer Spectrum Trading, LLC, with insider trading ahead of corporate acquisition announcements., The SECs complaint alleged that Zvi Goffer, Emanuels brother, orchestrated this insider trading scheme in which an attorney with the law firm Ropes &amp; Gray LLP misappropriated from the firm material, nonpublic information concerning potential corporate acquisitions, and tipped the inside information, through another attorney, to Zvi, in exchange for kickbacks. The complaint further alleged that Zvi tipped the information to a number of individuals, including his brother Emanuel. As alleged in the complaint, the tips related to potential acquisitions involving Ropes &amp; Gray clients, including the acquisitions of Alliance Data Systems Corp., Avaya Inc. and 3Com Corp. As alleged in the complaint, Emanuel Goffer traded on the inside information he received from his brother, resulting in illicit profits of more than $1.3 million., To settle the SECs charges, Goffer consented to the entry of a final judgment that: (i) permanently enjoins him from violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and (ii) orders disgorgement plus prejudgment interest of $1,546,021.

Jacobs material non-public information about a pending tender offer for Chattem, Inc. securities. L. Jacobs then traded on the basis of the information he received from his brother., According to the Commissions complaint, on December 21, 2009, Sanofi-Aventis (Sanofi), a French pharmaceutical company, announced its intent to make a tender offer for Chattem, a Tennessee-based distributor of over-the-counter pharmaceutical products, at the price of $93.50 per share (Announcement). Shares of Chattem closed 32.60% higher on the day of the Announcement than the prior trading days close of $69.98 and volume increased more than 3,000% to 10.3 million shares.,  The Commission alleges that A. Jacobs learned of the tender offer in a confidential conversation with his brother-in-law, who was at the time a Chattem executive. The executive, with whom A. Jacobs had been friends since business school and who was married to his wifes sister, requested that A. Jacobs keep their discussion confidential. A. Jacobs agreed to do so.

He coordinated the purchase of iTrackr shares so the stock price could remain high enough for him to effectively promote it at a later date and artificially inflate the price even higher. Bahr arranged for the dissemination of promotional material that overstated the likelihood of iTrackrs success and future profits. , According to the SECs complaint, Bahr connected with the undercover agent in November 2012 and was told that that he represented a group of registered representatives who had trading discretion over certain client accounts. In exchange for a 30 percent kickback, the brokers could arrange to purchase iTrackr stock through their customers accounts and hold the shares for up to a year in order to avoid sales that might decrease iTrackrs stock price. Bahr agreed to pay the kickback and sought the purchase of 10 million iTrackr shares at an average of 25 cents per share for a total of $2.5 million. Bahr agreed not to disclose the kickback to any iTrackr investors., According to the SECs complaint, Bahr agreed to a test run involving the purchase of modest amounts of iTrackr stock on the open market, and Bahr would then pay a small commission. During the first week of December 2012, a total of 135,000 iTrackr shares were purchased, which represented approximately 32 percent of iTrackrs trading volume during that time. Bahr was then informed that the test purchases totaled approximately $14,000, and he owed a $4,000 commission. Bahr paid $3,000 through a wire transfer, and he asked another person to pay the remaining $1,000. , The SECs complaint alleges that Bahr violated Section 17(a)(1) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5. The complaint seeks financial penalties, a penny stock bar, and a permanent injunction against Bahr. , The SECs investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Marc Blau and Sara Kalin of the Los Angeles Regional Office.

22731,2013,[<h3>SEC Charges China-Based Company and CEO in Latest Cross-Border Working Group Case</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a China-based company and the CEO with fraudulently misleading investors about its financial condition by touting cash balances that were millions of dollars higher than actual amounts.  The case is the latest from the SEC’s Cross-Border Working Group that focuses on companies with substantial foreign operations that are publicly traded in the U.S.  The Working Group has enabled the SEC to file fraud cases against more than 65 foreign issuers or executives and deregister the securities of more than 50 companies., The SEC alleges that China MediaExpress, which purports to operate a television advertising network on inter-city and airport express buses in the People’s Republic of China, began falsely reporting significant increases in its business operations, financial condition, and profits almost immediately upon becoming a publicly-traded company through a reverse merger.  In addition to grossly overstating its cash balances, China MediaExpress also falsely stated in public filings and press releases that two multi-national corporations were its advertising clients when, in fact, they were not.  The company’s chairman and CEO Zheng Cheng signed the public filings and attested to their accuracy.  After suspicions of fraud were raised by the company’s external auditor and an internal investigation ensued, Zheng attempted to pay off a senior accountant assigned to the case., According to the SEC’s complaint filed in Washington D.C., China MediaExpress became a publicly-traded company in October 2009 and began materially overstating its cash balances in press releases and SEC filings. For example, its 2009 annual report filed on March 31, 2010, reported $57 million in cash on hand when it actually had a cash balance of merely $141,000.  Later that year on November 9, 2010, China MediaExpress issued a press release boasting a cash balance of $170 million at the end of the third quarter of its fiscal year.  The actual cash balance was just $10 million., According to the SEC’s complaint, after China Media materially misrepresented its financial condition, its stock price tripled to more than $20 per share.  At the same time, China Media received $53 million from a hedge fund pursuant to a sale of the company’s preferred and common stock to that fund.  Zheng was financially incentivized to misrepresent China MediaExpress’ financial condition, as he had agreements to receive stock if the company met certain net income targets.  For instance, when China Media met net income targets for fiscal year 2009, Zheng personally received 600,000 shares of China MediaExpress stock that were worth approximately $6 million at the time., According to the SEC’s complaint, China MediaExpress’ external auditor resigned in March 2011 due to suspicions about fraudulent bank confirmations and statements.  The company’s audit committee then retained a law firm to conduct an internal investigation.  The law firm hired a Hong-Kong forensic accounting firm to assist in obtaining bank statements from China MediaExpress’ banks to verify the publicly reported cash balances.  The evening before a planned visit to the banks by the accounting firm’s team, Zheng called a senior accountant assigned to the team and told him that he had the authorization letters necessary to obtain China MediaExpress’ bank statements.  He asked the accountant to meet him alone to obtain the authorization letters.  During the meeting, Zheng admitted that there would be discrepancies dating back one to two years between China MediaExpress’ reported and actual cash balances. Zheng offered the accountant approximately $1.5 million to “assist with the investigation.”  The accountant refused the offer.  Approximately one month later, the bank statements were obtained, and they showed substantial discrepancies between publicly reported and actual cash balances., The SEC’s complaint charges Zheng and China MediaExpress with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.  The complaint also charges China MediaExpress with violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder, and charges Zheng with violating Exchange Act Rules 13b2-2 and 13a-14, and also with aiding and abetting China Media’s violations of Exchange Act Section 13(a).  The complaint seeks financial penalties, permanent injunctions, disgorgement, and an officer and director bar against Zheng., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2013/comp22731.pdf>SEC Complaint</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2013/lr22731.htm</i><br/>]"

Also charged was Kenneth Gross, of Porter Ranch, California, for selling Your Best Memories stock without being registered as a broker-dealer as required by the federal securities laws., According to the SECs complaint, Your Best Memories purportedly was in the business of raising money from investors on behalf of Moving Pictures, Inc., a Massachusetts-based company in the business of developing products intended to improve memory function in individuals suffering from Alzheimers disease, dementia or memory loss. The complaint alleges that, in total, Your Best Memories raised approximately $1.2 million from more than 50 investors in an offering of securities that was not registered with the SEC as required under the federal securities laws., Specifically, the complaint alleges that investors were told by Hurd and Your Best Memories that their funds would, in large part, fund the development and marketing of Moving Pictures memory enhancing products. According to the complaint however - unbeknownst to investors and contrary to Hurd and Your Best Memories representations - a mere 17% of the funds raised by Your Best Memories was forwarded to Moving Pictures for their intended purposes. The SEC alleges that Hurd funneled at least 37% of investor funds to himself, by transferring money to another of his companies, Smokey Canyon Financial, Inc., or simply by making cash withdrawals of investor funds. The SEC named Smokey Canyon as a relief defendant, alleging that it was unjustly enriched by its receipt of investor funds. The SEC also alleges that Hurd and Your Best Memories further defrauded investors by making Ponzi payments (using investors principal to make payments purporting to be investment returns to other investors) and that Hurd and Your Best Memories misled investors by falsely stating that they had secured FDA approval to sell coconut oil as a treatment for Alzheimers disease, when in fact the FDA never approved such a claim. , The SECs complaint charges Hurd and Your Best Memories with violations of Sections 5(a) and (c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 as well as Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, and charges Hurd with aiding and abetting violations by Your Best Memories of Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act as well as with control person liability under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The complaint also charges Gross with violations of Sections 5(a) and (c) of the Securities Act and Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act.

The denial was the products third, as the FDA denied clearance in 2008 and twice in 2010. Even though the FDA cited concerns about the safety of the device and the quality of the images, Janes told investors that the FDAs issues were not substantive and largely administrative., According to the SECs complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, on the conference call, Janes did not discuss the issues raised by the FDA in an October 2010 letter, such as the devices potential for over-heating, and the fact that some sample images the company submitted were scientifically invalid and useless., Even when asked on the call whether any of the FDAs concerns were safety-related or involved image quality, Janes said, Nope, and that there was really and honestly not one question about the technology or its consistency. It just doesnt make sense to me., After an investor obtained the FDAs denial letter and posted it on an Internet blog in early 2011, Janes used his personal Facebook page in another effort to mischaracterize the denial, the SEC alleged. Janes and his company didnt officially issue the full text of the denial letter until earlier this year, more than two years after the call to discuss it., The SECs action charges Imaging3 and Janes with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5(b).

Infinitys offering materials misled investors into believing that Infinitys ventures would own the leases and control drilling operations. Indeed, Infinitys communications with investors were peppered with references to as our wells and our crew. The Commission alleges that these claims were false, because Infinitys ventures did not actually have direct interests in any oil and gas leases and no direct involvement in operation of any leases. To the contrary, Infinitys ventures merely owned interests in an unaffiliated joint venture, over which Infinitys ventures could exercise no significant control. The complaint alleges that Madison and McGhee intentionally hid this fact from investors. The complaint further alleges that the defendants offering materials falsely described Madison as experienced and successful in the oil and gas industry and failed to disclose McGhees 2007 federal felony conviction., The complaint alleges that Infinity, Madison, McGhee violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

(Rohm). , The SECs complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, charges Mack D. Murrell, of Saginaw, Michigan, David A. Teekell, of Tomball, Texas, and Charles W. Adams, of Conroe, Texas with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also names as a relief defendant Raymond James Financial Services, Inc. (Raymond James) for the purpose of recovering illegal profits in its firm account. Teekell has agreed to settle the SECs charges and pay approximately $1.1 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty., The SECs complaint alleges that Murrell, who was the Vice President of Information Systems for Dow, obtained confidential details about the acquisition of Rohm from his then live-in girlfriend, now wife, who was the administrative assistant to Dows Chief Financial Officer at the time. Murrells girlfriend knew about and worked on the pending acquisition. The complaint alleges that the day after learning from his girlfriend of a special Board meeting at which the Rohm acquisition was discussed, Murrell tipped his long-time friend Teekell during a telephone call. Immediately following the telephone call, Teekell called Adams, his broker at Raymond James, and tipped him. , The complaint further alleges that the next business day after learning of the pending acquisition, Teekell and Adams began purchasing common stock and call options in Rohm. In addition to purchasing call options in his own account, Adams purchased stock in two discretionary customer accounts. Teekells and Adams purchases continued until the day before the acquisition announcement on July 10, 2008, when the price of Rohm stock jumped 64 percent. Teekell made an illicit profit of $534,526 and Adams and his discretionary customers made illicit profits of $107,043 through the insider trading. Raymond James made illicit profits of $373,497 when Teekell and Adams decided not to keep certain Rohm options that Adams had purchased in Teekells account., A call option is a security that derives its value from the underlying common stock of the issuer and gives the purchaser the right to buy the underlying stock at a specific price within a specified period of time. Typically, investors will purchase call options when they believe the price of the stock of the underlying securities is going up. Teekell and Adams invested so heavily in two series of Rohm call options on July 9, 2008 that their investments accounted for over 86 percent and 64 percent of the total options volume for these series on that day., The complaint seeks a final judgment ordering disgorgement of ill-gotten gains together with prejudgment interest from the defendants and the relief defendant, and permanent injunctions and penalties against the defendants. , Teekell has consented, without admitting or denying the SECs allegations, to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Teekell has agreed to pay $534,526 in disgorgement, $105,346 in prejudgment interest, and a penalty of $534,526. The settlement is subject to court approval., The SECs investigation was conducted by Philadelphia Regional Office enforcement staff Kingdon Kase and Suzanne C. Abt.

Fuqi and Chong have agreed to settle the SECs claims against them., The Commission alleges that Fuqi and Chong failed to disclose cash transfers of approximately $134 million to three purportedly unknown entities. Chong directed and authorized the transfers, which occurred between September 11, 2009 and November 24, 2010. Fuqis full board of directors was not aware of and did not approve the cash transfers, and the transactions were made without any written agreement or repayment terms. Although Fuqi has been unable to obtain independent third-party verification of a majority of the underlying cash transfers to or from the companys bank accounts, internal company records indicate that the transferred funds were returned to Fuqi throughout the same period. The funds, however, were not returned to the same bank accounts or in the same amounts as the initial transfers of cash from Fuqi. Fuqi lacked adequate internal accounting controls and incorrectly recorded the cash transfers in its books and records as increases or decreases in other payables or prepaids accounts. In addition, Chong falsely certified that Fuqis quarterly report on Form 10-Q, for the quarter ended September 30, 2009, contained no material misstatements or omissions even though Fuqi, at Chongs direction, had transferred $27.6 million to unknown third parties during that quarter. Fuqi also did not disclose the cash transfers in its November 10, 2009 current report on Form 8-K, which rendered Fuqis statements relating to cash in the Form 8-K misleading. , In the settled complaint, the Commission alleges that Fuqi and Chong violated the antifraud provisions of the securities laws, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5.

The action follows last weeks suspension of trading in Biozoom due to concerns that some shareholders may be unlawfully distributing its securities., Biozoom, formerly Entertainment Art, Inc., announced in April that it was changing its name and moving from producing leather bags to developing biomedical technology. The SECs complaint alleges that from March to June 2013, the ten defendants received more than 20 million shares of Entertainment Art, which was one-third of the companys total outstanding shares. In a one-month period beginning in mid-May, eight of them sold more than 14 million shares. The sales yielded almost $34 million, of which almost $17 million was wired to overseas bank accounts. Their U.S. brokerage accounts, which include approximately $16 million in cash, are subject to the asset freeze., The SECs complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, charges the eight defendants -- Magdalena Tavella, Andres Horacio Ficicchia, Gonzalo Garcia Blaya, Lucia Mariana Hernando, Cecilia De Lorenzo, Adriana Rosa Bagattin, Daniela Patricia Goldman, Mariano Pablo Ferrari -- along with two others, Fernando Loureyro, and Mariano Graciarena, who received shares but have yet to sell them., According to the SECs complaint, when the defendants deposited the Biozoom stock into their U.S. brokerage accounts, they claimed to have acquired the bulk of the shares in March 2013 from Entertainment Art shareholders who purchased them in private placements that began in 2007. Each of the defendants provided stock purchase agreements between them and the former shareholders purportedly signed by the defendants and those shareholders. The SEC alleges that the documents were false because the Entertainment Art investors had sold all of their stock in the company in 2009, almost four years earlier. The defendants shares of Biozoom were deposited into their accounts as shares that purportedly could be freely traded and the defendants sold them even though no registration, In addition to the temporary restraining order and asset freeze granted by the court, the SEC is seeking preliminary and permanent injunctions, return of the selling defendants allegedly ill-gotten sale proceeds, and civil penalties. The SEC also seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions against the non-selling defendants, Graciarena and Loureyro, because of the likelihood that both defendants will offer or sell their Biozoom shares to the public in violation of the registration requirements of U.S. securities law., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2013/comp-pr2013-122.pdf>SEC Complaint</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2013/lr22742.htm</i><br/>]"
22743,2013,[<h3>Criminal Charges Filed Against Massachusetts Investment Adviser For Defrauding Investors</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that, on July 1, 2013, the United States Attorney’s Office for the District of Massachusetts filed a criminal Information against Jeffrey A. Liskov (Liskov) of Plymouth, Massachusetts. The one-count criminal Information charged Liskov with willfully violating Section 206 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers Act). The Commission previously filed a civil action against Liskov and his advisory firm, EagleEye Asset Management, LLC (EagleEye), for defrauding advisory clients in connection with foreign currency exchange (forex) investments. The factual allegations in the criminal Information are substantially similar to those in the Commission’s complaint in the civil case., The Commission’s complaint in the civil case, filed on September 8, 2011, alleged that, between at least November 2008 and August 2010, Liskov made material misrepresentations to several advisory clients to induce them to liquidate investments in securities and instead invest in forex. The forex investments resulted in client losses totaling nearly $4 million, while EagleEye and Liskov came away with over $300,000 in performance fees, in addition to other management fees they collected from clients. The Commission alleged that Liskov’s strategy was to generate temporary profits on client forex investments to enable him to collect performance fees, after which client forex investments invariably quickly declined in value., According to the Commission’s complaint, Liskov made material misrepresentations or failed to disclose material information to clients concerning the nature of forex investments, the risks involved in forex, and Liskov’s poor track record in forex trading for himself and other clients. The Commission’s complaint further alleged that, as to two clients, without their knowledge or consent, Liskov liquidated securities in their brokerage accounts and transferred the proceeds to their forex trading accounts where he lost nearly all their funds, but not before first collecting performance fees on temporary profits in these clients’ forex accounts. The complaint alleged that Liskov accomplished the unauthorized transfers by using “white out” correction fluid to change dates, amounts, and other data on asset transfer documentation. Liskov also opened multiple forex trading accounts in the name of one client, without obtaining the client’s consent, thereby maximizing his ability to earn performance fees on the client’s forex investments., As result of the foregoing conduct, the Commission alleged that EagleEye and Liskov violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Advisers Act. The Commission also alleged that EagleEye failed to maintain certain books and records required of investment advisers in violation of Section 204 of the Advisers Act and Rule 204-2 thereunder, and that Liskov aided and abetted EagleEye’s violations of these recordkeeping provisions., On November 26, 2012, after an eight-day trial in the Commission’s civil action, a jury found that EagleEye and Liskov violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 206(1) of the Advisers Act. After a further hearing, U.S. District Court Judge William G. Young found violations by EagleEye and Liskov of Section 204 of the Advisers Act and Rule 204-2 thereunder, concerning their recordkeeping obligations relating to EagleEye’s advisory business. On December 12, 2012, the court entered a final judgment against EagleEye and Liskov in the Commission’s civil action, ordering that they be permanently enjoined from future violations of the foregoing provisions of the securities laws. The court further ordered EagleEye and Liskov, jointly and severally, to pay disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains in the amount of $301,502.26, plus pre-judgment interest on that amount of $29,603.59, and the court also ordered EagleEye and Liskov each to pay a civil penalty of $725,000., On December 27, 2012, the Commission instituted public administrative proceedings against each of EagleEye and Liskov to determine what sanctions against them, if any, may be appropriate and in the public interest., The Commission acknowledges the assistance of Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts William F. Galvin’s Securities Division and the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission, both of which filed cases against EagleEye and Liskov in September 2011., For additional information, see Litigation Release Numbers <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr22086.htm target=_top>22086</a> (September 8, 2011), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22546.htm target=_top>22546</a> (November 27, 2012), and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22570.htm target=_top>22570</a> (December 14, 2012), and Advisers Act Release Numbers <a href=/litigation/admin/2012/ia-3527.pdf target=_top>3527</a> and <a href=/litigation/admin/2012/ia-3528.pdf target=_top>3528</a> (December 27, 2012).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2013/lr22743.htm</i><br/>]"

Rogers of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, Canada granted summary judgment in favor of the Commission to recognize and enforce judgments previously entered in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against William Todd Peever (“Peever”) and Phillip James Curtis (“Curtis”), both of whom are Canadian citizens residing in British Columbia.  Those U.S. judgments held Peever and Curtis jointly and severally liable for $2,894,537.48 in disgorgement and $1,611,998.18 in prejudgment interest for their respective roles in a fraudulent scheme to manipulate the stock price of SHEP Technologies, Inc. (“SHEP”) f/k/a Inside Holdings Inc. (“IHI”), whose shares traded on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board.  , The Commission’s complaint in <em>SEC v. Brian N. Lines, et al.</em>, 1:07-CV-11387 (DLC) (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 19, 2007), filed in U.S. federal court, had alleged, in pertinent part, that during 2002 and 2003, defendants Peever and Curtis, together with certain co-defendants, engaged in a scheme to secretly obtain control of the publicly traded shell company IHI, through use of nominees.  The scheme involved merging IHI with a private company to form SHEP, secretly paying touters to promote the IHI/SHEP stock, and then selling SHEP stock into the ensuing demand.  During the first half of 2003, Peever, Curtis, and certain other defendants sold over 3 million SHEP shares into this artificially-stimulated demand, generating about $4.3 million in illegal proceeds.  As part of the scheme, Peever and Curtis failed to file required reports with the Commission regarding their beneficial ownership of IHI and SHEP stock to conceal that they, among others, owned substantial positions in, and had been selling, SHEP stock., Curtis and Peever challenged the Commission’s attempt to enforce the U.S. court judgments in Canada by contending: (1) the judgments had been procured by fraud; and (2) that the disgorgement award was penal in nature and, therefore, could not be recognized under Canadian law.  The Canadian court rejected both of the Defendants’ arguments, and held that there was no basis to bar enforcement of the judgments against the Defendants in Canada. , For additional information, please see Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20407.htm>20407</a> (Dec. 17, 2007) and Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20733.htm>20733</a> (Sept. 22, 2008).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2013/lr22745.htm</i><br/>]"

Graham, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Florida, signed the final judgment against defendant Stewart A. Merkin (“Merkin”) in a civil action originally filed on October 3, 2011.  Merkin is an attorney in Miami, Florida.   , The Commission brought a civil action against Merkin alleging violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Complaint alleged that on four occasions, Merkin, an experienced attorney, wrote letters falsely stating that his client, StratoComm Corporation (“StratoComm”), was not under investigation for violations of the securities laws.  The Complaint further alleged that Merkin knew that his statements were false because, at the time that he wrote each letter, he was representing StratoComm and several individuals in the Commission’s investigation into the company’s activities.  The Commission’s Complaint alleged that Merkin authorized his letters to be posted on the website maintained by Pink Sheets LLC (currently OTC Markets Group Inc.) for viewing by the investing public. , On October 3, 2012, the Court granted the Commission’s motion for summary judgment with respect to liability, finding that Merkin made false statements of material fact, with scienter, in connection with the purchase or sale of securities.  Merkin subsequently consented to the entry of a final judgment that: (i) orders him liable to pay a total of $125,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest and a civil penalty; (ii) imposes a permanent injunction against future violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act by making false or misleading statements; and (iii) permanently bars Merkin from participating in an offering of penny stock.  In consenting to these remedies, Merkin retained his right to appeal from the Court’s ruling on summary judgment with respect to liability.  <strong></strong>, For further information, please see Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr22115.htm>22115</a> (October 6, 2011) [initial complaint filed].,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2013/lr22746.htm</i><br/>]"
22747,2013,[<h3>SEC Freezes Assets of Insider Traders in Onyx Pharmaceuticals</h3>],"[On July 3, 2013, the Securities and Exchange Commission obtained an emergency court order to freeze the assets of traders using foreign accounts to reap approximately $4.6 million in potentially illegal profits by trading in advance of the Sunday, June 30, 2013 announcement that Onyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. had received, but rejected an acquisition offer from Amgen, Inc., The SEC alleges that unknown traders took risky bets that Onyx’s stock price would increase by purchasing call options on June 26, 27 and 28, the three trading days before the announcement.  Through quick, cross country coordination between the agency’s Los Angeles and New York offices, the SEC took emergency action to freeze the traders’ assets before courts closed for the holiday., According to the SEC’s complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan, on June 30, 2013 Onyx announced that it had received, but rejected, an unsolicited proposal from Amgen to acquire all of Onyx’s outstanding shares and share equivalents for $120 per share in cash.  The Announcement also stated that Onyx’s board of directors rejected Amgen’s proposal and that Onyx had authorized its financial advisors to contact potential acquirers who may have an interest in a transaction with Onyx.  Amgen’s $120 per share price offer represented a 38% premium to Onyx’s closing share price on Friday June 28, 2013.  The complaint further alleges that as a result of the announcement, Onyx’s share price increased from a close of $86.82 on over 51% on Monday July 1 compared with the prior trading day’s closing price, and that the trading volume of its stock increased by over 900% that day.  The complaint alleges that the traders, as a result of these well-timed trades, collectively earned a profit of approximately $4.6 million in just three days., The SEC alleges that certain unknown traders were in possession of material nonpublic information about the offer to acquire Onyx at a substantial premium over the stock price at the time they purchased Onyx call options, many of which were out-of-the-money, in the three trading days before the announcement.  According to the complaint, the timing and size of the trades were highly suspicious because they constituted large increases over the historical volume for those call options purchased.  , The emergency court order obtained by the SEC freezes the traders’ assets related to the Onyx call options transactions and prohibits the traders from destroying any evidence.  The SEC’s complaint charges the unknown traders with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5.  In addition to the emergency relief, the Commission is seeking a final judgment ordering the traders to disgorge their ill-gotten gains with interest, pay financial penalties, and permanently bar them from future violations., The SEC’s expedited investigation, which is continuing has been conducted by Melissia Buckhalter-Honore and Spencer Bendell.  The litigation will be led by John Bulgozdy and Sam Puathasnanon of the Los Angeles Office with the assistance of Alexander Vasilescu of the New York Office.

The complaint alleges Hartmann and Tordy each made misrepresentations to investors concerning the Agape investments they sold and sold the Agape investments despite the incredible returns promised by Agape, their knowledge of previous defaults by Agape, and dire warnings from Agapes president about Agapes financial condition.

22749,2013,[<h3>Serial Fraudster Matthew J. Gagnon Sentenced to Five Years in Prison</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on July 9, 2013, the Honorable Mark A. Goldsmith of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan sentenced Matthew J. Gagnon to five years of incarceration followed by three years of supervised release and ordered Gagnon to pay over $4.4 million in restitution to his victims.  Gagnon, 45, of Portland, Oregon, pleaded guilty to one count of criminal securities fraud for promoting a securities offering without fully disclosing the amount of his compensation in connection with his promotion of the $72 million Legisi Ponzi scheme in 2006 and 2007, in violation of Section 17(b) of the Securities Act of 1933.  , The criminal charges arose out of the same facts that were the subject of a civil injunctive action that the Commission filed against Gagnon on May 11, 2010.  The Commissions complaint alleged that since 1997, Gagnon had billed himself as an Internet business opportunity expert and his website as “the world’s first and largest opportunity review website.”  According to the SEC’s complaint, from January 2006 through approximately August 2007, Gagnon helped orchestrate a massive Ponzi scheme conducted by Gregory N. McKnight and his company, Legisi Holdings, LLC, which raised a total of approximately $72 million from over 3,000 investors by promising returns of upwards of 15% a month.  The complaint also alleged that Gagnon promoted Legisi but in doing so misled investors by claiming, among other things, that he had thoroughly researched McKnight and Legisi and had determined Legisi to be a legitimate and safe investment.  The complaint alleged that Gagnon had no basis for the claims he made about McKnight and Legisi.  Gagnon also failed to disclose to investors that he was to receive 50% of Legisis purported profits under his agreement with McKnight.  According to the complaint, Gagnon received a net of approximately $3.8 million in Legisi investor funds from McKnight for his participation in the scheme., The SECs complaint further alleged that beginning in August 2007, Gagnon fraudulently offered and sold securities representing interests in a new company that purportedly was to develop resort properties.  The complaint alleged that Gagnon, among other things, falsely claimed that the investment was risk-free and SEC compliant, and guaranteed a 200% return in 14 months.  In reality, however, Gagnon sent the money to a twice-convicted felon, did not register the investment with the SEC, and knew such an outlandish return was impossible.  Gagnon took in at least $361,865 from 21 investors. , The SECs complaint also alleged that in April 2009, Gagnon began promoting a fraudulent offering of interests in a purported Forex trading venture.  Gagnon guaranteed that the venture would generate returns of 2% a month or 30% a year for his investors.  Gagnons claims were false, and he had had no basis for making them because Gagnon never reviewed his friend’s trading records before promoting the offering, which would have shown over $150,000 in losses over the previous nine months.  , The SECs complaint charged Gagnon with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), 17(a) and 17(b) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 15(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint sought preliminary and permanent injunctions, disgorgement, and civil penalties from Gagnon.  On May 24, 2010, the SEC obtained an emergency order freezing Gagnon’s assets and other preliminary relief.  Subsequently, on August 6, 2010, the Court granted an order of preliminary injunction against Gagnon pursuant to his consent. On March 22, 2012, the Court granted the SEC’s motion for summary judgment and entered a final judgment against Gagnon.  The Court found that Gagnon violated the registration, anti-fraud, and anti-touting provisions of the federal securities laws.  The Court’s final judgment against Gagnon permanently enjoined him from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), 17(a) and 17(b) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 15(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered Gagnon to pay $3,613,259 in disgorgement, $488,570.47 in prejudgment interest, and a $100,000 civil penalty. , On May 2, 2012, the SEC instituted related administrative proceedings against Gagnon to determine what, if any, remedial action was appropriate and in the public interest.  On July 31, 2012, the SEC issued an Order Making Findings and Imposing Sanctions by Default barring Gagnon from association with any broker or dealer., For further information regarding this case, see Litigation Releases No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2010/lr21532.htm>21532</a> (May 25, 2010), and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22310.htm>22310</a> (March 27, 2012)., See also:  <a href=/litigation/complaints/2010/comp21532.pdf>SEC Complaint</a>]"

The SEC <a href=/investor/alerts/forextrading.pdf>has previously warned individual investors</a> about the risks involved with forex trading., The SEC alleges that Kevin G. White raised more than $7.1 million from investors by touting a sophisticated low-risk forex trading strategy yielding astronomical returns. He also advertised his purported 25-year Wall Street career. In reality, the forex trading has incurred losses of investor funds, and White actually spent only six years as a licensed securities professional in Houston before being barred by the New York Stock Exchange two decades ago. White also lied about his education. Meanwhile, White has siphoned away more than $1.7 million of investor money to pay personal expenses, finance expensive trips, and fund other unrelated and undisclosed businesses and investments., The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced parallel charges against White and his companies., According to the SECs complaint that was unsealed late yesterday in U.S. District Court of the Eastern District of Texas, White raised investor money through two entities that he owns and controls: KGW Capital Management and Revelation Forex Fund. KGW Capital purports to be one of the worlds leading private investment firms., The SEC alleges that White and his companies used websites, press releases, and presentations to prospective investors to solicit funds. White and his companies told investors that Revelation Forex was a $1 billion hedge fund that had achieved total returns of more than 393 percent since its January 2009 inception, and earned a compound annual rate of return of more than 36 percent. Marketing materials provided to prospective investors boasted that an initial investment of $250,000 in Revelation Forex in January 2009 would have grown to $983,111 by May 2013., The SEC alleges that these claims were false. While White and KGW Capital tout a track record for the fund that began in January 2009, Revelation Forex did not actually receive investor funds or begin forex trading until September 2011. The fund has since incurred realized trading losses of over $550,000 plus approximately $1,419,600 in unrealized losses through May 31, 2013. Meanwhile, bank records reveal that White has taken over $1.7 million for himself, KGW Capital, and two of his other businesses, including approximately $248,600 in investor funds from Revelation Forex to fund an unrelated and undisclosed propane business and $97,000 on another business entitled KGW Real Estate. The SECs complaint names both of these companies as relief defendants for the purpose of seeking disgorgement of investor funds in their possession., The court has granted the SECs request for an asset freeze and temporary restraining order against White, KGW Capital, Revelation Forex, and RFF GP LLC, which is the general partner of Revelation Forex. The court appointed Kelly Crawford as the receiver over these entities. A hearing has been scheduled for July 18, 2013 on the SECs motion for a preliminary injunction., The SECs complaint alleges that White, KGW Capital, Revelation Forex, and RFF violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5. The SEC is seeking disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest and financial penalties as well as preliminary and permanent injunctions., The SECs investigation was conducted by B.

22752,2013,"[<h3>Court Finds Massachusetts-Based Viking Financial Group, Inc. and Its Owner Steven Palladino Liable for Violations of the Securities Laws</h3>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that, on July 15, 2013, the federal district court in Massachusetts held that Massachusetts resident Steven Palladino, and his Massachusetts-based company, Viking Financial Group, Inc., committed securities fraud. On April 30, 2013, the Commission filed an emergency enforcement action against the Defendants. In its complaint, the Commission alleged that, since April 2011, Palladino and Viking falsely promised at least 33 investors that their money would be used to conduct the business of Viking - which was to make to short-term, high interest loans to those unable to obtain traditional financing. The Commission also alleged that Palladino misrepresented to investors that the loans made by Viking would be secured by first interest liens on non-primary residence properties and that investors would be paid back their principal, plus monthly interest at rates generally ranging from 7-15%, from payments made by borrowers on the loans. The complaint alleges that, in truth, the Defendants made very few real loans to borrowers, and instead used investors funds largely to make payments to earlier investors and to pay for the Palladino familys substantial personal expenses, including cash withdrawals and hundreds of thousands of dollars spent on gambling excursions, vacations, luxury vehicles and tuition. , The Commission first filed this emergency action on April 30, 2013, seeking a temporary restraining order, asset freeze, and other emergency relief, which the Court granted. After the parties had an opportunity to brief the issues, on July 15, 2013, the Court held that the Commission had established that the Defendants conduct violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933. The Court further stated that the Commission is entitled to injunctive relief and a temporary order of disgorgement of ill-gotten gains in the amount of at least $3.1 million. The Commission agreed to ascertain whether there are any other possible investors who may have been victims and to submit a final order of disgorgement and a proposed plan of distribution at a later date. The Court also held that imposition of any civil penalties would be determined after a criminal case against the Defendants has been resolved. In the meantime, an order freezing the Defendants assets remains in place. , Individuals who invested with Viking or Palladino since April 2011 and believe they may have been a victim of this fraudulent scheme should contact Deena Bernstein at (617) 573-8813 or <a href=mailto:bernsteind@sec.gov>bernsteind@sec.gov</a> on or before Friday, August 2, 2013., The Commission acknowledges the assistance of Suffolk County (Massachusetts) District Attorney Daniel F.

22754,2013,[<h3>Former Bristol-Myers Executive Agrees to Settle Insider Trading Charges</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that the Honorable Susan D. Wigenton of the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey entered a judgment approving a $324,777 settlement between the Commission and Robert D. Ramnarine, a former executive at Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., in a case that arose from allegations of insider trading in the securities of three companies that Bristol had targeted for acquisitions between 2010 and 2012. , In its action against Ramnarine, SEC v. Robert D. Ramnarine, 2:12-cv-04837 (D.N.J.), filed on August 2, 2012, the Commission alleged that Ramnarine, a former executive in Bristols treasury department, misappropriated material nonpublic information relating to Bristols involvement in evaluating possible acquisitions of ZymoGenetics, Inc., Pharmasset, Inc. and Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and then traded in stock options of these potential target companies securities in personal brokerage accounts. Prior to buying Pharmasset call options, the Commission alleged that Ramnarine sought to conceal his unlawful conduct by conducting internet research, using his Bristol computer, to determine whether his option trading would be detected by regulators. In particular, the Commission alleged that Ramnarine ran internet searches using Bristols computer network for phrases including can stock option be traced to purchaser, how to detect can stock option be traced to purchase inside trading, and illegal insider trading options trace. According to the Commissions complaint, Ramnarine realized ill-gotten gains of at least $311,361 by trading stock options of ZymoGenetics, Pharmasset and Amylin in advance of announcements that those companies would be acquired. , The judgment entered in the Commissions action permanently enjoins Ramnarine from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and (14)(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder, and permanently enjoins Ramnarine from acting as an officer or director of any issuer that has any class of securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act. The judgment also requires Ramnarine to disgorge $311,361, plus prejudgment interest of $13,061, and requires that funds in a brokerage account controlled by Ramnarine that were frozen by previous order of the Court be transferred to the Commission. Pursuant to the judgment, the Commission may later move the Court to impose a civil penalty against Ramnarine. , The U.S. Attorneys Office for the District of New Jersey filed a parallel criminal action against Ramnarine on August 1, 2012 based on the same facts, U.S. v. Ramnarine, 3:13-cr-00387 (D.N.J.), and on June 10, 2013, Ramnarine pleaded guilty to securities fraud before the Honorable Anne E. Thompson of the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey.

22755,2013,"[<h3>SEC Files Fraud Charges Against China Intelligent Lighting and Electronics, Inc.; NIVS Intellimedia Technology Group, Inc.; and Their Sibling CEOs</h3>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that the Commission filed fraud and other related charges against China Intelligent Lighting and Electronics, Inc. (CIL); NIVS IntelliMedia Technology Group, Inc. (NIV); and their respective CEOs, Xuemei Li and, her brother, Tianfu Li.  CIL reports that it is a lighting company, and NIV reports that it is a consumer electronic company.  Both are located in China., The Commission alleges that CIL, NIV, and their CEOs engaged in fraudulent schemes to raise and divert offering proceeds, and then attempted to hide the diversions by lying to auditors and making false and materially misleading filings with the Commission.  CIL and NIV are U.S. issuers that raised approximately $7.7 million and $21.5 million, respectively, in public registered offerings in the U.S. capital markets in 2010.  Thereafter, Xuemei Li, and Tianfu Li  diverted those offering proceeds from CIL and NIV contrary to the stated uses of proceeds set forth in the offering documents.  Specifically, on June 24, 2010, $7.7 million in offering proceeds was deposited into CIL’s Hong Kong bank account.  The next day, Xuemei Li transferred approximately $6.8 million, or almost 90%, to a company that has no disclosed relation to CIL, but continued to tell CIL’s auditor that the funds remained in the account.  Similarly, on April 26, 2010, $21.5 million in offering proceeds was deposited in NIV’s Hong Kong bank account.  Even though almost all of the money was transferred out of the Hong Kong bank account by May 5, 2010, NIV and Tianfu Li told the company’s auditor that the funds continued to be held in the account., In addition to lying to auditors to mask the diversions, CIL, NIV, and their respective CEOs also falsified bank and accounting records to reflect inflated cash balances, and filed false and misleading quarterly reports on Forms 10-Q with the SEC that contained inflated cash balances.  In addition, the defendants filed registration statements signed by the Lis that misled investors about how the offering proceeds would be used., In its complaint, the Commission alleges that the Defendants violated the antifraud provisions of the securities laws, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5.  The Commission further alleges that Xuemei Li and Tianfu Li lied to the auditors and aided and abetted the companies’ violations of  the reporting, recordkeeping, and internal controls provisions of the securities laws, including Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2) (B), and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, 13a-14, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2.  The Commission seeks permanent injunctive relief to prevent future violations of the federal securities laws, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, officer and director bars, and any other appropriate relief., The Commission also announced today the entry of an order instituting administrative proceedings to determine whether the registration of each class of securities of CIL and NIV should be revoked for failure to make required periodic filings with the Commission.  <i>See</i> Order Instituting Proceedings and Notice of Hearing Pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, <i>In the Matter of China Intelligent Lighting and Electronics, Inc. et al., </i>Administrative Proceeding File No. 3-15383, Exchange Act Release No. 34-70017 (July 22, 2013)., The SEC’s investigation was conducted by Ansu N.

The complaint alleges that Bravo obtained the shares through three wrap around agreements. The wrap around agreements involved debts that AVVAA supposedly owed to its officers, affiliates, or other persons closely associated with the company (Affiliates) for unpaid compensation for services rendered. Under the wrap around agreements, the Affiliates assigned to Bravo the debts that AVVAA purportedly owed to them, and AVVAA consented to the assignment and agreed to modify the terms of the original debt obligation so that the debts now owed to Bravo were immediately convertible into shares of AVVAA common stock. According to the complaint, within weeks of entering into the first two agreements, and approximately four months after the execution of the third, Bravo began selling the shares he obtained under the agreements to the public. He then used some of the proceeds of the stock sales to pay the amounts owed to the Affiliates under the wrap around agreements. The complaint further alleges that Bravo had previously been involved in wrap around agreements, in his capacity as of president and chief executive of Cross Atlantic Commodities, Inc., a public company located in Weston, Florida, and that those wrap around agreements were subjects of a prior Commission enforcement action, <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21224.htm>SEC v.

Drucker from Practicing Law for Three Years Based On Insider Trading Violation</h3>],"[The Commission announces that on July 17, 2013, the Appellate Division, Second Department, of the New York State Supreme Court (the Appellate Division), issued a <a href=http://www.courts.state.ny.us/courts/ad2/calendar/webcal/decisions/2013/D38372.pdf>decision</a> suspending attorney Mitchell S. Drucker from the practicing law for three years, commencing August 16, 2013.  The decision provides that Drucker cannot apply for reinstatement earlier than February 16, 2016.  The Court imposed this sanction based on the judgment the Commission obtained in its insider trading case against Drucker. SEC v. Mitchell S. Drucker, et al, 06 Civ. 1644 (S.D.N.Y.)  In December 2007, a jury in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York found that Drucker, who was in the legal department of public company NBTY, Inc., violated the antifraud provisions of the securities laws by insider trading the common stock of NBTY, tipping his father, who traded, and trading his friends NBTY shares.  In its decision, the Appellate Division upheld the determination of a Special Referee that Drucker had (1) engaged in conduct involving dishonesty, deceit, fraud, or misrepresentation, in violation of former Code of Professional Responsibility DR1-102(a)(4) (22 NYCRR 1200.3[a][4]), and (2) engaged in conduct adversely reflecting on his fitness as an attorney, in violation of former Code of Professional Responsibility DR 1-102(a)(7) (22 NYCRR 1200.3[a][7]).  In imposing its sanction, the Appellate Division found:, Previously, on December 26, 2007, Judge Colleen McMahon, whose decision and findings were cited by the Appellate Division, enjoined Drucker from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and barred him from serving as an officer and director of any public company. The judgment also ordered defendant Drucker to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest totaling $201,146, to pay, and be jointly and severally liable with his father, defendant Ronald Drucker for, disgorgement and prejudgment interest totaling $74,411, and to pay, and be jointly and severally liable with his friend, relief defendant William Minerva for, disgorgement and prejudgment interest totaling $11,577. Finally, the judgment ordered Mitchell Drucker to pay a civil penalty of $394,486, representing two times the combined ill-gotten gains obtained by defendants Mitchell Drucker and Ronald Drucker, and relief defendant Minerva.  Drucker subsequently completed those payments to the U.S. Treasury., In February 2008, the Commission issued an Order temporarily and then permanently suspending Drucker from practicing before the Commission based on his insider trading judgment., For more information see prior litigation release nos. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr19587.htm>19587</a>, <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20385.htm>20385</a>, <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20419.htm>20419</a> and administrative proceeding release no. <a href=/litigation/admin/2008/34-57292.pdf>57292</a>.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2013/lr22757.htm</i><br/>]"
22758,2013,[<h3>Former Investment Banker and His College Friend Sentenced to 16 Months in Prison for Insider Trading Scheme</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on July 23, 2013, investment bank analyst Jauyo Jason Lee, 29, of Palo Alto, Calif., and his college friend Victor Chen, 29, of Sunnyvale, Calif., were sentenced to 16 months in prison for their roles in an insider trading scheme.  The Honorable Richard Seeborg, of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, also sentenced Lee and Chen to two years of supervised release following their incarceration and ordered that restitution and forfeiture be considered at a subsequent hearing.  Chen paid $610,099 in forfeiture prior to sentencing.  Lee and Chen both pleaded guilty on April 16, 2013, to one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and one count of securities fraud., The criminal charges filed by the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California arose out of the same facts that were the subject of a civil action that the SEC filed against Lee and Chen on September 27, 2012.  The SECs complaint alleged that Lee, who worked in the San Francisco office of Leerink Swann LLC, gleaned sensitive, nonpublic information about two upcoming deals from unsuspecting co-workers involved with those clients and by reviewing various internal documents about the transactions, which involved medical device companies.  Lee tipped Chen, his longtime college friend with the confidential information, and Chen traded heavily on the basis of the nonpublic details that Lee had a duty to protect. Chen made more than $600,000 in illicit profits, which was a 237 percent return on his initial investment.  Bank records reveal a pattern of large cash withdrawals by Lee followed by large cash deposits by Chen, who then used the money for the insider trading., According to the SECs complaint, Lee was first privy to information about Leerinks client Syneron Medical Ltd., which was negotiating an acquisition of Candela Corporation in 2009.  He later learned that Leerinks client Somanetics Corporation was in the process of being acquired by Covidien plc. in 2010.  As Lee collected nonpublic details about each of the deals, he communicated with Chen repeatedly and exchanged dozens of phone calls and text messages.  Some of the calls took place from Lees office telephone at Leerink. Lee had a duty to preserve the confidentiality of the information that he received in the course of his employment at Leerink., The SEC alleged that in the days leading up to the public announcements of each of these deals, Chen made sizeable purchases of stock and call options in Candela and Somanetics and made unusual trades in the securities of each of these acquisition targets.  Chen had never previously bought securities in these companies, yet he suddenly spent a significant portion of his available cash to buy the Candela and Somanetics securities.  Chen proceeded to sell most of his Candela and Somanetics holdings once public announcements were made about the transactions.  Because Chen made some of his trades in his sister Jennifer Chens account, the SECs complaint also names her as a relief defendant for the purposes of recovering the illegal profits in her account., As a result of their conduct, the SECs complaint charged Lee and Chen with violations of Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder.  The complaint sought disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and permanent injunctions against Lee and Chen.

The judgment also imposed a penny stock bar against NFC which permanently bars it from participating in an offering of penny stock, including engaging in activities with a broker, dealer, or issuer for the purpose of issuing, trading, or inducing or attempting to induce the purchase or sale of any penny stock.  The judgment orders NFC to pay disgorgement of $605,262, representing NFCs ill-gotten gains, plus prejudgment interest of $38,819 and a civil penalty of $1 million., The Commissions complaint alleged that Eiten and NFC issued a penny stock promotional publication called the OTC Special Situations Reports.  According to the complaint, the defendants promoted penny stocks in this publication on behalf of clients in order to increase the price per share and/or volume of trading in the market for the securities of penny stock companies.  The complaint alleged that Eiten and NFC made misrepresentations in these reports about the penny stock companies they promoted.  For example, the Commissions complaint alleged that during 2010, Eiten and NFC issued reports promoting four penny stock companies: (1) Clean Power Concepts, Inc., based in Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada, a purported manufacturer and distributor of various fuel additives and lubrication products made from crushed seed oil; (2) Endeavor Power Corp., based in Robesonia, Pennsylvania, a purported recycler of value metals from electronic waste; (3) Gold Standard Mining, based in Agoura Hills, California, a purported owner of Russia gold mining operations; and (4) Nexaira Wireless Corp., based in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, a purported developer and seller of wireless routers.  The Commissions complaint alleged that in these four reports, Eiten and NFC made material misrepresentations and omissions, concerning, among other things, the companies financial condition, future revenue projections, intellectual property rights, and Eitens interaction with company management as a basis for his statements., According to the complaint, Eiten and NFC were hired to issue the above reports and used false information provided by their clients, without checking the accuracy of the information with the companies in question or otherwise ensuring that the statements they were making in the OTC Special Situations Report were true., The Commissions case against Eiten is still pending., For further information, please see Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr22188.htm>22188</a>.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2013/lr22759.htm</i><br/>]"

The sentence was based on Kileys conviction on 15 criminal counts including mail and wire fraud, conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud, and money laundering for his role in a $194 million foreign currency trading scheme that defrauded approximately 1,000 investors. Kiley was charged on July 19, 2011, and a jury found him guilty on June 12, 2012. , Kiley is one of the defendants in a pending civil injunctive action filed by the Commission on November 23, 2009 in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota. The Commissions action against Kiley arose out of the same facts that are the subject of the criminal case against him. The Commissions complaint alleges that from at least July 2006 through at least July 2009, Kiley and co-defendant Trevor G. Cook of Minneapolis, Minnesota, raised at least $190 million (later determined to be $194 million) from 1,000 investors through the unregistered offer and sale of investments in a purported foreign currency trading venture. According to the Commissions complaint, Cook and Kiley pooled investors funds in bank and trading accounts in the names of entities they controlled. The Commissions complaint alleges that the foreign currency trading they conducted resulted in millions of dollars in losses, and they misused approximately one half of the investor funds to make Ponzi-like payments to earlier investors and pay for, among other things, Cooks gambling losses and the purchase of the historic Van Dusen Mansion in Minneapolis. , The Commissions complaint charges Cook and Kiley with violating Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. On November 23, 2009, the Court entered a preliminary injunction order against Cook and Kiley and froze all of their assets. On March 7, 2011, the Commission also filed a civil complaint in the U.S. District Court in Minneapolis against Jason Bo-Alan Beckman and his registered investment advisory firm Oxford Private Client Group, LLC, for their roles in this scheme.

Capital Advisors with insider trading ahead of major announcements by technology companies., The SEC alleges that Richard Lees illegal trading based on nonpublic information he received from sources with connections to insiders at the technology companies enabled the S.A.C. Capital hedge fund that he managed to generate more than $1.5 million in illegal profits. Lee also made trades in his personal account. The insider trading occurred ahead of public announcements about a Microsoft-Yahoo partnership and the acquisition of 3Com Corporation by Hewlett-Packard., In a separate action, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Lee, who lives in Chicago., According to the SECs complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Lee received inside information in July 2009 from a sell-side analyst familiar with nonpublic negotiations between Microsoft and Yahoo to enter into an Internet search engine partnership. Lee learned that the negotiations, previously the subject of market rumors, were moving forward and a deal could be finalized in the next two weeks. The analyst told Lee that the confidential information came from a close personal friend who worked at Microsoft. Lee thanked the analyst for the very specific information and promptly purchased hundreds of thousands of shares of Yahoo stock in a portfolio that he managed on behalf of S.A.C. Capital. Lee also purchased shares of Yahoo stock in his personal trading account. When the imminent deal was reported in the press almost a week later, Yahoos stock price rose approximately four percent on the news and S.A.C. Capital and Lee reaped substantial profits., The SEC further alleges that Lee received highly confidential information about 3Com from a Beijing-based consultant who he knew had close personal ties with executives at the company. When his source tipped him on Nov. 11, 2009, that 3Com was on the verge of being acquired by Hewlett-Packard, Lee quickly purchased several hundred thousand shares of 3Com stock for the S.A.C. Capital hedge fund. On the basis of the nonpublic information, Lee amassed the sizeable 3Com position just minutes before Hewlett-Packard announced it agreed to acquire 3Com for $2.7 billion. The price of 3Com stock jumped more than 30 percent the next day, and the S.A.C.

22762,2013,[<h3>SEC Charges Houston-Based Investor Relations Executive with Insider Trading in Stocks of Clients</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged the former CEO of a Houston-based investor relations firm with insider trading in the securities of multiple firm clients. , The SEC alleges that Stephen B. Gray obtained confidential information about the companies while the firm assisted them with drafting and publishing press releases to announce quarterly and annual earnings, mergers and acquisitions, and other major events. Gray then traded on the basis of that material, non-public information for profits and avoided losses of more than $313,000 during a 13-month period. Gray disregarded the firms standard agreements with clients to protect confidential information and use it solely for business purposes, and he also flouted the firms statement of policy regarding securities trades that prohibited trading by firm personnel when in possession of non-public information about clients. Gray was fired last October after the firm learned about the SECs investigation., According to the SECs complaint filed in federal court in Houston, Gray illegally traded in the securities of at least six firm clients. Employees often asked Gray for advice on press releases based on his status as the firms CEO as well as his experience as a former CEO of a public company. Gray also asked employees about forthcoming material transactions or announcements before they became public, and he sometimes met directly with clients to discuss confidential information with them. Gray also helped maintain the firms shared computer network drive, which included drafts and final versions of all relevant press releases., According to the SECs complaint, Gray opened his only trading account in September 2009 and borrowed funds from his life insurance policy to fund his trading activity. Despite the firms policies, the overwhelming majority of Grays trades involved securities of the firm clients, and he did not disclose his trades or his intention to trade to the firm or clients. At first, Gray primarily traded in the common stock of firm clients, sometimes holding the securities for months at a time but on other occasions compiling shares immediately before a major announcement. For example, on May 5, 2011, The Mens Wearhouse issued a press release announcing higher than expected earnings per share for its quarter ending April 30. Its stock price increased 16 percent upon this news. While in possession of material non-public information about Mens Warehouse about the impending announcement, Gray made an electronic calendar appointment for himself on April 29 with the subject: Buy MW stock ahead of early June earnings release. On April 30, Gray created another appointment with the subject: Buy MW stock?? On May 3 and 4, he purchased 4,323 shares of Mens Warehouse stock. Gray sold his shares on May 5 after the announcement for an illegal profit of $17,397., According to the SECs complaint, later that same year Gray began engaging in more risky and lucrative short-term options trades in which profits were facilitated by his knowledge of inside information. In several instances, Gray purchased very short-term call and put options contracts. For instance, Grays firm worked with Powell Industries on drafting a press release in late 2011 to announce that its financial statements for the second and third quarters would be restated. Based on this material, non-public information, Gray purchased 15,000 Powell put options between October 18 and November 3. All of these options had the shortest term available. After Powell issued the press release on November 8, its stock price declined by 22 percent. Gray immediately sold his options for a profit of $82,570., The SECs complaint charges Gray with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, and seeks a final judgment ordering him to disgorge all of his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest and pay financial penalties. The complaint also seeks permanent injunctive relief. , The SECs investigation was conducted by Todd Baker, Ty Martinez, and Jonathan Scott of the Fort Worth Regional Office.

Lee purchased large amounts of Yahoo stock in the S.A.C. Capital hedge fund that he managed as well as in his personal trading account on the basis of the inside information., In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Aggarwal, who lives in India but recently returned to the U.S., The SEC alleges that Aggarwal learned confidential details about the significant progress of the Microsoft-Yahoo negotiations from his close friend at Microsoft on July 9, 2009, and he tipped Lee with the information during a telephone call the following day. When the information was reported in the media almost a week later, Yahoos stock price rose approximately 4 percent. S.A.C. Capital and Lee reaped substantial profits from the Yahoo shares that he purchased after speaking to Aggarwal., According to the SECs amended complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan, Aggarwal covered both Microsoft and Yahoo for his research firm and regularly received periodic updates from his inside source at Microsoft. Upon learning that Microsoft and Yahoo were potentially within two weeks of finalizing a deal, Aggarwal shared very specific details with Lee. Aggarwal assured him that the information came from a close friend at Microsoft who was reliable and accurate., The SECs amended complaint charges Aggarwal and Lee with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.

Sensenig used the proceeds to finance a collection of start-up companies he founded and controlled, the largest of which was Conestoga Log Cabin Leasing, Inc. More than half of the funds raised by Sensenig were returned to investors.

The SEC also charged investor Alvin Ausbon for his role in the scheme, which included signing false promissory notes and diverting proceeds from the sale of PGI Energy stock back to the company and Gandy., Gandy is also the CEO of Houston-based Pythagoras Group, which purports to be an investment banking firm. McZeal is an attorney licensed in Texas. The complaint alleges that Gandy and McZeal made material misstatements and provided false documents to attorneys and a transfer agent who relied on them to conclude that PGI Energy shares could be issued without restrictive legends. The SEC alleges that Gandy and McZeal backdated promissory notes that purported to memorialize debt supposedly owed by PGI Energy and a prior business venture. They also are alleged to have added false debt to PGI Energys balance sheet, and signed bogus gift letters and certifications of non-shell status, all in an effort to get unrestricted, free-trading PGI Energy shares unlawfully released into the market. Ausbon is charged with furthering the scheme by signing bogus promissory notes and remitting proceeds from the sale of PGI Energy shares back to the company and Gandy., According to the complaint, the scheme collapsed in February 2012 when the SEC ordered a temporary suspension of trading in PGI Energys securities, due to questions regarding the accuracy and adequacy of the companys representations in press releases and other public statements., The SECs complaint charges all defendants with violating Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, a financial penalty, and penny stock bars against all three defendants and officer and director bars against Gandy and McZeal., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SECs complaint, McZeal has consented to the entry of a final judgment enjoining him from future violations of Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. He has also agreed to pay disgorgement plus prejudgment interest thereon of $19,919.37 and a civil penalty of $70,000. In addition, McZeal has agreed to permanent officer and director and penny stock bars. This settlement is subject to court approval.

In the days leading up to a public announcement of BHPs bid, Cañas purchased Potash contracts-for-difference (CFDs), which were highly leveraged securities not traded in the U.S. but based on the price of U.S. exchange-listed Potash stock. The CFDs mirrored the movement and pricing of that stock. Cañas also tipped his close personal friend Julio Marín Ugedo about the potential acquisition and advised him to purchase Potash stock. Cañas and Marín sold their Potash securities after the public announcement for illicit profits of nearly $1 million combined., The SECs enforcement action against Cañas and Marín arises from its continuing investigation into suspicious Potash trading ahead of the Aug. 17, 2010, public announcement of BHPs acquisition bid. A former Banco Santander analyst agreed to pay more than $625,000 to settle insider trading charges by the SEC., According to the SECs complaint against Cañas and Marín filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Australia-based BHP made an unsolicited $38.6 billion offer to purchase all of the stock of Canada-based Potash for $130 per share in cash. On a number of occasions between August 5 and August 17, Banco Santanders CEO and at least three other bank executives discussed the status of BHPs proposal with Cañas. On August 9, one executive informed Cañas that the $10.5 billion financing commitment requested by BHP had been approved by Banco Santanders executive committee. On August 11, Cañas attended a lunch meeting during which bank executives discussed the Potash acquisition, including the timing of the deal. , The SEC alleges that Cañas purchased 30,000 Potash CFDs from August 9 to August 13 based on material, non-public information he learned about BHPs offer to acquire Potash. Cañas liquidated his entire CFD position in Potash following the August 17 public announcement for an illicit profit of $917,239.44. Cañas also communicated frequently with Marín that month, and Marín has admitted that he and Cañas discussed investing in Potash prior to his purchase of 1,393 shares of Potash common stock through two Spain-based brokerage accounts. By trading Potash stock based on material, non-public information, Marín generated net trading profits of $43,566 (a 28.47 percent return) in just one week., The SECs complaint alleges that Cañas and Marín violated Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3.

Taber is a resident of Salisbury Mills, New York and Yulee, Florida, and has been licensed as a certified public accountant by the State of New York since 1974., The SEC alleged in its application that Taber violated a July 21, 2004 Commission Order issued under Rule 102(e)(3)(i) of the Commissions Rules of Practice (the 2004 Order) that permanently suspended Taber from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant. According to the application, at the time of the 2004 Order, Taber was employed as the controller of Sono-Tek Corporation, an issuer that filed periodic reports with the Commission. Despite the 2004 Order, he continued to work in that capacity until 2005. Tabers responsibilities at Sono-Tek during that period included drafting quarterly and annual statements on Forms 10-Q and 10-K and preparing income statements, balance sheets, statements of cash flow, and footnotes to those financial statements. After Taber left Sono-Tek in 2005, he went to work for Jefferson Wells International, Inc., a professional services firm that outsourced specialists to perform accounting and other work.

22775,2013,[<h3>SEC Charges Former Executive of Massachusetts-Based Company with Insider Trading</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Joseph M. Tocci, a former executive of Massachusetts-based American Superconductor Corporation, with insider trading ahead of an April 5, 2011 company announcement that caused the companys stock price to tumble 42% and reaped Tocci over $80,000 in profits. Tocci has agreed to settle the charges by, among other things, paying a total of over $170,000 in disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty., In a Complaint filed on August 12, 2013, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts in Boston, the SEC alleges that Tocci, age 59, of Belmont, Massachusetts, used confidential information he obtained as the assistant treasurer of American Superconductor to purchase option contracts through which Tocci essentially bet that the companys stock price would soon decrease on the release of negative news. According to the SECs Complaint, on or about March 31, 2011, Tocci learned through communications with American Superconductors chief financial officer (CFO) that the companys largest customer, Sinovel Wind Group Co. Ltd., had refused to accept shipments scheduled for delivery by the close of the companys fiscal year on March 31, 2011, and had failed to pay past due amounts for earlier shipments. These developments, the CFO said, would likely require a public announcement from American Superconductor within the next few days. The CFO instructed Tocci to keep this information confidential. On April 1, 2011, the Complaint alleges, Tocci improperly used this material, nonpublic information to purchase 100 put option contracts, which increased in value as American Superconductors stock price decreased. On April 5, 2011, after the close of trading, the company announced that its financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended March 31, 2011 would be lower than expected due to a deteriorating relationship with Sinovel. The next day, American Superconductors stock price plummeted 42%. By then selling his 100 put option contracts, Tocci earned illegal profits of approximately $82,439., Tocci has agreed to settle this case by consenting to a judgment enjoining him from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering him to pay disgorgement of $82,439 (representing his ill-gotten gains) plus prejudgment interest of $6,109 and a civil penalty of $82,439. Tocci also agreed to plead guilty in a parallel criminal case brought by the U.S. Attorneys Office for the District of Massachusetts in connection with the same conduct. , The SECs investigation was conducted by Asita Obeyesekere, Michael Foster, and Kevin Kelcourse in the SECs Boston Regional Office. The Commission acknowledges the assistance and cooperation of the U.S. Attorneys Office for the District of Massachusetts and the Federal Bureau of Investigations Boston Field Office.

Goldsmith of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan sentenced Gregory N. McKnight to 188 months (15 years and 8 months) in prison, followed by supervised release of 3 years, and ordered McKnight to pay $48,969,560 in restitution to his victims.  McKnight, 53, of Swartz Creek, Michigan, had previously pled guilty to one count of wire fraud for his role in orchestrating a $72 million Ponzi scheme involving at least 3,000 investors.  The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Michigan filed criminal charges against McKnight on February 14, 2012.  McKnight was taken into custody immediately after the sentencing hearing., The criminal charges arose out of the same facts that were the subject of an emergency action that the Commission filed against McKnight and others on May 5, 2008.  On that same day, the Court issued orders freezing McKnight’s assets and those of several companies he controlled, and appointed a Receiver.  The Commission’s complaint alleged that, from December 2005 through November 2007, McKnight, through his company Legisi Holdings, conducted a fraudulent, unregistered offering of securities in which he raised approximately $72 million from more than 3,000 investors in all 50 states and several foreign countries.  According to the Commissions complaint, McKnight represented that he would invest the offering proceeds in various investment vehicles and pay interest of as much as 15 percent per month from the resulting profits.  The complaint charged that McKnight invested less than half of the offering proceeds and that these investments resulted in millions of dollars in losses.  The Commissions complaint further charged that McKnight used investor funds to make Ponzi payments to investors and for his own use.  The Commission’s complaint charged McKnight with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  , On July 6, 2011, the Court entered a final judgment against McKnight in the Commission’s action, and ordered McKnight to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties totaling approximately $6.5 million.  The court also issued orders permanently enjoining McKnight from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

A federal district court granted the SECs motion for emergency relief, halting the fraud., The SEC alleges that since 2011 Davian, a 34-year old resident of Copley, Ohio, has raised more than $1.5 million from investors by promoting Davian Capital Advisors, LLC as a highly successful investment management firm that manages a portfolio of profitable hedge funds. The SEC further alleges that Davian and Davian Capital misappropriated at least $1 million in investor proceeds and used the funds to pay for personal expenses such as the purchase of a luxury home and automobile for Davian., According to the SECs complaint, filed in federal district court, since 2011 Davian has raised at least $1.5 million from investors in several private funds managed by Davian Capital. Davian provided investors with marketing materials touting the funds supposedly high returns and profitable trading strategies. The returns and profits described in the marketing materials were fictitious. Davian misappropriated most of the money received from investors and used the investors funds to pay for personal expenses.  For example, Davian pressured three individuals to invest $225,000 into his private funds, telling them that if they acted fast he would give them a break on his firms management fees. Immediately upon receiving the investors proceeds on July 5, 2013, Davian used the funds to pay for the construction of his residence., The SEC filed an action against Davian and Davian Capital in federal district court in Akron, Ohio on August 13, alleging that they violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.

On August 16, 2013, Judge Hughes entered a final judgment imposing monetary and other relief., In rendering summary judgment in favor of the Commission, the Court found that Gilchrist, acting as the president and chairman of Mortgage Xpress, Inc. (subsequently renamed The Alternative Energy Technology Center, Inc.), authorized the unregistered offer and sale of six million company shares to himself and two entities he controlled, improperly maintaining that the offer and sale were exempt from registration under Rule 504 of Regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933. The Court further found that the company could not claim a Rule 504 exemption from registration because it was a development stage company at the time of the sale in February 2008., The Court further found that Gilchrist effected match trades in company securities through brokerage accounts he controlled, thereby driving the per share price from $1.00 per share immediately after a reverse stock split on January 18, 2008 to $2.41 per share, at which point Gilchrist arranged for promoters to tout the company to further drive up the price to $3.75 per share before the Commission suspended trading in the stock. Into this inflated market, Gilchrist made unregistered sales of 229,661 shares, which the Court found generated illicit proceeds of $692,146.38., The final judgment entered by the Court bars Gilchrist from serving as an officer or director of any company that is required to register its securities with the Commission, from acting as a broker or dealer, and from trading in stocks with a per share price less than five dollars. The final judgment also orders Gilchrist to pay to the Commission $842,493.40 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest., The SEC thanks the Financial Industry Regulatory Authoritys (FINRA) Office of Fraud Detection and Market Intelligence for its assistance in this matter., For further information, see Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2013/lr22599.htm>22599</a> (January 23, 2013).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2013/lr22788.htm</i><br/>]"

Dearman, Sr. and his close friend, Marya Gray, in connection with fraudulent securities offerings that raised at least $4.7 million from more than 30 of Dearmans advisory clients., The complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court in Tulsa, Oklahoma, alleges that Dearman invested his clients in various businesses that Gray owned in Bartlesville, Oklahoma. According to the Commission, Dearman and Gray misled investors about the safety of the investments and how their funds would be used, telling them, for instance, that investor funds would be used to purchase equipment for one of Grays companies, Bartnet Wireless Internet, Inc. In truth, however, Gray and Dearman squandered the vast majority of investor funds on gambling, personal expenses, and Ponzi payments.  The complaint also alleges that Dearman stole roughly $700,000 from some of his clients through various ruses., The complaint alleges that Dearman and Gray violated or aided and abetted violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

He also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years., The Commissions complaint, filed August 30, 2013, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that DeZwirek engaged in insider trading by purchasing CECO stock ahead of two press releases issued in March and October 2008 announcing new contract bookings. The Complaint further alleges that DeZwirek bought API stock before the company announced the acquisition of a privately held company in January 2011.  The Complaint also alleges that DeZwirek failed to file amended Schedules 13D and Forms 4 and 5 disclosing 268 purchases and sales of CECO and API stock that he executed between 2008 and 2010., DeZwirek has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Sections 10(b), 13(d), and 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rules 10b-5, 13d-2, and 16a-3 thereunder.

Feldstein and his entities then engaged in illegal free-riding by purchasing stock through the broker-dealers with no intention of paying for the stock if its price declined substantially after the trade date. Unbeknownst to these broker-dealers, Feldstein and his entities did not have sufficient assets to pay for their purchases and instead intended to walk away from transactions unless they were able to make a corresponding profitable sale, and use those sales proceeds to pay for their purchases. In total, between September 2008 and February 2009, Feldstein, Mara Capital, and Vita Healths broker-dealers suffered more than $2 million in losing trades. , According to the Commissions complaint, Feldstein also induced investors to give him approximately $450,000, based upon his various false promises to use that money to (1) purchase stock for them in a certain penny-stock issuer; (2) invest in a fashion companys initial public offering (IPO); and (3) invest in a hedge fund that Feldstein falsely described as substantial and successful. Feldstein never intended to purchase stock for these investors with this money, invest their money in an IPO, or invest their money in a hedge fund, and he never did so. Rather, he converted that money (much of which the investors had intended for retirement or their childrens education) for his own personal use., The SECs complaint charges the defendants Ronald Feldstein, Mara Capital Management LLC, and Vita Health of America LLC with committing violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and, as to Feldstein, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.

Butts, Jr.; Fotios Geievelis, Jr., a/k/a Frank Anastasio; Worldwide Funding III Limited LLC; Douglas J. Anisky; Sidney Banner, Express Commercial Capital LLC; and James Baggs raised over $3.5 million from approximately 45 investors in both the United States and abroad.  Worldwide Funding, through Geivelis, told investors that they would receive returns of 6.6 million Euros (approximately $8.7 million U.S. dollars) on a $60,000-$90,000 investment within 15 to 45 days, and then approximately 14% returns per week for 40 to 42 weeks.  Butts, who also solicited investors, acted as the escrow agent for the transaction.  Both Geivelis and Butts assured investors that their funds would remain in escrow in Butts’ account until Worldwide Funding had acquired the bank instruments necessary to generate the promised returns.  In reality, Butts transferred funds out of his trust account almost as soon as they were received, giving approximately 45% to Geivelis, 10% to sales agents, and retaining approximately 45% for himself.  The SEC alleges that no funds were used to acquire bank instruments and that Geivelis used investor funds to travel and gamble.  Anisky, Banner, Express Commercial Capital, and Baggs all sold interests in the fraudulent scheme., The SEC’s complaint charges all defendants with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Additionally, the complaint alleges that the primary function of the defendants’ scheme was to convince investors to invest in a fraudulent pooled investment that purportedly invested in metals, commodities, real estate, and a fund that, among other things, invested overseas.  The defendants then siphoned off the invested funds for their own purposes and to continue to perpetuate the fraud.  According to the complaint, none of the securities offered was covered by a registration statement filed with the Commission, and Hass, Projaris’ National Sales Director of Tomahawk, Wisconsin, solicited investors to invest in Projaris, but was not a registered broker-dealer., The complaint alleges that Projaris, Victory, and the Lawlers violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act).

Elrod and Pack reside in Buffalo Creek, Colorado and Highland, California, respectively., The Complaint alleges that, from at least March 2009 through November 2009, Elrod and Pack raised approximately $2 million from 12 investors who invested in high-yield promissory notes issued by CFS Holding Company LLC (“CFS”), a Colorado company owned and managed by Elrod.  According to the Complaint, Elrod told investors that their investments were secured and guaranteed and would generate annual returns ranging from 12% to 24%.  According to the Complaint, Elrod further represented to investors that the proceeds from their promissory notes would be used to expand a group of financial services companies owned and managed by Elrod.  The Complaint alleges that the foregoing representations, among others, were false and misleading when made, and that Elrod, rather than use investor money for legitimate business purposes, improperly used most of the investor funds to make substantial payments to himself and family members and to pay for personal expenses, to pay Pack significant commissions for referring investors, and to make interest payments back to investors.  According to the Complaint, the CFS note offering was not registered with the Commission, and Pack was not an associated person of a registered broker or dealer at the time he participated in the CFS note offering., Without admitting or denying the SEC’s allegations, Elrod and Pack agreed to settle the case against them.

The 40-count indictment charges Theodule with securities fraud, wire fraud, and money laundering.  According to the indictment, Theodule, among other things, falsely presented himself as a financial expert who would double investors’ funds within three months by placing trades through their investment accounts.  The indictment also alleges that Theodule operated a Ponzi scheme that raised more than $30 million from thousands of investors.  Theodule allegedly perpetrated the fraud through Creative Capital Consortium, LLC and Creative Capital Concept$, LLC (the “Creative Capital entities”), among other entities he controlled., In December 2008, the Commission halted Theodule’s on-going fraud at Creative Capital when it filed an emergency civil enforcement action against him and his companies.  The SEC’s complaint alleged that the defendants had raised more than $23 million from thousands of mostly Haitian-American investors through a fraudulent, unregistered offering of securities nationwide, and operated a Ponzi scheme, having lost at least $18 million trading stocks and options through a network of purported investment clubs.  The SEC obtained a restraining order to halt the fraudulent activity, and thereafter a receiver was appointed by the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida to identify and trace assets.

The Indictment also seeks forfeiture of properties obtained as a result of the alleged criminal violations., The Indictment alleges that from at least January 1998 through August 2009, Zada caused over twenty investors to invest over $20 million based on materially false statements and omissions. According to the Indictment, Zada attracted investors by projecting an image of great wealth, portraying himself as a successful businessman and investor with connections to Saudi Arabian oil ventures. He also hosted extravagant parties, drove expensive luxury vehicles, and maintained expensive homes in Wellington, Florida and Grosse Pointe, Michigan. The investors sent money to Zada with the understanding that he would use the funds to invest in various oil ventures on their behalf. The investors usually received promissory notes reflecting the principal amount of their investment. Zada deposited investors funds into bank accounts he controlled.  Instead of investing the funds in oil ventures, Zada used the money to support his lavish lifestyle and to make purported returns on investments to prior investors., The Indictments allegations are based on the same conduct underlying the Commissions November 10, 2010 Complaint against Zada in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan.

Scott registered his firm ACI Capital Group as an investment adviser and then embarked on a series of fraudulent schemes targeting individual investors and small businesses.  Scott repeatedly touted ACI’s registration under the securities laws and falsely claimed the firm’s assets under management to be as high as $3.7 billion to bolster his credibility when offering too-good-to-be-true investment opportunities.  As Scott solicited funds from investors after promising them very high rates of return, he simply stole their money almost as soon as they deposited it with ACI.  Scott paid no returns to investors and illegally used their money to fund such personal expenses as his children’s private school tuition, air travel and hotels, department store purchases, and several thousand dollars in dental bills., In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York today announced Scott has pleaded guilty to criminal charges.  Among the charges to which Scott has pleaded guilty is making false statements to SEC examiners when they questioned whether Scott and ACI had accepted loans from investors.  SEC examiners notified the agency’s Enforcement Division, which began investigating and referred the matter to criminal authorities., According to the SEC’s complaint filed in federal court in Brooklyn, one variation of Scott’s fraud was a so-called advance fee scheme – Scott promised investors that ACI would provide multi-million dollar loans to people seeking bank financing.  But investors were told that they first needed to advance ACI a percentage of the loan amount, and once they did so they would receive the remaining balance of the amount that Scott promised to pay.  Scott had no intention of ever returning the money, nor did he repay it., The SEC alleges that in another iteration of his fraud, Scott offered investors the opportunity to make a bridge loan to a third-party entity.  The investor was told to fund one portion of the loan, and ACI would supposedly fund the remaining balance.  In exchange, the investor would supposedly receive a substantial return on his initial investment.  In this scheme as with each of his others, investors never received returns and Scott stole the money., The SEC’s complaint charges Scott with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5, Section 207 of the Investment Advisers Act for filing a false Form ADV, and aiding and abetting ACI’s improper registration in violation of Section 203A of the Advisers Act. , The SEC’s investigation was conducted in the New York office by Sharon Binger, Adam Grace, Justin Alfano, Elzbieta Wraga, and Jordan Baker.  The investigation stemmed from a referral by the SEC’s examination staff including Raymond Slezak, Michael O’Donnell, Kathleen Raimondi, and Ken Fong.  The SEC’s litigation will be led by Alexander Vasilescu.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2013/lr22799.htm</i><br/>]"

accounted for 99 percent of its revenues.  , According to the Commission’s complaint, when Imperial Petroleum purchased Middletown, Ind.-based E-Biofuels LLC as a subsidiary in 2010, E-Biofuels’ owners falsely represented that they were producing renewable fuel from raw agricultural products such as soybean oil and chicken fat.  E-Biofuels received significant government incentives based on its biodiesel production representations.  But E-Biofuels actually used middlemen to buy finished biodiesel and portrayed those purchases in fake invoices as the raw “feedstock” needed to produce biodiesel.  E-Biofuels later sold the purchased biodiesel for as high as double the price it paid for it.  When Imperial’s CEO Jeffrey Wilson learned that E-Biofuels was not producing biodiesel from raw materials, he allowed the scheme to continue instead of taking corrective action.  Imperial’s annual revenue increased from $1 million to more than $100 million and its stock price soared as the company falsely told investors that E-Biofuels was in the business of environmentally friendly biodiesel production.  Imperial’s stock price plummeted to less than 10 cents per share after the scheme fell apart, resulting in a market loss of approximately $60 million. , The Commission’s complaint filed in federal court in Indianapolis charges Imperial Petroleum and Wilson as well as three former

LLC, Cima Green LLC, and CIMA Energy Group – and their operators Joseph Furando and Evelyn Pattison (a/k/a Katirina Tracy) for acting as the middlemen in the scheme.  They allegedly provided false and misleading documents to deceive government regulators and attract investors to Imperial., In a separate action, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Indiana announced criminal charges.  , According to the Commission’s complaint, Imperial falsely stated in its annual reports for fiscal years 2010 and 2011 that E-Biofuels produced and sold more than 28 million gallons of biodiesel from May 24, 2010 (the closing date of Imperial’s acquisition of E-Biofuels) to July 31, 2011 (end of the fiscal year).  More than 99 percent of Imperial’s revenues came from E-Biofuels during this time period.  Wilson, the Duceys, Carmichael, and others under their direction misrepresented to customers that the product they were selling was valid renewable fuel produced by E-Biofuels.  In reality, the vast majority was biodiesel bought from the New Jersey companies and fraudulently recertified with new incentives and tax credits.  The biodiesel was purchased and then resold unchanged to customers for more than $100 million.  , The Commission complaint also alleges that the scheme generated gross illicit profits of more than $50 million by buying the biodiesel at or near market price, fabricating invoices describing the transactions as the purchase of soybean oil or some other legitimate type of feedstock, and falsely certifying to the Environmental Protection Agency that E-Biofuels had produced biodiesel.  On some occasions, E-Biofuels pretended to blend the biodiesel in order to receive improper tax credits, or sold the fuel with the tax credits to end users.  From November 2009 to January 2012, E-Biofuels created more than 52 million fraudulent renewable energy credits and $35 million in false tax credits.  This illegal business model was never disclosed to Imperial’s investors or auditors., According to the complaint, Wilson knew by at least mid-June 2010 that E-Biofuels was not operating in the manner described in its annual report for 2010.  Nonetheless, he signed and certified the accuracy of the 10-K filing.  For the next three quarters and in the 10-K a year later, Imperial filed similar disclosures falsely describing the business as “biodiesel production” and misrepresenting that it used raw feedstock – primarily “premium white grease (chicken fat)” – to produce biodiesel.  Wilson signed and certified the accuracy of these reports.  Wilson also gave a false portrayal of the company when he had direct contact with prospective investors, including a power-point presentation with a video about E-Biofuels purportedly producing biodiesel from waste oils and greases.  In reality, E-Biofuels’ business was almost entirely illegal and unsustainable.  , The Commission complaint charges Imperial with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b), 13(a), and 13(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and various rules thereunder.  Wilson, the Duceys, and Carmichael are charged with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b) and 13(b) of the Exchange Act, and various rules thereunder.  They also are charged with aiding and abetting violations of the Exchange Act.  The complaint charges Furando, Pattison, and the three New Jersey companies with aiding and abetting violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5., The Commission seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, financial penalties, and permanent injunctions against further violations of the securities laws.  The SEC seeks to bar Wilson, the Duceys, and Carmichael from acting as officers or directors of a public company., The Commission’s investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Scott J. Hlavacek and James A. Davidson of the Chicago Regional Office.  The SEC’s litigation will be led by John E. Birkenheier and Anne Graber Blazek.  The investigation of the criminal action was conducted by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Indiana, the Department of Justice’s Environmental Crimes Division, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Department of Agriculture., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2013/comp-pr2013-184.pdf>SEC Complaint</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2013/lr22800.htm</i><br/>]"

The company has failed to obtain FDA approval to market and sell the CTLM® in the United States. From October 2008 to December 2009, Imaging Diagnostic Systems repeatedly disclosed in filings and letters to shareholders that it expected to file by specific deadlines a premarket approval application with the FDA to obtain permission to market and sell the CTLM®. The company failed to meet its projected deadlines.  In fact, CEO Linda Grable and CFO Allan Schwartz knew there was no basis for the projections because Imaging Diagnostic Systems did not have enough cancer cases to finish its clinical trials and could not pay for the clinical sites., The SEC further alleges that beginning in early 2010, Imaging Diagnostic Systems stopped remitting payroll taxes to the IRS for its employees. The companys failure to pay payroll taxes constituted a known commitment, event, or uncertainty of the type that should have been disclosed in the Managements Discussion and Analysis sections of the companys periodic filings, which were signed by Grable and Schwartz.   However, the company did not publicly disclose that it failed to remit payroll taxes until more than 16 months later, and even then still failed to disclose the risks associated with its failure to pay payroll taxes., The SECs complaint also alleges that Grable and Schwartz failed to file beneficial ownership reports in 2009, 2010, and 2011 despite having received stock or options., The SECs complaint charges Imaging Diagnostic Systems, Grable, and Schwartz with violating Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5(b). The complaint alleges that Imaging Diagnostic Systems violated Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13. The complaint alleges that Imaging Diagnostic Systems and Grable violated Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9; Grable and Schwartz violated Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-14, 13b2-1, and 16a-3; and Grable and Schwartz aided and abetted the companys violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5(b), 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13.

According to the Commission’s complaint, Benjamin and Oneal Staples operated what they called the Estate Assistance Program from early 2008 to mid-2012.  They recruited at least 44 individuals into the program and purchased approximately $26.5 million in bonds from at least 35 issuers., The Complaint further alleges that Defendants required the terminally ill individuals to sign documents relinquishing any ownership interest in the assets in the joint account, including the bonds that Defendants later purchased.  According to the complaint, Defendants purchased discounted corporate bonds containing a “survivor’s option” that allowed them to redeem the bonds for the full principal amount prior to maturity under such circumstances as the death of a joint owner of the bond.  The Commission alleges that after a terminally ill participant died, Defendants wrote a letter to the brokerage firm where the joint account was held, requesting the bonds to be redeemed under the survivor’s option.  In the redemption request letters, Defendants falsely represented that the deceased participant was an “owner” of the bonds.  Defendants did not inform the brokerage firms or bond issuers that the deceased program participants had signed the estate assistance agreements and participant letters relinquishing all ownership interest in the bonds., The Commission’s complaint charges Benjamin and Oneal Staples with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.  The Commission is seeking disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, financial penalties and permanent injunctions.  The Commission’s complaint names another son of Benjamin Staples, Brian Staples, also of Lexington, South Carolina, as a relief defendant for the purposes of recovering $400,000 in illicit profits that were transferred into his possession.  Brian Staples had no active role in the scheme., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2013/comp22805.pdf>SEC Complaint</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2013/lr22805.htm</i><br/>]"
22806,2013,[<h3>SEC Charges Former Technology Company Executive for Role in Rajaratnam Insider Trading Scheme</h3>],"[On September 20, 2013, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged a former executive at a Massachusetts-based technology firm for illegally tipping non-public information about the company’s financial predicament as part of the insider trading scheme operated by now-imprisoned Galleon Management hedge fund founder Raj Rajaratnam., The SEC alleges that Kieran Taylor, who was the senior director of marketing for Akamai Technologies, illegally tipped his close friend – hedge fund portfolio manager Danielle Chiesi – with confidential information about the company’s plans to lower its revenue guidance for 2008.  Chiesi in turn tipped Rajaratnam with the non-public information so they and others could trade ahead of the negative news and make millions of dollars in illegal profits.  Taylor also traded on the non-public information by selling 2,500 shares of Akamai stock that he held in a personal brokerage account to avoid losses of $20,635., Taylor, who lives in New York, New York, has agreed to settle the SEC’s charges by paying more than $145,000 and being barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  The settlement is subject to court approval., According to the SEC’s complaint against Taylor filed in federal court in Manhattan, he obtained confidential information in July 2008 from internal company sources indicating that Akamai would fall short of previous revenue projections it made publicly.  Akamai was planning to update its revenue guidance for 2008 when it announced its second quarter financial results on July 30.  Based on this inside information, Taylor sold his Akamai stock in the days leading up to the announcement.  Taylor also tipped Chiesi, a lifelong family friend who was then a portfolio manager at hedge fund advisory firm New Castle Funds.  Chiesi then prompted New Castle to short sell Akamai stock., According to the SEC’s complaint, the inside information leaked by Taylor continued to make its way around the Rajaratnam insider trading circle. Chiesi tipped other hedge fund managers including Rajaratnam with the inside information so Galleon Management and other firms could short Akamai stock.  Chiesi called Rajaratnam and relayed what she had learned from Taylor, noting that Akamai was “going to guide down a lot” at the company’s upcoming quarterly earnings announcement.  Chiesi similarly provided Taylor’s Akamai information to another friend, Steven Fortuna of the hedge fund advisory firm S2 Capital.  Chiesi, Rajaratnam, and Fortuna collectively shorted hundreds of thousands of shares of Akamai stock based on the non-public information illegally tipped by Taylor.  Their hedge funds consequently reaped approximately $10 million in illicit profits.  , The SEC charged Rajaratnam and Chiesi with insider trading in October 2009, and Fortuna was charged with insider trading a month later.  The SEC has charged a total of 34 firms and individuals in its Galleon-related enforcement actions, which have exposed widespread and repeated insider trading by numerous hedge funds as well as traders, investment professionals, and corporate insiders located throughout the country.  The insider trading occurred in the securities of more than 15 companies for illicit profits totaling more than $96 million., The SEC’s complaint charges Taylor with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.  Taylor agreed to pay $20,635 in disgorgement, $4,190.26 in prejudgment interest, and a $120,635 penalty.  Without admitting or denying the charges, Taylor also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and to be permanently enjoined from future violations of these provisions of the federal securities laws.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2013/lr22806.htm</i><br/>]"
22807,2013,[<h3>SEC Charges Former Qualcomm Executive and His Financial Advisor with Insider Trading Through Secret Offshore Accounts</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a former executive vice president at Qualcomm Inc. and his former financial advisor with insider trading ahead of major announcements by the San Diego-based wireless technology company for more than a quarter-million dollars in profits., The SEC alleges that Jing Wang, a former executive vice president and president of global business operations at Qualcomm, used a secret offshore brokerage account to make illegal trades based on confidential information that he learned on the job.  Gary Yin, a former registered representative at Merrill Lynch, helped Wang set up the account.  Yin also created a secret offshore account of his own and traded on the non-public information gleaned from Wang.  When Wang eventually realized that insider trading in the offshore accounts still may be discovered by the SEC or other regulators, he concocted a plan to conceal his trading activity by claiming the trades were made by his brother.  Wang even convinced Yin to travel to China and go over the account statements with Wang’s brother so he could explain the trades if asked by investigators., In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of California today announced criminal charges against Wang and Yin., According to the SEC’s complaint, Wang and Yin became friends in 2005 as members of the same church.  When Wang learned that Yin was a financial advisor at Merrill Lynch, he asked Yin to manage his money and opened a number of brokerage accounts at the firm’s San Diego branch office.  Each account was disclosed to Qualcomm because, as a company officer, Wang was restricted in his ability to trade Qualcomm stock and required to pre-clear all Qualcomm trades with the company.  , The SEC alleges that in early 2006, Wang approached Yin about hiding cash transactions.  Yin suggested that Wang create an entity registered in the British Virgin Islands (BVI) and use the name of a non-U.S. citizen family member as the beneficial owner.  Then he could open a brokerage account in the newly created entity’s name.  Yin then helped Wang set up a secret account in the name of a BVI company called Unicorn Global Enterprises, and Wang’s older brother was listed as the owner.  Yin similarly created his own BVI-registered entity named Pacific Rim and put it in his mother-in-law’s name.  Yin opened a Merrill Lynch brokerage account for Pacific Rim and used it to hide funds that he was using for investments., The SEC alleges that Wang and Yin used their secret offshore accounts to trade on material, non-public information that Wang learned as an executive at Qualcomm.  In early 2010, Wang was aware that Qualcomm executives were planning a board proposal to increase Qualcomm’s quarterly dividends and request authority to initiate a stock repurchase program.  Qualcomm informed Wang and all executives that they would not be permitted to trade Qualcomm stock.  On March 1, Wang attended a Qualcomm board meeting where the quarterly dividend increase and stock repurchase were approved.  Wang immediately instructed Yin to use all of the funds in the offshore Unicorn account to purchase Qualcomm stock.  Yin knew that Wang did not pre-clear these trades and realized that the purchase was out of character for Wang because he previously never purchased Qualcomm stock on the open market in his Merrill Lynch accounts.  Within the hour of executing the trades for Wang, Yin himself bought Qualcomm stock on the basis of the material, non-public information.  The stock price increased 6.7 percent after Qualcomm publicly announced the quarterly cash dividend and stock repurchase program.  Wang and Yin profited when they sold all of their shares.<br/>   <br/> According to the SEC’s complaint, Wang used the funds from that sale to conduct insider trading again – this time in the shares of San Jose-based Atheros Communications, which was the highly confidential target of a planned acquisition by Qualcomm. Wang was regularly briefed on the transaction internally tabbed as “Project Tango” to protect its confidentiality.  Wang instructed Yin to sell all of his Qualcomm stock in the Unicorn account on Dec. 2, 2010, and prepare to buy as many shares of Atheros stock as possible with the funds in that account.  He told Yin that he was leaving on a trip to China and would contact him to execute the Atheros trade.  On December 6, Wang attended a Qualcomm board meeting in Hong Kong and a resolution was passed to pursue the acquisition. Wang learned that Qualcomm planned to acquire Atheros at $45 per share.  Wang and Yin immediately communicated several times through phone calls and a text message, and Wang then purchased the maximum number of shares he could purchase with the existing funds in the Unicorn account at prices between $34 and $35 per share.  At Wang’s encouragement, Yin also purchased Atheros stock for himself in his offshore account.  When the news became public in early January, Atheros stock increased more than 20 percent.  Yin sold all of his Atheros shares in the Pacific Rim account on January 12, and Wang sold his Atheros shares in the Unicorn account on January 25., According to the SEC’s complaint, Wang took his next insider trading step merely four minutes after selling the Atheros stock, using the proceeds to purchase Qualcomm shares in advance of a company announcement that it would raise its revenue and earnings guidance for the 2011 fiscal year.  Wang had learned the confidential information prior to the board meeting he attended in Hong Kong, where Qualcomm’s better-than-expected first quarter financial performance was further discussed.  Wang learned that Qualcomm planned to announce its earnings results on January 26, and thus purchased his Qualcomm shares the day before the announcement.  After Qualcomm issued a press release to announcing its positive first quarter results, Qualcomm’s stock increased 5.9 percent., The SEC alleges that Wang made more than $244,000 in illegal profits through the insider trading scheme, and Yin realized gains of more than $27,000.  Wang eventually realized that his illegal trading may be detected by Merrill Lynch or others.  Wang first asked Yin to delete records of the trades in the Unicorn account, but because they were permanent records in Merrill Lynch’s systems they could not be erased.  Around January 2012, Wang directed Yin to establish a new BVI corporation named Clearview Resources and open a new account at Merrill Lynch to which they transferred the insider trading proceeds in the Unicorn account to further distance Wang from the suspicious trades.  A few months later, Wang informed Yin that the trades may have been detected because the SEC had subpoenaed his e-mails.  So Wang devised a cover story and convinced Yin if ever questioned to say that the Atheros trades were made by Wang’s brother.  Because Yin had never communicated with Wang’s brother, Wang instructed him to travel to China with the Unicorn account statements and review the trades with his brother so he could explain the trading if asked.  Yin did so in May 2012.  To further hide Wang’s ownership of the Unicorn account and his link to the Atheros trades, Yin removed the Unicorn account from Wang’s “household” in Merrill Lynch’s computer system in July 2012. “Householding” is a function used by Merrill Lynch to link related accounts.   , The SECs complaint charges Wang, who lives in Del Mar, Calif., with violating Sections 10(b) and 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 16a-3.  Yin, who lives in San Diego, is charged with violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5.  The SEC’s complaint seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, financial penalties, and permanent injunctions.  The SEC also seeks an officer-and-director bar against Wang. , The SEC’s investigation has been conducted by Ann C.

22810,2013,[<h3>SEC Charges TD Bank and Former Executive for Roles in Rothstein Ponzi Scheme in South Florida</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged TD Bank and a former executive with violating securities laws in connection with a massive South Florida-based Ponzi scheme conducted by Scott Rothstein, who is now serving a 50-year prison sentence., The SEC alleges that TD Bank and its then-regional vice president Frank A. Spinosa defrauded investors by producing a series of misleading documents and making false statements about accounts that Rothstein held at the bank and used to perpetuate his scheme. Spinosa falsely represented to several investors that TD Bank had restricted the movement of the funds in these accounts when, in fact, Rothstein could transfer investor money however he desired. Spinosa also orally assured investors that certain accounts held balances totaling millions of dollars, but each account actually held zero to $100., TD Bank agreed to settle the SECs charges in an administrative proceeding and pay $15 million. The SEC filed a complaint against Spinosa in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida., In previous enforcement actions, the <a href=http://www.sec.gov/News/PressRelease/Detail/PressRelease/1365171482252>SEC has charged two feeder funds</a> to the Rothstein Ponzi scheme., According to the SECs order and complaint, Rothstein claimed to represent plaintiffs who had reached purported legal settlements that were confidential and payable over time by large corporate defendants. He claimed that the purported plaintiffs were willing to sell their periodic payments to investors at a discount in exchange for one lump-sum payment.  The legal settlements were fake and the plaintiffs and defendants were not real. Rothstein told investors that the purported defendants had deposited the entire settlement amounts into attorney trust accounts. Rothstein opened 22 such accounts at Commerce Bank and TD Bank (the two merged in 2008) from November 2007 to October 2009., The SEC alleges that as Rothsteins scheme began to unravel in the fall of 2009, Spinosa made false statements to investors about the safety of their investments that enabled Rothstein to continue raising funds for the scheme. Spinosa executed so-called lock letters from TD Bank purporting to irrevocably restrict Rothsteins trust accounts. Under these conditions, TD Bank could only distribute funds in the accounts to the investors bank account designated in the lock letter. However, the representations were purely false as Spinosa did not apply any procedures to block the accounts or implement any system to restrict Rothstein from moving money out of the trust accounts. Spinosa also misrepresented to Rothsteins investors that the lock letters were commonplace at TD Bank when, in fact, they were never previously used by the bank. In fact, when Spinosa instructed his assistant to prepare the letters on TD Bank letterhead, she questioned whether it was even permissible because she had never seen such a letter before. Spinosa confirmed that she should prepare the letter for his signature anyway. Later, a vice president and branch manager who reported to Spinosa noted to him shortly after the first lock letter went out in August 2009 that the lock instructions put onto an account would have no practical effect because Rothstein could still transfer the money without bank officials being alerted. Spinosa dismissed those concerns., The SEC further alleges that Spinosa provided false assurances to two different groups of investors that certain trust accounts held the multi-million dollar balances claimed by Rothstein. On Aug. 17, 2009, Spinosa participated in a conference call with Rothstein and representatives of an investor group who asked how much money was in a particular account.  Spinosa responded that it held $22 million - the amount the investor was expecting to hear. Spinosa had full access to the account information to know the actual account balance was no more than $100. The following month, Spinosa met with the same group after it made additional investments with Rothstein, and falsely assured the investors that their money was safe because the provisions of the lock letter restricted the movement of their money. Also in September 2009, a different investor group bought a purported $20 million settlement from Rothstein, and one of the investor groups representatives obtained a TD Bank deposit slip that indicated a $0 balance as of that morning for the account that purportedly held the investors $20 million. Rothstein falsely stated that the funds were indeed in the account, but the funds would not appear available on the deposit slip because they were in TD Banks federal wire queue.  Rothstein and representatives from the investor group met with Spinosa on Sept. 14, 2009, and Spinosa falsely represented that the $20 million did not appear as available funds for the same reason provided by Rothstein. Spinosa falsely represented that the lock letter restricted the movement of their money. In reality, TD Bank was not holding the money in such a queue, and the account didnt contain the $20 million., TD Bank consented to the entry of an administrative order finding that it violated Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933. Without admitting or denying the SECs findings, TD Bank agreed to pay $15 million and cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act., The SECs complaint against Spinosa charges him with violating Sections 17(a)(1), 17(a)(2), and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Spinosa also is charged with aiding and abetting Scott Rothsteins violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5. The complaint seeks disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, financial penalties, and a permanent injunction., The SEC coordinated the filing of its cases with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, which today announced their own actions against TD Bank.  , The SECs investigation was conducted by Steven J.

22811,2013,[<h3>SEC Charges Former President of California-Based Investment Firm with Fraud</h3>],"[On September 24, 2013, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged the former president of a purported private equity real estate firm based in San Bernardino, Calif., with defrauding nearly 500 investors who purchased promissory notes under the false premise that they were secured by specific properties or other collateral., The SEC alleges that Larry Polhill used his company American Pacific Financial Corporation (APFC) to buy and sell real estate and distressed assets, and he offered investors the opportunity to invest in the company through unregistered notes that would yield them interest payments of 5 to 17 percent per year. However, the collateral that Polhill and APFC claimed made the investments secure was often non-existent or otherwise impaired. The properties underlying the investments were sometimes even sold without notice to investors. When APFC eventually filed for bankruptcy, it named the investors as unsecured creditors who were owed nearly $160 million. None of Polhills investment offerings were registered with the SEC., Polhill agreed to settle the SECs charges and be barred from acting as the officer or director of any public company. The settlement is subject to the approval of the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, which would decide monetary sanctions at a later date., According to the SECs complaint, in addition to promissory notes, investors also could invest in APFC-sponsored funds that pooled investor money to make loans to APFC. The company made regularly scheduled interest payments to investors in the notes and the funds from the mid-1980s to 2007. As a result, its investor base continually grew and the company began making larger and larger investments in distressed assets by buying numerous companies out of bankruptcy. While a few of APFCs investments were successful, the vast majority failed unbeknownst to investors. Consequently, the assets held by APFC that were securing the notes and loans held by investors decreased in value. In early 2008, APFC ceased making its scheduled payments to most investors, but continued to issue newsletters, pay preferred investors, and engage in other activities designed to create a false sense of security about the investments in the company., The SEC alleges that Polhill made several material misrepresentations to investors. Specifically, he told investors that the notes were secured by collateral when no such security interest existed. He failed to disclose that the collateral securing some investors notes already had been pledged to other lenders. Polhill represented that he would notify investors if their collateral went into default when that was often not the case. For instance, one investors note specifically stated it was secured by property located in Hesperia, Calif., that was owned by APFC and pledged as collateral. However, APFC sold the collateral in 2004, and neither Polhill nor APFC informed the investor that his collateral had been sold and there was no longer any asset securing the note., The SECs complaint charges Polhill with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act. Polhill has consented to the entry of an order that permanently enjoins him from violating these laws and permanently bars him from acting as an officer or director of any public company. , The SECs investigation was conducted by Marc Blau, Sara Kalin, and Peter Del Greco of the Los Angeles Regional Office.

22813,2013,[<h3>SEC Charges CEO of Video Game Company and Purported Consultant in Revenue Inflation Scheme</h3>],"[On September 24, 2013, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged the founder of a religious-themed video game manufacturer and his friend with scheming to falsely inflate the companys revenue by nearly 1,300 percent in a one-year period through sham circular transactions., The SEC alleges that Troy Lyndon, who serves as the companys CEO and CFO, caused Left Behind Games Inc. to issue almost two billion shares of stock to Ronald Zaucha as purported compensation for consulting services to the California-based company. The true purpose of the arrangement was to enable Zaucha to sell millions of unregistered shares of Left Behind Games stock into the market and then kick back a portion of his stock proceeds to the company in order to prop up its revenue at a time when it was in dire need of additional funds., The SECs complaint was filed September 24, 2013. Lyndon lives in Honolulu and Zaucha lives in Maui. The companys stock was suspended by the SEC today., According to the SECs complaint, Left Behind Games was founded in 2001 and touted itself as the only publicly-traded exclusive publisher of Christian modern media and the world leader in the publication of Christian video games and a Christian social network provider. However, financial troubles caused the company to terminate all of its employees and close its office at the end of 2011., The SEC alleges that Lyndon and Zaucha concocted their scheme beginning in 2009 in an apparent last-ditch fraudulent effort to save the company, which was unprofitable and severely undercapitalized at the time. Left Behind Games issued stock to Zaucha for his so-called consulting services, and at Lyndons direction he promptly sold virtually all of his stock for approximately $4.6 million in proceeds. Zaucha then kicked back approximately $3.3 million of these proceeds to the company in three deceiving ways., The SEC alleges that Zaucha first paid the company $871,000 between September 2009 and June 2010 for what his consulting agreement termed as early-sell fees for his excessive sale of stock. Secondly, in December 2010, Zaucha formed a company called Lighthouse Distributors and used the proceeds of his stock sales to finance the purchase of approximately $1.38 million in old and obsolete inventory from Left Behind Games.  Lighthouse simply gave most of these products away to churches and religious organizations, yet Left Behind Games improperly recognized the revenue from these sham transactions and falsely claimed that its revenue had increased nearly 1,300 percent from the prior fiscal year. Zaucha later kicked back another $1 million to Left Behind Games as instructed by Lyndon. Meanwhile, Lyndon allowed Zaucha to retain $1.28 million of his stock sale proceeds for personal uses, which included the purchase of condominiums in Maui and Orange County, Calif., Zaucha performed few, if any, consulting services, according to the SECs complaint. Each of the consulting agreements was vague about the services that Zaucha would provide. One agreement noted that Zaucha had experience in marketing related to non-profit corporations when, in fact, Lyndon understood Zauchas experience to be as a pastor running prison ministries rather than in marketing. Two agreements also vaguely stated that Zaucha would perform services to build an independent rep network to contact church pastors in an effort to offer Left Behind Games products. In reality, Left Behind Games had no network of independent representatives calling potential purchasers of its products., The SECs complaint alleges that Lyndon and Zaucha violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5. The complaint also alleges that Lyndon violated Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 13a-14, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2, and that he aided and abetted Left Behind Games violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13. The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, financial penalties, and penny stock bars against Lyndon and Zaucha, and an officer-and-director bar against Lyndon., The SECs investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Lucee Kirka, Carol Shau, and Marc Blau of the Los Angeles office.

TDI claims to have developed a laser-line system designed to mark first downs in professional and collegiate football games by generating a line on the field visible in the stadium to players and fans and on television., According to the SEC’s complaint, Kirschner and Rubens and their companies directly and through the services of sales agents they hired offered and or sold unregistered TDI stock to approximately 200 investors located throughout the United States, most of whom were senior citizens. From no later than July 2011 until at least November 2012, Kirschner and Rubens and their sales agents raised approximately $2.4 million from investors.  , The complaint also alleges that Kirschner, Rubens and their sales agents lured investors by making several material misrepresentations and omissions, including failing to disclose that they retained or paid their sales agents commissions and other fees of at least 75% of the offering proceedings, and, on some occasions, their sales agents misrepresented the status of negotiations with the National Football League and the use of the technology by certain teams and stadiums, or in the 2013 Super Bowl.  , After learning about the undisclosed commissions and misrepresentations, TDI terminated its relationship with Kirschner and Rubens’ company Premiere.  Despite this, Kirschner, Rubens, and their sales agents continued soliciting investors of purported stock on behalf of their new company, Advanced Equity.  They told investors the same misrepresentations they used earlier and generated false trade documents to dupe investors into believing they had purchased shares of TDI, when in fact they had not.  Not only did these investors fail to receive TDI stock certificates, but Kirschner and Rubens used nearly all of investor funds for personal use and to pay their sales agents., The complaint charges Advanced Equity, Premiere, Kirschner and Rubens with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

22817,2013,[<h3>SEC Charges Two Bank Executives for Financial Misstatements and Failure to Disclose Probable Loss on Troubled Loan</h3>],"[On September 24, 2013, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged two former bank executives at Illinois-based Mercantile Bancorp with failing to recognize in financial statements a probable loss on one of the bank’s largest troubled loans.  Former CEO Ted Awerkamp of Amarillo, Texas, and former CFO Michael McGrath of Quincy, Ill., agreed to settle the SEC’s charges by paying penalties of $100,000 each and being barred from acting as an officer or director of a publicly traded company., The SEC alleges that prior to the end of the third quarter in 2010, Awerkamp knew that the borrower in a shared national credit loan for a large residential real estate development to be built in Colorado Springs was unwilling or unable to contribute the necessary funds to complete the project, which served as collateral for the loan.  He also knew that the collateral had declined significantly in value.  After the third quarter but still weeks before the bank’s quarterly report was filed, Awerkamp and McGrath also learned that the borrower missed a loan payment and declared bankruptcy.  Based on these and other events, U.S. accounting rules required Mercantile to recognize a $5.28 million loan loss in its third quarter financial statements, yet the bank failed to do so., According to the SEC’s complaint, the failure to report the loan loss caused Mercantile to falsely state that its main subsidiary bank had met certain capital ratio thresholds required by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).  Mercantile also understated its net loss for the quarter and the nine months ending September 30.  The bank reported those figures as $7.5 million and $11 million when they were actually at least $12.78 million and $16.28 million.  Mercantile also falsely stated that its main subsidiary bank had a net income of $1.8 million for first nine months of 2010 when it actually had a net loss of at least $3.48 million during that period. , The SEC’s complaint charges Mercantile with violations of Section 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-11 and 13a-13.

By no later than June 2006, Chapman and the Alexander Companies were doing nothing to ensure their ability to repurchase and return shares to borrowers who elected to repay their loans, or remit share profits in excess of accrued interest to borrowers. Instead they used the proceeds to pay other borrowers, for operating costs, and for their own benefit. This was despite the fact that many of the loan agreements entered into by Chapman and the Alexander Companies with borrowers assured borrowers that the defendants would engage in hedging strategies, would hedge, or would enter into contracts with counterparties that would ensure that the portfolios could be returned. In so doing, they deliberately or recklessly misrepresented to new borrowers that, among other things, they could perform under new agreements. By early 2007, Chapman and the Alexander Companies were unable to honor maturing loan agreements, but continued to enter into new agreements under false pretenses.

Finally, the Commission alleged that Tomasetta and Hovanec attempted to cover-up their options backdating scheme by fabricating fraudulent meeting minutes of the Compensation Committee of Vitesses Board. , Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, Tomasetta consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating and/or aiding and abetting violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, as well as the financial reporting, record-keeping, internal controls, false statements to auditors, proxy, and securities reporting provisions of the federal securities laws. Tomasetta also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of any public company for ten years. Tomasetta will pay $2,126,450 in disgorgement, in satisfaction of the Commissions claim to recover the in-the-money benefit from his exercise of backdated stock option grants, and a $100,000 civil penalty.

Mody and former Vitesse Director of Finance Nicole R. Kaplan-due to their timely and substantial cooperation in the Commissions investigation and litigation. , On December 10, 2010, the Commission filed civil fraud charges against Mody and Kaplan for their participation in the revenue recognition scheme, and entered into bifurcated settlements with each of them, on a neither admit nor deny basis. Mody agreed to entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating and/or aiding and abetting the antifraud, reporting and record-keeping provisions of the federal securities laws; permanently barring him from serving as an officer or director of any public company; ordering him to pay $162,320 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest; and providing that, upon motion of the Commission, the court would determine the appropriateness and amount of any civil penalty.

The SEC alleges that Jenny E. Coplan raised approximately $4 million from more than 90 investors, many of whom were Colombian-Americans and Colombians, primarily living in Florida but also in California, Georgia, Texas, Canada, and Colombia. The SEC alleges that Coplan actively solicited investors through personal discussions with individuals both over the phone and in person.  According to the SECs complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, Coplan falsely told investors that her company Immigration General Services, LLC operated through an investment broker that would invest funds in immigration bail bonds.  Further, Coplan promised investors interest payments ranging from 60 to 108 percent annually and falsely told prospective investors this was a safe investment and their money was FDIC insured. According to the complaint, Coplan never placed investors funds with an investment broker to make a profit. Instead, the SEC alleges that Coplan, to conceal her unlawful conduct, paid purported profits to earlier investors using funds from newer investors in classic Ponzi scheme fashion and misappropriated approximately $878,000 of investors funds for her own personal use., In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of Florida today announced criminal charges against Coplan., According to the SECs complaint, Coplan conducted the scheme from at least January 2009 to October 2011. Coplan, who resides in Tamarac, Florida, and her company Immigration Services have never been registered with the SEC to offer securities., The SEC further alleges that Coplan created fictitious investor statements that were sent to investors to hide Coplans misuse of investor money and lead investors to believe their investments were growing. The SECs complaint charges Coplan with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SECs complaint also charges Coplan with violations of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act. The SECs complaint seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, financial penalties, and injunctive relief against Coplan to enjoin her from future violations of the federal securities laws., The SECs investigation was conducted in the Miami Regional Office by Senior Counsel Jorge L.

Fisher and his companies, The Good Life Financial Group, Inc. and The Good Life Global, LLC, with violations of the federal securities laws for conducting fraudulent, unregistered offerings of securities and misappropriating investor funds to pay Fishers personal expenses. The Commissions complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin, seeks permanent injunctions and disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest against all of the defendants and civil penalties against Fisher., The Commissions complaint alleges that from August 2009 through December 2012, Fisher, formerly of La Crosse, Wisconsin, raised approximately $1.04 million from approximately 18 investors who invested in unregistered securities offerings conducted by Fisher through his companies. Fisher offered investors the opportunity to invest their money through a special trading platform that supposedly generated significant returns. Fisher told investors that their money would be deposited in an overseas bank account and used as collateral for the purchase and sale of collateralized debt obligations and medium term notes on the trading platform. Before soliciting investors, Fisher conducted almost no due diligence into the trading platform. The brief internet search he conducted suggested that the trading platform was actually a scam. Fisher never told investors about what his search had revealed. The trading platform never produced any returns to the investors. Fisher knew this, but he nevertheless continued to solicit investors., The complaint further alleges that after transferring the funds of early investors to the purported trading platform, Fisher began misappropriating subsequent investors funds for his personal use. Of the $1.04 million that Fisher raised, he only sent approximately $155,000 to the purported trading platform. Fisher used at least $166,000 of investor funds to pay previous investors their purported returns or principal. He used the other $880,000 of investor funds for his personal use, including $123,000 to purchase a house, $27,000 to purchase a car, and at least $13,600 to pay for his daughters college tuition. Virtually all of the investors funds are gone., As a result of their conduct, the SECs complaint charged Fisher, Good Life Financial, and Good Life Global with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Petro-Suisse and Gasarch consented to the final judgments without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint., The Commissions complaint alleges that between 2003 and 2006, in connection with the purchase and sale of 21 limited partnership interests offered by Petro-Suisse to finance the drilling of oil wells in Trinidad, Gasarch, Petro-Suisses Director, Treasurer, and legal counsel, drafted 21 private placements memorandums (PPMs) that contained materially false and misleading information. Specifically, the PPMs stated that Petro-Suisse or an affiliate, as general partner of the 21 limited partnership offerings, would cause each of the 21 partnerships to enter into written agreements to finance the drilling of oil wells in Trinidad for which the partnerships would receive contractual rights to receive returns measured by the net revenues of the wells drilled and payable out of those revenues.

22830,2013,[<h3>SEC Charges New Jersey Resident in Prime Bank Investment Scheme and Files Settled Charges Against California Attorney Escrow Agent</h3>],"[On September 27, 2013, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed an enforcement action in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against New Jersey resident Brett A. Cooper and his companies Global Funding Systems LLC, Dream Holdings, LLC, Fortitude Investing, LLC, Peninsula Waterfront Development, LP and REOP Group Inc., who from at least November 2008 through about April 2012 perpetrated three fraudulent schemes and engaged in various fraudulent and deceitful acts, practices and courses of business in furtherance of those schemes., The SEC’s complaint alleges that, in the first scheme, commonly referred to as a “Prime Bank Fraud”, Cooper raised approximately $1.4 million from investors by claiming to have special access to programs that through pooling of funds allowed individual investors to participate in this investment opportunity generally available only to Wall Street insiders.  Cooper misrepresented to investors that the financial instruments are issued by the world’s largest and most financially sound banks; used vague, complex, and meaningless legal and financial terms designed to deceive the investors into believing that he offered legitimate investments; misrepresented that extraordinary returns of up to 1,000 percent within as little as 60 days were possible with little risk to principal; lied to investors that their principal would be collateralized with cash or semi-precious gemstones; and lied that their money would remain safe in escrow with attorneys pending the completion of certain steps in the transaction., In the second scheme, also purportedly involving investment in prime bank paper, Cooper offered to participate as an investor in the purchase and trade of a $100 million bank guarantee on the condition that all investor funds were pooled in an attorney client trust account.  Cooper sent a forged escrow agreement, purportedly from an attorney, containing wiring instructions for the attorney client trust account.  The wire instructions, however, were for an account controlled by Cooper, not an attorney acting as escrow agent.  The four investors unwittingly deposited a total of $925,000 in the phony escrow account which was, in fact, for Cooper’s company Dream Holdings, after which Cooper misappropriated the funds., In March 2012 Cooper and his company REOP participated in a third scheme involving the sale of a purported Brazilian sovereign bond.  Cooper claimed that, in exchange for a $50,000 “fee”, he would locate a buyer for the bond and open an account at a registered broker-dealer, which Cooper claimed was necessary to sell the bond.  Cooper forged a letter that purported to be from the broker-dealer indicating that the bond had been “accepted” by the broker-dealer.  Based upon this letter, the deceived investor paid Cooper’s $50,000 “fee”., According to the SEC’s complaint, Cooper used the investor money to pay personal expenses, buy cars, pay associates in the scheme, and fund frequent gambling junkets to casinos in Las Vegas and Atlantic City.  , The SEC’s complaint alleges that, despite his offering and selling of securities, Cooper has never been registered with the SEC to sell securities. , The SEC’s complaint alleges that Cooper and his companies violated the antifraud and broker-dealer registration provisions of the federal securities laws.  Specifically, the complaint alleges that they each violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; that Cooper aided and abetted violations of Securities Act, Section 17(a) and Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5; and that Cooper also violated Exchange Act Section 15(a).  The SEC seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest thereon, and civil penalties against each defendant. , Also on September 27, 2013, the SEC charged California attorney David H. Frederickson, a sole practitioner, and his law firm The Law Offices of David H. Frederickson, with aiding and abetting Cooper’s prime bank scheme in two transactions in 2010 and 2011.  , According to the SEC’s complaint filed separately in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, Frederickson served as escrow agent for two of Cooper’s prime bank transactions, and provided letters to investors stating that their investments were secured by collateral owned by Cooper’s company Global Funding Systems LLC.  Frederickson did nothing to verify the value, authenticity, or ownership of the collateral, which Cooper claimed to be seven sapphires valued at $376 million.  The SEC’s complaint also alleges that by the time Frederickson served as escrow agent for the second of these investors, Frederickson had learned facts indicating that Cooper had affixed Frederickson’s electronic signature to a forged escrow agreement that caused investor funds to be diverted to another Cooper company instead of being sent to Frederickson’s escrow account.  Moreover, Frederickson told this second investor that he had served as escrow agent for Cooper in numerous other successful bank instrument trading transactions.  In fact, none of the bank instrument trading transactions had been successful.  , Frederickson earned a total of $6,790 in escrow fees for these transactions and for a transaction involving an escrow agreement Cooper forged, for which Frederickson provided no escrow services.  These fees were paid from the funds of the defrauded investors. , Without admitting or denying the SEC’s allegations, Frederickson and his firm agreed to settle the case against them.  The settlement is pending final approval by the court.  Specifically, Frederickson and his firm consented to the entry of a final judgment that (1) permanently enjoins each of them from violating or aiding and abetting violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5; (2) permanently enjoins each of them from providing professional legal or escrow services in connection with, or from participating directly or indirectly in, the issuance, offer, or sale of securities involving bank guarantees, medium term notes, standby letters of credit, structured notes, and similar instruments, provided, however, that such injunction shall not prevent Frederickson from purchasing or selling securities listed on a national securities exchange; and<b> </b>(3) orders them to pay, jointly and severally, disgorgement and prejudgment interest totaling $7,257, and a civil penalty in the amount of $25,000, for a total of $32,257.  , As part of the settlement, and following the entry of the proposed final judgment, Frederickson, without admitting or denying the Commission’s findings, has consented to the entry of a Commission order pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3) of the Commission’s rules of practice permanently suspending him from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an attorney., The SEC’s complaints in these matters allege fictitious investments involving so-called bank guarantees, “stand-by letters of credit,” or foreign “trading platforms,” among other purported investment vehicles.

Fujinaga and MRI represented that they used investor money solely and exclusively to buy MARs., According to the SECs complaint, which was filed under seal on September 11, 2013 and unsealed last week in the U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada, MRI was a fraudulent Ponzi scheme designed to misappropriate money from investors. Fujinaga and MRI used investor money to pay the principal and interest due to earlier investors, for the expenses of MRI and other businesses owned by Fujinaga, and to buy luxury cars and pay Fujinagas credit card bills, alimony, and child support., The Honorable James C.

The Mulhollands told these investors that their real estate business was profitable, they would earn 7% per year on their investment, the returns would be generated by profits of the real estate business, and that the investors could get their money back upon 30 days written notice.

In reality, the real estate business was losing money during this period, needed new investor funds to pay its bills and to pay interest to previous investors, and did not have the means to refund investors principal within 30 days even if a small number of them asked for their money back. The Mulhollands never told investors that they were experiencing financial hardship, that they were having difficulty meeting financial obligations critical to the real estate operation, or that they were contemplating filing for bankruptcy. , For further information, see Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22518.htm>22518</a> (October 23, 2012),  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2013/lr22835.htm</i><br/>]"

Among other conduct, the Complaint alleged that Fraiman raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for Laborio by misrepresenting the historical returns and financial health of the Envit Companies, including that: (i) the non-existent hedge fund returned 42.9% in 2006 and 43.7% in 2007; (ii) shares in one of the unregistered offerings pay a 5% to 10% dividend; and (iii) the company had no debt and was cash flow positive., On October 8, 2013, the Court entered a final judgment against Fraiman: (i) permanently enjoining him from violating Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act); Sections 10(b) and 15(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder; and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers Act) and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder; (ii) barring him from participating in any offering of penny stock; (iii) finding him liable for disgorgement of $180,961.42 and prejudgment interest of $24,537.22, for a total of $205,498.66; and (iv) waiving payment of the disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and not imposing a civil penalty, based upon the representations in Fraimans sworn statement of financial condition. Fraiman agreed to settle the Commissions charges without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint., To settle the Commissions charges in related administrative proceedings that the Commission will separately institute, Fraiman has consented to be barred from any future association with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, transfer agent, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization, with the right to reapply after ten years. , The Commissions civil injunctive action against Laborio, Lazar, and the Envit Companies, <i>SEC v Laborio et al.</i>, 1:12-cv-11489-MBB (D.

(“ConnectAJet”).  The indictment was unsealed on September 19.  According to ConnectAJet’s press releases, ConnectAJet was developing a first-of-its-kind online booking system for private jet charters.  The indictment alleges that – to artificially boost demand for ConnectAJet stock – Wynn and Cantu issued several false public statements and advertisements that misled potential investors about (1) the progress and status of the company’s real-time booking system, (2) ConnectAJet’s relationships with other companies in the private jet industry, and (3) ConnectAJet’s customer base.  Based on that conduct, the indictment charges Wynn and Cantu with Conspiracy to Commit Securities Fraud in violation of Sections 10(b) and 32 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) and Aiding and Abetting Securities Fraud under those two provisions. , The allegations in the criminal indictment stem from the same misconduct underlying the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (the “Commission’s”) prior investigation of ConnectAJet and the Commission’s prior civil enforcement actions against Wynn and Cantu.  On March 13, 2008, the Commission sued Jason Wynn and others for their role in a series of illegal, unregistered stock offerings in several penny stock companies, including ConnectAJet.  <em>SEC v. Reynolds, et al.</em>, Case No. 3:08-cv-00438-B (N.D. Tex.).  In its Complaint, the Commission alleged that Wynn repeatedly engaged in a “pump and dump” of ConnectAJet and other companies.  The Complaint alleged that for each company, Wynn and his fellow penny stock promoters (a) organized a reverse merger of the company into a public shell, (b) purchased large blocks of the company’s stock at pennies per share in a bogus unregistered private offering, (c) created initial trading volume for the stock by selling some shares to a tightly controlled group of friends and family members, (d) touted the stock through spam e-mail, sham internet sites, and millions of direct mail advertisements, and then (e) dumped their shares on the investing public without the protection of registration at prices grossly inflated by their promotional activity.  On October 13, 2011, the Court entered partial judgment against Jason Wynn based on his consent and ordered that Wynn be permanently enjoined from further violations of the antifraud and registration provisions of federal securities law and be permanently barred from participating in any offerings of penny stock.  On July 11, 2013, the Court further ordered that Wynn and his corporate proxies pay $8,778,887 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest and $1,300,000 in civil penalties., On September 2009, the Commission separately sued Martin T. Cantu and others in <em>SEC v. ConnectAJet.com, Inc. et al.</em>, Case No. 3:09-cv-01742-B (N.D.

22841,2013,[<h3>Previously Unknown Insider Traders in Heinz Agree to $5 Million Settlement</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that two brothers in Brazil have agreed to pay nearly $5 million to settle charges that they were behind suspicious trading in call options for H.J. Heinz Company the day before the company publicly announced its acquisition., The SEC <a href=/News/PressRelease/Detail/PressRelease/1365171512848>filed an emergency enforcement action earlier this year</a> to freeze assets in a Swiss-based trading account used to reap more than $1.8 million from trading in advance of the Heinz announcement. The SECs immediate move the day after the announcement ensured the illicit profits could not be released out of the account while the investigation into the then-unknown traders continued., In an amended complaint filed today in federal court in Manhattan, the SEC alleges that the order to purchase the Heinz options was placed by Rodrigo Terpins while he was vacationing at Walt Disney World in Orlando, and the trading was based on material non-public information that he received from his brother Michel Terpins. The trades were made through an account belonging to a Cayman Islands-based entity named Alpine Swift that holds assets for one of their family members. Rodrigo Terpins purchased nearly $90,000 in option positions in Heinz the day before the announcement, and those positions increased dramatically by nearly 2,000 percent the next day., The Terpins brothers and Alpine Swift, which has been named as a relief defendant for the purposes of recovering ill-gotten gains, have agreed to disgorge the entire $1,809,857 in illegal profits made from trading Heinz options. The Terpins brothers also will pay $3 million in penalties. The settlement is subject to court approval., Rodrigo and Michel Terpins obtained confidential information prior to any public awareness that a Heinz deal was in the works, and they exploited it to the disadvantage of all other traders in the marketplace, said Sanjay Wadhwa, Senior Associate Director for Enforcement in the SECs New York Regional Office. Those who use foreign accounts to commit insider trading in the U.S. markets should know that their activities can still be tracked and they will be held accountable by the SEC for their actions., According to the SECs amended complaint, Alpine Swifts brokerage account was used to purchase 2,533 out-of-the-money June $65 calls. This was effectively a wager that Heinzs stock would increase in value by approximately $5 per share. The trade was then executed through an omnibus account at Goldman Sachs Zurich office. An omnibus account has the aggregate positions and transactions of a firm and its underlying customers without disclosing the identities of the beneficial owners or customers., The SEC alleges that prior to the February 14 announcement that Berkshire Hathaway and 3G Capital agreed to acquire Heinz in a deal valued at $28 billion, Michel Terpins learned that an investment consortium including 3G Capital was about to announce a major acquisition. He found out that Heinz was the target. Michel Terpins then provided the non-public information to Rodrigo Terpins, who placed the trades on February 13. Rodrigo Terpins communicated with a broker who cautioned him that his firm rated Heinz a sell. But Rodrigo Terpins instructed the broker to place the trade anyway. The timing, size, and profitability of the trades as well as the lack of a prior history of Heinz trading in the Alpine Swift account made the transactions highly suspicious in the wake of the Heinz announcement, hence the SECs emergency action at the time., In addition to the monetary sanctions, the proposed final judgments to which Rodrigo and Michel Terpins consented without admitting or denying the allegations permanently enjoin them from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5., The SECs investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Megan Bergstrom, David S. Brown, and Diana Tani in the Los Angeles office with assistance from Charles D. Riely in the New York office. They are members of the SEC Enforcement Divisions Market Abuse Unit.

Enea of Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin with violations of the federal securities laws for conducting fraudulent, unregistered offerings of securities and misappropriating investor funds to pay his personal expenses., The Commissions complaint alleged that, from July 2006 through May 2013, Enea operated a Ponzi scheme through the fraudulent and unregistered offer and sale of securities to 18 investors totaling approximately $2.1 million. Enea represented to the investors that he would combine his funds with funds contributed by each investor and use the money to invest in a credit card portfolio. Credit card portfolios, according to Enea, consisted of a group of retail merchants who pay fees to a third party credit card processor each time one of the merchants customers makes a credit card transaction. Enea told investors that by investing in credit card portfolios the investor would receive monthly or quarterly payments. The payments to investors were purportedly generated by the payment of the transaction fees by the merchants to the credit card processors. In reality, Enea never purchased any credit card portfolios and instead used approximately $1.35 million of the investors funds to make the monthly or quarterly payments to prior investors. Enea used the remaining approximately $760,000 he raised from investors to pay his personal and business expenses. Enea never told investors that he used their funds to make payments to previous investors or to pay his personal and business expenses. The complaint also alleged that Enea acted as an unregistered broker., As a result of his conduct, the Commissions complaint charged Enea with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder., Enea has agreed to settle the charges against him.

The perpetrators of the scheme falsely promised exponential, risk-free returns to investors in a venture that purportedly sold Internet-based childrens educational courses., The SECs complaint, filed under seal on October 9, 2013 and unsealed October 16, 2013 in the Eastern District of New York, alleges that since mid-2011, the defendants have solicited investments in an entity operating under the business name CKB or CKB168, which they claim is a rapidly growing and legitimate multi-level marketing company that purportedly sells web-based childrens educational courses.   Defendants solicit investors through a variety of tactics, including in-person sales pitches, videotaped presentations posted on the Internet, websites, written brochures, and email and telephone communications. They attract investors by claiming that the investors will earn exponential, risk-free returns with little or no effort. Defendants claim that investors can earn money when Profit Reward Points (Prpts) they are granted at the time of their initial investments increase in value or pay dividends, and can earn even larger returns by converting their Prpts into shares of CKB168 stock when the company conducts a promised IPO on the Hong Kong stock exchange. Investors have also been told that they will be able to make even greater returns in the forms of commissions and bonuses by recruiting new investors. CKB promoters have raised more than $20 million from U.S. investors, and millions of dollars more from investors in Canada, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and other countries in Asia., The complaint alleges that in reality, CKB168 is nothing more than a fraudulent pyramid scheme. CKB has little or no real-world retail consumer sales to generate the promised returns and has no apparent source of revenue other than money received from new investors. Defendants promote recruitment of new investors instead of retail sales. Most of the money raised has been paid out to accounts controlled by CKB entities and as commissions to promoters, with the bulk of the payouts going to those at or near the top of the investment pyramids, including the Defendants. The company has taken no steps to prepare for the promised IPO. The Prpts granted investors are essentially worthless.  , The Honorable Roslynn Mauskopf granted the SECs request for a temporary restraining order, asset freeze, and other emergency relief against the 16 defendants as well as seven entities controlled by the U.S. promoters that are named as relief defendants in the complaint.

The Commission alleged in its complaint that JBI, Inc. (JBI), its CEO, John Bordynuik (Bordynuik), and its former CFO, Baldwin, engaged in a scheme to commit securities and accounting fraud in 2009. In the consent judgment, the Court ordered Baldwin to pay $25,000 in civil monetary penalties. The final judgment against Baldwin successfully concludes this litigation, as the Court has previously entered final judgments against JBI and Bordynuik., The Commission filed its action on January 4, 2012, alleging that during two reporting periods in 2009 and in contravention of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), JBI stated materially false and inaccurate financial information on its financial statements. The Complaint alleged that the defendants misrepresented and overstated the actual value of certain assets, known as media credits, by almost 1,000%, in an effort to bolster JBIs balance sheet. JBI then used the overvalued financial statements in two private capital raising efforts (Private Investment in Public Equity or PIPES) that raised over $8.4 million from unwitting investors just before the company issued a public statement indicating its financial statements could no longer be relied upon, in part, due to the erroneous valuation of the media credits and other assets on the balance sheet. According to the Complaint, despite being aware of the issues regarding the valuation of the media credits, and of the significance of the value of the media credits for JBIs balance sheets and other financials, Baldwin failed to conduct any reasonable due diligence on the appropriate accounting for the media credits when he certified the financial statements contained in JBIs Form 10-K for the year ended 2009.

Skaltsounis on all counts.  Defendant AIC was a financial services holding company for three broker-dealers and an investment adviser based in Richmond, Virginia.  Defendant Community Bankers Securities was one of the subsidiary broker-dealers.  Defendant Skaltsounis was the founder, President, and Chief Executive Officer of AIC and Community Bankers Securities.  The Commission’s complaint, which was filed in April 2011, alleged that Skaltsounis devised and orchestrated an offering fraud by offering and selling millions of dollars of AIC promissory notes and stock.  , The complaint alleged that, from at least January 2006 through November 2009, Skaltsounis, directly and through registered representatives associated with Community Bankers Securities, offered and sold AIC promissory notes and stock to numerous investors across multiple states, many of whom were elderly, unsophisticated brokerage customers of CB Securities.  The Defendants misrepresented and omitted material information to investors relating to, among other things, the safety and risk associated with the investments, the rates of return on the investments, and how AIC would use the proceeds of the investments.  AIC and its subsidiaries were never profitable.  AIC earned <em>de minimis</em> revenue, and its subsidiaries did not earn sufficient revenue to meet their expenses.  The Defendants used money raised from new investors to pay back principal and returns to existing investors.    , Prior to trial, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee granted the Commission’s motion for partial summary judgment and found in favor of the Commission on its claims against AIC, Community Bankers Securities, and Skaltsounis under Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933.  The court also found in favor of the Commission on its claims against three relief defendants, Allied Beacon Partners, Inc. (f/k/a Waterford Investor Services, Inc.), Advent Securities, Inc., and Allied Beacon Wealth Management, LLC (f/k/a CBS Advisors, LLC), all of which were subsidiaries of AIC and all of which received proceeds from the Defendants’ illegal and fraudulent conduct.  In addition, prior to trial, two co-defendants, John B. Guyette, of Greeley, Colorado, and John R. Graves, formerly of Pensacola, Florida, and now incarcerated at the Federal Detention Center at Oakdale, Louisiana, both of whom were participants in the scheme, entered into settlement agreements with the Commission.  A final judgment ordering injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, and civil penalties was entered against Guyette, and a final judgment ordering injunctive relief and civil penalties was entered against Graves., At the conclusion of the almost three-week trial, the jury returned a verdict for the Commission and against Defendants AIC, Community Bankers Securities, and Skaltsounis on all of the remaining claims.  In particular, the jury found in favor of the Commission on its claims under Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In addition, the jury found in favor of the Commission on its claims against Defendants AIC and Community Bankers Securities under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act and against Skaltsounis under Section 20(e) of the Exchange Act., The trial team from the Commission’s Philadelphia Regional Office consisted of trial attorneys Michael J.

Duckson, a Minneapolis, Minnesota attorney, Capital Solutions Monthly Income Fund, LP, a Minneapolis-based real estate lending fund (the Fund), and Transactional Finance Fund Management LLC, a company owned by Duckson that became the funds investment advisor in November 2008. The Commissions complaint, which was filed in September 2010, alleged that the defendants engaged in securities fraud in connection with their offer and sale of interests in the Fund., The complaint alleged that, from approximately March 2008 through December 2009, the Fund raised $21.6 million from investors in a series of unregistered offerings. During most of the period of the Funds existence, it made mezzanine loans - or loans subordinate to more senior loans - to a single borrower. That borrower encountered financial problems in 2007 and, by May 2008, had defaulted on its obligations to the Fund. As a result, the Fund had no meaningful income-producing assets. The complaint alleged that in written documents provided to investors between March 2008 and late 2009, the Defendants made materially false and misleading statements that effectively hid the Funds deteriorating financial condition. The complaint also alleged that the Fund would use proceeds raised in offerings primarily to make real estate loans and other investments, when in fact the Fund needed to use most of the proceeds to pay senior lenders on properties the Fund had acquired and to make interest payments to existing investors. Duckson played a key role in drafting the written documents provided to investors, first as the attorney for the Fund and, in and after November 2008, as the Funds manager., At the conclusion of a five-week trial, the jury returned a verdict for the Commission and against all three Defendants. In particular, the jury found in favor of the Commission on its claims that Duckson and the Fund violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, that Duckson aided and abetted the Funds violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that Transactional Finance Fund Management LLC violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The Commissions complaint alleged that Zhou and Warner Investment, consultants to numerous Chinese reverse merger companies, in connection with such work for various clients from 2007 through at least 2010, engaged in a scheme to list one client on a national securities exchange through manipulative trading and by facilitating in effect an artificial shareholder base sufficient for listing.

The final judgment permanently enjoins Greene from violating the antifraud, books and records and reporting provisions of the securities laws and orders him to pay a $100,000 penalty., According to the Commissions complaint, starting in the third quarter of 2005, and in each quarter of 2006, Greene and Len A. Familant, then an InPhonic Senior Vice President, engaged in a series of undisclosed round-trip transactions to help InPhonic artificially inflate its financial results. After the end of the quarters, but before InPhonic publically reported its financial results, Familant obtained APC credits from Greene. At the same time, however, Familant and Greene entered into an oral side agreement under which InPhonic would repay the credits through future purchases of certain cell phone models at inflated prices and by paying for inflated and fake repairs. The complaint further alleges Greene hid the scheme from InPhonics independent auditors even after APCs accountant had informed Greene that APCs sham credit transactions with InPhonic were illegal. InPhonic improperly recorded a total of almost $10 million in credits from APC as a decrease in cost of goods sold, which allowed InPhonic to materially understate its losses and meet its quarterly and annual financial targets in reports filed with the Commission.

The SEC alleged in its complaint that Mancuso, a former proprietary trader at the registered broker-dealer Schottenfeld Group, LLC, used inside information he received from his good friend and colleague Zvi Goffer to trade ahead of five separate corporate acquisition announcements in 2007, resulting in illicit profits of approximately $350,000., The SECs complaint alleged that Mancuso used the material, nonpublic information he was tipped by Goffer to trade ahead of the announced acquisitions of Avaya, Inc., 3Com Corp., Axcan Pharma Inc., Hilton Hotels Corp. and Kronos Inc. As alleged in the complaint, certain of the tips originated from Arthur Cutillo and Brien Santarlas, attorneys at the law firm Ropes &amp; Gray. The SEC alleged that Cutillo and Santarlas had access to inside information about potential acquisitions involving their firms clients, and that Goffer paid them kickbacks in exchange for the information, using their mutual friend Jason Goldfarb as a conduit. The SEC alleged that other tips passed from Goffer to Mancuso came through Gautham Shankar, another former proprietary trader at Schottenfeld. As alleged in the complaint, Shankar was tipped the inside information by Thomas Hardin, a managing director at the hedge fund adviser Lanexa Management. The SEC alleged that Goffer also paid kickbacks in exchange for this information., To settle the SECs charges, Mancuso consented to the entry of a final judgment that: (i) permanently enjoins him from violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and (ii) orders disgorgement of $349,489, plus prejudgment interest of $112,171.

22858,2013,[<h3>SEC Charges New York Investment Professional with Insider Trading</h3>],"[On October 29, 2013, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil injunctive action in federal court in the Northern District of Georgia against Dennis Rosenberg (Rosenberg). The Commission alleges that Rosenberg traded in the securities of Carters Inc., (Carters), the Atlanta-based public issuer and clothing marketer, on the basis of material non-public information provided by a former Carters executive, and tipped two investment advisers about this information., The Commissions complaint alleges that, between 2005 and 2010, Rosenberg, a retired hedge fund investment consultant and market analyst who had previously covered the stock of Carters, traded in advance of market-moving news concerning Carters anticipated earnings, after having been tipped by a former Carters executive regarding the substance of the upcoming announcements. Rosenberg also disclosed this information to two investment advisers for two separate hedge funds, according to the complaint, who then also traded on the inside information. Rosenbergs total ill-gotten gains, losses avoided, and consulting fees (based on tips to one hedge fund client) totaled approximately $500,000, according to the complaint, while the combined losses avoided and profits by Rosenbergs tippees totaled approximately $2 million. , The Commissions complaint alleges that Rosenberg violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5. Without admitting or denying any of the allegations in the complaint, Rosenberg consented to the entry of an order enjoining him from future violations of these provisions, and ordering him to disgorge approximately $500,000 of ill-gotten gains and approximately $108,000 in prejudgment interest. The amount of civil monetary penalties to be imposed, if any, will be decided at a later date. , This is the second insider trading case that the Commission has brought in connection with its ongoing investigation of trading in the securities of Carters, <u>see</u> <u>SEC v.

22861,2013,[<h3>SEC Obtains Summary Judgment Against Defendants Charged with Defrauding Investors in Fictitious Offering</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that United States District Court for the District of Columbia granted the SECs motion for summary judgment against all primary defendants and certain relief defendants in a civil action arising from a prime bank investment scheme that defrauded at least 13 investors out of more than $2 million from August 2010 to November 2011.  Pursuant to the court’s ruling and judgment issued on August 26, 2013, the court permanently enjoined Washington D.C. attorney Brynee K. Baylor, her law firm Baylor &amp; Jackson, P.L.L.C., and their former “client” The Milan Group, Inc. from violations of the antifraud and other securities law provisions, and from engaging in similar investment schemes. The court also required these defendants to pay disgorgement and penalties, required the Estate of Frank L. Pavlico to pay disgorgement, and barred Baylor from acting as an officer or director of any public company.  The court required relief defendants Patrick T. Lewis and The Julian Estate to disgorge illegally obtained investor funds.  The court granted in part or denied summary judgment against two other relief defendants, but declined in September 2013 to reconsider that ruling., The SEC’s complaint, filed on November 30, 2011, alleged that Pavlico and Baylor operated a prime bank scheme, offering investors risk-free returns of up to 20 times the original investment within as few as 45 days through the purported “lease” and “trading” of foreign bank instruments, including “standby letters of credit” and “bank guarantees,” in highly complex transactions with unidentified parties and secretive international “trading platforms.”  However, the bank instruments and trading programs were entirely fictitious.  As the complaint alleged, Pavlico and Baylor provided investors with phony contracts and legal documents, digitally-created computer screen shots, and copies of fictitious foreign bank instruments as purported proof of the ongoing success of the transactions.  Baylor and her law firm acted as “counsel” for Pavlico’s company Milan, vouching for Pavlico and acting as an escrow agent that in reality was merely receiving and diverting the majority of investor funds.  , In furtherance of the scheme, the complaint alleged that Baylor provided investors with “attorney attestation” letters that assured them the investments were legitimate, and investor contracts that promised investment profits would be shared among investors, Milan, and Baylor &amp; Jackson.  Meanwhile, Pavlico was using a fake name of “Frank Lorenzo” to conceal his 2008 money laundering conviction from investors.  The complaint also alleged that Pavlico and Baylor used investor funds to pay Baylor &amp; Jackson business expenses as well as personal expenditures. , The court held in its summary judgment ruling that Baylor, an experienced lawyer, “acted with extreme recklessness” in the scheme, carrying out Pavlico’s bidding while failing to exercise even a “modicum of lawyerly interest in the legal implications of” Pavlico’s and Milan’s activities.  The court found that Baylor “encouraged others to invest in unregistered securities, aided and abetted Milan’s fraud, and knowingly allowed investors’ monies—placed for safekeeping in her firm’s IOLTA account—to be dispersed to Milan and then back to her”, with 71% of investor funds paid out to Baylor and Pavlico and no funds being used in any investment.  Finding the record clear despite Baylor’s claimed ignorance of the fraud, the court ruled that she made “extensive material misrepresentations and omissions....   Ms. Baylor knew that she omitted telling investors about the disbursements from her IOLTA account without any investment; she knew that she told investors that Milan was just closing a deal and/or that all would be well with multiple investments when, in fact, no profits were ever returned to an investor; she knew that she told investors that investments through Milan were outside federal oversight when, at best, she had not researched the question; and she knew that she was assuring investors that she had ‘validated’ aspects of the transactions, as an attorney, when, in fact, she had not.”  The court found that “Baylor’s attempt to use her role as an attorney as a shield is particularly pernicious because, as an attorney, she was in the position to lead investors to believe that their money was safe.”  , The court granted the SEC’s motion for summary judgment against all of the principal defendants—Baylor, Baylor &amp; Jackson, The Milan Group, and Frank Pavlico, as substituted by his Estate following his death in December 2012 during the litigation—that they violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that Pavlico, Baylor, and Baylor &amp; Jackson aided and abetted violations of these provisions; that they violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act and that Baylor and Baylor &amp; Jackson aided and abetted such violations; and that Baylor and Pavlico violated Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act., The judgment permanently enjoins Baylor, Baylor &amp; Jackson, and Milan from violating and aiding and abetting violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5, and from violating Section 5 of the Securities Act and Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act.  The judgment also prohibits Baylor, Baylor &amp; Jackson, and Milan from soliciting or accepting funds from investors in investment programs relating to bank instruments or bank instrument trading programs, or in any other investment program.  The judgment holds the Estate of Frank Pavlico, Milan, Baylor &amp; Jackson, and Baylor jointly and severally liable for disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains of $2,665,000, together with prejudgment interest thereon of $157,414, for a total of $2,822,414.  The judgment orders Baylor to pay the remaining obligation of $2,752,758 and directed the Estate of Pavlico to make payments as directed in the future by the court as the Estate collects estate assets and pays estate costs.  The judgment also orders Milan to pay a civil penalty of $1,318,734 and orders Baylor and Baylor &amp; Jackson to pay, jointly and severally, a civil penalty of $746,266.  The judgment permanently bars Baylor from acting as an officer or director of any public company., The court also granted summary judgment against two relief defendants, Patrick Lewis and The Julian Estate, an entity Pavlico formed to purchase a residence using investor funds.  The judgment orders Lewis to pay $375,000 and orders The Julian Estate to pay $437,250, with the amount to be satisfied by the sale of the property it purchased with investor funds., The court also granted in part the SEC’s motion for summary judgment against relief defendant Mia Baldassari with respect to $13,156 she received from Milan, but denied further relief against her.  The court also denied summary judgment against relief defendant Brett Cooper, whom the SEC alleged received investor funds from Milan through his company Global Funding Systems, LLC.  In September 2013, the court denied the SEC’s request to reconsider its summary judgment rulings as to Cooper and Mia Baldassari and, therefore, the litigation as to them is pending., The court previously entered default judgments against two other relief defendants:  on November 14, 2012 the court ordered Patrick Lewis’ company GPH Holdings, LLC to pay a total of $399,743, consisting of $375,000 it received in investor funds plus $24,743 in prejudgment interest; and on January 23, 2013, the court ordered Brett Cooper’s company Global Funding Systems, LLC to pay a total of $238,253, consisting of $225,000 it received in investor funds plus $13,253 in prejudgment interest., In addition, the SEC previously settled with relief defendant Dawn Jackson, Baylor’s law partner, and the court entered a final judgment against her on March 21, 2013.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC’s complaint, Jackson agreed to the final judgment that held her liable for disgorgement of $153,000 and $9,410 in prejudgment interest, for a total of $162,410, the payment of which is to be made from the sale, if any, of a Bahamian property but is otherwise waived based on Jackson’s sworn statement of financial condition., The SEC previously dismissed its case against three other relief defendants, Susan C. Kevra-Shiner, the Law Office of Susan Kevra, and Elmo Baldassari, upon satisfaction that they no longer held any improperly gained investor funds., For further information, please see Litigation Release Number <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr22181.htm>22181</a> (December 6, 2011).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2013/lr22861.htm</i><br/>]"
22862,2013,[<h3>SEC Halts Ponzi Scheme Involving New Zealand Companies</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced an emergency asset freeze to halt a Ponzi scheme involving U.S. and New Zealand-based companies peddling sham investment opportunities ranging from a bank trading program to kidney dialysis clinics., The SEC alleges that Christopher A.T. Pedras, who has residences in Turlock, Calif., and New Zealand, misled his initial investors into believing they were investing in a profitable trading platform in which his company served as an intermediary between global banks. When Pedras and his companies encountered difficulty paying the promised 4 to 8 percent monthly returns, they began steering investors to a different investment program to purportedly increase the value of their investment by 80 percent by funding kidney dialysis clinics in New Zealand. Pedrass business partner Sylvester M. Gray II and lead sales representative Alicia Bryan helped him solicit investors for both programs, and the money was never invested as promised. Earlier investors were paid supposed returns with funds received from newer investors, and Pedras stole more than $2 million and spent another $1.2 million on sales agents., According to the SECs complaint unsealed last Friday in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, Pedras raised more than $5.6 million from at least 50 investors in the U.S. since July 2010 by selling securities in two phases. Pedras, Gray, and Bryan first solicited investors for their Maxum Gold Small Cap Trade Program in which Pedrass company Maxum Gold purportedly serves as the intermediary between banks that cant legally trade with each other directly, so they use Maxum Golds trade platform to do so indirectly. Maxum Gold purports to share portions of the trading profits with investors.  , The SEC alleges that the Ponzi scheme shifted gears earlier this year when Pedras and others began promoting the FMP Renal Program to Maxum Gold investors. They characterized it as an investment in a New Zealand company called FMP Medical Services Limited that would be publicly traded and operate kidney dialysis clinics in New Zealand. Investors were told if they converted their Maxum Gold investments into the FMP Renal Program, they would instantly realize an 80 percent increase in the value of their investment., According to the SECs complaint, Pedras and Bryan routinely communicate with investors via email, and also conduct investor conference calls. Pedras has falsely claimed that Maxum Gold has been doing business for 15 to 20 years with more than 6,000 clients and has been making regular payments to investors. Pedras conducted at least one in-person seminar at Paramount Studios in Los Angeles. Investments were falsely touted as risk-free, and investor funds were not maintained safely in escrow accounts as described to investors., The SEC alleges that the Ponzi scheme paid investors more than $2.4 million in returns using new investor money. Pedras stole more than $2 million from investors in the form of cash withdrawals, car and retail purchases, and transfers of investor funds to his various companies. Approximately $1.2 million in sales commissions were paid to a small network of sales agents who sold the investments to U.S. investors., According to the SECs complaint, during at least one conference call, Pedras advised investors not to respond if contacted by the SEC. He characterized SEC investor questionnaires as fake and stated that the SECs investigation was motivated by a personal vendetta against him., The SECs complaint charges Pedras, Gray, Bryan, Maxum Gold Bnk Holdings Limited, Maxum Gold Bnk Holdings LLC, FMP Medical Services Limited, and FMP Medical Services LLC with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5. Pedras and Bryan also are charged with violations of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act, and they and Pedrass companies are charged with violations of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act. The complaint also named Comptroller 2013 Limited as a relief defendant. The Honorable Gary Feess granted the SECs request for a temporary asset freeze against Pedras, Maxum Gold Bnk Holdings Limited, Maxum Gold Bnk Holdings LLC, FMP Medical Services Limited, FMP Medical Services LLC, and Comptroller 2013. Judge Feesss order prohibits the destruction of documents and requires the defendants to provide accountings. A court hearing has been scheduled for November 20., The SECs investigation was conducted by J. Cindy Eson, Peter F. Del Greco, and Dora Zaldivar of the Los Angeles office.

According to the application, the SEC is investigating whether Coronati and others have violated or are violating registration, anti-fraud, or other provisions of the federal securities laws in connection with a business known as Bidtoask.com. , The SECs application alleges that Bidtoask.com, apparently created by Coronati, solicits investments relating to the securities of sought-after private companies that investors hope will soon hold initial public offerings, such as Facebook Inc., Twitter Inc., and Dropbox Inc. The nature and extent of investors interests once they purchase these purported pre-IPO shares is part of the investigation.

RBS agreed to settle the matter and pay more than $150 million, which the SEC will use to compensate investors for harm suffered as a result of RBSs conduct., The SEC alleges that RBS said the loans backing the offering generally met the lenders underwriting guidelines even though nearly 30 percent fell so short of the guidelines that RBS should have excluded them from the offering entirely. Stamford, Connecticut-based RBS, then known as Greenwich Capital Markets, quickly reviewed a very small portion of the loans and was paid approximately $4.4 million for its work as the lead underwriter on the transaction, the SEC said in a complaint filed in federal court in Connecticut., RBS told investors the loans backing the offering were generally in accordance with the lenders underwriting guidelines, which consider the value of the home relative to the mortgage and the borrowers ability to repay the loan.  RBS knew or should have known that was false because due diligence before the offering showed that almost 30% of the loans underlying the offering did not meet the underwriting guidelines. In its complaint, the SEC said RBS gave investors a misleading impression of the quality of the loans backing the offering and the likelihood of their repayment.  , The SECs complaint charges Stamford-based RBS with violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933. RBS, without admitting or denying the SECs allegations, has agreed to a final judgment that orders it to disgorge $80.3 million, plus prejudgment interest of $25.2 million, and pay a civil penalty of $48.2 million., The SEC thanks the federal-state Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities Working Group for its assistance in this matter.

(“Level Global”), then a New York based hedge fund.  The Commission alleges that Megalli caused Level Global to trade in the securities of Carter’s Inc., the Atlanta-based clothing marketer, on the basis of material non-public information provided by a former Carter’s executive., The Commission’s complaint alleges that, on several occasions from September 2009 through July 2010, Megalli, who was then working at Level Global, caused Level Global to trade in advance of market-moving news concerning Carter’s after Megalli was tipped concerning the information by a former Carter’s executive, who in turn was receiving tips from a current Carter’s executive.  A number of these trades occurred while Megalli was on the phone with his source.  The total profits and losses avoided on the trades placed or directed by Megalli are in excess of $3 million dollars., The Commission’s complaint alleges that Megalli violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934  and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement with prejudgment interest and civil monetary penalties pursuant to Section 21A of the Exchange Act.  , This is the third case that the Commission has brought alleging insider trading in connection with its ongoing investigation of trading in the securities of Carter’s (see SEC v.

He used the nonpublic information provided by Miri to trade Marvell securities on behalf of hedge funds that he founded after leaving Galleon. Far and Spherix Capital, who were <a href=/news/press/2009/2009-235.htm>among those earlier charged by the SEC</a> in the Galleon matter, earned hundreds of thousands of dollars in illicit profits based on Miris tips.

With an earnings announcement scheduled for later that month, Miri also revealed confidential information about Marvells sales revenue and profitability as well as projections of future earnings potential.  In the days leading up to the announcement, Spherix Capital hedge funds purchased approximately 300,000 shares of Marvell common stock. When the stock climbed more than 20 percent after Marvell announced its quarterly financial results and new CFO on May 29, Fars hedge funds reaped approximately $680,000 in ill-gotten gains., The SECs complaint charges Miri with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.

Jones is a resident of Farmington, Utah, and has been licensed as a certified public accountant by the State of Utah since June 1980., The Commission alleged in its complaint that Jones violated a May 4, 2001 Commission Order issued under Rule 102(e)(1)(ii) and (iii) of the Commissions Rules of Practice (the 2001 Order) that suspended Jones from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant. <em>In The Matter of R.

According to the complaint, beginning in 2001 through the present, Jones provided accounting and financial statement preparation work for public companies. The complaint alleges that Jones, through his company J&amp;J Consultants, LLC, has, among other things, created, compiled, and edited financial statements, information and data incorporated into Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K; drafted and edited footnotes to financial statements; drafted and edited Management Discussion and Analysis sections relating to financial information of public filings; drafted and edited responses to Commission comment letters relating to financial information on public filings; and provided issuers with accounting advice that was subsequently reflected in financial statements filed with the Commission.

The Commission alleges that Snisky recruited and trained a sales force that raised at least $3.8 million from more than 40 elderly investors in Colorado and seven other states by promising guaranteed returns and safety of principal through a purported investment in government secured bonds., The Commissions complaint alleges that Snisky and his sales force targeted mostly elderly, annuity-holding investors to purchase interests in Arete, LLC, a purportedly safe alternative to an annuity that also allowed for withdrawal of principal. Additionally, the complaint alleges that Snisky and his salespeople represented to investors that Arete provided a guaranteed annual return of 6% to 7%, a 10% bonus to compensate for any annuity withdrawal penalties, and that investor funds would be placed in bonds backed by the full faith and credit of the United States Government. These representations, however, were false, as Snisky misappropriated approximately $2.8 million in investor funds, mostly in cash withdrawals, and used these funds to pay commissions to his salespeople and for his personal use., The Commissions complaint alleges that Snisky violated the antifraud provisions of the securities laws, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), (2), and (4) of the Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder; violated the unregistered broker-dealer provisions of the securities laws in Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act; violated the security registration provisions of the securities laws in Sections 5(a) and (c) of the Securities Act; and aided and abetted Aretes failure to register as an investment company under Section 7(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940.

In its Complaint, the Commission alleged that, since April 2011, Palladino and Viking falsely promised at least 33 investors that their money would be used to conduct the business of Viking - which was purportedly to make to short-term, high interest loans to those unable to obtain traditional financing. The Commission also alleged that the Defendants misrepresented to investors that the loans made by Viking would be secured by first interest liens on non-primary residence properties and that investors would be paid back their principal, plus monthly interest at rates generally ranging from 7-15%, from payments made by borrowers on the loans. The Complaint alleges that, in truth, the Defendants made very few real loans to borrowers, and instead used investors funds largely to make payments to earlier investors and to pay for the Palladino familys substantial personal expenses, including cash withdrawals and hundreds of thousands of dollars spent on gambling excursions, vacations, luxury vehicles and tuition. , After the parties had an opportunity to brief the issues, on July 15, 2013, the Court held that the Commission had established that the Defendants conduct violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.

The Commission had charged MedLink, Vuono, and MedLink’s CFO, James Rose, with filing an annual report falsely stating that MedLink’s audit had been completed and with defrauding a MedLink investor.  In its ruling, the court found that Vuono’s default was wilful and that he had failed to present any meritorious defense to the Commission’s charges., Previously, on May 23, 2013, the court had entered default judgments against the defendants and ordered permanent injunctions from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 15d-1 and 15d-14.

22880,2013,[<h3>SEC Charges Weatherford International with FCPA Violations</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged oilfield services company Weatherford International with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) by authorizing bribes and improper travel and entertainment for foreign officials in the Middle East and Africa to win business, including kickbacks in Iraq to obtain United Nations Oil-for-Food contracts.  , The SEC alleges that Weatherford and its subsidiaries falsified its books and records to conceal not only these illicit payments, but also commercial transactions with Cuba, Iran, Syria, and Sudan that violated U.S. sanctions and export control laws.  Weatherford failed to establish an effective system of internal accounting controls to monitor risks of improper payments and prevent or detect misconduct.  The company reaped more than $59.3 million in profits from business obtained through improper payments, and more than $30 million in profits from its improper sales to sanctioned countries., Swiss-based Weatherford, which has substantial operations in Houston, has agreed to pay more than $250 million to settle the SEC’s charges and parallel actions by the Department of Justice’s Fraud Section, U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Texas, Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security, and Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control., According to the SEC’s complaint filed in federal court in Houston, the misconduct occurred from at least 2002 to 2011.  In Angola, for example, Weatherford’s legal department permitted its subsidiary to use an agent who insisted that an FCPA clause be omitted from the consultancy agreement.  The company took no steps to determine whether the agent was paying bribes to foreign officials, and the agent used sham work orders and invoices to pay bribes that ensured the renewal of a lucrative oil services contract for Weatherford in Angola.  The same agent made illicit payments to obtain commercial contracts for Weatherford in Congo.  The company also allowed its subsidiary to enter into a joint venture agreement with companies whose beneficial owners included Angolan oil company officials and a relative of an Angolan Minister in order to win business.  A Weatherford employee reported in a 2006 ethics questionnaire that Weatherford personnel were making payments to government officials in Angola and elsewhere, but the company failed to investigate.  , The SEC’s complaint also alleges that Weatherford failed to perform due diligence on a distributor suggested by an official at a national oil company in the Middle East.  From 2005 to 2011, Weatherford and its subsidiaries awarded more than $11.8 million in improper “volume discounts” to the distributor – money intended for the creation of a slush fund to pay foreign officials.  , According to the SEC’s complaint, the misconduct went beyond the use of agents or other third parties.  Weatherford provided improper travel and entertainment to officials of a state-owned company in Algeria with no legitimate business purpose.  For example, Weatherford paid for a 2006 FIFA World Cup trip by two of the officials, the July 2006 honeymoon of an official’s daughter, and an October 2005 religious trip to Saudi Arabia by an official and his family that was improperly recorded as a donation in Weatherford’s books and records.  Weatherford’s Middle East subsidiary also made more than $1.4 million in improper payments to obtain nine contracts under the Oil-for-Food program in 2002.  Iraqi ministries demanded improper “inland transportation fees” in an effort to subvert the UN program.  Weatherford’s subsidiary complied with the Iraqi demands and paid more than $115,000 in fees despite invoices that included charges inconsistent with the actual deliveries. Weatherford obtained more than $7 million in profits from the misconduct., The SEC further alleges that managers at Weatherford’s subsidiary in Italy flouted the lack of internal controls and misappropriated more than $200,000 in company funds, some of which was improperly paid to Albanian tax auditors.  The managers misreported cash advances, diverted payments on previously paid invoices, misappropriated government rebate checks, and received reimbursement for such purchases as golf equipment and perfume that did not relate to business activities.  , According to the SEC’s complaint, Weatherford employees created false accounting and inventory records from 2002 to 2007 to hide the illegal commercial sales to Cuba, Syria, Sudan, and Iran.  During this time period, exporting or re-exporting goods or services from the U.S. to these sanctioned countries was prohibited.  The falsified financial statements and books and records of Weatherford subsidiaries involved in the misconduct were consolidated into the financial statements of the parent company., The SEC’s complaint alleges that Weatherford violated the anti-bribery, books and records, and internal accounting controls provisions of the FCPA, specifically Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Weatherford agreed to pay $90,984,844 in disgorgement, $4,399,423.34 in pre-judgment interest, and a $1.875 million civil penalty assessed in part for lack of cooperation during the investigation.  $31,646,907 of the payment to the SEC will be satisfied by Weatherford’s agreement to pay an equal amount to the U.S. Attorney’s Office.  Weatherford agreed to pay $87 million in criminal fines to the Department of Justice for the FCPA violations, and $100 million to the other three agencies for the sanctions violations.

Lazar, of Columbus, Ohio, in a case arising from his alleged participation in a boiler room operated by Edward M. Laborio, of Boston, Massachusetts and Boca Raton, Florida.  Lazar consented to the entry of the judgment., On August 10, 2012, the Commission charged Laborio, Lazar and others with raising up to $5.7 million from more than 150 investors through the fraudulent sale of five unregistered offerings.  As to Lazar in particular, the Complaint charged that from October through December 2008, Lazar raised $585,000 from 10 investors through the sale of a PIPE (private investment in a public equity) by misrepresenting that the PIPE guaranteed an annual 8.5% dividend and that it was safe, like a fixed annuity or a certificate of deposit.  The Complaint alleged that Laborio hired Lazar in September 2008 to open an Ohio branch office operating under the name Envit Capital Private Wealth Management, LLC.  Along with Laborio and Lazar, the Complaint charged Jonathan Fraiman, of Boston, Massachusetts and Lantana, Florida, along with seven entities, most with the name “Envit,” that were owned and controlled by Laborio, including a non-existent hedge fund., On November 27, 2013, the Court entered a final judgment against Lazar:  (i) permanently enjoining him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act); Sections 10(b) and 15(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers Act); (ii) barring him for three years from participating in any offering of penny stock; (iii) finding him liable for disgorgement of $16,820.99 and prejudgment interest of $2,917.65, for a total of $19,738.64; and (iv) waiving payment of the disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and not imposing a civil penalty, based upon the representations in Lazar’s sworn statement of financial condition.  Lazar agreed to settle the Commission’s charges without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint., The Court previously entered a final judgment by consent against Jonathan Fraiman on October 8, 2013.  In related administrative proceedings instituted by the Commission on October 11, 2013, Fraiman consented to be barred from any future association with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, transfer agent, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization, with the right to reapply after ten years.  The Commission’s civil injunctive action against Laborio and the Envit Companies, <em>SEC v Laborio et al.</em>, 1:12-cv-11489-MBB (D.

22882,2013,[<h3>SEC Files Civil Injunctive Action Against Charles Raymond Langston III for Insider Trading and Rule 105 Violations</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a Miami-based trader with insider trading in the stock of a Chinese company and conducting illegal short sales in the securities of three other companies. , The SEC alleges that Charles Raymond Langston III learned confidential information in advance of a public announcement that significantly decreased the value of AutoChina Internationals stock. Langston was solicited by placement agents to invest in a secondary offering of AutoChina stock. Despite agreeing to keep information confidential and not trade on it, he promptly sold short 29,000 shares of AutoChina stock in advance of the companys public announcement that it had completed the secondary offering. To avoid detection, Langston made the trades through an entity he owned using a different broker and different account than he used to purchase shares in AutoChinas initial offering. Langston made $193,108 in illegal profits by trading on inside information., The SEC complaint filed in federal court in Miami further alleges that Langston, and two of his companies, Guarantee Reinsurance and CRL Management, violated Rule 105 of Regulation M, which prohibits the short sale of an equity security during a restricted period - generally five business days before a public offering - and the purchase of that same security through the offering. The rule addresses illegal short selling that can reduce offering proceeds received by companies by artificially depressing the market price shortly before the company prices its public offering. The SEC alleges that Langston through Guarantee Reinsurance and CRL Management made short sales in advance of separate secondary offerings by Wells Fargo, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, and Alcoa, and he purchased shares in the same offerings. Langston and his companies violations of Rule 105 resulted in unlawful gains of more than $1.3 million. , The SECs complaint charges Langston with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 by engaging in illegal insider trading. Langston has agreed to settle these charges, without admitting or denying the allegations, and he has agreed to pay disgorgement of $193,108, prejudgment interest of $22,204, and a civil money penalty of $193,108 for the insider trading violation. Langston, Guarantee Reinsurance, and CRL Management have also agreed to be enjoined from violating Rule 105 of Regulation M of the Exchange Act. Monetary sanctions against the defendants for the Rule 105 violations will be determined by the court at a later date. , In September, the <a href=/News/PressRelease/Detail/PressRelease/1370539804376>SEC announced enforcement actions against 23 firms</a> for Rule 105 violations as a part of a crackdown on potential stock manipulation in advance of stock offerings.

Waters of Milton, Massachusetts, and two entities that he controlled, broker-dealer A.L. Waters Capital, LLC and investment adviser Moneta Management, LLC, who are defendants in an enforcement action filed by the Commission in May 2012. The Commission filed its action on an emergency basis in order to halt the defendants fraudulent sales of fictitious investment-related partnerships. The final judgment, to which the defendants consented, enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. The Court also found the defendants jointly and severally liable for $839,000 in disgorgement, which has been deemed satisfied by a restitution order of over $9 million in a parallel criminal proceeding., The Commissions enforcement action filed May 1, 2012 alleged that from at least 2009-2012, Waters, A.L. Waters Capital and Moneta Management engaged in a fraudulent scheme through which they raised at least $780,000 from at least 8 investors, including $500,000 from Waters church, by promising to use investor funds to purchase a portfolio of securities, when they instead misappropriated the money and spent it on personal and business expenses. On May 3, 2012, the Court entered a preliminary injunction order that, among other things, froze the defendants assets, as well as those of two relief defendants, one of whom was Waters wife, and required them to provide an accounting of all their assets to the Commission., On August 7, 2012, the Commission filed a civil contempt motion against Waters, alleging that he had violated the courts preliminary injunction and asset freeze order by establishing an undisclosed bank account, transferring funds to that account, dissipating assets, and failing to disclose the bank account to the Commission, as required by the Courts order. On August 9, 2012, the U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts filed a separate criminal contempt action against Waters based on the same allegations. On October 2, 2012, Waters pleaded guilty to the criminal contempt charges, and the Commission on December 3, 2012 barred Waters from the securities industry based on his guilty plea in the criminal contempt action., The U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts charged Waters with an array of securities fraud and other violations on October 17, 2012. On November 29, 2012, Waters pleaded guilty to sixteen counts of securities fraud, mail fraud, money laundering, and obstruction of justice arising out of both the conduct that is the subject of the Commissions civil action and a criminal scheme through which Waters defrauded clients of his rare coin business out of as much as $7.8 million. The criminal information to which Waters pleaded guilty further alleged that he engaged in money laundering through two transactions totaling $77,000. Finally, Waters pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice in connection with multiple misrepresentations to Commission staff, including that there were no investors in his investment-related partnerships, in order to conceal the fact that investor money was misappropriated in a fraudulent scheme. As a result of his guilty plea to this criminal conduct, Waters was sentenced on April 26, 2013 to 17 years in federal prison and three years of supervised release, and was ordered to pay $9,025,691 in restitution and forfeiture., The final judgment in the Commissions enforcement action enjoins the defendants from violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and also enjoins Waters and Moneta Management from violations of Section 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.

22886,2013,[<h3>SEC Halts Texas-Based Oil and Gas Investment Scheme</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges and an emergency asset freeze against the perpetrators of a Texas-based Ponzi scheme involving purported investments in oil and gas projects., The SEC alleges that Robert A. Helms and Janniece S. Kaelin, who work out of an office in Austin, misled investors about their experience in the oil and gas industry while raising nearly $18 million for supposed purchases of oil and gas royalty interests. Despite representations that nearly all of the money they raised would be used to make oil and gas investments, Helms and Kaelin actually used only a fraction of the offering proceeds for that purpose. Instead, the vast majority of investor funds were used to make Ponzi payments and cover various personal and business expenses., The SECs complaint unsealed late yesterday in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas also charges Deven Sellers of Arvada, Colo., and Roland Barrera of Costa Mesa, Calif., with illegally selling investments for Helms and Kaelin without being registered with the SEC. They also allegedly misled investors about the sales commissions and referral fees they were receiving., According to the SECs complaint, Helms and Kaelin began offering investments in 2011 through Vendetta Royalty Partners, a limited partnership that they control. They have since attracted at least 80 investors in more than a dozen states while promising in offering documents that they would use more than 99 percent of the investment proceeds to acquire a lucrative portfolio of oil and gas royalty interests. The offering documents were fraudulent as Helms and Kaelin invested only 10 percent of the proceeds, and the oil and gas projects in which they actually did invest generated only minuscule returns., The SEC alleges that Helms and Kaelin directed Vendetta Royalty Partners to make approximately $5.9 million in so-called partnership income distributions to investors. They used money from newer investors to make the distributions to earlier investors. Helms and Kaelin created the illusion that Vendetta Royalty Partners was a profitable enterprise when, in fact, it was a fraudulent Ponzi scheme. Some offering documents touted Helms to have extensive oil-and-gas experience, misrepresenting that he had worked with various mineral companies over the last 10 years advising management on issues involving the acquisition and management of royalty interests, mineral properties and related legal and financial issues. In fact, Helmss oil-and-gas experience came almost entirely from operating Vendetta Royalty Partners and its affiliated or predecessor companies., The SEC alleges that Helms and Kaelin misled investors about other important matters besides their business background and industry reputation. They failed to disclose the existence of litigation against them and companies they control. They misrepresented the performance of the limited oil-and-gas royalty investments actually under their management. And they failed to inform investors that Vendetta Royalty Partners was behind on its line of credit. The company ultimately defaulted., According to the SECs complaint, Helms and Kaelin along with Sellers and Barrera told potential investors that any commissions or finders fees would be small. However, Sellers and Barrera each received more than $200,000 in such fees on one investment alone. Sellers and Barrera regularly solicited investments without being registered as brokers., At the SECs request, the court entered an order temporarily restraining the defendants from further violations of the federal securities laws, freezing their assets, prohibiting the destruction of documents, requiring them to provide an accounting, and authorizing expedited discovery., The SECs complaint alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5. The complaint further alleges that Sellers and Barrera acted as unregistered brokers in violation of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act. The complaint requests permanent injunctions and the disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and penalties., The SECs investigation was conducted by Chris Davis, Carol Hahn, and Joann Harris of the Fort Worth Regional Office.  The SECs litigation will be led by Timothy McCole.

22888,2013,[<h3>Massachusetts Investment Adviser Sentenced to 36 Months in Jail for Defrauding Investors</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) announced that, on December 11, 2013, Judge Denise J. Casper of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts sentenced former Plymouth, Massachusetts investment adviser Jeffrey A. Liskov (Liskov) to serve a prison term of 36 months, followed by a supervised probationary period of 3 years, and to pay $3,003,147 in restitution. The sentence was imposed in connection with Liskov’s guilty plea in July 2013 to a one-count criminal Information charging him with willfully violating Section 206 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers Act)., The Commission previously filed a civil action against Liskov and his former advisory firm, EagleEye Asset Management, LLC (EagleEye), for defrauding their clients in connection with foreign currency exchange (forex) investments. The factual allegations in the criminal Information are substantially similar to those in the Commission’s complaint in the civil case.  The Commission’s complaint, filed on September 8, 2011, alleged that, between at least November 2008 and August 2010, Liskov made material misrepresentations to several advisory clients to induce them to liquidate investments in securities and instead invest in forex. The forex investments resulted in client losses totaling nearly $4 million, while EagleEye and Liskov pocketed over $300,000 in performance fees. The Commission alleged that Liskov’s strategy was to generate temporary profits on client forex investments to enable him to collect performance fees, after which client forex investments invariably quickly declined in value. , According to the Commission’s complaint, Liskov made material misrepresentations or failed to disclose material information to clients concerning the nature of forex investments, the risks involved in forex, and Liskov’s poor track record in forex trading for himself and other clients. The Commission’s complaint further alleged that, as to two clients, without their knowledge or consent, Liskov liquidated securities in their brokerage accounts and transferred the proceeds to their forex trading accounts where he lost nearly all their funds, but not before first collecting performance fees on temporary profits in these clients’ forex accounts. The complaint alleged that Liskov accomplished the unauthorized transfers by using “white out” correction fluid to change dates, amounts, and other data on asset transfer documentation. Liskov also opened multiple forex trading accounts in the name of one client, without obtaining the client’s consent, thereby maximizing his ability to earn performance fees on the client’s forex investments., As result of the foregoing conduct, the Commission alleged that EagleEye and Liskov violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Advisers Act. The Commission also alleged that EagleEye failed to maintain certain books and records required of investment advisers in violation of Section 204 of the Advisers Act and Rule 204-2 thereunder, and that Liskov aided and abetted EagleEye’s violations of these recordkeeping provisions., After an eight-day trial in the Commission’s civil case, on November 26, 2012, a jury found that EagleEye and Liskov violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 206(1) of the Advisers Act. After a further hearing, United States District Court Judge William G. Young found that EagleEye and Liskov violated Section 204 of the Advisers Act and Rule 204-2 thereunder, concerning recordkeeping obligations relating to EagleEye’s business. On December 12, 2012, the Court entered a final judgment against EagleEye and Liskov in the Commission’s action, ordering that they be permanently enjoined from future violations of the foregoing provisions of the securities laws. The Court also ordered EagleEye and Liskov to pay, jointly and severally, disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains in the amount of $301,502.26, plus pre-judgment interest on that amount of $29,603.59, and each to pay a civil penalty of $725,000., On December 27, 2012, the Commission instituted public administrative proceedings against each of EagleEye and Liskov to determine what sanctions against them, if any, would be appropriate and in the public interest. On July 24, 2013, an administrative law judge revoked EagleEye’s registration as an investment adviser and barred Liskov from, among other things, associating with any investment adviser. On September 23, 2013, the Commission issued orders of finality in the administrative proceedings against EagleEye and Liskov., The Commission acknowledges the assistance of Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts William F.

22890,2013,[<h3>SEC Charges Perpetrators of Prime Bank Schemes in Las Vegas and Switzerland</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission filed fraud charges against a company named with an acronym for Make A Lot Of Money that is behind a pair of advance fee schemes guaranteeing astronomical returns to investors in purported prime bank transactions and overseas debt instruments., The SEC alleges that Swiss-based Malom Group AG and several individuals conducted the schemes from Las Vegas and Zurich. They raised $11 million from U.S. investors by using a series of lies and forged documents to steer them into seemingly successful foreign trading programs that were nothing more than vehicles to steal money. Advance fee frauds solicit investors to make upfront payments before purported deals can go through, and perpetrators fool investors with official-sounding terminology to add an air of legitimacy to the investment programs. Many transactions offered by Malom bore the hallmarks of prime bank frauds, which tout the supposed use of well-known overseas banks to attract investors., The SEC alleges that Malom charged investors fees for bogus services, and the individuals pulling the strings distributed investor funds among themselves for personal use. They further lied to investors who later inquired about the progress of the transactions, lulling them with excuses about why they have yet to receive investment returns or refunds., In a parallel action, the U.S. Department of Justice today announced criminal charges against the same six individuals charged in the SECs complaint:, According to the SECs complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada, the schemes occurred from 2009 to 2011, and lulling of investors continued through 2013. None of the transactions in securities offered or sold were registered with the SEC or eligible for an exemption. In the first scheme, they offered joint venture agreements that purportedly allowed investors to use Maloms financial resources in exchange for an upfront fee. The agreements required the investors to propose investment transactions for Malom to enter into with third parties in order to generate returns for the company and the investor. Malom supplied investors with forged bank statements and proof of funds letters to give the false impression that the company had the millions of dollars needed for the transactions. Before investors paid their upfront fees, the Malom executives and promoters typically knew at least the basic details of the proposed trading programs, in some cases actually providing the trading program for investors to propose. But after receiving the upfront fees from investors, Malom proceeded to reject every proposed transaction and misappropriate investor funds to further the scheme and line the perpetrators pockets., According to the SECs complaint, the second scheme falsely promised investors that Malom would generate funding by creating structured notes that would be listed on Western European exchanges. After inducing investors to pay an underwriting fee and making personal and corporate guarantees of repayment, Malom reneged on the guarantees of repayment and failed to issue any structured notes. Again the perpetrators behind the scheme quickly distributed investor funds among themselves., The SECs complaint alleges that Malom, its principals and agents Martin U. SchlÃ¤pfer, Hans-Jurg Lips, James C. Warras, and Joseph N. Micelli violated the antifraud and securities registration provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically, Section 17(a) and Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and, except as to Malom Group, they aided and abetted violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Further, the SECs complaint alleges that M.Y. Consultants, Inc., Anthony B. Brandel, M. Dwyer LLC, and Sean P. Finn violated the antifraud and securities and broker-dealer registration provisions of the federal securities laws. Specifically, the complaint alleges that these defendants violated Sections 17(a) and 5 of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act; and that they aided and abetted violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Thomas &amp; Co., LLC with violations of the securities offering and broker-dealer registration provisions of the federal securities laws. , Filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, the Commissions complaint alleges that the Parvizian, through Arcturus and Aschere, raised nearly $22 million from at least 380 investors between 2007 and December 2011.The complaint alleges that Parvizian prepared and disseminated to prospective investors offering materials that included material misrepresentations and omissions regarding, among other things, material litigation involving Arcturus and Aschere. According to the complaint, Parvizian, Arcturus and Aschere systematically, and without disclosure to investors, used the offering proceeds to pay the costs of defending and settling the litigation. The complaint further alleges that, among other things, Parvizian prematurely called for completion funds on at least two projects before he had finished drilling and testing the wells because he had already spent the offering proceeds for non-JV related expenses, including legal fees. According to the complaint, Parvizian, Arcturus, and Aschere spent only $7.9 million, or 36 percent, of the money raised to drill oil and gas wells., The complaint also alleges that the defendants offered and sold the joint venture interests in unregistered securities offerings that were not exempt from the registration requirements of the federal securities laws. In addition, the complaint alleges that Parvizian, Gonzalez, AMG, Balunas, and R. Thomas &amp; Co. acted as unregistered broker-dealers.

Through the phony press release and fraudulent marketing campaign, Hamdan disseminated false claims that CompuSonics had reached an out-of-court settlement regarding the companys patent portfolio and the phony press release added the claim that CompuSonics was considering many options to bring back shareholder value, including a cash dividend and a stock buy-back program. The Complaint alleges that in order to conduct the scheme, Hamdan employed numerous tactics to hide his true identity, including a proxy internet server, an anonymous email service, fictitious contact information, and a prepaid cellphone., The Complaint alleges that Hamdan and Oracle violated of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

22893,2013,[<h3>SEC Charges Microsoft Senior Manager and Friend with Insider Trading in Advance of Company News</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that, on December 19, 2013, it charged a senior portfolio manager at Microsoft Corporation and his friend and business partner with insider trading ahead of company announcements., The SEC alleges that Brian D. Jorgenson, who lives in Lynwood, Wash., obtained confidential information about upcoming company news through his work in Microsofts corporate finance and investments division. Jorgenson tipped Sean T. Stokke of Seattle in advance of the Microsoft announcements, the most recent occurring in October. After Stokke traded on the inside information that Jorgenson provided, the two equally split the illicit profits in their shared brokerage accounts. They made joint trading decisions with the goal of generating enough profits to create their own hedge fund., In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Western District of Washington announced criminal charges against Jorgenson and Stokke., According to the SECs complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, Jorgenson and Stokke made a combined $393,125 in illicit profits in their scheme, which began in April 2012., The SEC alleges that Stokke first traded in advance of a public announcement that Microsoft intended to invest $300 million in Barnes &amp; Nobles e-reader business.  Jorgenson learned of the impending transaction after his department became involved in the financing aspects of the deal. Jorgenson tipped Stokke so he could purchase approximately $14,000 worth of call options on Barnes &amp; Noble common stock. Following a joint public announcement on April 30, 2012, Barnes &amp; Nobles stock price closed at $20.75 per share, a 51.68 percent increase from the previous day. Jorgenson and Stokke made nearly $185,000 in ill-gotten trading profits., The SEC alleges that Stokke later traded in advance of Microsofts fourth-quarter earnings announcement in July 2013. As part of his duties at Microsoft, Jorgenson prepared a written analysis of how the market would react to the negative news that Microsofts fourth quarter earnings were more than 11 percent below consensus estimates. He estimated that Microsofts stock price would decline by at least six percent. Jorgenson tipped this confidential information to Stokke, who purchased almost $50,000 worth of Microsoft options. After Microsofts announcement on July 18, its stock price declined more than 11 percent the next day from $35.44 to $31.40 per share.  Jorgenson and Stokke realized more than $195,000 in illicit profits., According to the SECs complaint, Stokke traded in advance of another Microsoft announcement on Oct. 24, 2013. Jorgenson was aware that the company would be announcing first quarter 2014 earnings that were more than 14 percent higher than consensus estimates. Rather than purchase Microsoft securities directly, Jorgenson and Stokke purchased more than $45,000 worth of call options on an exchange-traded fund in which Microsoft comprised more than eight percent of the funds holdings. Following the announcement, Microsofts share price increased nearly six percent and the price of the ETF increased 0.51 percent. Jorgenson and Stokke made approximately $13,000 in illegal trading profits., Jorgenson and Stokke are charged with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, both directly and pursuant to Section 20(d) of the Exchange Act.

Kocoras of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois entered an order of permanent injunctions against Oakbrook, Illinois resident Patrick G. Rooney (Rooney) and his company Solaris Management, LLC (Solaris)., According to the SECs complaint filed on November 16, 2011, Rooney and Solaris radically changed the investment strategy of the Solaris Opportunity Fund LP (the Fund), contrary to the Funds offering documents and marketing materials, by becoming wholly invested in Positron Corp. (Positron), a financially troubled microcap company. The SEC alleges that Rooney, who has been Chairman of Positron since 2004 and received salary and stock options from Positron since September 2005, misused the Funds money by investing more than $3.6 million in Positron through both private transactions and market purchases. Many of the private transactions were undocumented while other investments were interest-free loans to Positron. Rooney and Solaris hid the Positron investments and Rooneys relationship with the company from the Funds investors for over four years. Although Rooney finally told investors about the Positron investments in a March 2009 newsletter, the SECs complaint alleges he falsely told them he became Chairman to safeguard the Funds investments. These investments benefited Positron and Rooney while providing the Fund with a concentrated, undiversified, and illiquid position in a cash-poor company with a lengthy track record of losses., Without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, Rooney and Solaris consented to the entry of permanent injunctions which enjoin them from violating Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rules 206(4)-8(a)(1) and (a)(2) thereunder; Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933; and Sections 10(b) and 13(d)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 13d-1 thereunder.

Concerning Its Illegal Unregistered Distributions of Stock - Relief Includes Payment of More Than $4 Million</h3>]","[ The Commission today settled a pending civil action against Advanced Cell Technology, Inc. (“Advanced Cell”), arising out of Advanced Cell’s issuance of hundreds of millions of unregistered shares of common stock on thirteen separate occasions without qualifying for any exemption from registration.  The settlement, which was filed with the Court earlier today, is subject to the Court’s approval.  ,  In its Complaint filed on May 30, 2012, the Commission alleged that seven defendants, including Advanced Cell, a biotechnology company with headquarters in Marlborough, Massachusetts, violated the federal securities laws by engaging in the illegal unregistered distribution of billions of shares of penny stocks through the repeated misuse of the exemption from registration contained in Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act of 1933.  Section 3(a)(10) permits a company to issue common stock to public investors other than pursuant to an effective registration statement “in exchange for one or more bona fide outstanding securities, claims or property interests  . . . where the terms and conditions of such issuance and exchange are approved after a hearing [held before a court or other governmental authority authorized to conduct such hearings] upon the fairness of such terms and conditions.”  The Section 3(a)(10) exemption may not be relied upon for capital formation by issuers, and it was improperly used for that purpose in these transactions.   ,  According to the Commission’s Complaint, in or about early 2006, Mark A. Lefkowitz, a penny stock financier, developed an illegal strategy for penny stock issuers to pay off past due debts and also raise capital by issuing stock purportedly pursuant to the Section 3(a)(10) exemption.  The Complaint alleges that in September 2008, Lefkowitz introduced the strategy to William Caldwell IV, who was then the Chief Executive Officer of Advanced Cell.   ,  The Complaint alleges that from September 2008 through January 2009, pursuant to an agreement between Lefkowitz and Caldwell, several entities affiliated with Lefkowitz (collectively, the “Lefkowitz Related Entities”) purchased past due debts of Advanced Cell from various Advanced Cell debtholders.  Shortly after a Lefkowitz Related Entity acquired each debt, Lefkowitz and Caldwell agreed on the terms of a settlement, and the Lefkowitz Related Entity filed a lawsuit against Advanced Cell in a Florida state court purportedly to collect on the debt.  The principal purpose of the lawsuits, according to the Complaint, was to present the settlements to the Florida state court for a fairness hearing, as required by Section 3(a)(10).     ,  The Complaint alleges that, in each instance, the Florida state court found the settlements to be fair and entered an order granting a Section 3(a)(10) exemption.  However, the Commission’s Complaint asserts that the parties never informed the Florida state court of the full terms and conditions of the settlements, thereby compromising the fairness hearings.  According to the Complaint, the parties falsely represented to the Florida state court that they were settling for the face value of the past due debts and did not inform the Florida state court of the actual market value of the settlement shares or that the market value of the shares greatly exceeded the amount of the debts that were to be extinguished.  Nor was the Florida state court told that the Lefkowitz Related Entities had agreed to sell the settlement shares quickly and remit a substantial portion of the sales proceeds to Advanced Cell.  ,  According to the Complaint, Advanced Cell ultimately issued a total of 260,115,983 shares of unrestricted common stock to settle the thirteen lawsuits filed against it by the Lefkowitz Related Entities.  The settlement shares, which had a total market value of approximately $9,230,000 as of the respective settlement dates, were issued to satisfy past due debts totaling approximately $1,110,000.  According to the Complaint, after retaining a portion of the profits from the sale of the shares for themselves, the Lefkowitz Related Entities remitted $3.5 million to Advanced Cell.   ,  The Complaint alleges that, as a result of the foregoing, Advanced Cell’s unregistered distributions to the Lefkowitz Related Entities violated Section 5 of the Securities Act.  The Complaint also alleges that Advanced Cell failed to timely disclose the settlement agreements and its issuance of unregistered shares of common stock in connection with the Section 3(a)(10) settlements by filing current reports on Forms 8-K with the Commission.   ,  The proposed final judgment would enjoin Advanced Cell from violating Section 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 13a-11 thereunder.  It would also order Advanced Cell to disgorge $3.5 million in ill-gotten payments from the Lefkowitz Related Entities, plus prejudgment interest in the amount of $586,619, for a total of $4,086,619, but would not impose a civil penalty based upon Advanced Cell’s financial condition.  Advanced Cell consented to the entry of the proposed Final Judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission’s Complaint. ,  The Commission’s litigation against the five remaining defendants, Mark A. Lefkowitz, Mark A. Lopez, Unico, Inc., Steven R. Peacock, and Shane H. Traveller, is ongoing. ,  For further information, please see <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22381.htm>Litigation Release No. 22381</a> (May 30, 2012).  ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2013/lr22896.htm</i><br/>]"

According to the Complaint, from approximately January 2011 until August 2012 when the ZeekRewards website was shut down, Rex Venture Group raised more than $850 million from approximately one million internet customers nationwide and overseas through the website. Both defendants have agreed to settle the Commission’s allegations against them, and their settlement papers were submitted to the Court for its consideration., The Complaint alleged that defendants solicited investors through the internet and other means to participate in the ZeekRewards program, a self-described “affiliate advertising division” for the companion website, Zeekler.com, through which the defendants operated penny auctions. The ZeekRewards program offered customers several ways to earn money, two of which — the “Retail Profit Pool” and the “Matrix” — involved purchasing securities in the form of investment contracts. These securities offerings were not registered with the SEC as required under the federal securities laws. , According to the Complaint, Wright-Olivares and others lured investors to ZeekRewards by promising investors a share of the company’s daily net profits in the form of daily profit share awards. The company’s purported calculations consistently resulted in daily award averaging approximately 1.5 percent per day, fraudulently conveying the false impression that the company was extremely profitable. In fact, the daily award percentage was fabricated and investor payouts bore no relation to the company’s net profits. Approximately 98% of ZeekRewards’ total revenues and the “net profits” paid to investors were comprised of funds received from new investors in classic Ponzi scheme fashion. When the company was shut down in August 2012, it was teetering on collapse. , The Complaint further alleged that Wright-Olivares conceived of the idea for operating penny auctions, helped develop the technical specifications for the Zeekler.com program and its key features, marketed ZeekRewards to investors, managed some of RVG’s operations, and helped design and implement features that concealed the fraud. She was a principal spokesperson for ZeekRewards, and she also served as chief operating officer from September 2011 to June 2012. For the duration of the company’s existence, Olivares was the chief architect of the company’s computer databases that tracked all investments (including subscription and bid purchases), managed the electronic operations, and perpetuated the illusion of a successful retail business. , The Commission alleged that Wright-Olivares offered and sold securities in violation of the registration provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act, and both defendants violated the antifraud provisions of the Section 17 of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The Complaint requested permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against the defendants. Without denying the allegations—and while also admitting the facts set forth in the Factual Summary filed contemporaneously with their respective plea agreements in the parallel criminal case — both defendants have agreed to settle the Commission’s charges against them, and their settlement papers were submitted to the Court for its consideration. In particular, both consented to permanent injunctions against future violations of the respective registration and antifraud provisions with which they were each charged. Wright-Olivares also agreed to disgorge at least $8,184,064.94 and Olivares agreed to disgorge at least $3,272,934.58 — amounts that represent the entirety of their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest. In light of their anticipated incarceration, no civil penalty will be imposed. The settlements are subject to approval by the court. In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of North Carolina simultaneously announced criminal charges against, and plea agreements by, the pair. , The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the United States Attorney’s Office for the Western District of North Carolina and the United States Secret Service. , The SEC’s investigation is continuing. , <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2013/comp-pr2013-270.pdf>SEC Complaint</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2013/lr22898.htm</i><br/>]"

22900,2013,[<h3>SEC Charges Archer-Daniels-Midland Company with FCPA Violations</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged global food processor Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (ADM) for failing to prevent illicit payments made by foreign subsidiaries to Ukrainian government officials in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA)., An SEC investigation found that ADMs subsidiaries in Germany and Ukraine paid $21 million in bribes through intermediaries to secure the release of value-added tax (VAT) refunds. The payments were then concealed by improperly recording the transactions in accounting records as insurance premiums and other purported business expenses. ADM had insufficient anti-bribery compliance controls and made approximately $33 million in illegal profits as a result of the bribery by its subsidiaries., ADM, which is based in Decatur, Ill., has agreed to pay more than $36 million to settle the SECs charges. In a parallel action, the U.S. Department of Justice today announced a non-prosecution agreement with ADM and criminal charges against an ADM subsidiary that has agreed to pay $17.8 million in criminal fines., According to the SECs complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of Illinois, the bribery occurred from 2002 to 2008. Ukraine imposed a 20 percent VAT on goods purchased in its country. If the goods were exported, the exporter could apply for a refund of the VAT already paid to the government on those goods. However, at times the Ukrainian government delayed paying VAT refunds it owed or did not make any refund payments at all. On these occasions, the outstanding amount of VAT refunds owed to ADMs Ukraine affiliate reached as high as $46 million., The SEC alleges that in order to obtain the VAT refunds that the Ukraine government was withholding, ADMs subsidiaries in Germany and Ukraine devised several schemes to bribe Ukraine government officials to release the money. The bribes paid were generally 18 to 20 percent of the corresponding VAT refunds. For example, the subsidiaries artificially inflated commodities contracts with a Ukrainian shipping company to provide bribe payments to government officials. In another scheme, the subsidiaries created phony insurance contracts with an insurance company that included false premiums passed on to Ukraine government officials. The misconduct went unchecked by ADM for several years because of its deficient and decentralized system of FCPA oversight over subsidiaries in Germany and Ukraine., The SECs complaint charges ADM with violating Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. ADM consented to the entry of a final judgment ordering the company to pay disgorgement of $33,342,012 plus prejudgment interest of $3,125,354. The final judgment also permanently enjoins ADM from violating those sections of the Exchange Act, and requires the company to report on its FCPA compliance efforts for a three-year period. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC took into account ADMs cooperation and significant remedial measures, including self-reporting the matter, implementing a comprehensive new compliance program throughout its operations, and terminating employees involved in the misconduct., The SECs investigation was conducted by Nicholas A. Brady and supervised by Moira T. Roberts and Anita B. Bandy. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Justice Departments Fraud Section and the Federal Bureau of Investigation., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2013/comp-pr2013-271.pdf>SEC Complaint</a>, <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=http://www.sec.gov/News/PressRelease/Detail/PressRelease/1370540535139>Press Release</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2013/lr22900.htm</i><br/>]"
