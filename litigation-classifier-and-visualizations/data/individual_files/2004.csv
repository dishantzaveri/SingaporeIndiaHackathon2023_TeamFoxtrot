Budinger, former president of Online Power Supply.  The judgment settles the Commissions claims against Budinger in a civil action filed on January 21, 2003. The complaint alleges that Budinger made false and misleading statements or omitted to state material facts to investors concerning, among other things, compensation that OnLine paid to registered representatives, and that Budinger misappropriated some of the proceeds from the sale of 841,000 shares of OnLine treasury stock.  The complaint further alleges that Budinger violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and aided and abetted Onlines violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder. , Budinger consented, without admitting or denying any factual allegations in the complaint, to the entry of the Order which imposes an officer and director bar against him, along with a penny stock bar.  The Order also requires Budinger to pay disgorgement in the total amount of $106,000, but waived payment of disgorgement and did not impose a penalty based on his demonstrated inability to pay them.  In addition, Budinger consented to a permanent injunction restraining and enjoining him from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder. ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18529.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Cal.)</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that today it filed securities fraud charges against three former senior executives of Gemstar-TV Guide International, Inc. - its former co-president, its former general counsel, and the former chief financial officer of its wholly owned subsidiary, TV Guide, Inc.  The complaint charges that these executives participated in Gemstars widespread and complex scheme to inflate its licensing and advertising revenue and to mislead investors about the companys true financial performance., The SECs action, filed in United States District Court in Los Angeles, amends the Commissions complaint filed against Gemstars former chief executive officer, Henry C. Yuen, and former chief financial officer, Elsie M. Leung, on June 19, 2003.  The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, civil money penalties, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains (including salaries, bonuses and any proceeds from the sale of stock during the fraud), and bars from service as an officer or director of a public company., The SECs new charges name the following defendants:, The SEC charged each defendant with violations of Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder, aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 thereunder.  The SEC also charged Orlick and Waggy with aiding and abetting violations of Rule 13a-13 of the Exchange Act, and Orlick with violations of Rule 13b2-2 of the Exchange Act., Gemstar is a Los Angeles-based media and technology company that, among other things, publishes TV Guide magazine and develops, licenses, and markets an interactive program guide (IPG) for televisions that enables consumers to navigate through and select television programs.  During the relevant period, Gemstar generated revenues from the IPG by licensing the technology to third parties and selling advertising on the IPG.  In statements to securities analysts and the investing public, Gemstar repeatedly touted the IPG technology and IPG advertising revenues as the companys future and as the value driver of the companys stock, and downplayed expected declines in revenue from TV Guide magazine., The SECs amended complaint alleges that, from June 1999 through September 2002, Gemstar overstated its total revenues by at least $248 million to meet its ambitious projections for revenue growth from IPG licensing and advertising.  As described in the SECs amended complaint, Gemstar manipulated its financial results through the following schemes., The amended complaint alleges that Boylan participated in Gemstars fraudulent reporting of transactions relating to IPG advertising.  The amended complaint alleges that Boylan structured two transactions unrelated to IPG advertising so that a portion of the amount to be paid to Gemstar was nominally and artificially allocated to the sale of IPG advertising.  The amended complaint further alleges that in press releases, conference calls with securities analysts, and annual reports, Boylan omitted to disclose material information regarding the transactions., The amended complaint also alleges that Orlick participated in Gemstars fraudulent recording and disclosure of certain IPG licensing and advertising revenue.  The amended complaint alleges that Orlick knew, but omitted to disclose, that Gemstar was improperly recognizing and reporting material amounts of licensing revenue from two companies.  The amended complaint also alleges that Orlick participated in Gemstars fraudulent recognition of this licensing revenue by repeatedly signing false management representation letters to Gemstars auditors regarding the status of negotiations with one of the companies.  Orlick failed to disclose material information regarding certain of Gemstars IPG revenue., The amended complaint alleges that Waggy participated in Gemstars fraudulent recognition and disclosure of certain IPG advertising revenue.  The amended complaint alleges that Waggy participated in Gemstars fraudulent recognition of IPG advertising revenue from TV Guide for advertising that did not run, from a third party that did not have the financial ability to pay for the advertising, and from an advertising barter transaction.  Waggy also omitted to disclose material information regarding certain of Gemstars IPG revenue.  The amended complaint further alleges that Waggy participated in Gemstars fraudulent disclosure by preparing annual and quarterly reports that omitted to disclose that certain IPG advertising revenue was improperly recognized and misrepresented that certain IPG advertising was unrelated to Gemstars other transactions with the advertiser., The SECs amended complaint charges Boylan, Orlick, and Waggy with securities fraud, falsifying Gemstars books and records, and aiding and abetting Gemstars reporting and record-keeping violations of the federal securities laws.  The amended complaint also charges Orlick with lying to Gemstars auditors., Previously, the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles granted the SECs application for an order requiring Gemstar to escrow any extraordinary payments to any of its directors, officers, partners, controlling persons, agents, or employees pursuant to Section 1103 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.  The Courts order placed in escrow, subject to court supervision, approximately $37.64 million in cash payments that Gemstar had previously agreed to pay to Yuen and Leung., The Commissions investigation into the conduct of others is continuing., Additional information can be found in <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18199.htm>Litigation Release No. 18199</a> (June 20, 2003), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18135.htm>No. 18135</a> (May 13, 2003), and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18095.htm>No. 18095</a> (April 18, 2003).,  ]"

Hammonds, 62, formerly of Inglewood, California, and Barry V. Reed, 58, formerly of Las Vegas, Nevada, were charged by the United States Attorney for the Central District of California in Santa Ana with using the United States mails to perpetrate an oil and gas investment scheme to defraud investors., In November 2001, Hammonds and Reed, along with two Nevada corporations, Texon Energy Corp. and Lonestar Petroleum Corp., were charged by the Commission with violating the securities registration provisions of the federal securities laws, Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933, and the antifraud provisions, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Reed was Texons president and Hammonds was Texons vice-president.  They raised $1.25 million from the sale of Texon stock to about 65 investors nationwide.  Investors were promised a dividend of 12% per year on their investment.  The Commissions complaint charged that Hammonds and Reed, through Texon and Lonestar, operated a Ponzi-like scheme in which they paid dividends to existing investors with money raised from new investors.  Texon and Lonestar, without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of the antifraud and securities registration provisions of the federal securities laws.  A final judgment entered against Hammonds and Reed enjoins them from future violations of the antifraud and securities registration provisions, and orders them to pay civil penalties of $110,000 each and to disgorge $1,254,100 plus prejudgment interest., Hammonds and Reed are scheduled to be sentenced on March 24, 2004.  The total maximum sentence for all offenses to which Hammonds and Reed pleaded guilty is 120 years imprisonment, a three-year period of supervised release, a fine of $1.5 million or twice the gross gain or gross loss resulting from the offenses, whichever is greatest, full restitution to the victims, and a mandatory special assessment of $600.  In addition to those penalties, convictions arising out of the conduct of telemarketing that victimized ten or more persons over the age of 55 may be subject to an additional prison term of up to 10 years., In 1994, Hammonds was enjoined by the Commission for his part in a similar oil and gas fraud in which investors were also falsely promised a 12% return.  In 1996, Hammonds was barred by the Commission from the securities industry., For further information, see <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17231.htm>Litigation Release No.17231</a> (November 14, 2001).  ,  ]"

In the same case, on December 23, the Honorable Audrey B. Collins, United States District Judge for the Central District of California, issued a temporary restraining order against Lewis, which temporarily restrained him from committing future securities fraud violations, froze the assets of Lewis, FAC, Income Fund, and Growth Fund, and required Lewis to provide an accounting.  , As stated in the Commissions moving papers, the Commission is seeking the receiver based on the following facts and evidence.  First, Lewis asserted his Fifth Amendment privilege in response to the order to provide an accounting and failed to appear at his deposition.  Second, a preliminary review of Lewis records indicates that assets under his control total only a small percentage of the $813 million Lewis owes investors.  These assets include about $2.3 million in cash, $5.8 million in investments in two private companies, and interests in three residences.  Third, the preliminary review of Lewis records also shows that he used investor funds for undisclosed purposes, including trading in foreign currency and purchasing luxury automobiles and expensive jewelry.

Prousalis, Jr. and Robert T. Kirk, Jr.</i>, Civil Action No. 04-CV-00081 (S.D.N.Y.)</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York charging Thomas T. Prousalis, Jr. and Robert T. Kirk, Jr. with committing fraud in connection with the June 2000 initial public offering by busybox.com, Inc.  Prousalis was securities counsel for busybox and Kirk was the majority owner and president of Barron Chase Securities, Inc., the lead underwriter for the offering.  Prousalis is a resident of McLean, Virginia and is licensed to practice in Washington, D.C.  Kirk is a resident of Parkland, Florida., The complaint alleges that Barron Chase agreed to underwrite a firm commitment offering that would raise approximately $12.8 million for busybox.  After informing busybox that Barron Chase was having difficulty selling the IPO securities to bona fide investors, Kirk and Prousalis devised and executed a fraudulent scheme to complete the offering.  According to the complaint, Kirk and Prousalis arranged for busybox insiders to purchase IPO securities using undisclosed bonuses, and for Prousalis to receive an inflated and undisclosed legal fee that was to be paid using IPO securities.  Barron Chase secretly financed these transactions and, during the IPO closing, Kirk and Prousalis caused busybox to repay Barron Chase out of the proceeds of the offering.  The complaint further alleges that the scheme gave Prousalis and the insiders almost 20% of the securities offered in the IPO, and reduced the proceeds available to busybox by over $2.1 million.  The IPO registration statement and prospectus did not disclose the insiders stock purchases, the inflated legal fee paid to Prousalis, Barron Chases financing of these transactions or the repayment to Barron Chase using IPO proceeds., As set forth in the complaint, the fraudulent scheme misled investors as to the financial health and future viability of the company.  The complaint alleges that Prousalis and Kirks firm benefited financially from the scheme by receiving fees of approximately $1.25 million and $1.5 million, respectively.  Finally, the Commission charged that, after the IPO was completed, Prousalis owned more than 5% of the companys outstanding stock, but failed to report his holdings on a Schedule 13D, as required by law.  He also failed to report the subsequent sale of all of his busybox IPO stock. , The Commission charges that Prousalis and Kirk violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Prousalis is also charged with violating Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13d-1 and 13d-2 thereunder.  The Commission is seeking permanent injunctions, disgorgement of defendants ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and the imposition of civil penalties against Prousalis and Kirk.  , Also today, the United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York announced the filing of related criminal charges against Prousalis and Kirk.

Robert Quattrone, et al., </i>Civil Action No. 04-33(SRC) (D.N.J.) </h2>]","[On January 7, 2004, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil complaint in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey charging ten defendants with violating the antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws in connection with a multi-year financial fraud at Suprema Specialties, Inc. (Suprema), a now defunct manufacturer and distributor of cheese products based in Paterson, New Jersey.  The defendants include Arthur Christensen, the former controller of Suprema; John Van Sickell, the former operations manager of Supremas Paterson, New Jersey plant; five entities that purported to buy from or sell products to Suprema in the round-tripping scheme, Battaglia &amp; Company, Inc. (Battaglia), California Milk Market (CMM), LNN Enterprises, Inc. (LNN), Packing Products, Inc. (Packing Products), and West Coast Commodities, Inc. (WCC); and three persons who owned or operated these entities, Lawrence Fransen, Robert Quattrone, and George Vieira.  Vieira was also sued in connection with his conduct as the former chief operating officer of Supremas Manteca, California plant.  Without admitting or denying the SECs charges, all of the defendants have consented to the entry of judgments providing for full injunctive and other relief (described below), while deferring for determination at a later date the amount of any disgorgement, prejudgment interest and civil penalties to be awarded.  , In its complaint, the SEC charged that, from at least 1998 through February 2002, when Suprema filed for bankruptcy, the defendants were engaged in a financial fraud that consisted of three components.  First, Suprema and certain of its customers and vendors, including the five entities named as defendants, engaged in round-tripping transactions that generated approximately $700 million in fictitious sales revenue, or approximately 60% of Supremas total reported revenue of approximately $1.13 billion over the relevant time period.  Second, imitation cheese and non-cheese products were falsely re-labeled as premium cheeses to fraudulently inflate Supremas reported inventory.  Third, certain of Supremas cheese products were adulterated with imitation cheese and non-cheese ingredients in order to reduce Supremas costs illegally, contrary to statements in its filings with the SEC that Suprema sold natural or all natural cheeses that met applicable federal standards.  According to the SECs complaint, all three components of the fraudulent scheme resulted in material misstatements in Supremas periodic reports filed with the SEC during its fiscal years 1998 through 2001 and the first quarter of 2002, as well as in the registration statements Suprema filed with the SEC for its secondary public offerings in 2000 and 2001.  , The complaint alleges that the round-tripping transactions were effectuated through circles of entities, each of which included Suprema, a third-party customer, and a related vendor.  In most instances, the customer and vendor in each circle shared a common owner.  False paperwork, including purchase orders, invoices, and bills of lading, was created purporting to represent sales of various cheese products from Suprema to the customer, then from the customer to the vendor, and finally from the vendor back to Suprema.  On each leg of the circle  Suprema to the customer, customer to the vendor, and vendor back to Suprema  checks were circulated in purported payment for the transactions.  Typically, the checks from Suprema to each vendor involved in the fraud were greater than the corresponding checks from the related customer back to Suprema.  This difference in the checks represented a kick-back or commission paid to the common owners for their participation in the fraudulent scheme.  Funds for the checks, including commissions, were drawn on Supremas line of credit, which increased as Supremas accounts receivable grew.  With rare exception, no goods were actually sold, purchased, or exchanged in these transactions.  ,   Specifically, in its complaint the SEC alleged that the defendants participated in the fraudulent scheme as follows:, Based on these allegations, the SEC charged Christensen, Fransen, Quattrone, Van Sickell, Vieira, Battaglia, CMM, LNN, Packing Products, and WCC with: (i) securities fraud in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5; (ii) aiding and abetting Supremas violations of the periodic reporting, books and records, and internal accounting controls provisions of Exchange Act Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13; and (iii) aiding and abetting misrepresentations by Supremas officers and directors to the companys accountants in violation of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-2.  Christensen and Van Sickell were also charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and, along with Vieira,  knowingly circumventing internal accounting controls and falsifying corporate books and records in violation of Exchange Act Section 13(b)(5) and Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1., Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SECs complaint, all of the defendants have agreed to settle the SECs charges.  Subject to the Courts approval, these settlements would result in judgments ordering permanent injunctive relief against future violations of the federal securities laws, permanent officer and director bars against the individual defendants (with the exception of Christensen, who would be subject to a ten-year bar in recognition of his level of cooperation), and deferment of any disgorgement, interest, or civil penalties until decided by the court upon motion by the SEC at a later date., In a related proceeding, the United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey filed criminal charges against Fransen, Quattrone, Van Sickell, and Vieira.  At a plea hearing in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey held earlier today, Fransen, Quattrone, and Vieira each plead guilty to one count of securities fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, bank fraud, and mail fraud and to make false statements to auditors.  In the same proceeding, Van Sickell plead guilty to one count of food adulteration and misbranding with intent to defraud and one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, bank fraud, and mail fraud, to make false statements to auditors, and to introduce adulterated and misbranded food into interstate commerce.

In addition, Gaines must also pay $72,413 in disgorgement, including prejudgment interest, and a $50,000 civil penalty., The Commissions Complaint charged that Gaines, individually and d/b/a Wrigley Drive Partners and Morten Avenue Partners, from September 1999 through March 2001, made fraudulent mini-tender offers to shareholders to purchase up to 1% of the outstanding stock of 287 public companies.  Mini-tender offer is a securities industry term for a tender offer resulting in ownership by the offeror of not more than 5% of a public companys securities.

According to the Commission, Gaines knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that the shareholders were not receiving this material information, and supported this allegation by pointing out that in 1999, for virtually identical conduct, Gaines agreed to a Commission order against his previous company, IG Holdings.

Howell of the Southern District of New York granted the Securities and Exchange Commissions motion for a preliminary injunction and other relief against defendants Opulentica, LLC (Opulentica), Zarrar Sheikh (Sheikh) and relief defendant Saima Shahzadi (Shahzadi).  The defendants and relief defendant filed no opposition to the SECs  motion and ultimately consented to the relief.  The court also granted the SECs motion for a partial final consent permanent injunction and other relief against defendant Nasser A. Dawoud., The January 9, 2004 order continues in place various forms of interim relief initially ordered by the court on December 23, 2003, when the court granted the Commissions motion for a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the defendants and relief defendant, prohibiting the destruction of documents, granting expedited discovery and other relief to halt the fraud perpetrated by the defendants.  , Among other things, the January 9, 2004 order preliminarily enjoins Opulentica and Sheikh from committing future violations of the registration provisions, Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933, and of the antifraud provisions, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In addition, the January 9, 2004 order:  (a) continues the freeze over the assets of the defendants and relief defendant; (b) directs the defendants and relief defendant to repatriate funds transferred to offshore accounts; (c) prohibits the destruction of documents; (e) imposes a limited stay of discovery and stays the time the defendants and relief defendant to respond to the Commissions complaint pending resolution of the criminal investigation; and (f) prohibits the defendants and relief defendant from all contact with investors.  The order, however, allows the Commission to take third-party discovery during the pendency of the stay., The SECs complaint filed on December 23, 2003, alleges that, between March 2002 and the present, Opulentica, Sheikh and Nasser A. Dawoud (Dawoud) fraudulently raised over $500,000 by making material misrepresentations to actual and prospective investors concerning monthly and annual returns on investments, investments risks, and the existence of insurance to protect against investment losses., The SECs complaint named the following defendants and relief defendants: , <b>Opulentica</b>, a New York limited liability corporation that was formed on or about May 21, 2002, and whose purported office was located at 44 WallStreet, New York, New York.  Opulentica has operated a website, though which it offered to investors and potential investors a purported guaranteed return of 6% (which it claimed would yield an annual return of 72%) on short-term investments., <b>Sheikh</b>, age 33, was the registered agent of Opulentica and was identified as the contact person in Opulenticas advertisements in the Weekly Pakistan News and the Pakistan Post and as media relations contact in offering materials., <b>Dawoud</b>, age 31, resides in Brooklyn, New York.  In a bank account opening Statement, Dawoud held himself out to be the president of Opulentica., Relief Defendant, <b>Saima Shahzadi</b>, is Sheikhs wife and received at least $56,200 in investor funds from Opulenticas bank accounts., Further, the SECs complaint alleges that:, As of December 9, 2003, the defendants raised approximately $538,000 from about twenty (20) investors in Opulentica.  The defendants solicited investors to open accounts with Opulentica for periods of 3, 6, 9, and 12 months., Opulentica promised investors returns of 6% monthly or, as described in the offering, 72% returns annually.  Opulenticas website boasted that offered investors the maximum gain with the minimum of risk exposure and extensive insurance coverage over all of its accounts.  In its offering materials, Opulentica listed fifteen individuals, including Sheikh, who it claimed constituted a staff of dedicated, professional, and licensed financial analysts., In truth, Opulentica was an ongoing fraud.  Opulentica never generated profits of 6% per month.  In fact, of the $538,000 raised, the defendants actually invested only $289,000 in reckless day trading through which the defendants lost over $117,000., Opulenticas trading accounts were not protected by insurance and investments in Opulenticas were not risk-free.  The defendants also failed to disclose that they had diverted $249,000 of investor funds for their personal use and that of Shahzadi., The litigation is pending., See also <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18526.htm>Litigation Release No. 18526</a> (December 29, 2003). , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18539.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Wolf of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts entered a final judgment by consent against Kevin J. Morrison, age 54, of West Hartford, Connecticut.  Morrison was the executive vice-president of American Commercial Financial Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Boston-based HPSC, Inc.  Without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, Morrison consented to the entry of a final judgment that bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company and permanently enjoins him from future violations of Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 promulgated thereunder., In its Complaint, the Commission alleged that from at least 1997 through May 2002, Morrison improperly diverted nearly $5 million of corporate assets to relief defendant Mildred K. Miller, a purported ACFC customer.  According to the Complaint, Morrison covered up his embezzlement by regularly providing falsified financial reports to ACFCs president, HPSC, and HPSCs outside auditors.  Information contained in those reports was incorporated in HPSCs financial statements for the periods ended December 31, 1997 through March 31, 2002, causing those financial statements to contain material misstatements.  On August 14, 2002, after becoming aware of Morrisons conduct, HPSC filed amended Forms 10-K for the years ended December 31, 2000 and December 31, 2001, which restated the companys net income and earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 1997 through December 31, 2001 and for the quarters ended March 31, 2000 through December 31, 2001.  The company also filed amended Forms 10-Q for the quarters ended September 30, 2001 and March 31, 2002.  The restatements reflect that Morrisons fraud resulted in an overstatement of HPSCs net income and earnings per share of between 4% and 112% during these periods., Previously in this same litigation, the Commission obtained a default judgment against Miller on December 22, 2002.  That default judgment against Miller was vacated by the court.  On February 13, 2003, the court re-entered a Final Judgment by Default against Miller.  The court ordered Miller to pay disgorgement of $4,782,381.26, plus prejudgment interest thereon of $189,813.63., On November 21, 2002, in related criminal proceedings filed by the United States Attorney for the District of Connecticut, Morrison pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1343.  On March 31, 2003, Morrison was sentenced to serve 16 months in prison and ordered to pay restitution of nearly $5 million by Judge Janet C. Hall of the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut.  On March 7, 2003, Miller pleaded guilty before Judge Hall to one count of wire fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1343.  On November 6, 2003, Miller was sentenced to 60 months imprisonment and ordered to pay restitution of nearly $5 million., For more information, see Litigation Release Nos. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18463.htm>18463</a> (November 17, 2003), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17686.htm>17686</a> (August 16, 2002) and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17921.htm>17921</a> (January 8, 2003)., <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18540.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Also on October 16, 2003, the Commission issued an order finding that Connelly had violated the federal securities laws by permitting select investors to time Alger mutual funds in exchange for maintaining at least 20% of their Alger investment in buy-and-hold positions, sometimes referred to as sticky assets.  The Commission directed Connelly to cease and desist from future violations of various provisions of the federal securities laws; barred him from association with any broker, dealer or investment adviser; barred him from serving in various capacities with respect to any registered investment company; and imposed a $400,000 civil penalty.  Connelly consented to the Commission order without admitting or denying the findings., The criminal charges against Connelly stemmed from his repeated efforts to tamper with an ongoing investigation by the New York Attorney General and the Commission of illegal trading practices in the mutual funds industry, including by directing subordinates to delete emails called for by subpoenas.  Connelly had admitted his conduct under oath before the Hon. James Yates of the Supreme Court of New York State in Manhattan.

Tx.) </h2>, <h2>Fastow To Disgorge More Than $23 Million; Agrees To Cooperate In Ongoing Investigation</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) today settled civil fraud charges filed against Andrew S. Fastow, Enrons former Chief Financial Officer.  The complaint, filed on October 2, 2002 in U.S. District Court in Houston, alleged that Fastow defrauded Enrons shareholders and enriched himself and others by, among other things, entering into undisclosed side deals, manufacturing earnings for Enron through sham transactions, and inflating the value of Enrons investments.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, Fastow has agreed to be enjoined permanently from violating the antifraud, periodic reporting, books and records, and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws, and to be barred permanently from acting as an officer or director of a public company.  The Commission settled its action in coordination with the Justice Departments Enron Task Force, which entered into a guilty plea with Fastow on related criminal charges.  In resolving the parallel civil and criminal proceedings, Fastow has agreed to serve a ten-year sentence, disgorge more than $23 million and to cooperate with the governments continuing investigation. , As alleged in the Commissions complaint, Fastow participated in a series of fraudulent transactions.  Three of the transactions - RADR, Chewco, and Southampton - were part of an alleged scheme to hide Fastows interest in and control of certain entities in order to avoid consolidating those entities in Enrons financial statements. This was done, according to the complaint, for self-enrichment and to mislead analysts, rating agencies, and others about Enrons true financial condition.  , Two of the transactions - the Nigerian barges and Cuiaba - are alleged to have been sham sales best described as secret asset-parking arrangements. The Nigerian barges involve Enrons purported sale of an interest in certain Nigerian barges to Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., Inc. (Merrill).  Fastow is alleged to have personally promised that Merrill would be taken out of its so-called investment and later arranged for an entity he controlled, LJM2 Co-Investment, L.P. (LJM2), to buy the financial institutions interest at a pre-arranged rate of return on a pre-arranged time table. In Cuiaba, Enron entered into a transaction with another off-balance-sheet entity controlled by Fastow, LJM Cayman, L.P. (LJM1), to sell an interest in a severely troubled power plant in Cuiaba, Brazil, in order to avoid consolidation of project debt and recognize earnings. In connection with this transaction, Fastow allegedly entered into an unwritten side agreement with Enron requiring Enron to buy back the interest it just sold to Fastow at a guaranteed profit. , In the last transaction, Enron and LJM2 created a complex financial structure - Raptor I - that allowed Enron to hedge against potential declines in certain of its mark-to-market investments.  LJM2s $30 million investment - representing the purported 3% outside equity required to be at risk in order for Enron to avoid consolidating the Raptor vehicle in its financial statements - however was not at risk.  Fastow allegedly entered into an undisclosed side deal in which Enron agreed that, prior to conducting any hedging activity with Raptor I, Enron would return LJM2s investment ($30 million) plus a guaranteed return ($11 million). As a result, Raptor I should have been consolidated on Enrons financial statements.  To conceal the side deal, Fastow and others allegedly devised a scheme to manufacture the $41 million payment to LJM2.  Enron and the Raptor vehicle entered into a put, a transaction in which Enron essentially bet that its own stock price would decline.  Enron purchased that put option from the Raptor vehicle for $41 million.  The $41 million was then transferred from Raptor I to LJM2.  The complaint alleged that there was no true business purpose for the put other than to generate funds to pay LJM2 under the undisclosed side deal.  The complaint also alleged that in September 2000, Fastow and others used Raptor I to effectuate a fraudulent hedging transaction and thus avoid a decrease in the value of Enrons investment in the stock of a public company called Avici Systems Inc. Specifically, Fastow and others back-dated documents to make it appear that Enron locked in the value of its investment in Avici in early August 2000, when Avicis stock was trading at its all time high price., The Commissions investigation relating to Enron is continuing. , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18543.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The defendants falsely stated to investors that their principal would be guaranteed and that funds would be pooled to purchase letters of credit traded by top-rated banks with returns as high as 20% per month.  In fact, according to the Commissions complaint, there are no such trading programs and defendants representations to investors were completely false.  In addition, instead of investing the funds he obtained, Calvin used investor money to pay commissions to four defendant salespersons, including Adams and Timson.  Calvin also used investor money to make luxury purchases for himself and his daughter, including a house, car, motorcycle, hot tub and furniture, and to pay for his daughters tuition at cosmetology school., The defendants failed to appear and respond to the Commissions allegations against them resulting in entry of the default judgments.

The Commission further announced that, simultaneously with the filing of the Complaint, Corrpro consented to the entry of an injunction from future violations of these provisions.  Corrpros offer of settlement will be submitted to the Court for its approval., According to the complaint, Corrpro misstated its financial statements during 2001 and the first three quarters of 2002, due to fraud in Corrpros Australian subsidiary, which took place during approximately October 2000 through February 2002.

Finally, the complaint alleges that following its discovery of the fraud in its Australian subsidiary, Corrpro undertook remedial measures to strengthen its financial reporting policies and internal control structure.  , The complaint alleges that, as a result of the foregoing, Corrpro violated Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder, by filing financial statements that contained false financial data.

The undertakings require Corrpro to (i) continue to maintain the remedial measures it has adopted since Spring 2002 (after discovering the Australian fraud) in order to comply with the provisions of the federal securities laws alleged in the complaint; (ii) for at least its fiscal years ending March 2004, 2005 and 2006, continue to engage an outside firm with appropriate qualifications and expertise to perform the internal audit function, or should Corrpro decide to staff the internal audit function with its own employees, assist a designated employee director of internal audit in performing certain internal audit procedures, and to require the internal audit function to report directly to the Audit Committee; (iii) to require internal audit to prepare a confidential business report at the close of each of the above fiscal years, to the Audit Committee, and copied to the staff of the Commission and to Corrpros independent auditors, which shall include (a) a description of the scope of the Audit Plan during the preceding year, (b) confirmation that the Audit Plan was carried out, (c) an overview of the significant control weaknesses identified which require improvement, and (d) a review of the steps taken to improve the system of internal controls; and (iv) for at least the fiscal years mentioned above, to maintain a hotline managed by an outside vendor pursuant to which employees, customers and vendors may report to the Audit Committee anonymously, without fear of retaliation, any suspicions of fraudulent or criminal activity, apparent weakness in control systems, misstatements or exaggerations of financial results, incorrect application of accounting policies, and any other activity that could lead to inaccuracies or distortions of Corrpros financial results., In determining to accept Corrpros settlement offer, the Commission considered that Corrpro undertook remedial actions and substantial cooperation with Commission staff., In 1998, Corrpro was previously sanctioned by the Commission for unrelated reporting and internal control violations., The Commission has also brought separate charges against the two officers of Corrpros Australian subsidiary in connection with this matter (Securities and Exchange Commission v. Waring and Treloar, Case No. 1:03-cv-2030, N. D. Ohio), which are still pending.  See Litigation Release Number 18382, and Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release Number 1883, both dated October 1, 2003.  The Commissions complaint in that action seeks injunctive relief against Waring and Treloar as well as the imposition of an officer and director bar., The Australian Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecution in Melbourne in the State of Victoria, Australia, has issued summons to Waring and Treloar for criminal violations of various sections of the Australian Corporations Act, and of the Crimes Act of the State of Victoria, in connection with the same conduct described in the Commissions complaint. , CONTACT: Cynthia Storer Baran <br/>(312) 886-1456,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18547.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Marks, of Wayland, Massachusetts, to a year and a day in prison in connection with insider trading charges brought by the U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts.  On October 3, 2003, Marks, formerly the highest-ranking attorney at Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Cambridge-based biotechnology company, pled guilty to a one-count information filed by the U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts charging him with unlawful insider trading in connection with his September 2001 sale of Vertex stock.  The criminal information alleged that, on September 20, 2001, Marks learned that Vertex planned to announce the suspension of clinical trials of one of its promising drugs on September 24.  According to the information, on September 21, Marks liquidated all of his Vertex stock despite having previously acknowledged in writing that the impending release would not be viewed favorably by Wall Street and that he should not sell his Vertex shares. , According to the criminal information, at the time he traded, Marks was the designated attorney for employees to contact regarding compliance with Vertexs employee securities trading policy.  In that capacity, the information alleged, Marks wrote Vertexs CEO an email on September 20, advising him to make sure that an employee who had requested permission to trade had no knowledge of the impending press release.  According to the information, Marks email went on to say:  , <p class=quote>. . .  I guess I am troubled about any employee trading prior to that release because it is likely to have an effect on the stock (looks like I cant sell any shares) and, depending on the degree of that effect, could create the perception of insider trading. . .   . , The criminal information alleged that, on September 21, less than 24 hours after writing this email to the CEO, Marks sold 20,900 shares of Vertex at an average price of $22.81 per share, receiving $476,765.  According to the information, Marks traded in breach of a fiduciary duty not to trade in Vertexs stock while in possession of material, nonpublic information regarding Vertex. As a result of the conduct described in the information, the U.S. Attorney charged Marks with criminal violations of the antifraud provisions of federal securities laws, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Marks was also sentenced to two years of supervised release following his incarceration, and to pay a $3,000 fine., On December 3, 2002, the Commission filed a complaint against Marks in connection with the same conduct in Massachusetts federal court.  The Commissions complaint alleged that Marks violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.  In that action, which is still pending, the Commission seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties, and further seeks an order barring Marks from acting as an officer or director of any publicly-traded company.

Under the settlements, Emamy will disgorge $2.1 million in cash and transfer a residence to a court-appointed liquidation agent.  Frank Gruttadauria and Emamy had purchased the residence in early 2001 for about $1.5 million.  Margo Gruttadauria will disgorge $400,000 in cash.  The total amount to be recovered under these settlements is about $4 million., In February 2002, the Commission sued Frank Gruttadauria in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio for perpetrating a massive fraud over a fifteen-year period against scores of his customers.  Gruttadauria misappropriated over $115 million during that period and sent falsified account statements that overstated the actual holdings in customer accounts by over $280 million.  The Commission also sued Emamy, seeking to recover assets that it alleged Frank Gruttadauria had given her and were the direct or indirect proceeds of his illegal conduct.  In June 2002, the Commission amended its complaint to sue Margo Gruttadauria, seeking to recover assets that it alleged Frank Gruttadauria had given her.  The Commission did not allege that either Emamy or Margo Gruttadauria had known of, or participated in, Frank Gruttadaurias fraud.  , On February 26, 2002, Judge Gaughan granted the Commissions motion for a temporary restraining order against Frank Gruttadauria and froze his assets.

During at least CAs fiscal year 2000, which ran from April 1, 1999 through March 31, 2000 (FY2000), CA prematurely recognized revenue from software contracts that had not yet been consummated, in violation of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).

Presto, which purports to be an international telecommunications company positioned to become Latin Americas Premier Integrated Communications Provider, has raised over $11 million from the sale of stock to date.  Also today, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California granted the relief that the Commission sought, ordering the freezing of Prestos and Vassallos assets, the appointment of a temporary receiver over Presto, and other relief., The Commissions complaint, filed in federal court in San Diego, alleges that the defendants induced more than 800 investors in 42 states to invest in Presto with promises that the company has significant business relationships with AT&amp;T, Sprint, MCI, and Qwest.  These four telecommunications companies have purportedly expressed interest in acquiring Presto or in making capital investments in the company.  Further, investors are advised that Presto is a partner to and has alliances with Cisco Systems and Unisys.  Finally, investors are told that the U.S. Commerce Department was lobbying Mexican telecommunications regulators on Prestos behalf, and that their funds will be used to build and operate a telecommunications network in Mexico., According to the complaint, these representations are false.  Additionally, the complaint alleges that while Vassallo and others have represented that investor funds would be used to pay Prestos business expenses, primarily fiber optics and equipment, in fact only 16% of investor and company funds were used for equipment and fiber, and Vassallo himself has misappropriated at least $1.2 million in investor and company funds for personal expenses.  These expenses include jewelry, luxury automobiles, a down payment on an expensive home, mortgage payments, home improvements, political and charitable contributions, and school tuition for his children., The complaint further alleges that Presto has failed to disclose to prospective investors that the license its affiliated entity received from the Mexican government in 1998 to operate a commercial telecommunications network in Mexico was, in fact, the subject of revocation proceedings that commenced in 2001.  Only recently has Presto informed investors that revocation proceedings had begun., In its lawsuit, the Commission obtained an order freezing the assets of Presto and Vassallo, an accounting, an order preventing destruction of documents, an order appointing a temporary receiver over Presto and temporarily enjoining Presto and Vassallo from future violations of the registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Humphreys was also enjoined from violating books and records provisions, Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder.  Further, both defendants were enjoined from violating the lying to auditors provision, Exchange Act Rule 13b2-2, and both were permanently barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  The judgment orders Winger to pay approximately $440,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest and civil penalties, and orders Humphreys to pay more than $150,000.  The judgment was entered upon default., The Commissions Complaint, which was filed on December 12, 2002, alleged that from at least November 1998 through March 2000, Safety-Kleens senior executives engaged in a massive accounting fraud by materially overstating the companys revenue and earnings in periodic reports filed with the Commission and in press releases issued by the company.  They carried out the scheme primarily by making inappropriate quarterly accounting adjustments for the purpose of meeting Wall Street pro forma earnings expectations.  The executives also fraudulently recorded approximately $38 million of cash that was generated by entering into speculative derivatives transactions, further distorting the companys true financial picture.  , The complaint alleged that Humphreys orchestrated the fraudulent scheme.  As set forth in the complaint, he engaged in the illegal conduct to create the illusion that predicted cost savings and business synergies from two large acquisitions were being achieved.  In fact, the expected savings had not materialized, the companys business was declining rapidly, and the company was facing a severe cash flow problem.  To make up for the earnings shortfall, Humphreys recorded, or directed others to record, numerous adjustments that were not in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.  According to the complaint, Winger signed Safety-Kleens periodic reports and knew or was reckless in not knowing that the financial statements contained in those reports were materially false and misleading.  Finally, the complaint alleged that Humphreys and Winger knew or were reckless in not knowing that the companys quarterly earnings press releases were materially false and misleading., The entry of the final judgment against Winger and Humphreys concludes the litigation brought by the Commission arising out of the financial fraud at Safety-Kleen.

In exchange, the two former employees directed securities trades on behalf of New York Life to Pinto, sometimes at prices favorable to Nomura and disadvantageous to New York Life.  Pinto consented to the final judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint.  The judgment permanently restrains and enjoins Pinto from violating antifraud provisions of the federal securities, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The judgment orders Pinto to pay $1,800,000 in disgorgement, which is deemed satisfied by his earlier payment of that amount to New York Life in a private settlement.  The judgment also orders Pinto to pay a $500,000 civil penalty., Today, the Commission also instituted and settled administrative proceedings against Pinto.  Pinto consented to an order, based on the entry of final judgment against him in the Commissions civil enforcement action and on his prior criminal conviction, that bars him from association with any broker-dealer., Pinto had pleaded guilty to criminal charges of securities fraud arising from the same scheme.  In November 2002, the criminal court sentenced him to serve twenty-one months in prison.  The criminal court did not order restitution in view of Pintos $1,800,000 settlement payment to New York Life.  , With this settlement, the Commissions has concluded this action against three of the five original defendants.  The two former New York Life employees who had received kickbacks and gratuities settled the Commissions claims against them in November 2003.  Both also pleaded guilty to criminal securities fraud charges and are serving their sentences.  The Commission also charged that two other registered representatives, at different broker-dealers, gave kickbacks or gratuities to one or both of the former New York Life employees in exchange of a flow of New York Life securities trades and favorable prices.  The Commissions civil action against those two registered representatives continues.  One has pleaded guilty to criminal charges and is serving her sentence.  The other was not criminally charged. , [Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr16937.htm>16937</a>, March 22, 2001; Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18478.htm>18478</a> / November 24, 2003], <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18556.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

According to the SECs Complaint, the affinity fraud targeted African Americans and Christians, and has been ongoing since at least 2000.  Also on January 27, 2004, Judge G. Kendall Sharp, U.S. District Judge for the Middle District of Florida, issued various emergency orders against the defendants, including temporary restraining orders, asset freezes, and other emergency relief., The SECs Complaint alleges that Ware Enterprises and Ware falsely guarantee investors 10% monthly interest payments on their investments for the first ten months followed by a 5% perpetual monthly return.  According to the SECs Complaint, Ware entices potential investors portraying the Company as a private clientele group investment firm whose Dreamkeeper Program is engineered for the not so wealthy to have a chance to make the same type of percentages on their money that the wealthy have been enjoying for centuries.  The defendants also falsely represent that Ware Enterprises has over $100 million in assets, when, according to the SECs Complaint, its bank account records actually reflect balance of only $2 million., The SECs complaint also alleges that, although Ware Enterprises and Ware claim to generate returns for investors by making investments in, among other things, commercial and residential real estate, small businesses, and the markets of the world, in reality, the defendants conducted a typical Ponzi scheme by using new investors investments to make interest payments to existing investors. , The SECs complaint charges Ware Enterprises and Ware with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Ware with violating Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

Eskind, Lorus and Capital consented to the entries of the judgment without admitting or denying any of the allegations of the Commissions Complaint.  Further, the court ordered joint and several disgorgement and prejudgment interest against defendants in the respective amounts of $3,661,786 and $808,403.  The court ordered each defendant to pay a civil penalty of $120,000. Defendants were also ordered to transfer to the court appointed special master $94,584.64 currently held in brokerage accounts frozen by previous court order.   Eskind was also ordered to comply with a prior order of the Commission barring him from association with an investment adviser.   , The Commissions Complaint, filed on September 3, 2002, alleged that Eskind was a recidivist violator who was preliminarily enjoined in June 1997 and permanently enjoined on January 12, 1998 from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. Eskind was subsequently barred by the Commission from association with any investment adviser. That case was based upon allegations of fraudulent conduct by Eskind which included misappropriating investors funds, failing to disclose that Eskind had been suspended by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in 1991, and inducing at least five investors to invest at least $500,000 in what was falsely represented to the investors to be a specified limited partnership.   The Complaint further alleged that subsequent to being enjoined, and continuing until the filing of the Complaint, Eskind raised at least $3 million through sales of limited partnership units in Capital.  Capital purportedly does business by trading in securities through initial or secondary public offerings. The sales materials misrepresented to investors Eskinds broker-dealer experience, and did not disclose his 1991 NYSE suspension, the Commissions 1997 civil action or the Commissions 2000 order barring him from association with an investment adviser. The Complaint alleged that investors were told that IRA accounts had been opened for them at a trust company which serves as an IRA custodian and that investors had received statements from Lorus indicating their funds in those accounts. In fact, no such accounts were opened. The sales materials falsely stated that a major law firm provided legal representation for Lorus.  Finally, the Complaint alleged that Lorus is an investment adviser and Eskinds continuing association with Lorus was a violation of the Commissions 2000 order., See also:   <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr15395.txt>L.

Lemcke, individually and d/b/a Lemcke &amp; Associates, Civil Action No.01-CV-547(D.R.I.) has completed the distribution of assets to the victims of former investment adviser Alfred M. Lemcke.  By orders dated November 19, 2003 and January 6, 2004, the Court ordered the distribution of $252,104, representing the proceeds from the sale of Lemckes home and a bank account that was frozen by the court shortly after the Commission filed its compliant.  The monies represented substantially all of Lemckes assets., On November 16, 2001, the Commission filed a complaint against Lemcke in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island.  The Commission obtained a temporary restraining order and asset freeze against Lemcke.  The court subsequently entered a preliminary injunction against Lemcke and continued the asset freeze.  The complaint alleged that from at least December 1995 through September 2001, Lemcke defrauded at least nine of his investment advisory clients of approximately $1 million by obtained funds with false promises of investing the funds in various securities.  On April 15, 2002, the court entered an order modifying the asset freeze to allow the sale of the Lemcke home, which was jointly owned by Lemcke and his former wife Rosemary Grogan-Lemcke (Grogan-Lemcke), on the condition that the proceeds from the sale be deposited with the registry of court.  On September 4, 2002, the court ordered Grogan-Lemcke to pay into the registry of court the proceeds from the sale of a house.  On October 30, 2002, the court permanently enjoined Lemcke and ordered him to pay $2,600 and his interest in the proceeds from the sale of the Lemcke home., On September 24, 2002, Lemcke pled guilty to one count of fraud in violation of the Advisers Act and nine counts of wire fraud before the United District Court for the District of Massachusetts, in  United States v.

Wenger, formerly of Bethesda, Maryland, to serve 46 months in federal prison and ordered him to pay $1,000,000 immediately as a fine for his conduct related to promoting the stock of PanWorld Minerals International Inc. on his radio show and in newsletters.  , Previously on August 26, 2003, a federal jury convicted Wenger on criminal charges for failing to disclose in 1994 that he had been paid 2.1 million shares of PanWorld stock (PWLM) by the Utah company to recommend on his nationally-syndicated radio shows and newsletters titled The Next SuperStock that investors buy PanWorlds stock.  The jury also found that Wenger failed to disclose that he was recommending investors should buy at the same time he was selling PanWorld stock that he owned.  Wenger was convicted of two counts of violating Section 17(b) of the Securities Act of 1933, the provision that requires persons publishing information about stocks to disclose if they have received compensation from a public company to make the recommendation and the amount of compensation, and one count of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, which prohibit persons from making false statements or omitting material facts in connection with the sale of securities.  , During 1994 and continuing into 1997, Wenger, who was based in Bethesda, Maryland, recommended penny stocks and other low-price securities on his radio shows that were broadcast weekly in Washington D.C., New York, Miami, Phoenix, Chicago, Seattle and other locations.  He also published bi-monthly newsletters to investors recommending his stock picks.  Although he often disclosed he was a paid consultant, Wenger failed to disclose, in both the radio shows and the newsletters that discussed PanWorld, the amount of compensation that he had received to include the company in his recommendations.  During 1994, Wenger sold over $100,000 of PanWorld stock at the same time he was telling investors to purchase it without disclosing his sales.  PanWorld Minerals International, a now-defunct mining company, had offices located in Salt Lake City, Utah., The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil injunctive action against Wenger and other defendants in June 1997 in the United States District Court for Utah, and alleged that Wenger violated the securities registration, touting, and anti-fraud provisions of Sections 5(a) and (c), 17(a) and (b) of the Securities Act, and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5.

In addition, United States Senior District Judge Barefoot Sanders entered orders freezing assets of three defendants named solely for purposes of obtaining equitable relief (relief defendants) and otherwise conserving assets and documents for the benefit of investors.  , Named as defendants are:, The Commission also named in its Complaint as relief defendants, seeking return of investor funds unjustly received, the following entities and individuals: , The Commissions Complaint alleges that, using aggressive cold calling, an Internet website, television infomercials and paid radio spots, FAF claimed to provide investors access to foreign exchange markets at the special Interbank level supposedly accessible only to the most profitable and largest financial institutions in the world. The Complaint also alleges that FAF further claimed to have a Currency Management Team with a five-year track record of 100% returns, headed by a world-renowned institutional money manager who is a Top 10 certified and rated trader.  The Commission contends that all of these claims, and others FAF made, are false and that FAF is in fact merely a five-month-old boiler room outfit whose real business is taking money from investors, paying commissions to its principals and funneling the balance to Paisley and his companies.  The Commission alleges that, in fact, no investor funds went to Interbank level foreign currency trading.  The Complaint alleges that the defendants raised at least $243,000 from investors in at least seven states and two foreign countries., The Commissions Complaint charges FAF LLC, FA Inc., Keesee and Lautieri with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Prater and his Guilford, Connecticut-based company, Wellspring Capital Group, Inc., to show cause why they should not be held in contempt of court in connection with a case charging them with fraud.  The Commissions application for the order alleges that Prater and Wellspring have violated and continue to violate a court-ordered asset freeze, preliminary injunction, and temporary restraining order (TRO).  Specifically, the Commissions application sets forth facts suggesting that, beginning immediately upon their receipt of the asset freeze and TRO, Prater and Wellspring began systematically to transfer frozen assets through a variety of schemes including through the Ebay online auction system and through real estate transactions.  In addition, according to the application, Prater and Wellspring also violated the preliminary injunction by creating a new internet Ponzi scheme substantially similar to the scheme that was the subject of the Commissions complaint.  The Court has scheduled a hearing on this matter for February 6, 2004., Previously, on November 25, 2003, the court upheld the sufficiency of the Commissions allegations that Prater and Wellspring had operated an internet Ponzi scheme.  In upholding the Commissions complaint, the Honorable Mark Kravitz, United States District Judge for the District of Connecticut, noted that the defendants had fail[ed] to speak to the allegation at the heart of the SECs fraud charge and had provided no alternative to the SECs explanation of how Defendants would pay out [the] enormous returns [promised] - which is that early investors would be paid from the proceeds obtained from later investors, the very definition of a pyramid scheme.  The Court also denied the defendants motion to modify the preliminary injunction and asset freeze., The Courts November ruling establishes that the Commission had stated a cause of action for securities fraud against Prater and Wellspring.  The complaint alleges that the defendants operated a sophisticated Internet Ponzi scheme that raised millions of dollars from thousands of investors.  It further alleges that Praters scheme used a series of interrelated Internet web sites and a network of agents operating throughout the United States to guarantee prospective investors exorbitant returns through a variety of programs.  Under one set of programs, Prater, through Wellspring, promised that, in exchange for a small sum of money, it would pay investors returns as high as 1,000 percent per year in the form of payments for various living expenses of the investors, such as car loans, rent, or business expenses. , In a separate ruling on September 25, 2003, the Court had previously concluded that the Commission had introduced prima facie evidence showing that the allegations were true and had imposed a preliminary injunction against the defendants and had ordered the defendants assets frozen.  In its latest ruling, the Court noted that the defendants had failed to produce any documentary evidence to support modifying this preliminary injunction and asset freeze.  The Court also recited facts suggesting that the defendants had made misrepresentations to the Court in their motion to dismiss and noted that the defendants had produced no information refuting or denying that such misrepresentations had occurred.  , The Court established a schedule to bring the action to trial in late summer of 2004.

Kerr and the China Investment Group, Ltd., in a  prime bank case arising from the promotion of a fraudulent high-yield investment program to investors throughout the United States, as well as in Canada.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the antifraud, securities registration, and broker-dealer registration provisions of the federal securities laws.   The defendants disgorgement obligations were waived, and no civil penalties were imposed against them, based on their financial conditions, and in the case of Kerr, based also on recognition of his $10,757,775 restitution order in a parallel criminal case.  In related proceedings, the Commission issued an administrative order on February 6, 2004, to which Kerr consented, which bars Kerr from associating with any broker or dealer in the future., In its complaint in federal court, which it filed on December 19, 2002, the Commission alleged that Kerr and his company induced more than sixty investors throughout the United States, as well as in Canada, to invest over $12 million in his fraudulent investment program, which Kerr falsely promised would yield exorbitant returns within a matter of weeks or months.  The complaint further alleged that, in furtherance of this scheme, Kerr posed as a wealthy, politically connected businessman and made numerous false and materially misleading representations to his investor victims and to various intermediaries whom he knew would echo his false claims to other investor victims.  These false and materially misleading representations, according to the complaint, included claims (i) that Kerr had control of a $200 million trust; (ii) that Kerr could use the trust as leverage to trade in medium term bank notes (MTNs); (iii) that this MTN trading would yield profits of more than 13,000% of the amount invested; (iv) that Kerrs company, CIG, conducted the MTN trading; (v) that the World Bank supported Kerrs trading program; and (vi) that Kerrs investment program was safe and was backed by Kerrs personal guarantee.  Further, the complaint alleged that, instead of investing his victims funds as he had represented, Kerr misappropriated it, and failed to return either profits or principal to his investor victims. (See Securities and Exchange Commission v. William R. Kerr and China Investment Group, Ltd., Civil Case No. 02-9659 (C.D. Cal.); Lit. Rel. No. 17908/December 20, 2002.)  , The courts final judgments permanently enjoin both of the defendants from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5.  , The above-described final judgments and bar order conclude this litigation.  , In a related criminal matter brought by the United States Attorneys Office for the Central District of California, Kerr pleaded guilty to mail fraud and securities fraud charges stemming from the same fraudulent scheme that is the subject of the Commissions complaint, and is currently serving a 57-month prison sentence imposed on him in that case.  See United States v. William R. Kerr, No. CR 02-1281 (C.D. Cal.).

U.S. District Judge Joan Humphrey Lefkow set sentencing for June 4, 2004.  According to the indictment against him, Jung was previously the manager of a hedge fund known as the Strategic Income Fund, L.L.C., and also the controlling general partner of ETJ Partners, Ltd., a broker-dealer through which Jung traded stock options on the Chicago Board Options Exchange.  The indictment alleged that from July 1994 to September, 1998, Jung engaged in a fraudulent scheme in which he falsely represented to prospective investors and investors that their pledged securities and cash would be used solely to conduct stock options trading on behalf of the Strategic Income Fund.  Instead, Jung misappropriated the investors assets to collateralize his own securities trading, and other securities trading unrelated to the Strategic Income Fund.  Beginning no later than January 1995, Jung also misappropriated pledged securities and cash for other purposes, including paying the expenses of ETJ Partners.  In addition, the indictment alleged that Jung misrepresented his trading performance record to prospective investors by distributing written trading track records that inflated the success of his trading for the fund and failed to disclose the adverse financial impact of his misappropriations.  The indictment further alleged that Jung distributed false quarterly statements to investors to retain their investments and to lull them into a false sense of security.  The indictment alleged that Jungs scheme caused approximately 55 investors to lose more than $21 million.  , On June 19, 2001, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil complaint against Jung and ETJ Partners in connection with the scheme described above.  The Commissions complaint charged that Jung and his broker-dealer, ETJ Partners, violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, including Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  On March 14, 2002, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois entered a final judgment order against Jung and ETJ Partners, pursuant to their consent, which enjoined Jung and ETJ Partners from future violations of the above antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.

The complaint alleges that, during 2000 and 2001, Nichols engaged in a fraudulent course of conduct in which he made numerous improper accounting journal entries on the books of AFI Foodservice Distributor, Inc. (AFI), a subsidiary of PFG.  Nichols conduct caused PFG to overstate its income by a total of $3.8 million in the companys Forms 10-Q filed with the Commission for the second and third quarters of 2000, and for the first and third quarters of 2001., Nichols, an executive vice-president and one time controller of AFI, was responsible for AFIs accounting functions and financial statements.  During 2000 and 2001, he repeatedly failed to reconcile imbalances in various AFI accounts, and made improper accounting adjustments in an effort to make the accounts appear to balance.  Because AFIs accounts were consolidated with PFGs, Nichols actions caused PFG materially to overstate its reported net earnings.  Nichols never notified PFGs management or accounting personnel of the account imbalances or of his improper accounting adjustments., On March 11, 2002, PFG announced that it had identified accounting errors in the financial statements of a subsidiary.

Judeh used these accounts to buy and sell securities with himself, through another brokerage account he held in his own name.  Judeh structured the trades so that the account in his name consistently made money, while the accounts under false or stolen identities (the nominee accounts) incurred losses.  Because Judeh had opened the nominee accounts using forged checks, the losses were incurred by the brokerages, and not by the individuals whose identities were stolen. , Judehs offers to buy and sell securities through the nominee accounts were fraudulent because he never intended to pay for the trading losses he accumulated in the nominee accounts.

The Court ordered Sanfellipo to pay $352,007 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest and $120,000 in penalties; Gasper to pay $67,445 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest and $66,276 in penalties; and Vance to pay $4,071 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest and $13,000 in penalties.   , Previously, on November 14, 2002, the Commission filed an emergency action to halt the telemarketing scheme allegedly run by the defendants.  The Commissions complaint alleged that California AutoCare Corporation, an auto repair company, sought to raise $9 million through the sale of unregistered stock and that the defendants had raised more than $500,000 in a two-month period before the Commission sought to halt the scheme.  The Commission further alleged that Sanfellipo, of Laguna Beach, California, defrauded investors by representing that (1) California AutoCare had significant business relationships with Shell Oil Company, NAPA Auto Parts, Monroe, and Interstate Batteries, when in fact it did not; (2) there were 20 AutoCare America retail locations throughout California, when in fact there were only 5; and (3) California AutoCare and AutoCare Americorp were negotiating sponsorship deals with Starbucks and Krispy Kreme Doughnuts, when in fact they were not.  The Commission also alleged that Gasper, of Solana Beach, California, and Vance, of Layton, Utah, offered and sold California AutoCares stock without being registered as brokers., The Commission charged California AutoCare, AutoCare Americorp and Sanfellipo with violations of the securities registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, namely Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.  The Commission charged Gasper, Vance and Elihu M. Sigal with violations of the securities and broker-dealer registration provisions of the securities laws, namely Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act and Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act.  All of the defendants consented to permanent injunctions without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations.  Also, Sigal agreed to pay $22,584.48 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest and $6,500 in civil penalties and California AutoCare and AutoCare Americorp, which are under the control of a court-appointed Receiver, agreed to pay $2,127,516 in disgorgement.  If the Receivers recovery and liquidation of the companies assets fail to satisfy the full disgorgement and interest amounts, the unsatisfied amounts shall be waived.  If the Receiver collects more than the ordered disgorgement and interest however, California AutoCare and AutoCare Americorp shall be assessed civil penalties in amounts not to exceed $1,792,516 and $335,000, respectively., For further information see <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17844.htm>LR 17844</a> (November 15, 2002) and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17872.htm>LR 17872</a> (December 3, 2002)., <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18588.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Civil Action No. 04 CV 10367-GAO (District of Massachusetts)</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil fraud action today in federal court in Boston alleging that Columbia Management Advisors, Inc. and Columbia Funds Distributor Inc. allowed certain preferred mutual fund customers to engage in short-term and excessive trading, while at the same time representing publicly that it prohibited such trading.  Columbia Management Advisors, Inc. is a registered investment adviser that manages Columbia mutual funds; Columbia Funds Distributor is a registered broker-dealer that is the principal underwriter and entity responsible for selling the funds.  Both are subsidiaries of FleetBoston Financial Corporation., According to the Commissions complaint, from at least 1998 through 2003, Columbia Funds Distributor secretly entered into arrangements with at least nine companies and individuals allowing them to engage in frequent short-term trading in at least seven Columbia funds, including international funds and a fund aimed at young investors.  The Commissions complaint alleges that, in connection with certain of the arrangements, Columbia Distributor and Columbia Advisors accepted so-called sticky assets  long-term investments that were to remain in place in return for allowing the investors to actively trade in the funds.  According to the complaint, after entering into these arrangements, the nine companies and individuals engaged in frequent short-term or excessive trading in at least sixteen different Columbia mutual funds.  The Commissions complaint further alleges that executives of Columbia Funds Distributor entered into the arrangements, and that Columbia Management Advisors knew and approved of all but one of the arrangements and allowed them to continue despite knowing such short-term trading could be detrimental to long-term shareholders in the funds., According to the Commissions complaint, both defendants acted improperly in entering and accepting the short-term trading arrangements, because they were contrary to disclosures made in the prospectuses used to sell the mutual funds.  Specifically, six of the nine arrangements were  entered into or continued after Columbia adopted prospectus disclosure for the mutual funds expressly stating that the funds did not permit short-term or excessive trading.  The complaint further alleges that allowing the frequent traders investments increased the size of the funds and resulted in increased advisory fees to Columbia Management Advisors and increased Columbia Distributors revenues. , The Commissions complaint alleges that the defendants had a duty to act at all times in the best interests of the Columbia mutual funds and to provide full and fair disclosure of all material facts to investors.  According to the complaint, despite this duty, the defendants never disclosed to fund shareholders or to the independent trustees of the funds that particular investors were being allowed to make short-term trades in the funds, or that Columbia Management Advisors had a conflict of interest because the short-term trading arrangements served to increase its management fees., The specific charges against the defendants in the federal court action are that they violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933,  Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Section 17(d) and Rule 17d-1 of the Investment Company Act of 1940.  Additionally, the SECs complaint alleges that Columbia Management Advisors violated Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and that Columbia Funds Distributor aided and abetted those violations; that Columbia Management Advisors violated Section 34(b) of the Investment Company Act; and that Columbia Funds Distributor violated Section 15(c) of the Exchange Act.  The Commission is seeking injunctive relief, disgorgement, restitution of investor losses and civil penalties, and an order pursuant to Section 36(a) of the Investment Company Act enjoining Columbia Advisors from serving as an investment adviser to any registered investment company., Todays actions reflect the coordinated efforts of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York Attorney Generals Office, which today brought a related action against the same defendants., The Commissions investigation is continuing., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18590.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18590.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The defendants made materially false and misleading statements and omissions in connection with the offers and sales of the investment contracts including, among other things, false historical returns, and promised returns without a reasonable basis therefore. Also, the complaint alleged that the private placement memorandum utilized by the defendants inaccurately stated that Focus Mentors Elzein Management (Focus Mentors) was fully insured by Allstate Insurance Company, such that the assets of Focus Mentors were protected in the unlikely case that Focus Mentors or its executives were to declare bankruptcy and falsely stated that each clients principal investment was protected in the case of acts of dishonesty.  These statements were false because Focus Mentors did not have such insurance.  The complaint further alleged that Knee promoted Focus Mentors on his MoneyJoe.com website and in his related electronic newsletter called Insiders Club.

Both Flood and Strohm consented to the entry of final judgments without admitting or denying any of the allegations of the complaint., The Commissions complaint was filed on January 15, 2003 and alleged violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Sections 10(b), 13(a) and 13(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, and 13b2-1 thereunder. The complaint alleged that since the quarter and fiscal year ended June 30, 2001, ClearOne Communications, Inc.s management engaged in a program of inflating the companys revenues and net income by engaging in improper revenue recognition.  This course of conduct, covering two annual reporting periods and four separate quarterly reporting periods, was effected primarily through a program of channel stuffing conceived and directed by Frances M. Flood, then ClearOnes Chairman, CEO and President.  In addition, while this conduct was ongoing, ClearOne closed a $25.5 million private placement of common stock., The order against Flood prohibits violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and aiding and abetting violations of Section 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1, 13a-13, 13b2-1 and 12b-20 promulgated thereunder.

(RJH) </h2>]","[On February 25, 2004, the Commission filed a civil action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Moises Saba Masri (Saba), a Mexican national, and Albert Sutton, a broker at Middlegate Securities in New York City, New York.  The Commissions complaint alleges that on August 20, 1999, the defendants violated the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws by unlawfully marking the close and thereby manipulating the price of T.V. Azteca American Depository Receipts (TZA), which are listed on the New York Stock Exchange.  The complaint seeks permanent injunctions and civil penalties against both defendants, and disgorgement with pre-judgment interest from Saba., According to the Commissions complaint, in February, March, and May 1999, Saba used the brokerage account of Tentafin Limited, an offshore corporation controlled by Saba and his family, at Middlegate to sell a large number of TZA put options having strike prices of $5 and $7.50 and an expiration date of August 20, 1999.  These options, if exercised by their holders, contractually obligated Saba to buy nearly 860,000 shares of TZA at $5 per share, and nearly 500,000 shares of TZA at $7.50 per share, on the August 20, 1999 expiration date.  , The Commissions complaint alleges that on August 20, 1999, the price of TZA ranged from $4.9375 to $5.1875, ultimately hovering at $5 ten minutes prior to the close of trading.  According to the complaint, at that point, Saba could reasonably expect that the holders of the TZA put options with a $7.50 strike price would exercise their options, causing a $3.7 million liability in Sabas Tentafin account.  If the holders of the TZA put options with a $5 strike price also exercised their options, the complaint further alleges, Saba would likely incur a further liability of $4.3 million.  The complaint charges that, in order to avoid incurring this additional liability, Saba instructed Sutton, his broker at Middlegate Securities, to begin buying TZA in the open market during the last ten minutes of trading so as to cause the per share price to close above $5.  According to the complaint, Sutton then executed a series of precisely timed purchases with the purpose and effect of causing TZAs per share price to close above $5, thereby enabling Saba to avoid the $4.3 million additional liability on the $5 put options.  The complaint alleges that Suttons incremental purchases of 200,000 TZA during the last ten minutes of trading on August 20, 1999 constituted approximately 94% of the buy-side activity for that security during the last hour of the trading day.  The complaint further alleges that, by engaging in these manipulative trades, Saba and Sutton violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder., The Commission wishes to acknowledge the assistance of the Chicago Board Options Exchange in this matter., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18593.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>, <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18593.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Rather than maintain the confidentiality of the news and abstain from trading in Carreker stock, however, George Matus conveyed the confidential negative information to his brother and transferred $50,000 to him in order to trade in Carreker securities and profit from the non-public information.  Pursuant to their plan, Peter Matus then used his brothers funds to purchase 750 Carreker put options, effectively betting that the price of Carreker shares would decline once the negative news was made public.  Predictably, upon release of the negative news, the price of Carreker stock declined.

Silverman and Brenner both reside in Boca Raton, Florida.  The SEC alleges that from August 1999 through May 2002, Silverman and Brenner defrauded hundreds of investors out of approximately $33 million through the offer and sale of unregistered securities marketed as purported hedge funds.  The hedge funds, IDT Fund A. Ltd., IDT Fund B Ltd., IDT Fund C Ltd., The Millennium IDT Fund Ltd., and IDT Venture (collectively, IDT Funds) were later rolled into IDT Group, Inc. (IDT Group).  During the relevant time period, Silverman and/or Brenner were instrumental in operating, managing and supervising IDT Funds and IDT Group. , According to the SECs Complaint, Silverman and Brenner used deceptive offering materials and fictitious statements, among other things, to entice persons to invest in the hedge funds.

Harkless, 59, of Riverside; Daniel J. Berardi, Jr., 40, of Palm Springs; Thomas Hawkesworth, 49, of Rancho Mirage; and Randall W. Harding, 43, of Corona.  The defendants have raised at least $33.5 million to date from the sale of Mx Factors notes.  Also today, U.S. District Judge Virginia A. Phillips of the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California granted the relief that the Commission sought, issuing orders freezing assets, appointing a temporary receiver over Mx Factors, BBH Resources, and JTL Financial, and other relief., The Commissions complaint, filed this morning in federal court in Riverside, alleges that the defendants fraudulently induced at least 247 investors nationwide and in Mexico to invest in Mx Factors notes, which purportedly pay a guaranteed return of 12% in 60 or 90 days.  Mx Factors claims that it will use the investor funds to provide its clients - construction contractors, wholesalers, and manufacturers - with accounts receivable financing, secured by the clients assignment of its accounts receivable.  The defendants also represent that investor funds are safe because at least 70% of the receivables are backed or funded by the government., According to the complaint, these representations are false.  Mx Factors has actually been operating a Ponzi scheme, and at least $19.9 million in new investor funds has been used to pay existing investors.  At least $5.64 million has been misappropriated (1) to finance a crab fishing business, (2) to pay the personal expenses of Harkless, Berardi, and Hawkesworth, including mortgage payments and credit card bills, and (3) to fund overseas bank accounts.  Additionally, the complaint alleges that BBH, Berardi, and Hawkesworth have skimmed $1.3 million in investor funds by failing to turn them over to Mx Factors.  The complaint further alleges that BBH Resources and JTL Financial have each received undisclosed sales commissions of at least 12%., In its lawsuit, the Commission obtained an order freezing the assets of Mx Factors, BBH Resources, JTL Financial, Harkless, Berardi, and Hawkesworth, an accounting, an order preventing destruction of documents, an order appointing a temporary receiver over Mx Factors, BBH Resources, and JTL Financial, and temporarily enjoining all of the defendants from future violations of the securities registration and antifraud provisions -- and temporarily enjoining defendants BBH Resources, JTL Financial, Berardi, Hawkesworth, and Harding from future violations of the broker-dealer registration provisions -- of the federal securities laws, Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Commission also seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions, and other relief, including disgorgement and civil penalties against all defendants.

On February 27, 2004, Judge Steele, U.S. District Judge for the Middle District of Florida, issued various emergency orders against the defendants, including temporary restraining orders, asset freezes against KS Advisors, Condor II, and Damian Partners, the appointment of a receiver, and other emergency relief., The Commissions Complaint alleges that the representations made by KS Advisors, Boyle and Fine to the hedge funds investors about the ever-increasing profits and net asset values of Condor II and Damian Partners were completely false.  According to the Commissions Complaint, the investments made by Boyle and Fine on behalf of the hedge funds, which consist mostly of speculative options trading, have lost millions of dollars.

Buchwald issued a partial final judgment ordering defendant Franklin S. Marone to liquidate his assets and disgorge all money that Marone is alleged to have obtained fraudulently from dozens of investors through a phony equity fund scheme that Marone began in 1999.  Marone consented to the judgment after the Securities and Exchange Commission last week filed a complaint against him and obtained an emergency order from Judge Buchwald freezing Marones assets.  Marone neither admits nor denies the Commissions fraud allegations.  The judgment also enjoins Marone from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders Marone to pay a civil money penalty.  The full amount of Marones disgorgement and penalty are to be determined by the Court at a future date.  The Commissions complaint alleges that Marone defrauded investors out of more than $3.2 million.  In a February 9, 2004, written statement to law enforcement authorities, Marone admitted to defrauding investors out of at least $1.9 million.

The Commission does not charge Mrs. Marone with securities fraud, but alleges that both Mr. and Mrs. Marone used investor funds from the fraud for their personal use. , The SECs complaint, filed February 13, 2004, alleges that, between January 1999 and January 2004, Marone fraudulently obtained over $3.2 million from dozens of investors by inducing them to invest in several fictitious equity funds that Marone purported to manage.  According to the Commissions complaint, Marone falsely promised investors extraordinary returns at virtually no risk and sent investors falsified account statements reporting the current value of their investments.  In reality, the complaint alleges, Marone never invested his victims money.  Instead, he used investor funds to support a lavish lifestyle.

Sullivan, the former Chief Financial Officer of WorldCom, Inc.  The Commission charged Sullivan with engaging in a fraudulent scheme to conceal WorldCom’s poor financial performance.  The Commission alleged that Sullivan, with the consent and knowledge of WorldCom’s former Chief Executive Officer, caused numerous improper adjustments and entries in WorldCom’s books and records, often in the hundreds of millions of dollars, to make the Company’s quarterly and yearly financial results appear to meet Wall Street’s expectations.  In addition, the Commission alleged that Sullivan made numerous false and misleading public statements about WorldCom’s financial condition and performance, and signed a number of SEC filings that contained false and misleading material information.  , Also today, in connection with the same conduct, Sullivan pleaded guilty to criminal charges filed by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York.  In addition, that office announced today the related indictment of Bernard J. Ebbers, WorldCom’s former Chief Executive Officer. , The Commission’s complaint against Sullivan alleges that by September 2000, Sullivan and other senior WorldCom executives knew that WorldCom’s true operating performance and financial results were materially below the financial guidance they had given to Wall Street analysts and investors.  Rather than disclose WorldCom’s true financial condition and suffer the resulting decline in the company’s share price, from approximately September 2000 through June 2002, Sullivan engaged in a scheme that fraudulently concealed WorldCom’s true operational and financial results.  The scheme involved improperly manipulating WorldCom’s reported revenue, expenses, net income, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), and earnings per share.  , The complaint charges that as part of the scheme, Sullivan instructed subordinates to book certain fraudulent adjustments and entries in WorldCom’s general ledger.  The adjustments and entries were designed to falsely increase WorldCom’s reported revenue and falsely decrease WorldCom’s reported expenses.  The false adjustments and entries, among other things, improperly reduced expenses by drawing down certain reserves and improperly capitalizing certain operating expenses commonly referred to in the telecommunications industry as “line costs.”   The complaint also alleges that Sullivan misrepresented or failed to disclose material changes in WorldCom’s revenue recognition practices.  During the same period, Sullivan and others made materially false or misleading statements or omissions to WorldCom’s independent auditors in connection with audits and the preparation of filings with the Commission.  , Simultaneously with the filing of the complaint, Sullivan has agreed, without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, to the entry of an order permanently enjoining him from violating, directly or indirectly, numerous provisions of the federal securities laws, including the antifraud, reporting, books and records, internal controls, and lying-to-auditors provisions, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder.   Sullivan has also agreed to the entry of an order that would permanently bar him from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  The order further provides that any monetary relief will be decided by the Court at a hearing to be held upon motion of the Commission or the instance of the Court and that the Court will retain jurisdiction of the action for all purposes, including the imposition of additional equitable remedies or sanctions, if any, as determined following a hearing.  Sullivan has agreed that for the purpose of any such hearing, the allegations of the complaint shall be deemed true.  The settlement is subject to the review by and approval of the Court. , In addition, Sullivan has agreed to a Commission administrative order, based on the injunction, suspending him from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant, under Rule 102(e) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice.  Sullivan has been licensed in the State of New York as a certified public accountant since 1985, although his registration lapsed in 1989. , The Commission’s action against Sullivan is its fifth civil enforcement action related to the WorldCom fraud.  The first was filed against WorldCom, Inc. on June 27, 2002, the day after WorldCom announced that it intended to restate its financial results for five quarters—all quarters in 2001 and the first quarter of 2002. (<a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17588.htm>Litigation Release No. 17588</a>).  The Commission sought, among other things, the appointment of a corporate monitor for WorldCom, and on July 3, 2002, U.S. District Judge Jed S. Rakoff appointed former SEC Chairman Richard Breeden to that position.  Since then, WorldCom has admitted that beginning in 1999, as a result of undisclosed and improper accounting, it materially overstated the income it reported in its financial statements by at least $9 billion.  It also filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code., On Nov. 26, 2002, the Commission obtained a judgment against WorldCom that provided the full injunctive relief sought against the company.  In addition, the judgment ordered WorldCom to undertake extensive reviews of its corporate governance and internal controls, as well as required the company to establish a training and education program for WorldCom officers and employees to minimize the possibility of future violations of the federal securities laws (<a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17866.htm>Litigation Release No. 17866</a>)., Subsequently, the U.S. District Court ordered WorldCom to satisfy the SEC’s civil monetary penalty judgment by paying $500 million in cash and transferring $250 million worth of common stock in the reorganized company when it emerges from bankruptcy into a fund for later distribution to victims of the companys fraud, pursuant to Section 308 (Fair Funds for Investors) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

(DTI), engaged in separate fraudulent schemes at three of DTIs subsidiaries to artificially inflate DTIs financial position.  At the time of the conduct alleged in the Commissions Complaint, DTI was headquartered in Springfield, Missouri.  The Commission named in its Complaint Richard Rambahal, the controller of DTI subsidiary Kalish, Inc., Paul H. Kofton and Joseph J. Barry, the controller and cost accountant of DTI subsidiary Sencorp Systems, Inc. and Michael Lesniewski, the general manager and controller of DTI subsidiary Assembly Machines, Inc. (Defendants).  Specifically, the Commissions Complaint alleged that between 1996 and 2002, the Defendants knowingly or recklessly failed to properly recognize costs associated with various projects in order to reach their subsidiarys projected earnings targets set by DTI.  The Commissions Complaint also alleged that the Defendants attempted to conceal their schemes in various ways, including, hiding unrecorded production costs in various balance sheet accounts that DTI consolidated into its financial statements and by creating false supporting documentation.  According to the Commissions Complaint, the Defendants improper entries on their respective subsidiarys books and records resulted in an understatement of the cost of sales and thereby caused material overstatements of DTIs consolidated net income and material understatements of DTIs consolidated net losses in various quarterly and annual reports that DTI filed with the Commission between 1997 and 2002.  According to the Commissions Complaint, the overstatements of DTIs consolidated net income ranged from 1% to 532%.  The Complaint seeks a permanent injunction enjoining Rambahal, Kofton, J. Barry and Lesniewski from violating Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder and for aiding and abetting DTIs violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.  The Complaint further seeks orders of disgorgement, plus prejudgment interest, from Rambahal, Kofton and Lesniewski and the imposition of civil monetary penalties against Kofton and Lesniewski.  J. Barry, without admitting or denying the allegations of the Complaint, consented to the imposition of an order permanently enjoining him from the violations alleged in the Commissions Complaint.  Also, in a related action, the Commission on March 4, 2004 issued an order instituting cease-and-desist proceedings requiring DTI to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of certain reporting, record keeping, and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws., <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18608.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Safavi had acquired a short position in SINA stock days earlier, so that he would profit if the price declined.  In fact, within an hour of the storys publication, SINA stock dropped in price by more than 3 percent.  Without admitting or denying the allegations set forth in the Commissions complaint, Safavi consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the antifraud provisions of the securities laws and imposing a civil penalty of $25,000., The Commissions complaint alleges that on Friday, October 24, 2003, Safavi sold short 1,000 shares of SINA common stock at $42 per share.  As a short seller, Safavi borrowed the 1,000 SINA shares that he sold, and agreed to acquire an equal amount of SINA shares at a later date to pay back the lender.  Safavi stood to profit if the price of SINA common stock dropped below $42 per share.  On Monday, October 27, shares of SINA common stock traded at prices between $42.35 and $43.88.  On October 28, the market for SINA common stock opened at $45.60 per share, $3.60 per share higher than the price at which Safavi had sold short.  At 12:58 p.m. on October 28, Safavi, using a screen name, published a fake Reuters news story, which listed two actual Reuters news reporters as the authors, on the Yahoo! Finance message board specifically dedicated to the discussion of SINA.  The fake story, which Safavi created moments earlier, claimed among other things that Goldman Sachs had initiated coverage of SINA with a Market Underperform rating because of valuation.

These four telecommunications companies had purportedly expressed interest in acquiring Presto or in making capital investments in the company.  Further, investors were advised that Presto is a partner to and has alliances with Cisco Systems and Unisys.  Finally, investors were told that the U.S. Commerce Department was lobbying Mexican telecommunications regulators on Prestos behalf, and that their funds would be used to build and operate a telecommunications network in Mexico. , According to the complaint, these representations were false.  Additionally, the complaint alleges that while Vassallo and others have represented that investor funds would be used to pay Prestos business expenses, primarily fiber optics and equipment, in fact only 16% of investor and company funds were used for equipment and fiber, and Vassallo himself has misappropriated at least $1.2 million in investor and company funds for personal expenses.  These expenses included jewelry, luxury automobiles, a down payment on an expensive home, mortgage payments, home improvements, political and charitable contributions, and school tuition for his children., The complaint further alleges that Presto failed to disclose to prospective investors that the license its affiliated entity received from the Mexican government in 1998 to operate a commercial telecommunications network in Mexico was, in fact, the subject of revocation proceedings that commenced in 2001., The Courts orders of March 1, 2004 preliminarily enjoin Presto and Vassallo from future violations of the registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

No. 02-5490 (D.N.J.)(Brown, J.).</h2>]","[On March 8, 2004, following a two-week trial, a federal jury in Trenton, New Jersey found for the Commission on all counts in an accounting fraud, insider trading and false filing case against Ed Johnson, the former Chief Executive Officer, Chairman of the Board, and President of MERL Holdings Inc.com.  In its complaint, the Commission had alleged that Johnson inflated the assets and financial results of MERL in two registration statements filed by the company with the Commission and disseminated to the public.  The jury found that Johnson violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, in connection with a multi-faceted fraud designed to raise $25 million in the public securities markets., According to the complaint, Johnson, age 54, orchestrated the fraudulent scheme in four ways.  First, Johnson improperly consolidated Essex Industries, Inc. (Essex) in MERLs 1997 and 1998 financial statements, which accounted for all of the companys revenues recorded in the income statements for those years.  Essex also comprised virtually all of MERLs assets in 1997 and for 363 days in 1998.  The complaint alleged that MERLs consolidation of Essex was improper because, among other things, Johnson and MERL had been specifically enjoined by a Virginia state court from exerting any control over Essex.  On July 24, 1998, Johnson entered into a Settlement and Security Agreement with Essexs owner which continued the severe restrictions on MERLs ability to control Essex.  Because of the injunction and the Security Agreement, Johnsons consolidation of Essexs operating results in its financial statements violated Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)., Furthermore, in MERLs second registration statement, a Report on Form 10-SB filed with the Commission on May 31, 2000, Johnson represented that Essex was still a subsidiary and business segment of MERL when, in reality, MERL no longer owned Essex., Second, Johnson artificially inflated the value of assets that MERL had acquired from Hanold Bookstores, Inc. and Hanold Schoolwear, Inc. (Hanold), in exchange for shares of MERLs preferred stock (with a par value of $10.00 per share).  Among other things, Johnson valued a Hanold customer list at $1.6 million when he knew that his valuation was not substantiated by any documentary or evidentiary support.  The complaint alleged that Johnsons treatment of the customer list and other Hanold assets was improper and violated GAAP., Third, the complaint alleged that the textual portions of both registration statements materially mischaracterized the financial health of MERL.  An objective view of the company was that it was in dire financial straits because of severe liquidity problems, drastically declining sales, disappearing customers and numerous legal problems.  For example, one of MERLs subsidiaries, MERL School Stores, Inc., had closed all of its stores and laid off all of its employees one month prior to the filing of the Form 10-SB.  Yet the Form 10-SB represented that MERL intended to hire additional employees to accommodate an alleged growth in MERL School Stores business., The complaint alleged that Johnson had a clear understanding of MERLs bleak financial position and future prospects but, in the textual portions of the registration statements, improperly painted a falsely prosperous and optimistic picture of the company and did not disclose the liquidity problems, negative sales trends, and adverse developments that had battered the company., Fourth, the complaint alleged that Johnson committed a fraudulent act in the Form 10-SB by representing that MERL did not believe that any of its officers or directors had been involved in any legal proceedings material to an evaluation of their ability or integrity when, in fact, Johnson himself had been criminally convicted in 1990 for willful misapplication of funds when he had been the CEO of Magnolia Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association in Knoxville, Tennessee., Finally, the complaint alleged that Johnson benefited from his fraudulent scheme by avoiding losses or becoming unjustly enriched by selling MERL stock and using material nonpublic information concerning MERLs accounting irregularities and true financial condition., Although he resigned as Chief Executive Officer, Chairman of the Board and President of MERL shortly after this civil enforcement action commenced, Johnson continues with the company as a consultant and an advisor to the board of directors.  His wife, G. Carol Johnson, is the acting President of MERL., The Court will hold further proceedings concerning remedies.  The Commission seeks to enjoin Johnson permanently from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and seeks civil monetary penalties against Johnson.  The Commission further seeks to bar Johnson permanently from serving as an officer or director of any public company and also seeks under section 603 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 to bar him permanently from any future participation in the offering of any penny stock.  Finally, the Commission seeks disgorgement, prejudgment interest and penalties from Johnson for his insider trading., <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18618.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Cal.)</h2>]","[On March 8, 2004, the Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) obtained a preliminary injunction in a multi-million dollars securities fraud scheme perpetrated by seven Southern California defendants:  Mx Factors, LLC of Riverside; BBH Resources, LLC of Palm Springs; JTL Financial Group, LLC of Corona; Richard M. Harkless, 59, of Riverside; Daniel J. Berardi, Jr., 40, of Palm Springs; Thomas Hawkesworth, 49, of Rancho Mirage; and Randall W. Harding, 43, of Corona.  The defendants have raised at least $33.5 million to date from the sale of Mx Factors notes.  Also today, U.S. District Judge Virginia A. Phillips of the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California granted additional relief that the Commission sought, including issuing orders freezing assets, appointing a permanent receiver over Mx Factors, BBH Resources, and JTL Financial, and requiring Mx Factors and Harkless to repatriate assets from abroad., The Commissions complaint, filed on February 26, 2004 in federal court in Riverside, alleges that the defendants fraudulently induced at least 247 investors nationwide and in Mexico to invest in Mx Factors notes, which purportedly pay a guaranteed return of 12% in 60 or 90 days.  Mx Factors claims that it will use the investor funds to provide its clients - construction contractors, wholesalers, and manufacturers - with accounts receivable financing, secured by the clients assignment of its accounts receivable.  The defendants also represent that investor funds are safe because at least 70% of the receivables are backed or funded by the government., According to the complaint, these representations are false.  Mx Factors has actually been operating a Ponzi scheme, and at least $19.9 million in new investor funds has been used to pay existing investors.  At least $5.64 million has been misappropriated (1) to finance a crab fishing business, (2) to pay the personal expenses of Harkless, Berardi, and Hawkesworth, including mortgage payments and credit card bills, and (3) to fund overseas bank accounts.  Additionally, the complaint alleges that BBH, Berardi, and Hawkesworth have skimmed $1.3 million in investor funds by failing to turn them over to Mx Factors.  The complaint further alleges that BBH Resources and JTL Financial have each received undisclosed sales commissions of at least 12%., In its lawsuit, the Commission obtained an order freezing each of the defendants assets, an order appointing a permanent receiver over Mx Factors, BBH Resources, and JTL Financial, an order requiring Mx Factors and Harkless to repatriate assets from abroad, and preliminarily enjoining all of the defendants from future violations of the securities registration and antifraud provisions -- and preliminarily enjoining defendants BBH Resources, JTL Financial, Berardi, Hawkesworth, and Harding from future violations of the broker-dealer registration provisions -- of the federal securities laws, Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Manella, United States District Judge for the Central District of California, sentenced Thomas S. Hughes, 56, of Rancho Palos Verdes, California, to 97 months in federal prison.  Hughes pleaded guilty on August 11, 2003, to three counts of securities fraud and one count of criminal contempt., Hughes was charged by the United States Attorneys Office for the Central District of California with orchestrating a fraudulent securities scheme.  Specifically, Hughes was accused of issuing false and misleading public statements in July 2002 - press releases and website content - that artificially inflated the price of eConnect, whose stock was then publicly quoted on the Over-The-Counter Bulletin Board.  The press releases and website content falsely claimed that eConnect had received a $20 million investment in AA asset-backed bonds, that eConnect had begun a stock repurchase program of its shares, and that eConnect had received a $964,000 purchase order for its principal product, suggesting that a legitimate company had a relationship to the company that actually placed the order.  In reality, the indictment alleged:  (1) the bonds were not AA rated or registered so that they could be traded publicly; (2) there was no stock repurchase program; and (3) there was no relationship between the company that placed the $964,000 purchase order and the legitimate company identified in the press release.  Hughes was also charged with criminal contempt of a permanent injunction against him obtained by the Commission in April 2000 in the case SEC v. eConnect and Thomas S. Hughes, Civil Action Number CV-00-2959 MMM (RCx)(C.D. Cal.)(Lit. Rel. No. 16481)., In a related proceeding, the Commission obtained emergency relief against Hughes and others, including an asset freeze, in Los Angeles federal court on August 8, 2002, alleging that Hughes and others violated the federal securities laws based upon the scheme described above.  On September 4, 2003, Judge Manella entered judgment against Hughes pursuant to his consent. The court ordered Hughes to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $120,000, and permanently enjoined him from future violations of the insider transactions reporting provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 16a-3 thereunder. The Court also prohibited Hughes from acting as an officer or director of a publicly-traded company.  The Commissions complaint charged Hughes with violations of Sections 10(b) and 16(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 16a-3 thereunder., This case is the product of an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the United States Attorneys Office in Los Angeles, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which received assistance from NASD Regulation, Inc., For further information, please see Litigation Release Nos. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17670.htm>17670</a>, <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17694.htm>17694</a>, <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17709.htm>17709</a>, and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18326.htm>18326</a>., <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18620.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Dick and James S. Adams, formerly Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer of Carmel, Indiana based Conseco, Inc., and its then wholly owned subsidiary, Conseco Finance Corporation.  In its complaint, the Commission alleged that throughout 1999 and early 2000, Conseco and Conseco Finance made false and misleading statements about their earnings and income in filings made with the Commission and in public statements announcing their earnings, overstating their results by hundreds of millions of dollars.  This massive overstatement occurred because defendants Dick and Adams conducted a fraudulent scheme to avoid huge write downs of certain assets held by Conseco Finance, known as interest-only securities.  The complaint alleged that in order to avoid the charges to earnings associated with these write downs, Dick and Adams made improper adjustments to the historical basis of these securities, and also manipulated the valuation equation used to test these securities for impairments.  Dick and Adams also made a number of unsupported and improper adjustments to the books and records of these companies to increase earnings.  The complaint alleged that as a result of their activities, Dick and Adams violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and aided and abetted Conseco and Conseco Finances violations of the reporting, record keeping and internal controls provisions.  Specifically, the complaint alleged Dick and Adams violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder, and that Dick and Adams aided and abetted Conseco and Conseco Finances violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-13 thereunder.  The complaint seeks an injunction against further violations of the above provisions of the federal securities laws, disgorgement of the salaries and bonuses earned by Dick and Adams during their fraudulent scheme, civil penalties and officer and director bars.  , In separate administrative proceedings, the Commission ordered Conseco, Inc. to cease-and-desist from violating the reporting, record-keeping and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws described above.

Friedman, 65, of La Jolla, California, who is alleged in the Commissions complaint to have controlled both entities.  The Commissions complaint alleges that the defendants grossly overstated the assets of GMM to investors.  , Acting on the Commissions lawsuit, the Honorable Barry T. Moskowitz, United States District Judge for the Southern District of California, yesterday issued a temporary restraining order against GMM, LF Global, and Friedman, appointed a receiver over GMM and LF Global, and issued orders freezing the assets of the defendants, prohibiting the destruction of documents, and ordering accountings from the defendants.  A hearing on whether a preliminary injunction should be issued against the defendants is scheduled for March 25, 2004.  , The Commissions complaint alleges that since 1993, the defendants have sold, in an unregistered offering, limited partnership interests in GMM, a purported private hedge fund that invested in securities, such as stock and stock options.  While the amount of money actually raised is not known, Friedman has told investors at various times over the last several months that the hedge fund held assets ranging from $60 million to over $100 million.  GMMs brokerage records, however, show that, since at least December 2002, the securities it holds have been worth no more than $11 million.  In addition, Friedman touted his investment experience but failed to inform investors about his disciplinary history, including that he has been barred from association with any member of the National Association of Securities Dealers.   , The Commissions complaint alleges that GMM, LF Global, and Friedman violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and, as to LF Global, Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and, as to Friedman, that he aided and abetted those violations of the Advisers Act, seeking, in addition to the emergency relief described above, from each defendant, preliminary and permanent injunctions, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.<!--<IMG SRC=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=9 ALT= BORDER=0>  <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18623.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>--><!-- End text -->,  ]"

(Millennium), a sophisticated and fraudulent international boiler room operation.  The Commissions complaint alleges that Millennium conducted fraudulent operations from Spain, Mexico and the United States, and operated from approximately March 2000 until June 2002.  The complaint alleges that, during that time, Millennium defrauded more than 700 investors in over 20 countries, and raised more than $20 million., The Complaint alleges that Rodney Shehyn headed Millenniums operations, and that Rodney Marr, Donald Marr and Karen Leigh each acted, at various times, as Millennium salespersons and managers of other salespersons.  The complaint alleges that each of the defendants knew of the fraudulent nature of Millenniums operations and took numerous steps to conceal their respective roles.  Among other things, the Complaint alleges that each of them used a variety of aliases when working for Millennium., The Complaint alleges that Millennium made a number of fraudulent claims about itself and the securities that it was selling.  Millennium first identified potential investors by renting the subscription lists of English language financial publications, including certain well-known U.S. publications.  Millennium then contacted those subscribers and lured them in with false claims that it was a prestigious offshore banking firm with a phenomenal 21-year track record.  In reality, Millennium began its operations in approximately March 2000., The Complaint alleges that Millennium then engaged in a two-step bait and switch sales scheme.  First, Millenniums salespersons fraudulently induced investors to purchase U.S. securities trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).  Those investors who purchased NYSE-traded securities were then contacted by another Millennium salesperson.  In the second stage of the sales process, Millennium fraudulently induced investors to sell their NYSE-traded securities and invest the proceeds, plus additional money, in the so-called pre-initial public offering securities of small U.S. companies, including Key Card Communications, Inc., kNutek Holdings, Inc. and Sonic Garden, Inc.  Millenniums salespersons used high pressure sales tactics and made a number of fraudulent statements concerning the value of these securities.  None of the companies which issued these securities have had an IPO, and Millenniums investors have typically lost most, if not all, of their investment., The Commissions Complaint alleges that each of the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities contained within Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.  It alleges that Shehyn, Rodney Marr and Donald Marr are liable for Millenniums violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 as controlling persons under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act.  The Complaint further alleges that Shehyn violated Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act.  The Commissions Complaint seeks, against all the defendants, a permanent injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws, disgorgement and prejudgment interest thereon, an accounting and repatriation of investor funds, civil monetary penalties, and a penny stock bar., On May 22, 2002, the Commission filed an action against Millennium itself.  <i>SEC v.

Since then, he has remained in custody., The Commission wishes to acknowledge the cooperation and assistance of the regulatory and law enforcement officials of more than a dozen foreign jurisdictions in connection with this matter, including the Federation of St. Kitts and Nevis, which has restrained over $1.3 million of defrauded investor funds.  The Commission also wishes to acknowledge the cooperation and assistance of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement., In order to assist investors, the Commission has released an online brochure on pre-IPO fraud.  Entitled Risky Business: Pre-IPO Investing, the brochure advises investors about the consequences of investing at the pre-IPO stage and provides key questions investors should ask. The brochure is available at <a href=/investor/pubs/preipo.htm>www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/preipo.htm</a>.  The Commission has also posted a warning to foreign investors who may be additionally victimized by those who promise to help recover losses in U.S. microcap stocks.  In some cases, individuals have fraudulently promised to help investors recover losses for a substantial fee disguised as some type of tax, deposit, or refundable insurance.

The Commission alleges that the Unknown  Purchasers engaged in illegal insider trading in the last six  business days before the  March 15, 2004 announcement that GE Infrastructure, a subsidiary of General Electric Company,  intended to acquire InVision, a manufacturer of  explosive-detection systems, for $50 per share in cash for all outstanding InVision shares., The Commissions Complaint also alleges:, During the period from March 6, 2004 through March 12, 2004, the Unknown Purchasers purchased a total of 4575 out-of-the-money March 45  and April 45 call options for the shares of InVision.

As a result, the value of the Unknown Purchasers call options increased by about $1.7 million., Also on March 15, the Unknown  Purchasers sold  most of the call options, realizing profits of about $1.27 million.  Including the unrealized profits from the call options not sold, the total realized and unrealized profits are about $1.7 million., In the pending lawsuit, the Commission alleges that the unknown defendants engaged in illegal insider trading in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5.

Civil Action No. H-04-1054, U.S.D.C./Southern District of Texas (Houston Division)</h2>, <h2><i>In the Matter of CMS Energy Corp. and Terry Woolley</i>, Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Release Number 49432 </h2>]","[On March 18, 2004, the SEC announced that, yesterday, it issued a cease-and-desist order and filed a civil action relating to alleged fraudulent statements by CMS Energy Corporation (CMS), a Michigan-based energy company, in connection with over $5 billion in round-trip energy trades -- simultaneous, pre-arranged buy-sell trades of energy with the same counter-party, at the same price and volume, and over the same term, resulting in neither profit nor loss to either transacting party.  The civil suit alleges that Preston D. Hopper, CMSs former controller, violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and aided and abetted CMSs violations of the antifraud, reporting, books-and-records and internal controls provisions, and Tamela C. Pallas, the former chief executive of CMSs Houston-based trading subsidiary, violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and for aided and abetted CMSs violations of the antifraud and reporting provisions.  CMS and Terry Woolley, the former controller of CMSs energy-trading subsidiary, in a cease-and-desist order issued by the SEC on March 17, 2004 (the Order), have agreed to cease and desist from committing or causing violations and future violations of the above-referenced provisions.  Woolley also agreed to pay a $25,000 penalty.  CMS and Woolley consented to the cease-and-desist order without admitting or denying the findings., In the civil action, the SEC alleges that Hopper improperly caused the revenue to be reported in CMSs SEC filings and earnings releases.  According to the SECs complaint, when CMSs outside auditors required CMS to reclassify the revenues and expenses from the 2001 trades in CMSs 2001 Form 10-K on a net, rather than a gross basis, nullifying the impact of the trades on CMSs income statement, Hopper failed to ensure that material details about the reclassification were disclosed in the Form 10-K.  The SEC further alleges that Pallas violated the antifraud provisions, and aided and abetted CMSs antifraud and reporting violations by orchestrating the trading without ensuring that the illusory volume and revenues associated with the trades were excluded from CMSs public disclosures and SEC filings.  In its lawsuit, the SEC is seeking permanent injunctions, disgorgement with pre-judgment interest, and civil money penalties against Hopper for violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder, and for aiding and abetting CMSs violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder, and against Pallas for violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and for aiding and abetting CMSs violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Sections 10(b) and 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.  , The SEC finds in its Order that the round-trip trades conducted by CMSs trading subsidiary in 2000 and 2001, artificially increased CMSs revenues and trading volumes.  Between the third quarter of 2000 and the third quarter of 2001, CMS cited its artificially inflated revenue and trading volume in its filings with the SEC, press releases, earnings conference calls and investor presentations.  By reflecting the results of the trades, CMS overstated its revenue by a total of $5.2 billion over five quarters: $1.0 billion, or 10%, for the last two quarters of 2000; and $4.2 billion, or 36%, for the first three quarters of 2001.  Woolley improperly recorded the revenues from the trades.  CMS also overstated its trading subsidiarys reported energy-trading volume by 78% over the last two quarters of 2000 and 72% over the first three quarters of 2001.  The settled Order requires that CMS cease and desist from committing or causing, and that Terry Woolley cease and desist from committing or causing violations and future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Sections 10(b), of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and from causing any violation of Sections13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18628.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The judgment against Wulf also barred him from acting or serving as an officer or director of any public company, and from participating in an offering of penny stock. Wulf International and Wulf consented to the judgments without admitting or denying any of the allegations in the Commissions complaint., The complaint alleged that, between January 2001 and April 2002, Wulf International, through Wulf, made fraudulent statements in press releases concerning: (1) its receipt of financing commitments for low-income housing projects in the Philippines and Pakistan; (2) its receipt of approval from the Philippines government for the housing project in that country; and (3) related earnings projections.  Wulf International has subsequently abandoned those proposed housing projects., The complaint alleged that the statements about purported financing commitments were fraudulent because they failed to disclose material contingencies associated with such commitments.  In particular, any purported loan commitments were conditioned on Wulf International obtaining bank or government guarantees as security for the loans, which had not occurred.  The complaint further alleged that statements in the press releases about approval from the Philippines government were fraudulent because they implied that the Philippines government had granted final approval for the project in that country. Contrary to this implication, only one of five governmental entities from which approval was required had approved the project.  Finally, the statements about earnings projections lacked a reasonable basis in light of the lack of financing commitments and government approval. , Litigation as to the Commissions claims for disgorgement of ill-gotten gains and civil money penalties against Wulf is continuing. ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18629.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The offering through D&amp;E, which unlawfully raised approximately $6 million, constituted an unregistered offering of securities, which was integrated with the earlier unregistered, non-exempt offerings.	, See also:  <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18565.htm>L.R. 18565</a> (February 5, 2004) and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18141.htm>L.R. 18141</a> (May 16, 2003),  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18630.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The Commission alleged that the defendants had solicited investors to buy shares of ForceTek -- a company controlled by Garcias associates that had no business operations -- with materials that described the business of Force Technologies, Inc., a different and unrelated Canadian company that traded in Canada under the symbol FRCE.  The Commission alleged specifically that such conduct violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b), 15(a) and 15(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 15c1-2 thereunder., On September 16, 1997, the Court issued an order temporarily restraining defendants from engaging in further fraudulent activities and freezing their assets.

Ginsburg for insider trading in violation of the federal securities laws.  The Court of Appeals also reinstated a $1 million civil penalty and ordered the district court to impose a permanent injunction from future violations., Ginsburg was originally found liable on April 16, 2002, when a federal jury in West Palm Beach, Florida found that he had engaged in illegal insider trading based on his tips to, and resulting trading by, his brother, Mark J. Ginsburg, and father, Jordan E. Ginsburg, in the common stock of EZ Communications, Inc., and Katz Media Group, Inc.  The jury found that, in July 1996, Scott Ginsburg, then the chairman and chief executive officer of Evergreen Media Corporation, a publicly-held radio company, tipped Mark Ginsburg and Jordan Ginsburg with information that EZ was for sale and that Mark Ginsburg and Jordan Ginsburg purchased EZ stock prior to the announcement that EZ would be sold to another radio company.  The jury also found that, less than a year later, in June 1997, Scott Ginsburg tipped Mark Ginsburg with information about the sale of Katz Media at a time when substantial steps had been taken by Evergreen and another entity towards a joint tender offer for the shares of Katz Media.  The day after the tip, Mark Ginsburg purchased Katz Media stock. The SEC alleged that Mark and Jordan Ginsburg realized illegal profits of $1.8 million from their trading based on tips from Scott Ginsburg. , After a seven-day trial, a jury found that Scott Ginsburg violated Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3, which are antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The district court imposed a $1 million civil penalty, but declined to impose an injunction.  In December 2002, on Ginsburgs motion, the district court threw out the jury verdict and the penalty, stating that the SEC had not presented sufficient evidence to support the verdict.  The SEC appealed that decision as well as the district courts denial of injunctive relief., In reversing the district court, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals held that the SEC had presented sufficient evidence at trial to support the jurys verdict against Scott Ginsburg and that the district court had abused its discretion in denying the permanent injunction sought by the SEC.  The court of appeals also reinstated the $1 million civil penalty that the district court initially had ordered against Ginsburg., Prior to the trial of Scott Ginsburg in this case, on March 30, 2002, Mark Ginsburg and Jordan Ginsburg had settled the SECs insider trading charges against them, without admitting or denying the SECs allegations, by consenting to the entry of final judgments that included permanent injunctions, disgorgement, prejudgment interest and civil money penalties totaling over $4.7 million. , The SEC acknowledges the assistance provided by The American Stock Exchange in certain parts of the investigation of this matter. , For further information, please see Litigation Releases Nos. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17917.htm>17917</a> (January 7, 2003), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17482.htm>17482</a> (April 23, 2002), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17455.htm>17455</a>  (April 4, 2002), and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr16275.htm>16275</a> (September 9, 1999).,  ]"

CEDRIC KUSHNER PROMOTIONS, INC., CEDRIC KUSHNER, JAMES DILORENZO, and STEVEN ANGEL</u>, Civil Action No. 04 CV 2324 (TPG)(AJP) (S.D.N.Y.) (filed March 24, 2004)</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) announced today that it filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against Cedric Kushner Promotions, Inc. (CKP or the Company), its Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, President and Founder Cedric Kushner (Kushner), its Principal Financial and Accounting Officer, James DiLorenzo (DiLorenzo), and its former Executive Vice President and Secretary and a current director, Steven Angel (Angel) for violating the antifraud, record-keeping, and reporting provisions of the federal securities laws.  As part of this action, the Commission alleges that Kushner and DiLorenzo violated the certification requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and Rule 13a-14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act)., According to the Commissions Complaint, on the evening of May 20, 2003, CKP filed a Form 10-KSB for the year ended December 31, 2002, that contained what purported to be unqualified independent auditor reports authorized and issued by its former auditor, BDO Seidman, LLP (BDO), and current auditor, Marcum &amp; Kliegman LLP (Marcum).  However, the Complaint charges, neither BDO nor Marcum had actually provided those reports to CKP, and CKP instead filed forged auditor reports.  Moreover, CKP filed its Form 10-KSB without obtaining either independent auditors consent., The Complaint alleges that the financial statements included in the May 20 filing contained material misstatements and substantial errors.  For example, the Complaint alleges that the May 20 filings statement of cash flows included in CKPs financial statements for 2002 reflected, among other things, an approximate $4 million cash deficit when, in fact, CKPs cash balance was $0 by year-end 2002.  The Complaint alleges that the May 20 filings statement of cash flows showed that $5.6 million had been used in operating activities in 2002 when, in fact, only $846,433 had been put to such uses.  As a result, the Complaint alleges, CKP misstated its total assets by over 100%.  The Complaint alleges further that the May 20 filing misstated in its financial footnotes the number of shares outstanding following CKPs April 2002 reverse merger by 8%., According to the Complaint, despite their failure to obtain a signed audit report and material errors in the Companys financial statements, Kushner and DiLorenzo each personally certified that the filing fairly and accurately presented CKPs financial condition, in violation of Commission rules adopted pursuant to Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which require an issuers principal executive and financial officer to certify financial and other information contained in the quarterly and annual reports.  Prior to certifying, the Complaint alleges, Kushner failed to read either the Sarbanes-Oxley certification or the filing to which it was attached, or to take any steps to ascertain whether the filing was true and accurate. , On May 21, both BDO and Marcum wrote letters protesting the forged auditor reports to CKP pursuant to Exchange Act Section 10A, which requires auditors to notify the appropriate level of management as soon as practicable once they detect, or otherwise become aware of, information indicating that an illegal act has or may have occurred.  On May 23, the Company filed a Form 8-K containing the auditors letters and simultaneously filed a Form 10-KSB/A removing the auditor reports, but including new materially inaccurate financial statements.  The Complaint charges that DiLorenzo and Angel substantially participated in the creation of both the May 20 and May 23 filings., The Complaint seeks an injunction against CKP based on its violation of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 12b-20 and 13a-1. The Complaint also seeks an injunction, officer and director bars, and civil monetary penalties against Kushner and DiLorenzo based on their primary violations of Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5 and 13a-14, and their aiding and abetting CKPs violations of Exchange Act Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B), and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1.  The Complaint further charges that Kushner is liable for CKPs violations as a control person under Exchange Act Section 20(a). Lastly, the Complaint seeks an injunction, an officer and director bar, and a civil penalty against Angel based on his primary violations of Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5 or, in the alternative, based on his aiding and abetting violations of Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5 by CKP, Kushner and DiLorenzo, and his aiding and abetting violations of Exchange Act Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 by CKP., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18638.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18638.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The Commission had charged that Mr. Borders, 41, had engaged in insider trading in violation of the federal securities laws, specifically Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.  During the relevant time period, Borders was a stockbroker employed by brokerage firm Morgan Keegan &amp; Co., Inc. in its Bowling Green, Kentucky branch office., This action was filed on March 14, 2000 against Mr. Borders and eighteen other defendants in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York as SEC v.

Criminal charges against Borders were dismissed, and the SECs claims against Borders were severed and transferred to the federal district court in Bowling Green, Kentucky for trial.  The SECs claims against the other eighteen defendants have all been resolved., The Commission alleged that from 1997 through January 2000, Mr. Borders and others engaged in a widespread insider trading scheme that produced over $8 million in illegal profits from trading in the securities of 23 public companies.  The Commission alleged that John Freeman, a temporary word-processing employee at Goldman Sachs &amp; Co., Inc. and later Credit Suisse First Boston, tipped a number of defendants about merger and acquisition transactions involving clients of those investment banking firms.  The Complaint further alleged that Borders participated in and profited from the scheme through a chain of tipping and trading that originated with Freeman and ultimately led to Morgan Keegans Bowling Green branch office.  ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18640.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

(MJK), which was a subsidiary of Stockwalk, Inc.  During this time period, the Complaint alleges that Brooks never disclosed MJKs true financial condition which resulted from his departments failure to collect the marks owed to MJK to any of the broker-dealers his department conducted business with, while knowing the broker-dealers relied on MJKs financial condition to decide how much business to transact with MJK. , The Commission further alleges that Brooks aided and abetted MJKs violations of the customer reserve requirements and record-keeping provisions during this same time period.  According to the Complaint, Brooks falsified two stock loan reports which were used by MJKs accounting department to incorrectly compute MJKs customer reserve deposit.  The false information was subsequently incorporated into MJKs FOCUS reports which Brooks subsequently provided to broker-dealers doing business with the SL Department. ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18641.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Also today, the Honorable Gary L. Taylor, United States District Judge for the Central District of California, granted the relief that the Commission sought, issuing orders freezing assets, appointing a temporary receiver over any entity directly or indirectly controlled by Nathanson, and other relief., The Commissions complaint, filed on March 25, 2004, in federal court in Orange County, alleges that since 2001, Nathanson and his companies have raised $29.5 million from over 1800 investors nationwide through four fraudulent investment schemes.  Nathanson was continuing to raise funds from investors in at least two of his schemes.  The first of Nathansons schemes involved selling securities in a golf equipment company he controls, Giant Golf Co., which purportedly was preparing to conduct an IPO.  The second scheme is an ongoing Ponzi scheme involving several funds that would purportedly purchase air time to air Giant Golfs infomercials.  In the third scheme, according to the complaint, Nathanson sold investment interests through the Nathanson Investment Trust in a purported unnamed software company that he claimed would soon be bought-out by a larger, unnamed, company.  Finally, the complaint alleges that Nathanson sold securities in a company known as Millennium Technical Group that Nathanson said would exploit certain FCC licenses purchased in 1994.  The Commission alleges that in these four schemes, the defendants lied to investors regarding how they would use the investor funds.  The complaint alleges that without the investors knowledge or consent, Nathanson commingled the investors monies, and used the commingled funds to operate both the unprofitable defendant businesses and his other various unprofitable businesses., Additionally, the Commissions complaint alleges that since February 2001, Nathanson used at least $1 million of investor funds to support his extravagant lifestyle, including three homes and payment of $346,500 in gambling-related debts.  Finally, the Commission alleges that, in Ponzi-like fashion, Nathanson has caused over $5 million of the $29.5 million raised to be paid to certain investors either as purported returns on their investments when, in fact, their investments were not profitable, or as purported returns of their principal., In its lawsuit, the Commission obtained an order (1) freezing the assets of Nathanson, Nathanson Investment Trust, Giant Golf, Play Big, Starquest, Whitehawk, Leafhead, NetTel, Yrmac, Millennium, and other Nathanson companies; (2) preventing destruction of documents; (3) appointing a temporary receiver over any entity directly or indirectly controlled by Nathanson; and (4) temporarily enjoining all of the defendants from future violations of the securities registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Stewart engaged in the unregistered offerings individually and through his solely owned companies Stewart Finance Company (SFC) and Stewart National Finance Company (SNFC).  Stewart also caused an unregistered offering of securities to be conducted through D&amp;E Acquisitions, Inc. (D&amp;E), a company solely owned by Donald N. Ellis (Ellis).  All three companies were based in Greene County Georgia.  Judge Royals order permanently enjoined Stewart from further violating the registration provisions set forth in Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933.  Stewart consented to the entry of the order without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions complaint and first amended complaint.  Stewart was ordered to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest and a civil penalty in amounts to be resolved upon motion of the Commission at a later date., The Commissions complaint and first amended complaint alleged that in 1989, SFC commenced a continuous series of offerings to Georgia investors of its subordinated debentures and senior demand notes, and in 1998, SFC sold preferred stock to Georgia investors.  Although the initial offers and sales of securities by SFC were purportedly exempt from registration pursuant to the intrastate offering exemption set forth in Section 3(a)(11) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), by 1999, SFC could no longer rely on that exemption and was, in fact, engaging in unregistered offers and sales of securities without an exemption from registration.  The complaint and amended complaint alleged that in or about August 1999, after learning that SFC could no longer issue securities, Stewart began personally issuing promissory notes to investors and transferring the proceeds of those notes to SFC.  The pleadings further alleged that the offers and sales of Stewarts promissory notes were not registered with the Commission and were not exempt from registration, and that in January 2002, SNFC began offering $25 million in variable rate subordinated debentures in a purported private placement pursuant to Regulation D of the Securities Act.  The SNFC offering was not exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act because the facts and circumstances of the offering required it to be integrated with the prior and contemporaneous non-exempt offerings by SFC and Stewart.  The offering through D&amp;E, which occurred from July 2002 through January 2003, unlawfully raised approximately $6 million, and similarly constituted an unregistered offering of securities, which was integrated with the earlier unregistered, non-exempt offerings., See also:  <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18630.htm>L.

Although Tippetts was listed as President or Trustee of the respective accounts, Wolfson directed manipulative trades of Freedom Surf stock out of the accounts.  In this way, Tippetts aided and abetted Wolfsons securities fraud violations.

Resteiner on 60 felony counts including wire fraud, mail fraud, and money laundering charges involving a fictitious investment scheme.  Resteiner is a defendant in a previously filed SEC fraud action based on the same conduct. , The indictment alleges that Resteiner created and executed a scheme by which he defrauded approximately 50 investors, many of whom were members of the Church of Christ Scientist (Christian Science Church), out of more than $30 million through a purported high-yield, international bank trading program.  As part of this scheme, Resteiner, assisted by others, made false representations to prospective investors, including that he was one of only a few people in the world permitted to conduct off-balance sheet trading, that his trading program would pay annual returns of no less than 50 percent, and that investors principal would never be at risk.  The indictment further alleges that Resteiner knew that he was not a trader and had no way to generate the promised investment returns, that investors principal was not safe, and was in fact being used to pay purported interest payments to investors to lure more investors into the scheme, and to support his lavish lifestyle.  The indictment alleges Resteiner maintained  homes in the Bahamas and in Switzerland, a yacht, an airplane, a helicopter, two Rolls Royce motor cars, two Hummer vehicles, a Porsche Carerra sports car, and other assorted vehicles. , On April 16, 2001, the Commission filed a complaint in the Massachusetts federal district court against Resteiner and others charging them each with participating in the same investment scheme alleged in the indictment.  On August 19, 2002, the Massachusetts federal district court entered default judgments against Resteiner and another defendant, Voldemar A. VonStrasdas, in the Commissions action.  The Court ordered Resteiner and VonStrasdas jointly and severally to pay disgorgement plus prejudgment interest of $25,930,895.26.  In addition, the Court ordered Resteiner and VonStrasdas each to pay civil penalties of $4.4 million, and permanently enjoined each of them from violating the antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws.  The court had previously entered judgments by consent against two other individuals involved in Resteiners fraudulent investment scheme, Charles G. Dyer and Miles M. Harbur, and against two entities controlled by Dyer, Resource F, LLC and Bunker Hill Aviation, LLC., Unscrupulous promoters continue to victimize the public with Prime Bank schemes.

RICHARD H. HAWKINS</u>, United States District Court for the Northern District of California, Civil Action No. 04-1259 CW</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced civil fraud charges against the Chief Financial Officer of McKesson HBOC for his role in a massive accounting fraud.    McKesson HBOC (now renamed McKesson Corporation) is a Fortune 100 company with its corporate headquarters in San Francisco., The SECs complaint, filed in the Northern District of California, alleges that Richard Hawkins, age 53, of Atherton, California, violated the antifraud, lying-to-accountants, and books and records provisions of the federal securities law.  Mr. Hawkins also was indicted today on criminal charges stemming from his role in the fraud., As alleged in the complaint, Mr. Hawkins participated in a fraudulent scheme with other former McKesson officers to artificially inflate the companys financial results for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 1999, by fraudulently recognizing revenue on a $20 million transaction between McKesson and Data General Corporation.  Mr. Hawkins and others caused revenue from the Data General transaction to be reported to the public as part of the companys earnings release on April 22, 1999, despite the fact that McKessons independent auditors told Mr. Hawkins that revenue from the transaction could not be recognized.  Soon after the fraud was discovered in April 1999, McKessons stock tumbled from approximately $65 to $34 a share, a drop that slashed the companys market value by more than $9 billion., Mr. Hawkins was also formerly the Chief Financial Officer of San Francisco-based McKesson Corporation before the companys January 1999 merger with Atlanta-based HBOC &amp; Company (HBOC) to form McKesson HBOC.  The charges relate to Mr. Hawkins conduct in the first fiscal quarter after the merger., Mr. Hawkins is the only former McKesson officer who was not employed by HBOC, to date, to be charged in the investigations into the accounting fraud at McKesson HBOC.  Mr. Hawkins becomes the twelfth person charged civilly by the SEC in connection with this investigation.  Six former HBOC executives have previously been charged criminally., According to the civil complaint, the charges against Hawkins stem from his involvement in a single fraudulent $20 million transaction between McKesson and Data General.  The transaction allowed McKesson to report to the public that the company met Wall Street analystss expectations for the quarter ended March 31, 1999, which was the first quarter of combined operations after McKessons acquisition of HBOC., According to the complaint, the Data General transaction was fraudulent for three reasons:  the deal was backdated, gave Data General an unconditional right to return the McKesson product, and was a swap that was not accounted for as a swap. , 	According to the complaint, the Data General transaction was conceived, negotiated, and executed, in its entirety, after the close of the quarter.  The transaction consisted of two separate contracts.  The first contract was improperly backdated to March 31, 1999.  The second contract was dated April 5, 1999.  Both contracts were contingent upon each other and negotiated contemporaneously as part of the same transaction.  The second contract also contained a provision requiring McKesson to buy back any software that Data General was unable to resell., According to the complaint, although McKesson HBOCs outside auditors informed Mr. Hawkins that revenue from the transaction could not be recognized under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, Mr. Hawkins and others included the $20 million transaction in the companys earnings release on April 22, 1999.  Hawkins also made false statements to the companys auditors regarding the Data General transaction., The SEC charges Mr. Hawkins with violating Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, and  13b2-2 thereunder.  The Commission is seeking to enjoin Mr. Hawkins from committing future violations of these provisions, compel him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil monetary penalties, and to bar Mr. Hawkins from serving as an officer or director of a public company. , <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18649.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18649.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

According to the complaint, Johnson and Johnson &amp; Co. assisted in the scheme by performing a range of accounting functions for Winners, including purporting to audit financial statements they had previously prepared for Winners.

(STC), an uninsured national banking association based in Phoenix, Arizona.  Among other services, STC effected mutual fund trades for participants in retirement plans and processed data regarding those trades for the plans third party administrators (TPAs).  In accordance with the final judgment, STC paid $1 million in disgorgement on March 31, 2004, when STC was shut down pursuant to orders from its primary regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.  STC consented to the entry of the judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint., In addition to STC, the Commissions complaint, filed on November 25, 2003, charged STCs former chief executive, Grant D.

McDermott consented to the entry of a final judgment that was entered on February 23, 2004.  The case is pending against Seeger and Kenyon., The Commissions complaint alleged the following:, Late Trading: From May 2000 to July 2003, STC facilitated hundreds of mutual fund trades in nearly 400 different mutual funds by several hedge funds controlled by Edward J. Stern, known as the Canary Capital funds.  Approximately 99% of these trades were transmitted to STC after the 4:00 p.m. EST market close; 82% of the trades were sent to STC between 6:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m. EST.  The hedge funds late trading was effected by STC through its electronic trading platform, which was designed primarily for processing trades by TPAs for retirement plans.  STC repeatedly misrepresented to mutual funds that the hedge funds were a retirement plan account, even though the defendants knew that the hedge funds were not a TPA or a retirement plan account. , Market Timing: During its three-year relationship with the Canary hedge funds, STC and the other defendants employed various methods to attempt to conceal the hedge funds market timing activities from mutual funds, including a piggybacking strategy in which STC set up a sub-account within the account of one of STCs TPA clients and attached the Canary hedge funds mutual fund trades to the trades of this client without its knowledge., The complaint charged STC, Seeger, Kenyon, and McDermott with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  STC is also charged with violating Rule 22c-1, under Section 22(c) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, which prohibits the purchase or sale of mutual fund shares except at a price based on the current NAV of such shares that is next calculated after receipt of a buy or sell order.  Seeger is also charged with violating Section 37 of the Investment Company Act, which prohibits stealing the assets of a registered investment company.

(Powerball), falsified company records to hide his theft of $7,200, and to hide his failure to pay $40,000 for stock he had received through the exercise of warrants.  The Complaint alleges that in order to conceal his fraud, Freise altered monthly bank statements for Powerballs bank account, which made that account appear to contain a substantially higher cash balance than it actually contained.  The Complaint alleges that Freise knew that Powerballs financial statements and its reports to the Commission would reflect such false cash balances.  As a result of such conduct, Powerball materially misstated its financial statements for the quarters ended June 30, 2002 and September 30, 2002 and for the year ended December 31, 2002., The Complaint alleges that Freise violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the Securities Act), Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder.  The Complaint also alleges that Freise aided and abetted Powerballs violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 promulgated thereunder.  The Complaint seeks a permanent injunction prohibiting Freise from future violations of these provisions, disgorgement, prejudgment interest and civil penalties pursuant to Section 21(d)(3) of the Exchange Act and Section 20(d)(1) of the Securities Act.  The Commission also seeks an order permanently barring Freise from serving as an officer or director of a public company. , On April 1, 2004, the Commission issued an Order instituting public administrative proceedings against Powerballs former auditors, David T. Thomson, CPA (Thomson) and David T. Thomson PC (Thomson PC), pursuant to Rule 102(e)(1)(ii) of the Commissions Rules of Practice [17 C.F.R.§ 201.102(e)].  The Order denies Thomson and Thomson PC the privilege of appearing or practicing before the Commission as accountants, with the right to request that the Commission consider their reinstatement by submitting an application after two years.  The Order finds that Thomson and Thomson PC failed to comply with generally accepted auditing standards (GAAS) in their audit of Powerballs financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002.  The Order further finds that Thomson and Thomson PC failed to obtain confirmations of cash balances from Powerballs bank, or otherwise obtain sufficient competent evidential matter to verify Powerballs cash balances and instead relied on faxed copies of bank statements.  Obtaining bank confirmations is a fundamental audit requirement that was heightened in this case by the fact that Powerballs cash balances represented over two-thirds of the companys assets.  Based on such conduct, the Commission found that Thomson and Thomson PC engaged in improper professional conduct.  Thomson and Thomson PC consented to the Order, but neither admitted nor denied the findings in the Order.  See In the Matter of <a href=/litigation/admin/34-49516.htm>David T.

Zaba, 47, also of British Columbia, its former president, Robert B. Abbott, 57, a resident of Quebec Canada, and California attorney, Warren J. Soloski, 62, for violations of the anti-fraud, securities registration, periodic and current reporting, and beneficial ownership reporting provisions of the federal securities laws.  LASV and Abbott have consented to the entry of permanent injunctions and Abbott has agreed to be barred from serving as an officer-and-director and from participating in a penny-stock offering.  These settlements await Court approval., According to the SECs complaint, Zaba, Abbott, and Soloski participated in a fraudulent scheme as follows:, In March and April 2000, Zaba secretly acquired control of LASV, a public shell company, and orchestrated a reverse merger with a no-asset, private British Columbia company that he controlled.  Between May 2000 and July 2001, Zaba caused LASV to issue a series of false and misleading press releases designed to artificially increase the price of the companys stock.  Among other things, the press releases announced that LASV had acquired a multi-million-dollar casino resort in the Dominican Republic, that it had obtained funding to acquire a multi-million-dollar airline, and that it would profit billions from the operation of a Russian national lottery.  In truth, LASV never came close to completing these transactions.  Several of these misleading statements were also contained in LASVs Commission filings, which also failed to disclose, as required, Zabas control of the company., Abbott served as LASVs strawman president.  At Zabas direction he signed fraudulent Commission filings, served as a nominee shareholder, and authorized the issuance of millions of LASV shares for Zabas benefit., Soloski prepared LASVs misleading quarterly, annual, and current SEC reports. He also prepared 11 fraudulent Form S-8 registration statements that registered offerings of approximately 16.2 million LASV shares to purported independent consultants.  In reality, the consultants were Zaba nominees, who performed no consulting services for LASV.  In fact, Soloski and Zaba received the bulk of the Form S-8 shares and sold or distributed them into the inflated market., In total, Zaba and Soloski received a financial benefit in excess of $2.3 million from the unlawful sale and distribution of LASV shares., Based on the alleged misconduct, the complaint charges that:, LASV, Zaba, Abbott and Soloski violated the securities-registration and anti-fraud, provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically, Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder., LASV, aided and abetted by Zaba, Abbott and Soloski, violated the issuer reporting provisions found in Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder; and, Zaba additionally violated Sections 13(d) and 16(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13d-1, and 16a-3 thereunder, which are the beneficial-ownership and principal-shareholder reporting provisions of the federal securities laws., The SEC seeks, among other relief, permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with pre-judgment interest, civil money penalties, and penny-stock bars against defendants Zaba and Soloski.  The complaint further seeks an order barring Zaba from serving as an officer-and-director of an SEC reporting company.   Defendants LASV and Abbott agreed to all of the requested injunctive relief without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  No civil penalty was imposed against Abbott based on his demonstrated financial inability to pay.  , Further, the SEC issued an administrative order revoking the registration of LASVs securities under Section 12(j) of the Exchange Act, finding that LASV failed to comply with the aforementioned provisions of the Exchange Act.

The complaint alleged that Klein negotiated an agreement with a barter company, and that during fiscal years 1998 and 1999 Candies fraudulently recognized approximately $1.9 million in revenue pursuant to the agreement.  In addition, the complaint alleged that Klein improperly recorded a $1.6 million credit against amounts owed to Candies Asian sourcing agent during the third quarter of fiscal year 1998, which had the effect of decreasing expenses and therefore increasing income by the same amount.  Finally, the complaint alleged that Klein was aware that Candies employed a bill and hold practice, and that during fiscal years 1998 and 1999 Candies fraudulently recorded approximately $4.4 million in revenue pursuant to the bill and hold and other irregular shipping practices., The final judgment permanently enjoins Klein from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1, and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13.

The Commissions Complaint alleges that the frozen funds result from suspicious trading in call options of InVision Technologies, Inc. in the days immediately prior to a March 15, 2004, joint announcement by General Electric Company (GE) and InVision, a manufacturer of explosive-detection systems, that GE had agreed to acquire InVision in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $900 million, or $50 per share of InVision common stock. The Preliminary Injunction was issued in the Commissions previously filed civil injunctive action, <u>Securities and Exchange Commission v. One or More Unknown Purchasers of Call Options for the Common Stock of InVision Technologies, Inc.</u>, 04 Civ. 02037 (WHP) (S.D.N.Y.) (filed March 16, 2004). , The frozen proceeds are being held in accounts of UBS Securities LLC, a U.S. brokerage firm and resulted from InVision call option purchase orders that came to UBS Securities through certain of its European affiliates. In addition to the freeze provisions, the Preliminary Injunction continues the Temporary Restraining Orders provisions requiring those who purchased the InVision call options through the UBS Securities accounts to identify themselves, and prohibiting the defendants from destroying documents.  To date, no defendant has come forward to contact the Commission staff or the District Court., Additionally, on March 31, 2004, the Commission amended its complaint in the civil injunctive action to include additional suspicious trading in InVision call options immediately ahead of the joint GE/InVision announcement.  The additional trading took place in accounts of Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., a U.S. brokerage firm, and resulted from purchase orders for InVision call options placed through a Deutsche Bank Securities European affiliate.  These trades included orders to buy 1,000 April 45 InVision call options on March 12, 2004, the trading day immediately prior to the GE/InVision joint announcement, at prices ranging between $1.25 and $1.50 per contract.  The positions were sold the next trading day, at an average price of $4.25 per contract, for a one-trading-day profit of approximately $286,728.  On March 31, 2004, the District Court issued a second Temporary Restraining Order in the Commissions action, this time ordering a freeze of proceeds from the InVision option trading in the Deutsche Bank Securities accounts, requiring those who purchased those InVision call options to identify themselves, establishing an expedited discovery schedule and prohibiting the defendants from destroying documents.

Garrett Bewkes, Jr. (Garry Bewkes), while a director of IBC, received adverse material non-public information in advance of an IBC Board of Directors meeting and advised his son, Robert D. Bewkes (Robert Bewkes), a stockbroker, to sell his IBC stock.  Approximately ten minutes after receiving that advice, Robert Bewkes sold over 16,000 shares of IBC owned by himself, his family, and a number of clients., The Commission filed its complaint against:, Garry Bewkes, 76 years old, a resident of Vero Beach, Florida and Nantucket, Massachusetts.

On February 3, 2003, the day before the Board meeting, Garry Bewkes telephoned Robert Bewkes, told him that IBCs business was lousy and advised him to sell any IBC stock that Robert Bewkes owned.  Within ten minutes of that phone call, Robert Bewkes sold 16,230 shares of IBC stock owned by himself, family members, and his brokerage clients, at prices ranging from $14.30 to $14.42 per share.  On February 11, 2003, IBC announced a reduction in its estimates for earnings during fiscal year 2003 from $1.30 per share to $0.90 to $0.95 per share.  On that day, the price of IBC stock fell from $13.64 per share to $10.22 per share.

The Court entered temporary restraining orders restraining and enjoining Heyman and Heyman International from violations of the registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The Court also entered orders to freeze the assets of Heyman, Heyman International and Heyman International investor funds wherever located, among other emergency relief., The Commissions Complaint alleges that from at least June 2001 to the present, Heyman raised at least $10 million from approximately 150 investors through the unregistered offer and sale of securities issued by Heyman International in the form of Depository Agreements.  According to the Commissions Complaint, Heyman represents to investors in the Depository Agreements that: he has access to certain proprietary high yield depository accounts, and trading programs in the United States and elsewhere; investor funds will be deposited in these accounts to increase the overall yield of the accounts and that, as a result, investors will earn a minimum of 10% per month on their principal investment.  Heyman also represents in the Depository Agreement that investor funds are fully refundable. The Commissions Complaint alleges that, in reality, Heyman is operating a Ponzi scheme by using investor funds to pay previous investors their monthly returns and to pay his personal expenses.  The Commissions Complaint alleges that Heyman has used at least $1.3 million of investor funds to pay personal expenses, including several luxury cars and lavish trips.  The Complaint also alleges that Heyman invested at most a de minimus amount of investor funds and that Heyman International does not have sufficient funds in its bank accounts to repay investors as represented in the Depository Agreement., The Complaint seeks orders of preliminary and permanent injunction enjoining Heyman and Heyman International from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Householder, a resident of Park Ridge, Illinois.  The indictment charged Householder with three counts of mail fraud (18 U.S.C. §§ 1341 and 1346) for defrauding his investment advisory clients.  According to the indictment, Householder devised and conducted a scheme to defraud his advisory clients by making false and fraudulent representations and material omissions to them concerning, among other things, his use of the funds they invested with him, the risks involved in the investments he proposed, and the expected return on these investments.  According to the indictment, Householder then converted advisory client funds to his own benefit, resulting in losses to his clients of approximately $1.5 million.  , In June 2002, the Commission filed a civil complaint against Householder and four related entities in connection with the conduct alleged in the indictment.  In its complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, the Commission alleged that from 1991 through March of 2000, Householder acted as investment adviser for a number of his accounting clients.  The complaint alleged that Householder recommended that his clients allow him to manage their investments, and that they purchase securities through him and his accounting firm, Householder Accounting Services, Inc.  In making these recommendations, Householder made misrepresentations and omitted to state material facts to his clients concerning, among other things, the existence of the entities in which his clients were investing, his use of their fund, and the risks involved in these investments.  The complaint further alleged that after getting his clients to invest, Householder misappropriated their investments.  The complaint also alleged that Householder committed fraud through Apex Equity Advisors, Inc., a separate investment advisory firm run by Householder.  Householder conducted risky trading on behalf of a mutual fund that violated restrictions on trading set forth in the funds offering materials, resulting in the loss of all of the funds assets.  The Commissions complaint further alleged that Householder, Apex Capital Management Corporation, another investment advisory firm formed by Householder, and Apex Limited Partnership, sold Apex L.P. securities without disclosing material facts about Householders disciplinary history.  The Commissions complaint requested, among other relief, an order enjoining the defendants from further violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, disgorgement of misappropriated funds, and appropriate civil penalties.  In this civil action, the Honorable Blanche M.

At the time the Commission filed its complaint, Nathanson was continuing to raise funds from investors in at least two of his schemes.  The first of Nathansons schemes involved selling securities in a golf equipment company he controls, Giant Golf Co., which purportedly was preparing to conduct an IPO.  The second scheme was a Ponzi scheme involving several funds that would purportedly purchase air time to air Giant Golfs infomercials.  In the third scheme, according to the complaint, Nathanson sold investment interests through the Nathanson Investment Trust in a purported unnamed software company that he claimed would soon be bought-out by a larger, unnamed, company.  Finally, the complaint alleges that Nathanson sold securities in a company known as Millennium Technical Group that Nathanson said would exploit certain FCC licenses purchased in 1994.  The Commission alleges that in these four schemes, the defendants lied to investors regarding how they would use the investor funds.  The complaint alleges that without the investors knowledge or consent, Nathanson commingled the investors monies, and used the commingled funds to operate both the unprofitable defendant businesses and his other various unprofitable businesses. , Additionally, the Commissions complaint alleges that since February 2001, Nathanson used at least $1 million of investor funds to support his extravagant lifestyle, including three homes and payment of $346,500 in gambling-related debts.

Without admitting or denying the allegations of the Complaints, Zar, Rivard and Kaplan each consented to a permanent injunction and officer and director bar, as described more fully below., Specifically, the Commissions complaints allege as follows:, Through the conduct of certain members of CA management, including Zar, Rivard and Kaplan, CA engaged in a practice in which CA held its books open after the end of each quarter and improperly recorded, in that elapsed quarter, revenue from contracts that had not been finalized and executed before the expiration of the quarter (the Extended Quarters practice). CA personnel sometimes concealed the Extended Quarters practice by using licensing contracts that falsely bore preprinted signature dates for the last day of the quarter that had just expired, rather than the subsequent dates on which the contracts actually were executed., As a result of this improper practice, CA made material misrepresentations and omissions about its revenue and earnings in Commission filings and other public statements for at least FY2000. For the First, Second, Third and Fourth Quarters of FY2000, respectively, at least 18%, 33%, 26% and 7% of CAs reported quarterly revenues pertained to contracts not executed by CA or the companys clients by the quarters end.  For all quarters of FY2000 combined, CA prematurely recognized over $1.4 billion in revenue from at least 116 contracts that the client or CA signed after the quarter close., CAs FY2000 reported revenues and earnings per share appeared to meet or exceed the consensus estimates of Wall Street analysts, but CA failed to disclose that those reported results improperly included prematurely recognized revenue and did not comply with GAAP. When CA refrained from recognizing revenue prematurely during the First Quarter of FY2001, the company missed its earnings estimate and CAs stock price dropped over 43% in a single day., The Commission further alleges that, among other things:, Zar, as CFO, helped orchestrate CAs improper revenue recognition in FY2000 by directing the improper extensions of fiscal quarters, and by signing and overseeing the preparation of CAs Forms 10-Q and 10-K while aware that those filings reported revenue improperly under GAAP. Zar also backdated his own signature on a large customer contract and authorized the backdating of other contracts., Rivard, as head of Sales Accounting, allowed CA to record revenue from contracts in prior quarters while aware that the contracts were executed later, knew that CA customers were backdating signatures on contracts, and actually backdated his own signature on some contracts., Kaplan, as a Divisional Vice President and the head of Financial Reporting, oversaw the preparation of CAs financial statements for inclusion in its Forms 10-Q and 10-K while aware that those statements included revenue from backdated contracts in violation of GAAP., Zar, Rivard and Kaplan also each misled CAs outside auditors regarding the existence of CAs Extended Quarters practice., In its lawsuits, the Commission seeks judgments: (a) permanently enjoining Zar, Rivard and Kaplan from violating, and aiding and abetting violations of, the securities laws; (b) requiring Zar, Rivard and Kaplan to disgorge their ill-gotten gains together with prejudgment interest; (c) imposing civil money penalties; and (d) barring Zar, Rivard and Kaplan from acting as officers or directors of any publicly held company., Concurrently with the filing of the Commissions complaint, Zar, Rivard and Kaplan, without admitting or denying the allegations of the Complaint, each consented to entry of a permanent injunction prohibiting them from violating Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder, and from aiding and abetting any violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13.  They each also consented to a permanent bar from serving as an officer or director of a publicly held company.  Litigation against Zar, Rivard, and Kaplan with respect to the Commissions claims of disgorgement and penalties is continuing., The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the United States Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter.

Moskowitz, United States Judge for the Southern District of California, granted the Commissions motion for a preliminary injunction in its emergency action to halt an ongoing multi-million dollar securities fraud.  The Commission filed its complaint on March 11, naming San Diego-based Global Money Management, L.P., (GMM) an unregistered private hedge fund, LF Global Investments, LLC (LF Global), which operated GMM, and Marvin I. Friedman, 65, of La Jolla, California, who controlled both entities.  The Commissions complaint alleges that the defendants grossly overstated the assets of GMM to investors., In addition to issuing a preliminary injunction against GMM, LF Global, and Friedman, the court issued orders freezing the assets of the defendants, prohibiting the destruction of documents, and ordering an accounting from Friedman.  The court also appointed Charles LaBella as the permanent receiver over GMM and LF Global.  Investors may obtain information about the receivership at www.gmmreceiver.com or by calling 619-696-9200., The Commissions complaint alleges that since 1993, the defendants have sold, in an unregistered offering, limited partnership interests in GMM, a purported private hedge fund that invested in securities, such as stock and stock options.  While the amount of money actually raised is not known, Friedman has told investors at various times over the last several months that the hedge fund held assets ranging from $60 million to over $100 million.  GMMs brokerage records, however, show that, since at least December 2002, the securities it holds have been worth no more than $11 million.  In addition, Friedman touted his investment experience but failed to inform investors about his disciplinary history, including that he has been barred from association with any member of the NASD. , The Commissions complaint alleges that GMM, LF Global, and Friedman violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and, as to LF Global, Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and, as to Friedman, that he aided and abetted those violations of the Advisers Act.  In addition to the emergency relief described above, the Commission seeks, from each defendant, permanent injunctions, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18666.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Breckenridge, a former registered representative with Suncoast Capital Group, Ltd.  The Commission had charged Breckenridge with defrauding New York Life Insurance Company, Inc. by giving commission kickbacks, gifts, and gratuities to a former New York Life employee.  In exchange, the former New York Life employee directed securities trades on behalf of New York Life to Breckenridge, at prices that favored Suncoast Capital to the detriment of New York Life.  Breckenridge consented to the final judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint.  The judgment permanently restrains and enjoins Breckenridge from violating or aiding and abetting violations of antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The judgment orders Breckenridge to pay $236,562 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest and deems that $190,000 is satisfied by Breckenridges payment of that amount to New York Life.  The remainder of Breckenridges disgorgement obligation shall be deemed satisfied upon payment of restitution in the amount of $136,394 to New York Life, as ordered against Breckenridge in a parallel criminal case, U.S. v. Deborah Breckenridge, 01 Cr. 248 (JGK).  Previously, Breckenridge had pleaded guilty to criminal charges of securities fraud arising from the same scheme.  In the criminal proceeding, in addition to the restitution order, Breckenridge was sentenced to eighteen months in prison., Today, the Commission also instituted and settled administrative proceedings against Breckenridge.  Breckenridge consented to an order, based on the entry of final judgment against her in the Commissions civil enforcement action and on her prior criminal conviction, barring her from association with any broker or dealer. , With this settlement, the Commission has concluded this action against four of the five original defendants, each of whom also was criminally convicted for the underlying conduct.

Case No. 04-20654-CIV-LENARD (S.D. Fla.  March 19, 2004)</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) announced that on April 15, 2004 it filed a complaint and obtained a temporary restraining order (TRO) and other emergency relief against Spear &amp; Jackson, Inc., an OTC Bulletin Board company headquartered in Boca Raton, Florida, and its CEO Dennis P. Crowley.  The SECs complaint charges that for the last two years, Crowley has been secretly selling Spear &amp; Jackson stock through brokerage accounts in the name of nominee companies based in the British Virgin Islands.  To date, Crowleys illegal sales of Spear &amp; Jackson stock total more than $3 million.  At the Commissions request, Judge Donald P. Middlebrooks of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida also issued an Order temporarily barring Crowley from serving as an officer or director of any public company, and appointing a Corporate Monitor to oversee Spear &amp; Jacksons affairs., According to the Commissions complaint, Spear &amp; Jackson is a household tool manufacturer and distributor with over 750 employees and operations around the world.  For its fiscal year ended September 30, 2003, Spear &amp; Jackson had revenues of more than $90 million, with a majority of those revenues coming from the United Kingdom and other European countries., The Commissions complaint alleges that over the past two years, Crowley has orchestrated a pump-and-dump scheme to manipulate the share price of Spear &amp; Jackson stock.  Starting in 2002, Crowley, along with an Orlando, Florida-based stock promoter, defendant International Media Solutions (IMS), and IMS two principals, defendants Yolanda Velazquez and Kermit Silva, used false information to tout Spear &amp; Jackson stock to registered representatives and broker-dealers around the country.  Between January 2002 and July 2003, Spear &amp; Jacksons stock price increased from $2 to $16 per share. , Crowley profited from that increase in Spear &amp; Jacksons stock price by selling stock that he secretly held in the names of nominee companies.  According to the Commissions complaint, Crowley used nominee companies based in the British Virgin Islands illegally to obtain over 1.2 million shares of Spear &amp; Jackson stock during 2002, some of which he obtained through the filing of a fraudulent Form S-8 registration statement.  The Commissions complaint alleges that during the time that Crowley and IMS promoted Spear &amp; Jackson shares, Crowley sold almost 650,000 of these shares, realizing over $3 million in profits.  Crowley also transferred some of the illegally obtained Spear &amp; Jackson shares to IMS, which sold them for approximately $1.6 million., The Commissions complaint also alleges that Crowley has committed at least one similar scheme in the past.  In 2001, the Commissions complaint alleges, Crowley secretly gained control of another public company.  According to the Commissions complaint, that company issued over 1.4 million shares of its stock to the offshore nominee companies that Crowley controlled, which were sold for over $450,000 in profits., In addition to the temporary officer and director bar and order appointing a Corporate Monitor for Spear &amp; Jackson, the Court issued an order, among other things:  (a) temporarily enjoining the defendants from violating the antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws; (b) freezing the assets of all of the defendants (except Spear &amp; Jackson) and of the offshore nominee companies and certain other companies that Crowley controls; (c) requiring the defendants (except Spear &amp; Jackson) to repatriate assets held abroad; (d) and requiring Crowley, Velazquez, and Silva to surrender their passports and prohibiting them from traveling outside the United States., The complaint charges violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), 17(a) and 17(b) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(d), 16(a), and 15(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5,  12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-14, and 16a-3 thereunder.  As final relief, the Commission seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of all ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest; civil penalties, and against Crowley a penny stock and officer and director bar and against Velazquez and Silva, a penny stock bar., The Commission wishes to thank the National Association of Securities Dealers and the British Virgin Islands Financial Services Commission for its assistance in this investigation.  The Commissions investigation is continuing., The Commission also announced that earlier in this matter, it filed a subpoena enforcement action against Silva.  That action, which the Commission filed on March 19, 2004, alleged that pursuant to a subpoena issued on January 29, 2004, Silva was obligated to appear for testimony before the Commission staff on numerous occasions between February 20, 2004 and March 17, 2004.  On each of those occasions, however, Silva chose not to appear, and instead informed the Commission staff, through counsel, that he would need extensions of the testimony dates.  The last of those requests for an extension occurred just days before his scheduled testimony date. ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18668.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Fla.)(JIC)</h2>]","[On April 16, 2004, the Commission filed a Complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida against defendants John Surgent, Barry Abrams, Warren Hemedinger, Scott Piccininni, Paul Tahan, Robert Vitale, Mark Chavez, Sal Puccio, and Victor A. Lessinger in connection with a fraudulent pump-and-dump manipulation of the stock of Orex Gold Mines Corporation (Orex) between March and July 1999. , The Commissions Complaint alleges that between March and July 1999, the defendants used false promotional materials and classic boiler-room tactics to sell approximately $6 million of Surgents unregistered Orex securities.  According to the Complaint, defendants Surgent, Abrams, and Hemedinger were all associated at the time with Orex, which claimed to be in the business of extracting gold from iron ore by means of an environmentally safe process.  The Complaint further alleges that Surgent, a recidivist securities law violator and disbarred attorney, controlled the majority of Orex stock and -- together with Abrams and Hemedinger -- created and distributed promotional materials that falsely portrayed Orex as an active, established mining company with mines and a revolutionary gold extraction process.  In truth, the Complaint alleges, Orex neither owned any mines nor possessed any mining equipment.  Moreover, the gold extraction process that formed the cornerstone of the Orex promotional campaign had never been tested or implemented on a commercial basis. , The Complaint further alleges that defendants Piccininni, Tahan, Chavez, Puccio, and Vitale (the Preferred brokers), operated a brokerage boiler room from the Pompano Beach, Florida office of Preferred Securities Group, Inc., a broker-dealer registered with the Commission.  The Complaint alleges that the Preferred brokers agreed to sell Surgents Orex stock to unsuspecting investors through Preferred, in exchange for a share of the Surgents profits.  According to the Complaint, the Preferred brokers employed abusive sales practices and fraudulent misrepresentations to pressure customers to purchase Orex.  The Complaint alleges that defendant Lessinger, Preferreds president,  opened the Pompano Beach branch office, authorized the Preferred brokers to solicit transactions in Orex, and personally approved numerous transactions in Orex securities.   According to the Complaint, the Preferred brokers also routinely failed to provide customers with the disclosures and documents required by the penny stock disclosure rules of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act).  Preferred brokers ultimately sold approximately $3 million in unregistered Orex securities - and transactions in Orex stock grew to account for at least 50% of the business of the entire Pompano Beach branch office. , The Complaint alleges that the defendants scheme drove the price of Orex stock from $1.50 per share to more than $7.50 per share over the course of three months, after which the price abruptly collapsed to just pennies a share.  Between the Preferred boiler room and other means, the Complaint alleges, Surgent sold over 1 million Orex shares for a total gross profit of approximately $6 million., The Commissions Complaint alleges that by engaging in the foregoing conduct, (1) defendants Surgent and Abrams violated Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the Securities Act), Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5; (2) defendant Hemedinger violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5; (3) defendants Piccininni, Tahan, Chavez, Puccio, and Vitale violated Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act, and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, and aided and abetted violations of Section 15(g) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 15g-2, 15g-4 and 15g-5; and (4) Lessinger, as a control person (pursuant to Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act) violated Sections 10(b) and 15(g) of the Exchange Act, and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 15g-2, 15g-4 and 15g-5, as well as NASD Conduct Rule 3010 (the NASDs Failure to Supervise rule). , The Commission seeks final judgments against the defendants that permanently enjoin them from further violations of the federal securities laws, bar them from participating in any penny stock offerings, and require them to pay to civil penalties and disgorgement (with prejudgment interest thereon).   In addition, the Commission seeks officer and director bars against Surgent, Abrams, and Hemedinger.     , Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions Complaint, Piccininni and Tahan have consented to entry of final judgments against them that permanently enjoin them from violating Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5 - and also enjoin them from aiding and abetting violations of Section 15(g) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 15g-2, 15g-4 and 15g-5.  If approved by the Court, the Final Judgments against Piccininni and Tahan will also permanently bar them from participating in any penny stock offerings., In addition, without admitting or denying the SECs findings, defendants Piccininni and Tahan have agreed to Commission administrative orders that permanently bar them from association with any registered broker or dealer, based on the federal district courts anticipated entry of injunctions against them.  Piccininni and Tahan were previously convicted in a related criminal proceeding, in part from their conduct at Preferred, sentenced to terms of incarceration, and ordered to pay $5 million and $4,040,000, respectively, in restitution.  In light of the criminal sanction and restitution order previously imposed against defendants Piccininni and Tahan, the Commission did not seek to impose disgorgement or civil penalties against them., Finally, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions Complaint, defendant Abrams consented to entry of a final judgment against him that would permanently enjoin him from violations of Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, permanently bar him from participating in any penny stock offering, and permanently bar him from acting as an officer or director of any public company.  The proposed Final Judgment also orders Abrams to pay disgorgement of $50,000, plus prejudgment interest thereon, but waives payment of those amounts based on his demonstrated inability to pay., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18669.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18669.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The Order preliminarily enjoins the Defendants from violating the anti-fraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws in connection with a $10 million Ponzi scheme.  The Order also continues the asset freeze and other ancillary relief previously ordered by the Court on April 5, 2004, upon the Courts grant of the Commissions Ex Parte Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order and Other Emergency Relief., The Commissions Complaint in this action alleged that from at least 2001 to the present, Heyman raised at least $10 million from approximately 150 investors through the unregistered offer and sale of securities issued by Heyman International.  Heyman represents to investors that as a result of investments that he makes, investors will earn a minimum of 10% per month on their fully refundable principal investment.  The Commissions Complaint alleges that, in reality, Heyman is operating a Ponzi scheme by using investor funds to pay previous investors their monthly returns and to pay his personal expenses.  The Commissions Complaint alleges that Heyman has used at least $1.3 million of investor funds to pay personal expenses, including several luxury cars and lavish trips.  The Complaint also alleges that Heyman invested at most a de minimus amount of investor funds and that Heyman International does not have sufficient funds in its bank accounts to repay investors as Heyman represented., The Order preliminarily restrains and enjoins Heyman and Heyman International from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

STANSON</i>, Civil Action No. 04 CIV 02 989 (MBM) (S.D.N.Y.)</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed civil fraud charges against Vincent P. Iannazzo and Milton E. Stanson (Defendants) for engaging in a fraudulent scheme to manipulate the public trading market for stock issued by Emex Corporation (Emex).  At the time of Defendants fraud, Emex essentially was a start-up company with no established operating business.  Its two main subsidiaries claimed to be focused on developing innovative technologies for exploiting energy resources, and on mining gold and other metals and minerals.  Defendants carried out the scheme, which operated from at least October 2000 through April 2001, in their roles as founders, directors and major shareholders of Emex.,  The Commissions complaint, filed in the United States  District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that Iannazzo, 46, and Stanson, 79, violated various antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  As alleged in the complaint, Defendants devised and orchestrated a scheme to artificially inflate Emexs stock price by causing Emex to issue a series of false or materially misleading press releases as well as a false or materially misleading year 2000 Annual Report.  Iannazzo and Stansons illegal efforts were meant to deceive the investing public and others about the technology, financial prospects and value of Emex.  , According to the complaint, in August 2000 Iannazzo and Stanson acquired a public shell corporation they soon named Emex, into which they placed the assets of certain of their private investments.  Those investments included a company purportedly focused on developing innovative technologies for exploiting energy resources, in particular the conversion of natural gas to diesel fuel and other marketable products using a gas-to-liquids (GTL) technology..  , The complaint alleges that shortly after acquiring Emex, the Defendants caused the company, in several of its press releases and its annual report, to make false or materially misleading statements about the status of its  GTL technology and the significance of a related financing agreement.  Among other things, Emex announced that it possessed a commercially viable proprietary GTL technology, and that the company was ready to build a commercial plant utilizing that technology with a $100 million financing proposal it had obtained through the efforts of Credit Suisse First Boston.  In fact, Emexs technology only was at the developmental stage and never had been proven to be commercially viable.  Furthermore, Emexs financing agreement was with Fieldstone, Inc., a small investment bank whose name Emex intentionally omitted from its public statements on the subject while highlighting that of Credit Suisse First Boston, a much larger and well-known investment bank.  In addition, due to various contingencies, Emex had little prospect of raising any money under its financing agreement with Fieldstone.  Therefore, despite Emexs representations to the contrary, the company had neither the technology nor the money to build a commercial plant. , The complaint further alleges that during April and May 2001 Emexs stock price increased dramatically as a result of Defendants fraudulent activities.  Then, after publication of a May 23, 2001 news article that questioned the veracity of Emexs public statements, trading in Emex stock was halted.  On May 30, 2001, the day trading in Emex stock was resumed, the companys stock price closed down more than 40%.  A week later, Emexs stock price had dropped by another 50%, and from there it continued to slide.  Emex currently is in the process of liquidating its assets in Chapter 7 bankruptcy.  , The Commissions complaint charges Iannazzo and Stanson with violations of  Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and aiding  and abetting violations of Sections 10(b) and 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20 and 13a-1 thereunder.  The Commission seeks to enjoin Iannazzo and Stanson from committing future violations of these provisions, to compel them to pay monetary penalties, and to bar Iannazzo and Stanson from serving as officers or directors of any public company in the future.  The Commission also seeks to compel Mr. Stanson to pay disgorgement of his ill-gotten gains, with prejudgment interest thereon., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18671.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18671.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Mann and Notwell were ordered jointly and severally to pay restitution to investors in the schemes in the amount of $8,162,743.  Manns sentence is identical to the sentence previously imposed on Pete J. Buffo, the third principal actor in the scheme., Mann, Notwell, and Buffo have consented to entry of injunctions in a civil case filed by the Commission concerning Capital Acquisitions and a companion scheme known as Laser Leasing.  The injunctions prohibit future violations of the registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Commissions case and the criminal cases alleged that Mann, Notwell, and Buffo raised approximately $33 million from nationwide offers and sales of securities in the schemes.  Investors were told that the money would be used to finance acquisition of properties to produce oil and gas and to purchase and lease eye laser surgery machines, but instead the defendants used most of the investor proceeds to make interest payments to earlier investors and to finance other ventures that Mann or Buffo controlled., For further information on this case, see Litigation releases <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17889.htm>17889</a> (December 10, 2002), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17757.htm>17757</a> (September 30, 2002), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr16400.htm>16400</a> (January 5, 2000), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr16083.txt>16083</a> (March 9, 1999), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr15868.txt>15868</a> (September 2, 1998), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr15670.txt>15670</a> (March 13, 1998), and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr15601.txt>15601</a> (December 23, 1997).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18672.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"
18673,2004,"[<h2>U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</h2>, <h2>Litigation Release No. 18673 / April 22, 2004</h2>, <h2><i>Securities and Exchange Commission v. Alfred S. Teo, Sr., et al.</i><br/>
Civil Action No.  CV 04-1815 (WGB)</h2>]","[NEW YORK  The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it filed securities fraud charges against Alfred S. Teo, Sr., and ten of his relatives, friends and colleagues who collectively received approximately $1.8 million in illicit profits from insider trading in the securities of Musicland Stores Corporation (Musicland) and C-Cube Microsystems, Inc. (C-Cube).  Teo, a major Musicland shareholder, learned about a proposed tender offer for Musicland, and then purchased Musicland stock on the basis of this information prior to the companys public announcement of the acquisition on December 7, 2000 (Musicland Announcement).  Teo also tipped eight other defendants with this information, who then purchased Musicland stock prior to the Musicland Announcement.  Additionally, Teo and two other defendants filed false Forms 13D with the Commission that materially understated their ownership of Musicland stock, so that Teo could continue to buy Musicland stock, but avoid triggering Musiclands poison pill.  By making these secret purchases of Musicland stock, and then subsequently selling these shares, Teo made approximately $22 million in illicit profits.  Teo also engaged in insider trading in the securities of C-Cube.  Teo, a director of Cirrus Logic, Inc. (Cirrus), which had been negotiating to take-over C-Cube, misappropriated material, non-public information about C-Cube and then purchased C-Cube stock shortly before C-Cube announced on March 26, 2001 that it had agreed to be acquired by another company (C-Cube Announcement).  Teo also tipped another defendant with this information, who then purchased C-Cube stock prior to the C-Cube Announcement.  , The Complaint named the following as Defendants:<br/>, The Complaint alleges the following:, Teo (i) engaged in insider trading in securities of Musicland Stores Corporation (Musicland) and tipped other defendants who also traded, (ii) engaged in insider trading in securities of C-Cube Microsystems, Inc. (C-Cube), and (iii) failed to file required reports and made false and misleading disclosures in reports filed with the Commission concerning the true extent of his ownership and control of Musicland stock., On December 7, 2000, Musicland announced that it would be acquired by another company through a tender offer.  The price of Musicland stock rose more than 30% following the announcement.  As the largest shareholder of Musicland, Teo had learned of the acquisition through several confidential communications with Musicland senior management during the fall of 2000.  After learning of the tender offer, but before it was publicly announced, Teo purchased 45,000 shares of Musicland stock.  Teo sold those shares after the announcement and realized a profit of approximately $185,275.  Teo also tipped defendants Teren Seto, Reir, Fortune, Lauzon, Phil Sacks, Herron, Rosen and Ross (and Fortune then tipped defendant Johnston), all of whom purchased Musicland stock prior to the announcement.  Collectively, Teos tippees realized profits in excess of $1.1 million., On March 26, 2001, C-Cube announced that it would be acquired by another company.  The price of C-Cube stock rose more than 40%.  Teo learned before the announcement that C-Cube was discussing a potential merger because he was a director of Cirrus Logic, Inc. (Cirrus), one of the companies that was discussing acquiring C-Cube, and Teo attended confidential Cirrus board meetings at which a potential acquisition was discussed.  After learning of a potential acquisition of C-Cube, but before it was announced, Teo purchased 35,000 shares of C-Cube stock.  Teo sold these shares after the announcement and realized a profit of approximately $180,012.  Teo also tipped defendant Mitchell Sacks, who also purchased C-Cube stock prior to the announcement and realized profits of approximately $115,155., Teo also engaged in securities fraud by failing to file required reports and by making false and misleading disclosures in reports filed with the Commission concerning the extent of his ownership and control of Musicland stock.  For instance, Teo, the MAAA Trust (a trust for Teos children), and Teren Seto, as the MAAA Trusts sole trustee, filed Schedules 13D that falsely under-reported the number of shares of Musicland stock that Teo owned and controlled.  Teo sought to conceal the true extent of his ownership and control of Musicland stock in order to avoid the risk of triggering Musiclands shareholder rights plan, or poison pill.  Teo thereby concealed his purchase of nearly 6 million shares of Musicland stock above the poison pill trigger.  Teo thereafter sold those shares realizing a profit of approximately $22 million., The Commission charged violations of Sections 10(b), 13(d), 14(e) and 16(a) of the Securities Exhange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13d-1, 13d-2, 14e-3, and 16a-3 thereunder.  The Commission seeks the following relief from the defendants: (a) permanent injunctions; (b) disgorgement of all illicit profits; (c) civil penalties; and (d) and officer and director bars against Teo and Rosen.  The Commission filed its complaint in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey., The Commission also announced that it reached settlements with Fortune, Johnston and Rosen.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions Complaint, Fortune Johnston and Rosen each consented to final judgments that permanently enjoined them, ordered them to disgorge their illicit profits plus prejudgment interest, and imposed a civil penalty equal to the illicit profits they obtained.  Rosen also agreed to the entry of an order barring him from serving as an officer or director for five years., The Commission expresses its appreciation to New York Stock Exchange, Inc. for their assistance in the investigation of this matter., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18673.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18673.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Lyons (Lyons) with offering to sell Bear Stearns &amp; Co. (Bear Stearns) and three other financial institutions a fraudulent foreign bank guarantee for $200 million that Lyons claimed would be worth $220 million in one year.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins Lyons from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and imposes a $25,000 monetary penalty on Lyons. , The Commissions complaint alleges that in September 2002, Lyons, operating through SV Group, approached a senior managing director at Bear Stearns - where Lyons had previously been employed as a broker - to sell Bear Stearns a purported zero coupon bank guarantee note for $200 million, saying it would be worth $220 million one year after its purchase.  Lyons provided Bear Stearns with documentation describing the purported bank guarantee and the transaction that Lyons claimed he and his associates would coordinate in order for Bear Stearns to obtain a bank guarantee issued by a third party.  Lyons had obtained the offering materials and other information that he provided to Bear Stearns from a network of individuals and entities located in Europe.  Despite significant training and experience in the financial services industry, Lyons failed to conduct any type of independent inquiry into the purported bank guarantees or into the individuals and entities that claimed that they could furnish them.  In fact, the investment opportunity that Lyons offered to Bear Stearns did not exist. , The Commissions complaint further alleges that during the time that Lyons, through SV Group, were offering the bank guarantee to Bear Stearns and the three other financial institutions, SV Group was not registered with the SEC or the NASD as a broker-dealer and Lyons was associated with an unregistered broker-dealer.   , For more information about prime bank frauds, visit the SECs Prime Bank Information Center at <a href=/divisions/enforce/primebank.shtml>http://www.sec.gov/divisions/enforce/primebank.shtml</a>.

Glick, a former director of both MetroWest Bank and Banknorth Group, Inc., and four of his associates  Arthur H. Freedman, Jeffrey S. Epstein, Steven T. Moore and Romeo J. Pendolari  for illegal insider trading in three publicly-traded Massachusetts banks  MetroWest Bank, Medford Bancorp and Warren Bancorp.  Without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, Glick, Freedman, Epstein, Moore and Pendolari consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The defendants also agreed to pay a total of over $437,000 in disgorgement of trading profits, prejudgment interest and civil penalties, and Glick consented to a permanent bar from serving as an officer or director of any publicly-traded company. , The Commissions complaint alleges that in May 2001, Glick, then a director of MetroWest, learned that MetroWest would potentially be acquired.  Shortly thereafter, Glick tipped Freedman, Epstein and Moore to the acquisition and directly or indirectly caused five other individuals to buy MetroWest stock prior to the public announcement of the acquisition of MetroWest by Banknorth.  According to the Commissions complaint, Glicks tippees and the other individuals then purchased a total of 33,140 shares of MetroWest stock.  On June 11, 2001, Banknorth announced it was acquiring MetroWest, causing MetroWests stock price to rise by $1.47, or approximately 15% from its price per share at the close of the market the prior day.  The Commissions complaint alleges that Glicks tippees and the others whom he caused to buy MetroWest stock profited by approximately $100,000., According to the Commissions complaint, Glick became a director of Banknorth after it acquired MetroWest.  On or about June 6, 2002, Glick learned at a Banknorth board meeting that Medford was seeking to be acquired, and that Banknorth was interested in potentially acquiring Warren.  The Commissions complaint alleges that Glick thereafter caused another individual to purchase 3,900 shares of Medford stock and 10,000 shares of Warren stock.  Glick also tipped Pendolari to inside information concerning the potential acquisition of Warren.  According to the Commissions complaint, Pendolari subsequently purchased 800 shares of Warren stock for himself and caused another individual to purchase 1,100 shares of Warren stock.  Glick also illegally purchased a total of 43,700 shares of Warren stock for himself, but sold those shares prior to Banknorths August 8, 2002 public announcement that it would be acquiring Warren.  After the announcement on June 13, 2002 that it was going to be acquired by another bank, Medfords stock price rose $5.37, or approximately 18% from its price per share at the close of the market the prior day, and the individual who Glick caused to buy Medford stock profited by $32,211.  Banknorths August 8, 2002 announcement that it was going to acquire Warren caused Warrens stock price to rise by $4.08, or approximately 35% from its price per share at the close of the market the prior day, and Pendolari and the two individuals who Glick and Pendolari caused to buy Warren stock profited by a total of $43,769., The Commissions complaint alleges that Glick breached fiduciary duties he owed to MetroWest, Medford, Warren and/or Banknorth when he disclosed material, nonpublic information to Freedman, Epstein, Moore and Pendolari, and when he caused others to buy MetroWest, Medford and Warren stock while he was in possession of material, nonpublic information concerning those companies.  According to the Commissions complaint, Freedman, Moore, Epstein and Pendolari each breached the duty they assumed to MetroWest, Warren and/or Banknorth when they purchased stock, and in certain instances, caused others to buy stock. , In its complaint, the Commission charged Glick, Freedman, Epstein, Moore and Pendolari with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, based on their illegal insider trading.  Glick, Freedman, Epstein, Moore and Pendolari have each consented to entry of final judgments enjoining them from violating these antifraud provisions.  Glick has also agreed to be permanently barred from serving as an officer or director of any publicly-traded company.  In addition, Glick has consented to pay a civil penalty in an amount equal to the trading profits of all individuals who he tipped and directly caused to buy stock (a penalty of $165,875.25).  Glick also agreed to pay disgorgement of $98,823.50 and prejudgment interest of $10,555.82 for the trading profits of the individuals (other than Freedman, Epstein, Moore and Pendolari) whom he directly caused to buy stock.  For their part, Freedman, Epstein, Moore and Pendolari each agreed to pay disgorgement of their respective trading profits plus prejudgment interest (and in the case of Epstein and Pendolari, also the trading profits of those whom they caused to buy stock while they were in possession of material, nonpublic information).  Freedman, Epstein, Moore and Pendolari also each agreed to pay a civil penalty equal to their respective trading profits (and in the case of Epstein and Pendolari, also equal to the trading profits of those whom they caused to buy stock while they were in possession of material, nonpublic information).

The Commission alleged in its complaint that Lefebvre, RMO and others participated in a fraudulent offering of securities that raised at least $40 million from investors in July 2002.  In the default judgments, the Honorable Jeffrey S. White permanently enjoined Lefebvre and RMO from future violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and ordered them to pay over $6 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest and civil penalties.  In addition, on March 31, 2004, the Court released to investors in excess of $13 million in frozen assets that the Commission alleges was fraudulently obtained by Lefebvre, RMO and other defendants.  The court had originally frozen the assets in August 2002 at the Commissions request to protect them from dissipation or misappropriation by certain defendants., The Commission alleged in its complaint that Lefebvre, acting through RMO and another company, falsely promised investors exorbitant returns, such as a 100% return per week, through a fraudulent prime bank trading program.  The complaint further alleged that, in the span of several weeks in July 2002, Lefebvre and others spent at least $4 million in investor funds on personal and luxury items such as cars, jewelry, and large hotel bills., In its order granting the Commissions motion for default judgment against Lefebvre and RMO, the Court found that Lefebvre made intentional misrepresentations to investors by falsely stating that he was federally-licensed to trade financial institution instruments, and by knowingly misappropriating investor funds for his own personal gain.  The Court further found that the actions of Lefebvre, as RMOs agent and acting on RMOs behalf, are imputed to and thus impose liability on RMO.  For that misconduct, the Court permanently enjoined Lefebvre and RMO from committing further violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws [Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder].  The Court found that the appropriate disgorgement liability for Lefebvre and RMO is $5,473,487 (plus prejudgment interest), which is equal to the amount of investor funds that was disbursed from an account under the direct control of Lefebvre and RMO.  In addition, the Court imposed civil penalties of $250,000 each against Lefebvre and RMO.

The Court further ordered Garian to pay a civil money penalty in the amount of $120,000 based on his fraudulent conduct.

According to the complaint, between 1997 and mid-2001, Garian, 42, of Van Nuys, California, and Glendale-based NIE raised over $20 million from about 200 investors.  Most of the investors Garian and NIE targeted were residents of Glendales large Armenian-American community, many of whom had never invested in the stock market, and some of whom were Armenian immigrants for whom English was a second language.  Garian falsely told investors that he would use their money to purchase various securities for their accounts; had an inside line to upcoming hot IPOs, particularly for Internet and other technology-related companies; and could deliver large profits quickly.

Gaughan, United States District Court Judge for the Northern District of Ohio, on March 11, 2004, granted the Commissions motion for summary judgment and permanently enjoined Frank D. Gruttadauria, the former Cleveland broker, and two entities that he created to facilitate his fraud from violating certain antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  Judge Gaughan also ordered Gruttadauria to disgorge monies he misappropriated and compensation he received during the fraud.  Gruttadauria is presently in federal custody serving a seven-year jail term.  The Commissions lawsuit was filed in February 2002, alleging that Gruttadauria had defrauded scores of his customers over a fifteen-year period.  The Commission also alleged that Gruttadauria misappropriated millions of dollars and sent falsified account statements that, at the time the fraud ended in January 2002, overstated the actual holdings in customer accounts by over $280 million.  , In her March 11 Order, Judge Gaughan found that, from 1987 through January 2002, Gruttadauria engaged in a massive scheme to defraud many of his customers.  The court found that, among other things, Gruttadauria lied to customers about purchases and sales of securities in their accounts, falsely told customers that he used the funds deposited into their accounts to buy securities, and created false customer account statements that reflected account values far in excess of their actual balances.  Judge Gaughan also found that, to disguise his fraudulent scheme, Gruttadauria misappropriated funds from the accounts of some customers to meet withdrawal requests from other customers.  Judge Gaughan permanently enjoined Gruttadauria and two entities he created, DH Strategic Partners, Inc. and JYM Trading Trust, from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Court also ordered Gruttadauria to disgorge the monies that he misappropriated, totaling almost $105 million, and $20.8 million in compensation (salaries, bonuses, and commissions) that he received from his employers while committing his fraud.

Tyler charging him with securities fraud and wire fraud.  The indictment charges Tyler with deceiving his clients in connection with the offer and sale of securities.  It is anticipated that Tyler, a former stockbroker, will surrender to federal authorities in Dallas within the next week., Previously, the Commission filed a civil suit against Tyler on February 11, 2002.  In its complaint, the Commission alleged that Tyler raised at least $30 million from investors, and personally realized over $5.2 million in undisclosed commissions, by fraudulently enticing more than 480 mostly elderly investors into purchasing investments issued by his company, Advanced Financial Services, Inc. According to the complaint, Tyler deceived the elderly investors with false guarantees about the investments liquidity, above-market interest rates and fixed maturity dates. Tyler used investors funds to buy viaticals, which rendered the guarantees false because viaticals are illiquid investments with no fixed maturity dates and uncertain rates of return.

Renert, formerly of Wilton, Connecticut and against Hawthorne Sterling &amp; Co., an unregistered investment adviser controlled by Renert.  The judgment was entered in a civil enforcement action the Commission filed in June 2001 alleging that Renert, the owner and control person of Hawthorne, was the architect of a $22 million fraudulent offering of interests in unregistered offshore mutual funds.  The Commission alleged in its complaint that from at least June 1997 through June 2000, Renert and Hawthorne induced more than 700 investors in 49 states and more than 100 investors overseas to purchase interests in 30 entities known as the Hawthorne Sterling Family of Funds.  According to the complaint, Renert and Hawthorne misrepresented via the Internet, offshore seminars and a network of sales agents that the funds would invest in bank debentures, which in this case, were fictitious prime bank instruments.  The Commission also alleged that the Renert and Hawthorne failed to disclose that Renert used fund assets to engage in day  trading in Internet stocks, losing at least $2.2 million, and to fund a mortgage on one of Renerts homes. , The judgment against Renert and Hawthorne permanently enjoins both from violating the anti-fraud provisions of the securities laws, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act); Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  The judgment also enjoins both Renert and Hawthorne from violating Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act and Section 7(d) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, which prohibit unregistered offerings.  , The Court also held Renert and Hawthorne jointly and severally liable to pay $717,276 (representing profits gained as a result of conduct alleged in the complaint) plus prejudgment interest of $117,264, for a total disgorgement of $834,540.

Reid, a Canadian businessman, for causing Firepond, Inc., a software development company formerly based in Waltham, Massachusetts, to materially misstate its financial results for two quarters in 2002.  The Commissions complaint alleges that in January and April 2002, Reid caused Firepond to make these material misstatements by fabricating license agreements with three purported customers of the software developer, forging signatures and correspondence, and engaging in an elaborate scheme with confederates and impersonators to prevent Firepond from discovering his wrongdoing.  Earlier today, Reid was arrested on federal criminal charges involving the same conduct charged in the Commissions complaint and made an initial appearance in federal court in Buffalo on the criminal charges.  Prior to his appearance, an indictment presented by the U.S. Attorneys Office for the District of Massachusetts and returned by a federal grand jury sitting in Boston was unsealed., According to the Commissions complaint, Reid, who was acting vice president of North American sales at Firepond for much of the relevant period, conducted several sales meetings on behalf of Firepond with Bombardier, Inc., a large equipment manufacturer based in Montreal, Canada.  Although the sales meetings stalled and Bombardier never purchased Firepond software, on December 19, 2001, Reid provided Firepond management with a purported executed license agreement between Firepond and Bombardier worth approximately $3.5 million in revenue.  According to the Commissions complaint, Reid had forged the name of a high-level Bombardier executive to the agreement.  Reid was paid over $156,000 in commissions for the forged Bombardier deal.  The Commissions complaint also alleges that Reid used similar methods to create forged contracts with two other Firepond customers.  Firepond is now headquartered in Minnesota., In its Complaint, the Commission further alleged that, due to Reids deception, Firepond filed materially misleading financial statements for the two fiscal quarters ended January 31, 2002 and April 30, 2002 and issued misleading press and earnings releases, all of which reported results that included revenue and other information from the agreements Reid had falsified. The Commissions complaint alleged that Reids conduct violated certain provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder.

Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, Noe, Paschal, Alelov and Kaplan consented to the entry of the final judgments, which permanently enjoin them from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws., In the Complaint filed on February 14, 2002, the Commission alleged that Noe and his brother, Clif Goldstein, used two entities that they controlled along with Kaplan --  Great American Trust Company and Great American Trust Corporation -- to operate a fraudulent high-yield investment scheme that targeted both cash-poor companies unable to obtain funding through conventional means, and individual investors who desired to earn high investment returns quickly.  Noe and Goldstein served as the primary offerors of the investment programs that comprised the fraudulent scheme, while Paschal and Alelov served as selling agents.  As a result of their efforts, the defendants raised more than $1.1 million from more than 20 individuals., The final judgments permanently enjoin Noe, Paschal, Alelov and Kaplan from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  On the basis of their representations in sworn financial statements and other documents and information furnished to the Commission, payment of disgorgement by Noe, Paschal, Alelov and Kaplan was waived and civil penalties were not imposed., On the same day that the final judgments were entered, the Court also granted the Commissions motion to dismiss the case against defendants, Goldstein and Russell B.

ROLLERT (United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, No. 01-Civ.-10237-JLT(D.Mass)</h2>]","[The Commission announced that, on March 30, 2004, Gordon J. Rollert, the former principal of registered investment advisers Sage Advisory Services LLC and Standard Asset Group, L.P., was enjoined, by consent, from violations of the antifraud and false filing provisions of the federal securities laws and ordered to pay $50,000 disgorgement., In February 2001, the Commission charged Rollert, of Wellesley, Massachusetts, with defrauding one of his clients, the Pakachoag Church of Auburn, Massachusetts, of approximately $900,000 between 1993 and 1997.  In its Complaint, the Commission alleged that Rollert used his investment advisory firm, Sage Advisory Services, LLC, and its predecessor, Standard Asset Group LP (collectively Sage), to misappropriate hundreds of thousands of dollars in soft dollar credits generated by securities transactions made on the Churchs behalf in an account that Rollert set up at a Boston-area broker-dealer.  It also alleged that Rollert fraudulently induced the Church to invest $250,000 in Rollerts advisory firm., The Complaint alleged that as part of the scheme to misappropriate soft dollar credits, Rollert submitted invoices to the broker-dealer for payments with soft dollars that had been generated by trading in the Churchs account.  Many of the invoices that Rollert submitted were in the name of FA Partners, a shell entity that Rollert controlled, and falsely indicated that FA Partners had provided services to Sage that were payable with soft dollars.  The broker-dealer paid FA Partners based on these false invoices.  Rollert personally picked up these payments from the broker-dealer and deposited them into bank accounts that he controlled.  He then withdrew the majority of the funds for his personal use.  The Commission alleged that the Church was not informed that its soft dollars were being used for Rollerts personal benefit., Soft dollar credits are created when an investment adviser and a broker-dealer enter into an arrangement in which a percentage of commissions are used to pay for products and services, such as research, that help the adviser in making investment decisions.  Because soft dollar credits are generated by commissions paid by the advisory client, they are assets of the client. Soft dollar arrangements are permissible under the securities laws if there is appropriate disclosure to the client about the products and services for which the soft dollars will be used, as well as disclosure that the client may pay higher commission rates as a result of the soft dollar arrangement., The Complaint also charged that Rollert churned the Churchs endowment account to generate additional soft dollar credits, which he then misappropriated, and that Rollert fraudulently offered and sold to the Church at least $250,000 in securities in the form of equity interests in and promissory notes offered by Sage and its predecessor.  Finally, according to the Complaint, Rollert failed to disclose his soft dollar practices in Form ADV amendments filed with the Commission by Sage., Rollert was enjoined from violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 207 of the Advisers Act.  In addition, he was ordered to pay $50,000 disgorgement, with additional amounts waived and penalties not assessed based on his financial condition., In July 2001, Sage was ordered to pay an additional $304,852 in disgorgement and interest in a related Commission administrative proceeding.  In October 2002, Rollert pled guilty to mail and wire fraud charges in a related criminal action.  In December 2002, Rollert was criminally sentenced to pay an additional $100,000 in disgorgement, was fined $15,000, and ordered to serve six months of home confinement.  In January 2003, Rollert was barred by the Commission from association with any investment adviser on the basis of his criminal conviction., For further information, see Litigation Release Nos. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr16895.htm>16895</a> (Feb. 8, 2001), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17764.htm>17764</a> (Oct. 2, 2002), and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17900.htm>17900</a> (Dec. 17, 2002) and Advisers Act Rel.

(California Amplifier),  engaged in accounting fraud and insider trading.  Specifically, the Complaint alleges that Kusatzky caused California Amplifier to materially overstate income and equity in its quarterly and annual financial statements for the period November 27, 1999 through November 25, 2000, by hiding $7.8 million in Company expenses.  Kusatzky accomplished this fraud by fabricating financial statements and falsifying the Companys books and records.  Kusatzky also concealed his fraud by presenting false records to California Amplifiers auditors., According to the Complaint, in January 2000, before his fraud was discovered, Kusatzky illegally profited from his misdeeds.   At that time, with full knowledge of his wrongdoing, Kusatzky exercised all his vested options and sold all his 15,000 shares of California Amplifier stock while in possession of material, non-public information that the Companys earnings were materially overstated.  The Complaint alleges that at the time of his insider sales, Kusatzky knew that California Amplifiers earnings for the quarter ended November 27, 1999 were materially overstated because he was solely responsible for overstating them.  Kusatzkys illegal sales enabled him to avoid losses of over $350,000.  The Complaint also alleges that in March 2001, on the day before the Companys annual audit was to begin, Kusatzky confessed to his fraud.   In a handwritten note provided to Company officials, Kusatzky admitted to hiding expenses and to making California Amplifiers P+L look better.  The Complaint alleges that Kusatzkys confession neither revealed the extent of his misstatement of California Amplifiers financial statements, nor acknowledged his insider trading.  , The Complaint alleges that Kusatzky violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the Securities Act), Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder, and aided and abetted California Amplifiers violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.  The Complaint seeks a permanent injunction prohibiting future violations of these provisions, disgorgement, including prejudgment interest, and civil penalties pursuant to Sections 21(d)(3) and 21A of the Exchange Act, and Section 20(d)(1) of the Securities Act.  The Commission also seeks an order barring Kusatzky from serving as an officer or director of a public company., In a related proceeding, on April 29, 2004, the Commission issued a settled Order against California Amplifier.  The Order finds that during fiscal 2000 and much of fiscal 2001, California Amplifier failed to establish or maintain internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that its financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  This lack of adequate internal controls allowed Kusatzky to commit fraud, caused the failure of the company to discover that Kusatzky was not a CPA. as he had represented, resulted in books and records that failed to accurately reflect the companys transactions, caused numerous other accounting errors, and caused California Amplifier to file materially false and misleading periodic reports with the Commission.  The Order requires that California Amplifier cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.

The Commission alleges that the defendants, who have raised at least $60 million to date, lured elderly victims to workshops with the promise of a free lunch and then bilked them out of their retirement money by purporting to sell them safe, guaranteed notes.  The Commission coordinated its investigation with the United States Postal Inspection Service, the California Department of Corporations, and the Riverside County District Attorneys Office, which late yesterday executed criminal search warrants at the defendants offices in Hemet, Brea and Pasadena and at Heaths and OBriens homes.  Also yesterday, U.S. District Judge John F. Walter of the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California issued orders freezing the defendants assets., The Commissions complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, alleges that the defendants fraudulently induced at least 803 elderly investors nationwide to invest in PCM notes that purportedly pay a guaranteed return of 5.5% to 8% per year.  The defendants claim that investor funds will be used to make secured loans to businesses.  The defendants also represent that independent IRA administrators conducted due diligence on the PCM Notes and that either investors will be repaid their principal at maturity, or they may redeem all or part of their investment before maturity, subject to a 10% penalty.  Finally, the defendants claim that PCM and the PCM Fund are California entities., According to the complaint, these representations are false.  There is no evidence that there are any secured loans.  The PCM Notes also are not liquid because the defendants have failed to promptly return investor funds.  The complaint further alleges that some investors have had to threaten to file, or actually filed, lawsuits against the defendants to get back their money.  Nor is it true that IRA administrators have conducted due diligence.  Finally, there is no record that either PCM or the PCM Fund are California legal entities., In its lawsuit, the Commission obtained an order freezing the assets of all defendants (except OBrien), an accounting, an order preventing destruction of documents, an order expediting discovery, and an order temporarily enjoining all of the defendants from future violations of the securities registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

(May 14, 2003)</h2>]","[On April 28, 2004, the Honorable Harry Lee Hudspeth, Senior United States District Court Judge for the Western District of Texas, entered a Final Judgment against Dean S. Thomassen (Thomassen) for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  In its Complaint filed on May 14, 2003, the Commission alleged that for almost two years, from August 1998 to May 2000, Thomassen made repeated fraudulent misrepresentations on the Internet for the purpose of manipulating the stock price of at least nine microcap companies.  According to the Complaint, Thomassen sent numerous fraudulent unsolicited spam e-mail messages touting the stock and business prospects of each of the companies.  Using several aliases, the Complaint further alleged, Thomassen also posted false and misleading information about these microcap companies on the Silicon Investor and Raging Bull websites.  The Complaint alleged that, after the dissemination of the false information, the stock price and trading volume of many of the issuers increased significantly in the short term.  According to the Complaint, on three occasions, Thomassen quickly sold his personal stock holdings in these companies into the resulting inflated market.  The Complaint alleged that through his trading in the issuers stocks, Thomassen realized illegal profits of $8,302, which constituted a return on his original investment of between 32% to 132%, depending upon the particular stock., Thomassen, without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions Complaint, consented to entry of the Final Judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and permanently bars him from any future participation in the offering of penny stocks, under Section 603 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.  The Final Judgment also orders disgorgement of $8,302, but waives such amount, and waives civil penalties and prejudgment interest based on Thomassens sworn statement of financial condition.

No. (May 4, 2004).</h2>]","[On May 4, 2004, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas, against Michael W. Gullion, the former board chairman and chief executive officer of Gold Banc Corporation, Inc.  Gold Banc is a Kansas-based bank holding company listed on the NASDAQ.  The complaint alleges Gullion, 49, of Leawood, Kansas, misapplied $4.4 million in Gold Banc funds to his personal benefit by circumventing Gold Bancs internal controls and falsifying its books and records, with the result that Gold Banc materially misstated its operating results.  Gullion, who has since reimbursed Gold Banc, has offered to settle the SECs claims against him by consenting to pay a $100,000 civil penalty, and also to the entry of district court orders permanently enjoining him from future violations of the securities laws and barring him from serving as an officer or director of a publicly-held company., According to the SECs complaint, Gullions misappropriations involved two separate schemes.  Most egregiously, in connection with the purchase of land for a suburban bank location, Gullion diverted two checks, in November 2000 and April 2001, respectively representing $1 million and $900,000 in Gold Banc funds, into his personal brokerage and banking accounts. Second, from January 1998 to December 2002, Gullion received an approximate $2.5 million in unauthorized extensions of credit by Gold Banc., The $1.9 million Gullion misappropriated in connection with the real estate purchase was not booked as an expense during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2000 and 2001, or during the quarter ended June 30, 2001.  Consequently, Gold Banc overstated its income and earnings in the Forms 10-K that it filed with the SEC for 2000 and 2001, and also overstated its income in the Forms 10-Q that it filed for the second and third quarters of 2001.  Gullion signed those periodic filings.  Gullion also signed the October 2002 registration statement for a $49.3 million offering of Gold Bancs common stock, and a December 2001 registration statement for an offering of common stock to company employees in connection with Gold Bancs 401(k) plan, both of which incorporated the misstated financials., The SECs complaint alleges that Gullion violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder, and that he aided and abetted violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Gullion made an offer of settlement in which he consented to the entry of an order of permanent injunction against violations of the above-specified provisions of the federal securities laws, the payment of a $100,000 civil money penalty, and a bar against serving as an officer or director of a publicly held company.  , Additionally, the SEC instituted settled cease-and-desist proceedings against Gold Banc, based on its violations of the recordkeeping, reporting and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws, which Gullion caused. The SEC found that Gullions misappropriations in connection with the land purchase caused Gold Banc to make material financial misstatements, and that internal control deficiencies caused Gold Banc to fail to prevent, detect or correctly account for Gullions misapplication of corporate funds., Without admitting or denying the findings made by the SEC, Gold Banc consented to the entry of an order which requires the company to cease and desist from violating Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.  The SEC agreed to settle with Gold Banc on the above terms based on the remedial acts promptly undertaken by Gold Banc, and the cooperation afforded the SECs staff.  Immediately after discovering Gullions misconduct, Gold Banc initiated an internal inquiry, alerted shareholders to its inquiry, terminated Gullion, obtained re-payment from Gullion for his misappropriations, implemented or strengthened various internal controls, and issued financial restatements., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18691.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18691.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

White (White), formerly President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chairman of the Board of Directors of Informix Corporation, consented to a final judgment permanently enjoining White from violating, or aiding and abetting violations of, Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act); Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2; and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act).  Separately, White pleaded guilty on December 18, 2003 to one count of criminal securities fraud in an action brought by the Office of the United States Attorney for the Northern District of California based on some of the same facts underlying the Commissions civil action.  White is scheduled to be sentenced in the criminal matter on May 12, 2004., The Commission instituted this action against White in November 2002 and filed its Amended Complaint today.  In its Amended Complaint, the Commission alleges that White concealed secret side agreements to software licensing contracts on which Informix had improperly recognized revenue in its financial statements for its fiscal year ended December 31, 1996.  To further his scheme, White made false statements and representations concerning the existence of these secret side agreements to members of Informixs financial staff and to Informixs independent auditors.  White did this to avoid triggering a restatement of Informixs 1996 financial statements.  When the side agreements were discovered, Informixs Board of Directors forced White to resign.  Informix ultimately restated its 1996 financial statements to reflect substantial decreases in its earnings and income caused by, among other things, discovery of the side agreements White concealed and various other side agreements.  Informixs amended 1996 Form 10-K revealed that, instead of earning net income of $97.8 million as Informix originally reported, Informix suffered a net loss of $73.6 million in 1996.  According to the Amended Complaint, White violated, or aided and abetted violations of, antifraud, reporting, and record-keeping provisions of the Securities Act and Exchange Act.  White consented to the final judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions Amended Complaint. , The civil and criminal actions against White are the result of investigations by the Commission, the Office of the United States Attorney for the Northern District of California, and the San Francisco office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation., Previously, the Commission instituted and simultaneously settled an administrative proceeding against Informix.

The Commission also obtained a permanent injunction prohibiting Ofstedahls further violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In January 1999, Ofstedahl engaged in illegal insider trading when he tipped insider information in advance of Adaptecs pre-announcement of positive earnings to his friend and dentist, Robert Rutner.  The penalty was imposed on April 30, 2004 by Judge James Ware of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California following a one-day bench trial.  Previously, Ofstedahl had stipulated to the entry of a judgment of liability on the Commissions insider trading claims.  Ofstedahl had also entered a guilty plea, and been sentenced, for obstructing the Commissions investigation into Dr. Rutners trading., The Commissions complaint filed on July 31, 2002 alleged that in January 1999, Ofstedahl learned that Adaptec planned to pre-announce its preliminary third-quarter earnings for the 1999 fiscal year, which exceeded analysts estimates.  On the morning of January 6, 1999, Ofstedahl tipped information about the pre-announcement to Rutner pursuant to their earlier agreement to share profits that Rutner might make by trading on inside information.  Rutner in turn tipped William Kuncz, Rutners friend and business associate, who also traded in Adaptec securities.  Following Adaptecs release of the pre-announcement on January 6, 1999, Rutner realized profits of $648,936 on his Adaptec trading, while Kuncz gained $26,013., In settlement of the Commissions insider trading charges against them, Rutner and Kuncz have paid the Commission a total of $1,167,047.87 in disgorgement of unfair profits, penalties and interest.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18693.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

According to the Commission, the company lured investors into a fraudulent Ponzi scheme by guaranteeing profits of over 36% per year, and at times promising to double investors money within a year., The Commissions complaint, filed in federal district court in San Francisco, alleges that Chicago D&amp;P fraudulently represented that it would use investor funds to acquire real estate that would generate safe and phenomenal returns.  Instead, the companys founder and president, 57-year-old Emeryville, California resident Patricia Pat Morgen, diverted hundreds of thousands of dollars to personal use.  According to the Commissions complaint, the defendants fooled investors into thinking the investment was profitable by making regular payments of supposed investment returns; in actuality, the money came from new investors.  , An order issued by Judge Charles R. Breyer Tuesday morning freezes all funds and assets controlled by Chicago D&amp;P and Morgen, as well as those of Morgens 27-year-old son Shalom Gibson, of Berkeley, California, who is alleged to have controlled various bank accounts into which Morgen siphoned investor funds.  The Commission reported to the court that, immediately after receiving subpoenas from the Commission over the weekend, Gibson and Morgen attempted to withdraw $300,000 of investors funds in cash and cashiers checks, a move blocked by the court order., Based on the evidence presented by the Commission, the Court issued an order temporarily freezing all of Chicago D&amp;Ps, Morgens, and Gibsons funds and providing other emergency relief.

This is the first known disciplinary action brought by the Institute based on a complaint by the Commission and is the result of cross-border cooperation between the Commission and the Institute on this auditor oversight matter.  Moore Stephens consented to an order of a severe reprimand, a fine of £35,750 ($67,450) and the payment of costs of £5,330 ($10,056).  Stewart consented to an order that includes a reprimand, a fine of £3,000 ($5,660) and the payment of costs of £ 600 ($1,132).  The disciplinary actions resulted from Stewarts and the firms conduct with respect to the issuance of an unqualified audit report, dated July 28, 1997, on the consolidated financial statements of the Cronos Group for the year ended December 31, 1996, to the effect that the firm had conducted its audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards (GAAS) in the United States, when this was not the case. , On July 2, 2002, based on the conduct described above and other conduct, the Commission in an administrative proceeding found that Stewart and two other auditors at the firm of Moore Stephens engaged in improper professional conduct within the meaning of Rule 102(e)(1)(ii) of the Commissions Rules of Practice and denied Stewart the privilege of practicing before the Commission as an accountant, but provided that he may request that the Commission consider his reinstatement after one year, and censured the two other auditors.

Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, Dinh consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws., In the Complaint filed on October 9, 2003, the Commission alleged that Dinh orchestrated a scheme to dispose of his large position in out of the money options to sell the common stock of Cisco Systems, Inc.  On July 11, 2003, Dinh surreptitiously accessed and took control of the online brokerage account of a Massachusetts investor and placed buy orders in that account corresponding with sell orders he previously placed through his own brokerage account.  As a result, Dinh avoided approximately $37,000 in losses he would have otherwise incurred had the options expired worthless in his account.  While carrying out his scheme, Dinh took great pains to conceal his identity and evade detection, including assuming various online aliases, using multiple e-mail accounts, and employing foreign Internet service providers and several anonymizing websites., The final judgment permanently enjoins Dinh from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In light of the fact that full restitution was paid in a related criminal action, disgorgement was waived.  In addition, on the basis of Dinhs representations in sworn financial statements and other documents and information furnished to the Commission, a civil penalty was not imposed., In a related criminal action prosecuted by the U.S. Attorneys Office for the District of Massachusetts, Dinh also was sentenced on May 5, 2004 to 13 months of imprisonment, to be followed by three years of supervised release.  Additionally, a $3000 fine and an $800 special assessment were imposed.

(May 4, 2004)</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that on May 3, 2004, it filed an emergency federal civil action seeking to halt an alleged billion dollar fraudulent securities offering affecting 29,000 investors worldwide.  This action was filed against defendants Mutual Benefits Corp. (MBC), Joel Steinger, his brother, Leslie Steinger, and Peter Lombardi (collectively the defendants).  MBC is headquartered in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida.  The SECs action includes a civil complaint and also a contempt motion against the Steingers.  In 1998, the Steingers were enjoined from violating the federal securities laws in connection with their activities at MBC., On May 4, 2004, the Honorable Federico A. Moreno, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Florida, entered, among other things, a temporary restraining order, a freeze of the defendants assets and an order appointing a receiver over MBC. , The SECs complaint alleges that the defendants raised over $1 billion from more than 29,000 investors through a fraudulent, unregistered offering of securities in the form fractionalized interests in viatical and life settlements.  A viatical or life settlement is the sale of a life insurance policy by a terminally-ill person or senior citizen (the viator) at a price discounted from the face value of the policy.  Investors pay the premiums and receive the face value of the life insurance policy when the insured, or viator, dies.  In turn, the viator receives a portion of the proceeds of his life insurance policy as a lump sum.  , According to the SECs complaint, MBC promised investors fixed returns ranging from 12% to 72%, depending upon the term of investment chosen by the investor.  The life expectancy figure determined for each viator was a key factor in determining the maturity date of the investment, the rates of return to investors and the amount of funds needed to be escrowed for payment of future premiums on the policies.  , In its complaint, the SEC alleges that in raising money for its enterprise, MBC falsely represented to numerous investors that its life expectancy figures were the product of a review by an independent physician.  The SEC further alleges that MBC failed to disclose that about 65% of its outstanding life insurance policies were sold to investors using fraudulent life expectancy figures generated by MBC.  Moreover, the SEC alleges that MBC omitted to tell investors that more than 90% of its policies have already surpassed their assigned life expectancy.  According to the SECs complaint, as a result of the failure of these older policies to mature, shortfalls in escrowed premium funds have forced MBC to effectuate a premium payment scheme similar to traditional Ponzi schemes, whereby the company is paying premium obligations of specific investors with monies escrowed for future obligations of other investors.  , The SECs complaint also contends that the defendants failed to disclose to investors that Joel Steinger and Leslie Steinger both played key roles in the management of MBCs operations and its securities offering.  Furthermore, the complaint alleges that investors were not being told that at least $26 million in funds collected in MBCs offering was paid to the Steingers and their relatives in the form of consulting fees.  , The SECs complaint charges the defendants with violating the anti-fraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws.  Specifically, the Commission alleges that defendants MBC, Joel Steinger, Leslie Steinger and Peter Lombardi violated Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, thereunder.  The Commission also alleges that defendants Joel Steinger and Leslie Steinger, as control persons of MBC, violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5, thereunder.  In addition to the emergency relief described above, the complaint seeks permanent injunctions prohibiting future violations of the securities laws, disgorgement, and civil penalties., Also named in the SECs action as relief defendants are Viatical Benefactors, LLC, Viatical Services, Inc., Kensington Management, Inc., Rainy Consulting Corp., Twin Groves Investments, Inc., P.J.L. Consulting, Inc, SKS Consulting, Inc. and Camden Consulting, Inc.  , In addition to its civil complaint, the SEC filed an emergency contempt action against defendants Joel Steinger and Leslie Steinger for disobeying a prior final judgment of permanent injunction entered against them on May 6, 1998 in  <i>SEC v. Joel Steinger and Leslie Steinger</i>, Civil Action 98-6442-CIV-MIDDLEBROOKS (S.D.Fla. 1998).  In that previous action, the SEC charged defendants Joel Steinger and Leslie Steinger with fraud and securities violations arising out of their roles in MBCs offering as it stood at that time.  In that case, the Steingers were permanently enjoined from violating the registration and anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws and paid $850,000 in disgorgement, plus prejudgment interest, and $50,000 each in civil money penalties., In simultaneous filings, the State of Floridas Department of Financial Services-Office of Insurance Regulation filed an emergency cease-and-desist order against MBC suspending MBCs license to operate as a viatical settlement provider in and from the state of Florida, and the State of Floridas Office of Statewide Prosecution issued a 16 count criminal information against MBC., The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the following federal and state agencies: the State of Floridas Department of Financial Services-Office of Insurance Regulation, the U.S. Department of Homeland Securitys Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the State of Floridas Office of Statewide Prosecution, the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA), and the state securities regulatory agencies for Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Vermont and Virginia. , <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18698.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>, <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18698.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Hill, age 40, the former General Counsel of Inso Corporation, Inc. (later known as eBT International, Inc.), a now defunct software company headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, was named in a nine count superseding indictment charging him with securities fraud, wire fraud, false statements to accountants and perjury in connection with a Commission investigation.  The charges against Hill were added to a previously existing indictment returned in November, 2003 that charged Graham Marshall, age 56, formerly of Lexington, Massachusetts, with securities fraud, wire fraud, circumventing internal accounting controls and perjury in connection with a Commission investigation.  If convicted, Hill and Marshall each face penalties that range from 5 to 20 years= imprisonment on each count of the indictment, to be followed by 3 years of supervised release and fines up to $1 million., The superseding indictment alleges that at the end of September 1998, Marshall, then-vice president of Inso, arranged a sham transaction whereby a Malaysian software distributor signed a purchase order for roughly $3 million, upon assurances that Inso would actually sell the software to another customer within a few days or weeks.  It is alleged that at the end of 1998, Hill, then-General Counsel of Inso, played a pivotal role in arranging a series of deals that were designed to create the appearance that the Malaysian software distributor had paid Inso $3 million for the software products that Inso had reported as sold during the third quarter of 1998.  The indictment charges that Hill arranged for Inso to provide the Malaysian distributor with $4 million in financing for the $3 million payment.  The reported third quarter sale represented roughly 15% of Inso=s quarterly earnings and enabled Inso to meet internal and public targets for revenue growth.  Share prices for Inso=s stock tumbled in January of 1999, when the company publicly announced that it would need to restate its revenues for the first three quarters of 1998. The perjury charges against Marshall and Hill arise from their testimony before the Commission about the transactions with the Malaysian software distributor., On June 21, 2002, the Commission filed related civil enforcement actions against Hill, Marshall and certain other senior officers of Inso.  The Commission=s action against Marshall and Hill remains pending., For more information see Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18467.htm>18467</a> (November 17, 2003), Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18394.htm>18394</a> (October 4, 2003) and Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17578.htm>17578</a> (June 21, 2002).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18699.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Finkelstein, the former chief financial officer of The Warnaco Group, Inc., for aiding and abetting Warnacos violations of the antifraud, issuer reporting, books and records, and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws.  Also on May 11, the Commission filed a settled action for a civil money penalty against PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC), Warnacos former auditors, for aiding and abetting Warnacos violation of the issuer reporting provisions in connection with Warnacos 1998 annual report.  Finkelstein has agreed to pay $189,464 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest and a civil penalty of $75,000 and to be barred for four years from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  PwC has agreed to pay a $2.4 million civil penalty.  In related administrative proceedings, the Commission issued cease-and-desist orders against Warnaco, former chief executive officer Linda J. Wachner, and former general counsel Stanley P. Silverstein, and censured Silverstein and PwC under Rule 102(e) of the Commissions Rules of Practice., The Commissions complaint against Finkelstein alleges that Warnaco issued a false and misleading press release on March 2, 1999, which announced record results for fourth quarter and fiscal 1998, but failed to disclose that Warnaco would be restating its financial results for the prior three years to correct a $145 million inventory overstatement.  In the press release, Warnaco falsely portrayed the inventory write-down as a part of the companys write-off of deferred start-up costs under a new accounting pronouncement.  , The complaint alleges that Finkelstein authorized the issuance of the press release almost immediately after he had participated in two days of meetings during which PwC, Warnacos outside auditors, had insisted over the objections of Warnacos senior management that Warnaco could not write off the inventory overstatement under the new accounting pronouncement.  After the meetings, Finkelstein showed PwC the draft press release and was told that its description of the reason for the restatement was inconsistent with how the restatement would be described in Warnacos upcoming annual report and was urged to consult with counsel regarding the content of the release.  Finkelstein nevertheless issued the press release containing the misleading characterization of the restatement., One month later, on April 2, 1999, Warnaco filed its fiscal 1998 annual report with the Commission.  Although the annual report correctly accounted for the $145 million restatement, it failed to disclose that the true cause of the restatement was an inventory overstatement and incorrectly stated that the restatement resulted from the write-off of start-up related costs.  Finkelstein approved and signed the annual report even though he knew there was no reasonable basis for describing the restatement as involving start-up related costs.  The complaint also alleges that Finkelstein failed to ensure that Warnacos books and records were accurate and that the companys internal controls were functioning properly.  Finally, the complaint alleges that in November 2000, Warnaco improperly offset $190.5 million in cash against long-term debt in order to create the appearance that the company remained in compliance with a key financial covenant.  The offset was not in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles.  Finkelstein directed the offset and signed the misleading quarterly report that Warnaco filed with the Commission., The Commissions complaint against PwC alleges that, during PwCs audit of the financial statements contained in Warnacos fiscal 1998 annual report, PwC had determined that the $145 million inventory overvaluation could not be written off pursuant to Warnacos adoption of the new accounting pronouncement and most likely resulted from a series of internal control deficiencies and accounting errors.  The complaint further alleges that, although Warnacos financial results were accurately reflected in the annual report, PwC failed to object to Warnacos mischaracterization of the inventory overstatement as involving start-up related costs and incorporated the misleading description of the restatement into its own audit report., The Commissions complaint against Finkelstein charges Finkelstein with aiding and abetting Warnacos violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), and 13(b)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13.  Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 are general antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The Commissions complaint against PwC alleges that the firm aided and abetted Warnacos violation of Section 13(a) and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 in connection with the incorrect disclosure in Warnacos fiscal 1998 annual report.  , Finkelstein and PwC have agreed to settle these matters without admitting or denying the allegations in their respective Complaints.  The settlement terms are subject to court approval., Finkelstein has consented to the entry of an order that would enjoin him from future violations of the relevant federal securities law provisions and rules, order him to pay $189,464 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest and a civil penalty of $75,000, and bar him from acting as an officer or director of a public company for four years., PwC has consented to the entry of an order requiring the firm to pay a civil money penalty pursuant to Section 21(d)(3) of the Exchange Act in the amount of $2.4 million.  The Commission also censured PwC for aiding and abetting Warnacos reporting violations in a separate settled administrative proceeding brought under Rule 102(e)(1)(iii) of the Commissions Rules of Practice., In related proceedings, on May 11, 2004, the Commission issued a settled cease-and-desist order against Warnaco for violating the antifraud provisions of the securities laws in connection with the March 1999 press release, and for violating the issuer reporting, books and records, and internal control provisions of the securities laws in connection with the companys annual report for fiscal 1998 and quarterly report for the third quarter of 2000.  Warnaco also agreed to settle additional reporting, books and records, and internal control violations for two restatements the company made in April 2001 and July 2002.  Warnaco agreed to hire an independent consultant to perform a complete review of the companys internal controls and policies relating to its inventory systems, internal audit, financial reporting, and other accounting functions and to adopt the recommendations of the independent consultant within 180 days. , The Commission also issued a settled cease-and-desist order against Warnacos former chief executive officer, Linda J. Wachner, for causing Warnacos violations of the reporting, books and records, and internal control provisions in connection with the fiscal 1998 annual report, and ordered her to pay $1,328,444 in disgorgement of a 1998 bonus amount and prejudgment interest.  The Commission found that at the time she approved and signed the 1998 annual report, Wachner knew or should have known that the restatement of the companys financial results was caused by material flaws in the cost accounting and internal control systems at one of the companys largest divisions and was not related to the write-up of deferred start-up or start-up related costs.  The Commission also found that Wachner knew or should have known that the divisions inventory costing control system was inadequate to ensure the accuracy of Warnacos books and records and failed to ensure that proper internal controls were in place., The Commission also issued a settled cease-and-desist order against Warnacos former general counsel (and current senior vice president and chief administrative officer), Stanley P. Silverstein, for aiding and abetting and causing Warnacos violations of the reporting provisions of the Exchange Act by (i) approving an annual report for fiscal 1998 that he knew or should have known contained a materially inaccurate and misleading description of the reasons Warnaco had made a $145 million restatement of its financial results; and (ii) approving and signing a quarterly report for the third quarter of 2000 that he knew or should have known did not accurately represent Warnacos debt and cash.  The Commission ordered Silverstein to pay $165,772 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest and also censured Silverstein under Rule 102(e)(1)(iii) of the Commissions Rules of Practice., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18701.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a> (PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP), <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18701-2.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a> (William S.

Ozer, and the audit manager, Bradley J. Schmidt, and against the companys former Executive Vice President of Operations, Norman Bruce Cowgill, and Division Manager, Phillip D. Teal.  Styling, now defunct, developed and marketed beauty salon products., Without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions complaint, Ozer and Schmidt consented to the entry of orders permanently enjoining them from further violations of the anti-fraud and periodic reporting provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Sections 10(b) and 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act).  Schmidt was also enjoined from violating the books and records and internal control provisions of the Exchange Act, Sections 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B) and 13(b)(5), and the rules promulgated thereunder.  The Court imposed civil penalties against Ozer in the amount of $50,000, and $30,000 against Schmidt.  In related administrative proceedings, the Commission, on their consent, permanently suspended Ozer from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant and suspended Schmidt with a right to apply for reinstatement after five years., The District Court also entered consent judgments against Cowgill and Teal for violating the statutory provisions described above.  It ordered Cowgill to pay a civil penalty of $30,000, and Teal to disgorge a $10,000 bonus he had received.  The Commission did not pursue a claim for a penalty against Teal based on his cooperation in the Commissions investigation., In its complaint filed in December 2003, the Commission alleged that the principal executive officers of Styling engaged in an extensive financial fraud over a two and one-half year period.  Teal, the complaint charged, repeatedly falsified revenue by booking projected sales for the entire year in the current quarter.  At year-end 1998, purported sales revenue was recognized from the shipment of millions of dollars of product between company-controlled warehouses.  Cowgill, the complaint charged, knew of and approved these year-end transactions.  Stylings former Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer previously settled actions against them with the Commission.  See Litigation Release No. 18485 (December 3, 2003)., The complaint further alleged that in February 1999 -- one month prior to the filing of Stylings 1998 annual report -- Teal  advised company officers, including Cowgill, about the fraudulent sales he had recorded.  Yet the company took no steps to correct the books and records, and falsely reported revenue and income from the fraudulent transactions in public filings with the Commission., Ozer and Schmidt, the complaint charges, recklessly failed to detect the fraudulent sales despite numerous red flags and knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that Stylings public statements concerning a $5.1 million write-off were false and misleading.  The complaint alleges that Stylings auditors therefore failed to ensure that the audit was conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards (GAAS) and recklessly caused their employer Arthur Andersen LLP to render an unqualified audit report on Stylings 1998 financial statements.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18702.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The defendants agreed to the entry of the preliminary injunction.  The Commission alleges that the defendants, who raised at least $60 million, lured elderly victims to workshops with the promise of a free lunch and then bilked them out of their retirement money by purporting to sell them safe, guaranteed notes.  U.S. District Judge John F. Walter of the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California also set a hearing on the Commissions application for appointment of a permanent receiver for May 20, 2004.  , The Commissions complaint, filed on April 28, 2004, in federal court in Los Angeles, alleges that the defendants fraudulently induced at least 803 elderly investors nationwide to invest in PCM notes that purportedly pay a guaranteed return of 5.5% to 8% per year.  The defendants claim that investor funds will be used to make secured loans to businesses.  The defendants also represent that independent IRA administrators conducted due diligence on the PCM Notes and that either investors will be repaid their principal at maturity, or they may redeem all or part of their investment before maturity, subject to a 10% penalty.  Finally, the defendants claim that PCM and the PCM Fund are California entities., According to the complaint, these representations are false.  There is no evidence that there are any secured loans.  The PCM Notes also are not liquid because the defendants have failed to promptly return investor funds.  The complaint further alleges that some investors have had to threaten to file, or actually filed, lawsuits against the defendants to get back their money.  Nor is it true that IRA administrators have conducted due diligence.  Finally, there is no record that either PCM or the PCM Fund are California legal entities., The Courts Order of May 6, 2004, preliminarily enjoins the defendants from future violations of the registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Order also freezes the assets of all defendants (except OBrien), orders an accounting, prevents the destruction of documents, and expedites discovery.

Reed, 58, formerly of Las Vegas, Nevada, were charged by the United States Attorney for the Central District of California in Santa Ana with using the United States mails to perpetrate an oil and gas investment scheme to defraud investors.  Hammonds and Reed, who are currently incarcerated, pleaded guilty to six counts of mail fraud on December 22, 2003. , Reed was sentenced on March 24, 2004 and Hammonds was sentenced on April 15, 2004.  Each defendant was sentenced to 27 months in a federal correctional facility and ordered to serve three years supervised release thereafter.  Reed and Hammonds were also ordered to pay restitution of $1,172,905 jointly and severally.  , In November 2001, Hammonds and Reed, along with two Nevada corporations, Texon Energy Corp. and Lonestar Petroleum Corp., were charged by the Commission with violating the securities registration provisions of the federal securities laws, Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933, and the antifraud provisions, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleged that Reed was Texons president and Hammonds was Texons vice-president, they raised $1.25 million from the sale of Texon stock to about 65 investors nationwide, and investors were promised a dividend of 12% per year on their investment.  The Commissions complaint charged that Hammonds and Reed, through Texon and Lonestar, operated a Ponzi-like scheme in which they paid dividends to existing investors with money raised from new investors.  Texon and Lonestar, without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of the antifraud and securities registration provisions of the federal securities laws.

Roblee, who was the president of Los Angeles-based Premier Marketing &amp; Investments, Inc., is scheduled to be sentenced on September 13.

On January 15, 2003, the Court issued a temporary restraining order as to Roblee and Premier, as well as orders freezing their assets, prohibiting the destruction of documents, granting expedited discovery, and for an accounting.  On January 23, 2003, the Court issued an order preliminarily enjoining Roblee and Premier from violating the registration and antifraud provisions, and continuing the other orders issued on January 15, 2003., In its complaint, the Commission alleged that the defendants had raised about $4.5 million by representing to investors that they would invest their monies in a variety of high-yield investment programs involving, among other things, short-term promissory notes, real estate-related bridge loans, and the purchase and sale of precious metals; that these programs would generate returns of up to 200% per month; and that investor funds would remain at all times in a trust account and never be put at risk.  In reality, Roblee used investor monies to pay for Premiers operating expenses and his personal living expenses, to finance adult film productions and an adult-content website, and to make returns of purported profits and principal to Premier investors., On September 24, 2003, a default judgment was entered against Premier in the Commissions civil action, permanently enjoining Premier from violating the registration and antifraud provisions and ordering it to disgorge $4,497,451 plus prejudgment interest.

JAMES MURPHY, ROBERT LOCKWOOD AND GILBOA PERETZ</i>, Civ. Action No. 00cv11981-PBS (D. Mass., filed September 26, 2000)</h2>]","[The Commission announced today that on April 28, 2004, following a four-day bench trial held in March 2004, the Honorable Patti B. Saris of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts entered judgment in favor of Gilboa Peretz on a finding that he did not have the requisite scienter to aid and abet Centennial Technologies, Inc.s violations of Sections 10(b) and 13 (b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder., The Commission presented evidence that between April 1994 and December 31, 1996, Emanuel Pinez, Centennials former chief executive officer, and James Murphy, Centennials former chief financial officer, with the assistance of Peretz, Robert Lockwood, and others, orchestrated a massive fraud which made Centennial appear significantly more successful than it was.  Among other things, they caused Centennial to recognize revenue from invalid or nonexistent sales, include fake items in inventory, and make false additions to fixed assets.  As a result of these improper activities, Centennial overstated its earnings for this period by approximately $40 million.  Based on this evidence, the Commission previously obtained civil judgments against Pinez, Lockwood and others, by consent, and against Murphy, by summary judgment, and in prior parallel criminal proceedings, Pinez, Murphy, Lockwood and other defendants were criminally convicted for perpetrating the Centennial financial fraud., During trial, Peretz specifically admitted that, at Pinezs instruction, Peretz, the founder of PG Technologies, Inc., a Centennial customer, placed an order with Centennial to purchase 2,500 Flash PC cards at a cost of $500,000, on condition that Pinez provide the funds to pay for the purchase.  Centennial shipped 1,000 blank PC cards to PG and thereafter billed PG $500,000, as if it had sent the company 2,500 real PC cards.  Pinez subsequently provided Peretz $500,000, which Peretz used to pay Centennial for the fictitious sale to PG.  The Commission sought judgment against Peretz for aiding and abetting Centennials violations of §§ 10(b) and 13 (b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder. , The court found that, although Peretz was careless in his financial affairs and perhaps negligent regarding the $500,000 transaction, he did not have knowledge of the fraud at Centennial and did not knowingly provide assistance to Pinez in perpetrating the fraud.  Previously, in a separate proceeding, Judge Saris held Peretz in contempt for lying to the court regarding the source of funds received from Pinez.  52 F.Supp.2d 205 (DMA 1999). , For further information, please see Litigation Release Nos. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17705.htm>17705</a> (8/30/02), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr16725.htm>16725</a> (4/26/00), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr16170.htm>16170</a> (6/2/99), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr15818.txt>15818</a> (7/21/98), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr15605.txt>15605</a> (12/23/97), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr15548.txt>15548</a> (10/31/97), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr15405.txt>15405</a> (7/7/97), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr15399.txt>15399</a> (6/26/97), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr15295.txt>15295</a> (3/14/97) and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr15258.txt>15258</a> (2/14/97).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18706.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

After the merger, he was an officer of Cendant Membership Services, the post-merger name for the former CUC business units, until his resignation from Cendant in April 1998., The Commissions complaint alleged, among other things, that Corigliano, as Controller of CUC, assisted senior CUC officers who initiated the long-running financial reporting fraud and, later, as CUCs Chief Financial Officer, proceeded to orchestrate and refine the fraud.  The complaint further alleges that, as Chief Financial Officer, Corigliano was the CUC officer responsible for creating and maintaining a schedule that CUC officers used to track their fraudulent scheme during the course of each fiscal year.  He was responsible for keeping more senior CUC officers apprised about the progress of the scheme.  While Chief Financial Officer, Corigliano directed CUC mid-level financial reporting managers to make unsupported quarterly top-side adjustments to CUCs earnings as reported in its quarterly Reports on Form 10 Q filed with the Commission.  He also instructed less senior CUC managers to make unsupported journal entries effectuating year-end adjustments that improperly inflated CUCs operating income and earnings as reported in its annual Reports on Form 10 K filed with the Commission.

In carrying out their fraudulent conduct, the defendants violated and circumvented Lucents internal accounting controls, falsified documents, hid side agreements with customers, failed to inform personnel in Lucents corporate finance and accounting structure of the existence of the extra-contractual commitments or, in some instances, took steps to affirmatively mislead them.  In addition, Ackerman, at the time an officer of Winstar, engaged in a scheme with Plunkett that resulted in Lucent improperly recording a $125 million software purchase by Winstar at the end of Lucents fourth quarter of fiscal year 2000., Aversano and Dorn engaged in a pattern and practice of orally granting Anixter International, Inc. and Graybar Electric Company (Lucents top two distributors) certain rights and privileges beyond those contained in their respective distribution agreements with Lucent.  While the specific rights and privileges granted to Anixter and Graybar varied from transaction to transaction, the general nature of the agreements was that if these distributors took the product offered by Lucent they would not get hurt in a given transaction; that Lucent would assist them in moving the product to end-customers; and that Lucent would accept a return of the product if sales to the end-customers did not materialize.  Despite the fact that Aversano and Dorn knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that the verbal agreements entered into in connection with these transactions made revenue recognition improper under GAAP, they nevertheless failed to inform Lucents CFO structure of the existence of those agreements.  Moreover, on some occasions Aversano and Dorn affirmatively misrepresented facts to members of Lucents CFO structure.  In total, Aversano and Dorns fraudulent conduct resulted in Lucent materially overstating its pre-tax income for fiscal year 2000 by approximately 7 percent., In September 2000, Plunkett negotiated, with the assistance of Lucents Winstar sales team members, Harris and Petrini, the sale of $135 million worth of software in a software pool transaction with Ackerman of Winstar.  The software pool arrangement allowed Winstar to select software by September 29, 2001, and Lucent to recognize $135 million in revenue in its fiscal year ending September 30, 2000.  Responding to pressure from Lucents senior management, including Aversano, to recognize revenue, Plunkett reached an agreement with Ackerman in which Winstar would pay Lucent $135 million for the software and the parties would separately document additional elements of the software pool transaction that would give Winstar additional value.  The additional value came in the form of a $35 million credit to be applied to Winstars future purchases, a $45 million credit expected to comprise substantially all the cost of a network integration laboratory for Winstar, and reduced pricing for Winstar on purchases of equipment for building and hub sites (the side agreements).  , To ensure that Lucents accountants would not deduct the value of the side agreements from the $125 million ($135 million less a $10 million properly documented credit) Lucent would recognize on the software pool agreement in September 2000, Plunkett instructed Petrini to draft and post-date three letters documenting the side agreements with fictitious dates in October 2000.  The effect of the post-dated letters was to create the appearance that the side agreements were reached after September 30, 2000 and were not connected to the software pool agreement.  Petrini drafted and post-dated the letters as instructed and Plunkett signed the post-dated letters on September 29, 2000.  Petrini told Harris that Plunkett and Petrini had documented the side-agreements in post-dated letters.  In addition, after receiving an email specifically requesting any information regarding discounts or incentives offered by Lucent to Winstar, Harris, despite knowing of the existence of the side agreements and the true nature of the concessions granted to Winstar, nevertheless failed to disclose the side agreements to Lucents accountants., Ackerman received the three executed post-dated letters on September 29, 2000 and knew that they did not accurately portray the entire software pool transaction.  Nevertheless, Ackerman agreed to Plunketts post-dating of Lucents obligations thereby creating the false appearance that they had been agreed to after September 30, 2000.  Ackerman also counter-signed the letter dealing with reduced pricing on purchases of equipment for building and hub sites.  Ackerman post-dated that letter October 20, 2000 and sent that executed letter back to Plunkett on September 29, 2000.  Petrini, Harris, Plunkett, and Ackerman knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that if the credits and discounts had been properly recorded by Lucent in the same quarter that the software pool agreement was executed, Lucent would not have recognized $125 million on the transaction.  By engaging in such conduct, Ackerman aided and abetted Lucents fraud., In a transaction with AT&amp;T wireless services (AWS) Carter and Hayes-Bullock knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that Lucents recognition of $53 million of revenue and operating income on June 30, 2000, at the end of Lucents third quarter of fiscal year 2000, violated GAAP.  Starting in approximately the summer of 1999, Lucent and AWS began to negotiate a new business model known as Voice Path Pricing (VPP).  Under VPP, AWS would no longer pay Lucent for the individual pieces of equipment that make up a telecommunications network as they had done traditionally (conventional pricing).  Instead, AWS would pay a price for each voice path - in essence pay for each data/voice connection that could be handled on the finished network., While the VPP agreement continued to be negotiated, Carter authorized his subordinates to enter into a verbal agreement with AWS.  Through that verbal agreement, Lucent and AWS agreed that VPP would be retroactively applied to product purchased between April 1, 2000 and the date the agreement was ultimately reached (interim period).  As part of this side agreement, any pricing differential between VPP and conventional pricing for product purchased during the interim period would be adjusted through credits via a true-up process once the VPP agreement was finalized.  In effect, the parties agreed to have VPP commence on April 1, 2000.  Hayes-Bullock, who was the CFO for Lucents AT&amp;T customer business unit, was aware the oral side agreement had been entered into with AWS., During the interim period, Lucent provided AWS with switching equipment valued at $53 million under conventional pricing.  In order to recognize revenue on the switches, Carter instructed his subordinates to obtain a purchase order from AWS for the switches.  AWS provided a purchase order at the end of Lucents third quarter of fiscal year 2000 with the explicit understanding that - in conformity with the original oral understanding - Lucent would provide a credit for the invoiced amount and that AWS would ultimately pay the VPP price for the equipment.  On June 30, 2000, at the end of Lucents third quarter of fiscal year 2000, this switching equipment was invoiced under conventional pricing and Lucent violated GAAP by recognizing revenue and operating income in the amount of $53 million.  Carter and Hayes-Bullock knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that Lucents recognition of the revenue and operating income violated GAAP because the price AWS would ultimately pay for the switches was not fixed and determinable, and Lucent could have no expectation that it would collect $53 million for the switching equipment because the parties had agreed AWS would receive an offsetting $53 million credit.  Carter and Hayes-Bullock also took affirmative steps to mislead Lucents Chief Accountant about the existence and nature of the side agreement with AWS., On September 30, 2000, Lucent and BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc. (BellSouth) entered into a software pooling agreement, called LOA 105, which obligated BellSouth to pay Lucent $95 million by April 1, 2001 for software that it had to select by September 30, 2002.  To induce BellSouth to enter into LOA 105, Bratten agreed to provide BellSouth with a $20 million credit and a 2 percent price discount (valued at $1 million).  Bratten failed to notify Lucents CFO structure that he had agreed to the credit and discount as part of a software pooling transaction.  In addition, on October 10, 2000, Bratten executed a letter to BellSouth that falsely represented that the credit and discount had been granted on that date rather than in September.  The letter was drafted by Elliott, who knew that Bratten had granted the credit and discount in September as an inducement for BellSouth to enter into LOA 105.  As a result of their fraudulent conduct, Lucent violated GAAP by recording the entire $95 million as revenue and operating income, rather than $74 million., Lucent, Plunkett, Harris and Petrini have agreed to settle these matters without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint.  The Commission expects the penalties from the settling defendants to be distributed pursuant to the Fair Fund provisions of Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.  The settlement terms are subject to court approval., Lucent has consented to the entry of a judgment that enjoins it from violations of the anti-fraud, reporting, books and records and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws, (Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-11, 13a-13, and 12b-20 thereunder, and Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act).  Lucent will also pay a $25,000,000 civil penalty and $1 in disgorgement. , Plunkett, Harris and Petrini have each consented to the entry of a judgment that enjoins them from violating the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws and from knowingly circumventing internal controls (Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act), and from aiding and abetting violations of the reporting, books and records and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws (Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-11 and 12b-20 thereunder, and Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act).  Additionally, Plunkett has consented to an order permanently barring him from acting as an officer or director of any public company and payment of a $110,000 civil penalty.  Harris has consented to an order baring her from acting as an officer or director of a public company for five years and payment of a $100,000 civil penalty.  In addition, Petrini will disgorge $109,505, representing profits gained as a result of the conduct alleged in the Complaint, together with prejudgment interest thereon in the amount of $23,487, and pay a civil penalty of $60,000., The seven remaining defendants have not reached settlements with the Commission.  All of these defendants, except Ackerman, have been charged with violating, and aiding and abetting the violation of, the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws and aiding and abetting violations of the reporting, books and records and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws.  The Commission seeks, as to all these defendants, except Ackerman, permanent injunctions against future violations of these provisions of the federal securities, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains (including salaries and other benefits), prejudgment interest thereon and civil penalties.  For Aversano and Carter, the Commission also seeks orders prohibiting them from acting as an officer or director of any public company.  Solely as to Aversano, the Commission also seeks an injunction from future violations of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-2, which prohibits, among other things, making materially false or misleading statements to an accountant in connection with an audit or examination of financial statements that will be filed with the Commission., The Commissions Complaint charges Ackerman with aiding and abetting Lucents violation of the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws and the reporting, books and records and internal control provisions.  The Commission seeks from Ackerman a permanent injunction against aiding and abetting future violations of these provisions of the federal securities laws, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains (including salaries and other benefits), prejudgment interest thereon and civil penalties., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18715.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18715.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Brown, Jr. of the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey entered a consent order (Order) regarding the SECs application to hold New Jersey-based MERL Holdings Inc.com (MERL) in civil contempt (Contempt Motion).  The Contempt Motion alleged that MERL violated the final judgment of permanent injunction (Final Judgment), entered by the Court against MERL on April 3, 2003, which permanently enjoined MERL from violating the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC alleged that MERL violated the Final Judgment by issuing three materially false and misleading press releases.  , MERL, without admitting or denying the allegations against it, consented to the entry of the Order, which found that three of MERLs press releases contained materially false and misleading statements and omissions.  The first press release, issued by MERL on August 1, 2003, announced that MERL had entered into a software licensing agreement with Heritage Capital Credit Corporation.  According to the Contempt Motion, the August 1 press release omitted to state that Heritage was a wholly-owned subsidiary of MERL Financial Group, Inc. which, in turn, was controlled by the same individuals who held a controlling interest in MERL.  The second press release, issued by MERL on September 5, 2003, announced that MERL had received a $50 million financing proposal from a private equity fund.  In fact, according to the Contempt Motion, the private equity fund had withdrawn the financing proposal on August 28, 2003, prior to the issuance of the press release.  Finally, the third press release, issued by MERL on November 10, 2003, announced that the company had signed a $50 million letter of interest.  In fact, according to the Contempt Motion, the investment banking firm that issued the letter of interest had not yet begun its formal due diligence of MERL, and the letter of interest was subject to a number of significant conditions in addition to extensive due diligence.  The November 10 press release described the investment banking firm as an investor, but in fact, according to the Contempt Motion, the firms role was going to be to attempt to raise $50 million among its investors.  This was a best efforts proposal only, meaning that there was no assurance that the investment banking firm could raise all or any portion of the $50 million for MERL.  , In addition, the Order directed MERL to issue a corrective press release within ten days of entry of the Order or it would be subject to a prospective fine of $10,000 for each day that it does not issue the corrective press release.

Of these 285 purchases, Lorain National succeeded in placing the last trade of the day for LNB Bancorp stock on 232 days.  This manipulative trading practice is known as marking the close.  Defendant Smith maintained supervisory roles over Ryan, Falcon and Eschke and knew, or was reckless in not knowing of the marking the close scheme and failed to take timely action to stop the scheme.

Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, Dyer and Oxbow Partners consented to the entry of the Final Judgment, which permanently enjoins them from future violations of the antifraud and securities registration provisions of the federal securities laws, Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Dyer and Oxbow Partners were also ordered to pay disgorgement of $3.96 million, but payment of all but $50,000 was waived and a civil penalty was not assessed based upon the defendants financial condition., The Commissions complaint alleged that from November 1998 to August 2000, Dyer and Oxbow Partners aided and abetted a massive Ponzi scheme perpetrated by Capital Consultants, LLC (CCL), formerly an investment adviser in Portland, Oregon.  The Commission alleged that Dyer and Oxbow Partners helped CCL conceal from its clients the failure of a $160 million loan made by the former investment adviser.  Among other things, Dyer and Oxbow Partners purchased the failed loan from CCL and profited from entering into a series of complex transactions with CCL and two borrowers that resulted in new client funds being used to repay clients invested in the failed loan.  During the scheme, the defendants knew that CCL made misrepresentations to its clients about Dyer and Oxbow Partners role in purchasing the failed loan., The Commissions complaint also charged Dyer and Oxbow Partners with fraud in connection with two securities offerings conducted between April 1999 and November 2000:  Oxbow Capital 1999 Fund I, LLC (Oxbow Fund I) and Washington Motorcycle Partners, LLC (Washington Partners).  The Commission alleged that the defendants failed to disclose to Oxbow Fund I investors that the funds first investment would be in the failed CCL loan.  The defendants also defrauded Oxbow Fund I by purporting to replace the funds investment in the failed CCL loan with securities that the defendants did not own.

The Commission also charges that Caggia violated the recordkeeping, ownership and disclosure, and certification requirements of the federal securities laws., According to the Commissions Complaint, in August 2002, Ocumed filed a Form 10-KSB for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2002 that contained what purported to be an auditor report issued by an independent auditor.  The Complaint alleges that the auditor report was a forgery fabricated to make it appear as if Ocumeds 2002 financial statements were audited when, in fact, no audit ever occurred.  , The Complaint alleges Caggia and Ocumeds now deceased CFO created the forged auditor report and, with Caggias knowledge, included the forged report in Ocumeds 10-KSB.  Caggia and Cummings signed the 10-KSB.  The complaint further alleges that Cummings failed to read or take any steps to ascertain whether the filing was true and accurate.  The Complaint further alleges that Caggia failed to file with the Commission required ownership and disclosure statements identifying his control of a substantial percentage of the outstanding Ocumed shares and his transfer of several shares to other individuals or entities.

In a federal court complaint filed on April 28, 2004, the Commission alleged that the four receivership entities, D.W. Heath &amp; Associates, Inc., Private Capital Management, Inc. (PCM), Private Collateral Management, Inc., and PCM Fixed Income Fund I, LLC (PCM Fund), and two individuals, Daniel William Heath, 47, of Chino Hills, and Denis Timothy OBrien, 49, of Yorba Linda, fraudulently induced at least 803 elderly investors to invest in secured notes that paid a guaranteed return of 5.5% to 8% per year, and raised at least $60 million.  The defendants agreed to the entry of the order appointing the permanent receiver over the entities., In his first report to the court filed on May 14, 2004, the receiver stated that from July 1993 through March 31, 2004, approximately $144.8 million was raised from investors through PCM, and of that amount, approximately $39.6 million in principal and interest was returned to investors.  According to the receivers report, over the life of the company, PCM suffered a net loss of about $41.8 million and earned only $1 million in total income.  The receiver concluded that the payments to investors could have only come from the money invested by other investors.  Using funds from new investors to make principal and interest payments to existing investors without disclosing such a practice constitutes a Ponzi scheme.  , The Commissions complaint alleged that the defendants fraudulently induced at least 803 elderly investors nationwide to invest in PCM notes that purportedly paid a guaranteed return of 5.5% to 8% per year.  The defendants claimed that investor funds would be used to make secured loans to businesses.  The defendants also represented that independent IRA administrators conducted due diligence on the PCM Notes and that either investors will be repaid their principal at maturity, or they may redeem all or part of their investment before maturity, subject to a 10% penalty.  Finally, the defendants claimed that PCM and the PCM Fund are California entities., According to the complaint, these representations are false.  There is no evidence that there are any secured loans.  The PCM Notes also are not liquid because the defendants have failed to promptly return investor funds.  The complaint further alleges that some investors have had to threaten to file, or actually filed, lawsuits against the defendants to get back their money.  Nor is it true that IRA administrators have conducted due diligence.  Finally, there is no record that either PCM or the PCM Fund are California legal entities., On May 6, 2004, the defendants consented to the entry of a preliminary injunction enjoining them from future violations of the registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The defendants also consented to the entry of orders freezing their assets (except against OBrien), prohibiting the destruction of documents, requiring accountings, and expediting discovery.

As detailed below, defendants Del, Taber, Engel and Rubin have agreed to settle this matter without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions Complaint. , The Commissions Complaint alleges, among other things, that Trugman orchestrated, and Taber, Engel and Rubin carried out a financial fraud at Del that resulted in Del materially overstating its reported revenues and caused Del to make numerous material misrepresentations in Commission filings and in press releases.   According to the Complaint, Del routinely engaged in improper revenue recognition when it held open quarters, prematurely shipped products to third-party warehouses, and recorded sales on products that Del had not yet manufactured.  The Complaint also alleges that Del improperly accounted for inventory by recording obsolete inventory at full value and overstating certain engineering work in process values.  In addition, the Complaint alleges that Del improperly characterized certain ordinary expenses as capital expenditures.  As alleged in the Complaint, these actions contravened Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and resulted in the overstatement of Dels reported pre-tax income by at least $3.7 million (110%) in fiscal year 1997, $5.2 million (161%) in fiscal year 1998, and $7.9 million (466%) in fiscal year 1999 - and allowed Del to represent that its performance was on par with internal and external expectations in the first three quarters of fiscal year 2000, when in fact those expectations outpaced the companys actual performance by a wide margin., The Complaint further alleges that the Defendants engaged in a cover-up to prevent Dels outside auditors from discovering the fraud.  Del kept two sets of books (one set for its auditors and one correct set) and falsified documents such as shipping logs, quality control records, and accounts receivable documents to hide its fraudulent accounting practices from its outside auditors.  The Complaint alleges that defendants Rubin and Michael participated in some of these practices.  Specifically, the Complaint alleges that in October 2000, they submitted phony invoices to Del to support Tabers attempt to improperly capitalize costs related to a Del acquisition.  Michael was previously suspended from appearing or practicing as an accountant before the Commission, pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the Commissions Rules of Practice.  <i>See In the Matter of Michael, Adest &amp; Blumenkrantz, et al.</i>, Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rel. No. 41284, Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Rel. No. 1125 (April 14, 1999)., The Commissions Complaint alleges that by engaging in the foregoing conduct: (i) defendant Del violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws (Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5), as well as the reporting, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the Exchange Act  (Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B), and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13);  (ii) defendants Trugman, Engel, Taber and Rubin violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws (Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5), the internal control and books and records provisions of the Exchange Act (Section 13(b)(5) and Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1), and the provisions of the Exchange Act that prohibit an officer or director from making misleading statements to accountants  (Exchange Act Rule 13b2-2), and (iii) defendant Michael violated the internal control and books and records provisions of the Exchange Act (Section 13(b)(5) and Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1), as well as the provisions of the Exchange Act that prohibit an officer or director from making misleading statements to accountants (Exchange Act Rule 13b2-2).  The Complaint additionally charges Trugman with (i) aiding and abetting Dels violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13, and (ii) acting as a control person of Del, pursuant to Exchange Act Section 20(a)., Defendants Del, Engel, Taber and Rubin have consented to the entry of final judgments against them, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions Complaint.  The Commission expects the penalties from the settling defendants to be distributed pursuant to the Fair Fund provisions of Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.   The settlement terms are subject to court approval., Del consented to entry of a final judgment against the company that permanently enjoins it from further violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13.  Del will also pay a civil penalty of $400,000 and $1 in disgorgement.  The $400,000 civil penalty was imposed, in part, because the company, upon the discovery of the fraudulent accounting scheme by the firms auditors, commissioned an internal investigation that sought to shield the architect of the fraud, former Del Chairman and CEO defendant Leanord A. Trugman (Trugman), from liability.   For example, Dels Audit Committee hired Trugmans close personal friend to conduct the investigation.  Moreover, during the internal investigation, Trugman and his associate were permitted to speak to (and intimidate) witnesses prior to their interviews.  After the Commission commenced its inquiry in this matter, Del hired independent outside counsel who cooperated with the staffs investigation.   , Taber, Engel and Rubin consented to entry of final judgments against them that permanently enjoin them from further violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, and Exchange Act Rules 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 -- and permanently bar each of them from acting as an officer or director of a public company.  Additionally, Engel has agreed to pay $50,000 in disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, $15,940 in prejudgment interest thereon, and a $50,000 civil penalty.   Rubin has agreed to pay $32,162.97 in disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, $8,941.69 in prejudgment interest thereon, and a $75,000 civil penalty.   Taber has also agreed to entry of a Commission order, pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the Commissions Rules of Practice, that will bar him from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant.   The judgment against Taber waives his disgorgement obligation and does not impose a civil penalty, based on Tabers sworn statement of financial condition and other information furnished to the Commission.  , With respect to the two remaining defendants -- Trugman and Michael -- the Commissions Complaint seeks a final judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, barring them from serving as officers or directors of a public company, and ordering them to pay civil penalties.  The Complaint also seeks to have Trugman disgorge his ill-gotten gains obtained from the foregoing conduct, and prejudgment interest thereon. , <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18732.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18732.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The complaint alleges that, in the spring of 1999, Fair, Henson and Master Graphics Chief Executive Officer implemented a scheme to fraudulently overstate the companys net income to meet analysts expectations.  Pursuant to the plan, the company fraudulently reclassified rent and salary expenses that Master Graphics had already paid to its division presidents in the first quarter to assets on the companys balance sheet, thus reducing expenses and increasing income.  According to the complaint, this scheme fraudulently overstated Master Graphics net income by 628%, 46% and 10% in the first, second and third quarter financial statements, respectively, that the company filed with the Commission in 1999.   , The complaint alleges that Henson and Fair violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws (Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5), as well as the books and records and internal controls provisions of the Exchange Act (Section 13(b)(5) and Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1).

(Symbol), with securities fraud and related violations.  The SEC also charged eleven former Symbol executives in connection with their roles in the fraud.  Symbol has agreed to settle the Commissions charges by paying a $37 million penalty and consenting to injunctive relief.  The entire amount of the penalty will be distributed to injured investors.  One individual defendant, James Dean, has consented to injunctive relief., The SECs complaint alleges that from at least 1998 until early 2003, Symbol and the other defendants engaged in numerous fraudulent accounting practices and other misconduct that had a cumulative net impact of over $230 million on Symbols reported revenue and over $530 million on its pre-tax earnings.  Based in Holtsville, New York, Symbol supplies mobile information systems using bar code scanners and related technology and its stock is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange., <i>Individuals Sued</i>:  In addition to Symbol, the Commissions complaint names the following individual defendants who worked at Symbol during the relevant period:, Tomo Razmilovic, age 62, former President and CEO, Kenneth Jaeggi, age 58, former CFO, Leonard Goldner, age 56, former General Counsel, Brian Burke, age 57, former Senior Vice President of Worldwide Operations and the former Chief Accounting Officer, Michael DeGennaro, age 39, former Senior Vice President of Finance, Frank Borghese, age 49, former Senior Vice President of Worldwide Sales and Service, Christopher DeSantis, age 38, former Vice President of Sales Finance, James Heuschneider, age 47, former Director of Customer Service Finance, Gregory Mortenson, age 38, former Senior Director of Finance, James Dean, age 34, former Manager and Director of Operations Finance, Robert Donlon, age 37, former Director of Sales Operations, <i>Conduct</i>:  The complaint alleges that Symbol and other defendants engaged in a fraudulent scheme to inflate revenue, earnings and other measures of financial performance in order to create the false appearance that Symbol had met or exceeded its financial projections.  Razmilovic and others fostered a numbers driven corporate culture obsessed with meeting Wall Street estimates., With no regard for generally accepted accounting principles or their financial reporting obligations, defendants used the following fraudulent schemes to align Symbols reported financial results with market expectations:, (a) 	a Tango sheet process through which baseless accounting entries were made to conform the raw quarterly results to managements projections;, (b)	the fabrication and misuse of restructuring and other non-recurring charges to artificially reduce operating expenses, create cookie jar reserves and further manage earnings;, (c) 	channel stuffing and other revenue recognition schemes, involving both product sales and customer services; and, (d)	the manipulation of inventory levels and accounts receivable data to conceal the adverse side effects of the revenue recognition schemes., Razmilovic, Jaeggi, Burke, DeGennaro and Borghese directed the fraud, while DeSantis, Heuschneider, Mortenson, Dean and Donlon implemented the schemes., While the accounting fraud was occurring, Goldner manipulated stock option exercise dates to enable select senior executives, including himself, to profit unfairly at the companys expense.  Rather than use the actual exercise date as defined by the option plans, Goldner instituted, without board approval or public disclosure, a practice of using a more advantageous date chosen from a 30-day look-back period so as to reduce the cost of the exercise to the executive.  To create the false appearance that these exercises occurred on the selected dates, Goldner had his staff backdate transactional documents and use the phony exercise dates in the forms on which the executives reported their acquisitions to the Commission and the public., In addition to committing securities fraud, some of the defendants interfered with two internal investigations into Symbols accounting practices and delayed the Commissions investigation.  After the Commission began its investigation, Jaeggi directed subordinates to discard copies of Tango sheets and other incriminating documents.  During the same relevant period, DeGennaro rigged the revenue recognition data provided to the forensic accountants involved in the first internal inquiry, instructed subordinates to withhold information from subsequent internal investigators, and directed employees to sanitize key portions of schedules that they provided to the investigators., <i>Statutory Violations</i>:  The Commissions complaint alleges that by engaging in this conduct, the defendants violated antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, and also violated, or are secondarily liable for Symbols violations of, numerous reporting, record-keeping, internal control and proxy solicitation provisions.  Specifically, the complaint alleges that Symbol violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2) and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, 14a-3 and 14a-9.  Each individual defendant is alleged to have violated Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1.  Razmilovic, Jaeggi, Goldner and Burke are also alleged to have violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, and Goldner is alleged to have also violated Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 16a-3.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Razmilovic, Jaeggi, Burke and DeGennaro made, or directed others to make, false statements to Symbols accountants in violation of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-2.  , <i>Relief Sought</i>:  The complaint seeks final judgments enjoining violations of these provisions of the federal securities laws; ordering all defendants to pay disgorgement and civil money penalties; and barring defendants Razmilovic, Jaeggi, Goldner, Burke, DeGennaro and Borghese from acting as an officer or director of any public company., Symbol, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, has agreed to the following relief:, A permanent injunction against future violations of the relevant antifraud, reporting, books and records and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws., A civil penalty of $37 million and nominal disgorgement of $1, all of which will be distributed to injured investors., Various remedial measures, including the appointment of an independent examiner to review Symbols accounting practices and internal control systems and assess the status of remedial actions undertaken or planned by the company in those and other areas., Dean has also agreed, without admitting or denying the allegations, to the imposition of the injunctive relief sought by the Commission., <p class=center>*     *     *, The Commissions claims for disgorgement and civil penalties against Dean, and all of its claims against the other individual defendants, remain pending., This is the third enforcement action the Commission has brought as a result of its investigation into Symbols financial reporting.

Kautilya Tony Sharma, and Neal R. Wadhwa</i>, Civil Action No. 04-80525 Paine/Johnson (S.D. FL)</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil securities fraud action today in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, against Geek Securities Inc., Geek Advisors, Inc., Kautilya Tony Sharma, president and owner of Geek Securities and Geek Advisors and Neal R. Wadhwa, a Geek Securities registered representative.  According to the SECs complaint, the defendants engaged in pervasive market timing and late trading on behalf of their institutional clients.  The defendants defrauded mutual funds and their shareholders by engaging in a series of activities designed to circumvent the restrictions on market timing by those mutual funds and systematically engaged in late trading in those mutual fund shares.  , With respect to the defendants market timing scheme, the SEC alleges that, between at least  September 2001 and November 2003, mutual fund companies blocked Geek Securities and Geek Advisors clients from trading in their mutual funds due to their market timing activities.   Market timing includes (a) frequent buying and selling of shares of the same mutual fund or (b) buying or selling mutual fund shares in order to exploit inefficiencies in mutual fund pricing.  Market timing, while not illegal per se, can harm other mutual fund shareholders because it can dilute the value of their shares, if the market timer is exploiting pricing inefficiencies, or disrupt the management of the mutual funds investment portfolio and can cause the targeted mutual fund to incur costs borne by other shareholders to accommodate frequent buying and selling of shares by the market timer.  In response to the blocks by the mutual fund companies, according to the Commissions complaint, Geek Securities and Geek Advisors, through Sharma and Wadhwa, used various deceptive activities to evade detection of ongoing market timing, including establishing new customer accounts for existing customers and transferring balances between customer accounts, thereby making it more difficult for mutual fund companies to detect market timing.   By October 2003, Geek Securities and Geek Advisors clients had been banned from trading in all but about four mutual funds.  , The SECs complaint also alleges that, between at least September 2001 and November 2003, Geek Securities and Geek Advisors, through Sharma and Wadhwa, participated in a systematic scheme to late trade mutual fund shares on behalf of some of its clients.   Late trading refers to the practice of placing orders to buy and sell mutual funds shares after the close of the market at 4:00 p.m. EST, but at the mutual funds net asset value (NAV), or price, determined at the market close at 4:00 p.m. EST.  Late trading enables the trader to profit from market events that occur after 4:00 p.m. EST, but that are not reflected in the previously calculated NAV.  Late trading is illegal.   According to the SECs complaint, Geek Securities and Geek Advisors received trading instructions from customers after 4:00 p.m. EST and executed those trades as if the trading instructions had been received prior to that time.   According to the SEC, Geek Securities and Geek Advisors attempted to conceal their late trading activities by time-stamping trades using a time-stamp machine that, intentionally, did not reflect the accurate time, time-stamping only purported preliminary trade instructions received before 4:00 p.m. EST but not final trade instructions received after 4:00 p.m. EST, and by accepting trade instructions received after the 4:00 p.m. EST cut-off by undocumented phone conversations., The Commissions complaint alleges that Geek Securities, Geek Advisors, Sharma and Wadhwa violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.   The complaint also alleges that Geek Securities violated Section 15(c)(1) of the Exchange Act and that Sharma and Wadhwa aided and abetted Geek Securities violation of Section 15(c)(1) of the Exchange Act.   The Commission is seeking injunctive relief, disgorgement, and civil money penalties., Additional Materials:, SEC Complaint in this matter, For further information contact:, David Nelson, Regional Director (305) 982-6332, Glenn S.

Treloar, a resident of Wyndham Vale, Victoria, Australia, was sentenced for violations of the Crimes Act (Victoria) 1958 (the Crimes Act) and the Corporations Act 2001 (Corporations Act), to which he had pled guilty on December 1, 2003., Treloar is the former financial accountant of Corrpro Companies Australia Pty Ltd. (Corrpro Australia), the Australian subsidiary of Corrpro Companies, Inc. (Corrpro), a U.S. public corporation based in Medina, Ohio.  Treloar and Greg Waring, the former managing director of the Australian subsidiary, were the subjects of a civil injunctive action filed by the Commission on September 30, 2003 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio (<i>United States Securities and Exchange Commission v. Greg Waring and Craig Treloar</i>, 1:03CV2030, Polster, J.).  The Commissions complaint in that matter alleged that from at least October 2000 through February 2002, Waring and Treloar falsified accounting and other financial records of Corrpro Australia in order to inflate its net income and its net assets so that Corrpro Australia would meet financial performance targets set by managers at the parent company.  The Commission further alleged that Waring and Treloar took steps to fabricate documents to be reviewed by the companys independent auditors.  On April 2, 2004, the court entered orders by default against both Waring and Treloar.  The orders permanently enjoined Waring and Treloar from further violations of certain provisions of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. The courts orders also imposed an officer and director bar on both defendants, which prohibits them from acting as an officer or director of any company registered with the Commission., In the Australian criminal case, Treloar was sentenced to 16 months imprisonment, all of which was suspended, for the Crimes Act charges.  Treloar was sentenced to 10 months imprisonment for the Corporations Act charges.  However, Treloar will be released without serving prison time, upon entering into a 3-year parole agreement.  If Treloar fails to be of good behavior during the 3-year parole period, he risks the possibility of serving his prison sentence, and paying an AD$8,000 fine.  Treloar has undertaken to continue to assist ASIC in its ongoing investigation in relation to this matter., In a separate criminal case, Australian authorities have charged Waring with violations of the Crimes Act and Corporations Act.  Waring has not yet entered a plea.  The criminal cases against Treloar and Waring both involve the same course of conduct as alleged in the Commissions civil case against Treloar and Waring., The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission in its investigation., For additional information, see Litigation Release Nos. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18382.htm>18382</a> (October 1, 2003).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18739.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The Commissions complaint alleges that, between February 1999 and March 2002, one of Schering-Ploughs foreign subsidiaries, Schering-Plough Poland, made improper payments to a charitable organization called the Chudow Castle Foundation.  The Foundation was headed by an individual who was the Director of the Silesian Health Fund during the relevant time.  The health fund was a Polish governmental body that, among other things, provided money for the purchase of pharmaceutical products and influenced the purchase of those products by other entities, such as hospitals, through the allocation of health fund resources.  According to the complaint, Schering-Plough Poland paid 315,800 zlotys (approximately $76,000) to the Chudow Castle Foundation to induce the Director to influence the health funds purchase of Schering-Ploughs pharmaceutical products.  , The complaint alleges that none of the payments made by Schering-Plough Poland to the Foundation was accurately reflected on the subsidiarys books and records.  The complaint also alleges that the companys system of internal accounting controls was inadequate to prevent or detect the improper payments.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Schering-Plough consented to pay a $500,000 civil penalty.  , In a related enforcement action announced today, Schering-Plough consented, without admitting or denying the Commissions findings, to the issuance of a Commission Order requiring Schering-Plough to cease and desist from committing or causing violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act.  Schering-Plough also was ordered to comply with its undertakings to retain an independent consultant to review the companys policies and procedures regarding compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and to implement any changes recommended by the consultant.

No. 33-8428 (June 9, 2004).</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced a settled enforcement action against i2 Technologies, Inc. (i2) in connection with alleged accounting improprieties and misleading revenue recognition by the Dallas-based developer and marketer of enterprise supply chain software and management solutions.  i2 agreed to pay a $10 million civil penalty and nominal $1 disgorgement in a civil suit the Commission filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas (Dallas Division).  As part of the settlement, but without admitting or denying the Commissions substantive findings or allegations, i2 consented to the entry of a cease-and-desist order finding that i2 committed securities fraud in accounting for certain software license agreements and in accounting for and improperly disclosing four barter transactions.  As provided under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the penalty amount will become part of a disgorgement fund for the benefit of injured i2 investors., In summary, the Commissions cease-and-desist order finds and civil complaint alleges that, for the four years ended December 31, 2001 and the first three quarters of 2002, i2 misstated approximately $1 billion of software license revenues.  As a result, i2s periodic filings with the Commission and earnings releases during this period materially misrepresented i2s revenues and earnings.  , Specifically, the order finds and complaint alleges that i2 favored up-front recognition of software license revenues, purportedly in accordance with generally accepted accounting principals (GAAP).  i2s compensation structure fostered this preference, because compensation of sales and pre-sales personnel was largely based on the amount of revenue recognized and cash collected in the current period.  However, as i2 knew or recklessly ignored, immediate recognition of revenue was inappropriate for some of i2s software licenses because they required lengthy and intense implementation and customization efforts to meet customer needs.  In some cases, i2 shipped certain products and product lines that lacked functionality essential to commercial use by a broad range of users.  In other cases, the company licensed certain software that required additional functionality to be usable by particular customers.  On still other occasions, i2 exaggerated certain product capabilities, or entered into side agreements with certain customers that were not properly reflected in the accounting for those transactions.  In each case, significant modification and customization efforts were necessary to provide the required functionality.    , i2 also improperly recorded revenue from four barter transactions during the restatement period.  These transactions involved third-party purchases of software licenses from i2, with i2 recognizing the revenue immediately, in exchange for i2s agreement to purchase from the other parties in the future a comparable amount of products or services.  In some of these transactions, i2 paid a premium over the prevailing rates for those products or services, in an effort to equalize both sides of the deal.  When i2 recorded revenue from these transactions, it could not determine the fair value of the items exchanged within reasonable limits.  Accordingly, i2s up-front recognition of license revenue from these transactions was improper under GAAP.  Moreover, i2s financial statements and Commission filings failed to disclose the true nature of these transactions, which improperly inflated i2s reported revenues by approximately $44 million. , The Commission also found and alleges that, during the summer of 2001, i2 received two documents flagging issues impacting software license revenue recognition.  First, in June 2001, i2 generated a summary of revenue recognition risks, outlining such potential problems as identifying products to meet customer needs after licenses were signed; bundling wrong or incorrectly positioned products in deals; substantial underestimation of implementation services necessary to meet customer needs; the provision of development and customization services without separate formal agreements; and barter transactions., Second, also in June 2001, i2 received the initial report of a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor the company had hired to examine its business practices.  The professors report identified serious deficiencies within the organization, from shortcomings in its product and technology strategy to weaknesses in its sales practices, product release management, and quality assurance.  Critically, this report indicated that i2s products had largely become custom software requiring considerable customization and modification, which would preclude up-front recognition of revenue from these licenses.  Neither i2s auditors nor Audit Committee learned of the MIT professors report until September 2002., <p class=center>**********, The cease-and-desist order finds and civil complaint alleges that i2 violated Sections 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13 and 13b2-1 thereunder., The Commissions investigation continues as to other individuals and entities., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18741.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18741.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

(Gerber)., In its Complaint, the Commission alleged that Jones, age 57, was the Group Managing Director of Gerbers Spandex PLC (Spandex) subsidiary and that Godden, age 47, was the vice-president of marketing with Spandex. The Commission further alleged that in early June 1999, Jones learned that Gerber had decided to acquire the assets of Graphic-Cal, Australias largest sign making materials supplier.  On the basis of this information and before the acquisition was made public, Jones, on June 11, 1999, purchased 5,000 shares of Gerber stock.  Following the announcement of the acquisition on September 13, 1999, Gerbers stock price increased and Jones made a profit of $5,250 from his trading in advance of the announcement of the Graphic-Cal acquisition. , The Commission further alleged that shortly before March 15, 2000, Jones received additional material, nonpublic information indicating that Gerber and its subsidiaries would have significantly worse financial results than previously expected.  On the basis of this information, Jones, on March 15, 2000, sold 5,000 shares of Gerber stock.  On April 26, 2000, Gerber announced that its results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2000 likely would be lower than expected.  Gerbers stock price closed that day at $11.50 per share, down $3.63 from the prior days closing price.  Jones thus avoided losses of $47,500., In its Complaint, the Commission alleged that Godden also received material, nonpublic information about Gerber and its subsidiaries prior to the April 26, 2000 announcement.  Among other things, Godden learned of product problems that a Gerber subsidiary was experiencing and that the subsidiarys operating income for February 2000 was below budget.  Godden further learned that Gerbers fourth quarter results would be worse than expected.  On the basis of this information and on the first day when he could trade in his recently opened brokerage account, Godden, on April 18, 2000, sold 10,000 shares of Gerber stock.  By trading in advance of Gerbers April 26, 2000 announcement, Godden avoided losses of $64,375., The Commission alleged in its Complaint that, as a result of their misconduct, Jones and Godden each violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.  The Commission is seeking a final judgment enjoining Jones and Godden from violating these provisions, compelling each of them to pay monetary penalties, requiring each of them to disgorge his profits and/or the losses avoided from their unlawful trading, with prejudgment interest thereon., In addition to the relief sought in the Complaint, the Commission today also sought a temporary freeze of assets of Mr. Jones sufficient to pay disgorgement plus prejudgment interest thereon and penalties that the Court may order.  The Court granted the Commissions request, entered an order freezing $300,000 of assets of Mr. Jones until otherwise ordered by the Court, and scheduled a hearing for June 16, 2004, for Mr. Jones to show cause why the Court should not enter an order extending the asset freeze until there is a final adjudication of the case., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18742.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18742.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The complaint alleges that, in the spring of 1999, Miller devised and implemented a scheme to fraudulently overstate the companys net income to meet analysts expectations.  Pursuant to the plan, the company fraudulently reclassified rent and salary expenses that Master Graphics had already paid to its division presidents in the first quarter to assets on the companys balance sheet, thus reducing expenses and increasing income.

The four principals are John D. Barry, the  President, Thomas P. Daniels, the Chief Investment Officer, John M. Irwin, the Senior Portfolio Manager, and Mark P. Miszkiewicz, the Chief Financial Officer.  The SEC filed the original complaint in this action on November 7, 2002, charging Beacon Hill with fraud.  The case was stayed from February 24, 2003 until May 31, 2004., The amended complaint alleges that the four principals of Beacon Hill together implemented a fraudulent scheme that resulted in investors losing more than $300 million.  The allegations are that from at least the beginning of 2002 through October 2002, Beacon Hill and its principals made material misrepresentations to investors and engaged in other fraudulent conduct.  The misrepresentations concerned the methodology Beacon Hill used for calculating the net asset values of the hedge funds it managed; the hedging and trading strategy for the purportedly market neutral funds; and the value and performance of the funds., The SEC further alleges that central to Beacon Hills fraud was its method of valuing securities in the hedge funds to show steady and positive returns.  Beacon Hill manipulated its valuation procedures for the Master Fund, the core hedge fund that held and traded securities in Beacon Hills three feeder hedge funds.  The manipulative conduct allowed Beacon Hill to report steady growth and hide losses in these hedge funds during 2002., The amended complaint further alleges that as the value of these Beacon Hill hedge funds decreased over the summer of 2002, Beacon Hill nevertheless continued to report positive returns.  Beacon Hill increasingly inflated the prices of the securities in the Master Fund to maintain the appearance of positive returns.  At the same time, contrary to what it was telling investors, Beacon Hill made an increasing and ultimately unsuccessful bet on interest rates rising in an attempt to cover its hidden losses., In addition, the SEC alleges that Beacon Hill entered into a series of trades between the Master Fund and certain other accounts it managed for two institutional clients (the managed accounts) at prices that defrauded the Master Fund and allowed the managed accounts, whose performances had also declined, to reap substantial profits.  Beacon Hill was able to hide the losses resulting from these fraudulent trades by inflating the value of the securities in the Master Fund to an even greater extent., Finally, the amended complaint alleges that in September 2002, as their scheme started to unravel, three of the four principals liquidated an account in which they were the only investors by selling the securities in their account to the Master Fund without disclosure to investors.  In early October 2002, when Beacon Hills prime broker challenged the valuation of the Master Fund and Beacon Hill was forced to admit it had sustained losses, the principals misrepresented the magnitude of the actual losses in an attempt to save Beacon Hills operations and make the losses appear to be the result of market conditions.  On October 17, 2002, Beacon Hill finally announced the full extent of investor losses, admitting that, as of September 30, the NAVs of its hedge funds had declined 54% from previously reported August 31, 2002 levels, and further acknowledging that it had mis-priced securities in the funds prior to August., The SEC alleges that by engaging in this conduct, Beacon Hill, Barry, Daniels, Irwin, and Miszkiewicz violated Section 17(a)(1), (2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Additionally, through this conduct Beacon Hill violated Sections 206(1), (2) and (3) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and defendants Barry, Daniels, Irwin, and Miszkiewicz aided and abetted Beacon Hills violations of these sections.  The Commission seeks from the defendants permanent injunctions, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.

The Commission alleges that Gallucci, Manzo, and Taffet, through their insider tipping and trading, each violated Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b 5 and 14e 3 thereunder.

Skadden Arps represented a company in connection with each of these contemplated business combinations, and Galluccis wife learned the target companies identities in the course of her employment.  The complaint alleges that she disclosed the information to Gallucci only after he expressly assured her that he would not disclose it to others or use it for trading purposes.  The complaint also alleges that, although Gallucci himself did not trade on the basis of the information, he did misappropriate it from his wife by disclosing it and its source to Manzo, his long-time friend and owner of a New Jersey insurance company that did business with local government entities in New Jersey.  Manzo purchased securities of the target companies, garnering illegal profits of more than $900,000.  The complaint further alleges that, in addition, Manzo tipped a friend, Taffet, who was an owner of a company that provided insurance advice to local government entities in New Jersey and who had strong political ties in the state.  Taffet purchased securities of several of the target companies, resulting in illegal profits of approximately $247,000.  The complaint also alleges that Manzo and Taffet each tipped other individuals who themselves traded on the basis of those tips, and one of those individuals tipped two others, who also traded.

Feess, United States District Judge for the Central District of California, issued a preliminary injunction in connection with a $36 million affinity fraud perpetrated by C+ Capital Management, LLC (C+ Capital) and its principal owner and managing member, Won Charlie Yi (Yi), age 34.  The Court:  (1) granted the Commissions request for a preliminary injunction against C+ Capital; (2) continued to freeze assets of C+ Capital and Yi; (3) prohibited the destruction of documents by the defendants; and (4) ordered accountings from the defendants. , C+ Capital is a Delaware limited liability company registered as an investment adviser with the State of California.  C+ Capital is headquartered in Los Angeles, California and operates an office in Seoul, South Korea.  C+ Capital and Yi (also known as Won Charles Yi, W. Charlie Yi, W. Charles Yi, Won Chong Yi, and Charlie Yi), engaged in a scheme that targeted primarily members of the Korean community in Los Angeles.  The Commissions complaint alleges that the defendants raised at least $36 million by soliciting members of the Korean community to invest funds through C+ Capital.  According to the complaint, Yi misrepresented to investors that C+ Capital would establish brokerage accounts at Carlin Equities Corp., a registered broker-dealer, in which Yi would buy and sell stocks on behalf of the investors at discounted prices.  He then instructed his clients to make checks payable to Carlin Corp.  The Commission further alleges that Yi not only failed to open brokerage accounts for his advisory clients, but he also deposited the checks into a bank account held in his own name.  Yi then provided the clients with fabricated Carlin account statements, and lulled investors when they later sought to withdraw funds from their accounts by giving them various reasons why their holdings could not or should not be immediately liquidated.The Commission obtained a preliminary injunction enjoining C+ Capital from committing securities fraud in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The order also preliminarily enjoins C+ Capital from committing securities fraud in violation of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

Goyal was Vice President and Chief Financial Officer at Santa Clara, California-based software manufacturer Network Associates, Inc. until his departure in 2000.  The Commissions complaint alleges that from the second quarter of fiscal 1998 through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000, Goyal engaged in a fraudulent scheme to, among other things, overstate Network Associates revenue and earnings in violation of the federal securities laws.  The Commissions complaint also alleges that Goyal sold stock while in possession of material non-public information regarding the financial fraud at Network Associates., According to the complaint, Network Associates oversold products to its distributors and Goyal oversaw the improper recognition of hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue.  In particular, the complaint alleges that Goyal and others at his direction:, used a wholly-owned Network Associates subsidiary to repurchase products previously sold to distributors in order to reduce distributor inventory levels and limit product returns,, made secret payments to distributors to induce them to hold excess inventory and buy more products,, offered distributors deep discounts and rebates on amounts that distributors already owed to Network Associates for prior product purchases and from which Network Associates already had recorded revenues, and, sold products to distributors on consignment in violation of Network Associates written sales contracts and stated revenue recognition practices., The complaint further alleges that Goyal took action to conceal the fraud, directing that payments and discounts to distributors be misrecorded in Network Associatess books, and directing the release of unrelated tax reserves to cover payments to distributors and to increase inadequate sales reserves.  The complaint alleges that Goyal knowingly or recklessly defrauded investors through the reporting of false and materially misleading financial information in periodic reports, financial statements, and securities registration statements that Network Associates filed with the Commission, in press releases, and in other public statements., The Commissions complaint seeks to permanently enjoin Goyal from violating, or aiding and abetting future violations of, the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5; from violating the provisions of the federal securities laws that prohibit falsifying corporate records and lying to accountants, Exchange Act Section 13(b)(5) and Exchange Act Rules 13b2-1 and 13b2-2; and from aiding and abetting future violations of certain reporting and recordkeeping provisions of the federal securities laws, Exchange Act Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B), and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13.  The complaint also seeks an accounting, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains both in the form of salary and bonuses and from sales of stock, prejudgment interest, civil money penalties, and an order prohibiting Goyal from acting as an officer or a director of any reporting company., The United States Attorney for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Goyal arising from the same conduct charged in the Commissions complaint., This is the second lawsuit that the Commission filed in connection with accounting issues at Network Associates.

The Commissions complaint, filed in federal court in Dallas, alleges that from June 2000 through September 2001, Seghers and Dickey fraudulently offered and sold securities in three Texas-based hedge funds, Integral Equity, LP, Integral Hedging, LP, and Integral Arbitrage, LP (collectively, the Funds).  During this period, the Funds raised over $71.6 million from approximately 30 investors.  , The Commission alleges that Seghers controlled and made investment decisions for the Funds through Integral Investment Management, LP, and that Dickey marketed the Funds to investors.  As alleged in the complaint, Seghers and Dickey fraudulently offered the Funds securities by failing to disclose to investors the substantial losses the Funds incurred and that Seghers was overstating the Funds assets.  Seghers caused the Funds assets to be overstated by amounts ranging from 13% to 77% per month.  The Commission further alleges that Seghers misrepresented to a potential investor, The Art Institute of Chicago, that certain brokerage firm errors did not affect one of the hedge funds, Integral Arbitrage, LP, when, in fact, they did.  Based on this statement, The Art Institute invested $22.5 million in Integral Arbitrage, LP. , The Commission also alleges that Seghers and Dickey misrepresented to investors that the Funds had prominent brokerage firms at various times as their prime broker, when the Funds never had a prime broker.  In a prime brokerage relationship, the prime broker is a broker-dealer that, among other things, clears and finances customer trades made at other brokerage firms at the customers request., The Commission charged Seghers and Dickey with violating the securities registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and also charged Seghers with violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Dickey with violating the broker-dealer registration provisions of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act.  The Commission seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against Seghers and Dickey. , In addition, the Commission instituted and settled public administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings against Samer M. El Bizri and his company, Bizri Capital Partners, Inc. (BCP).  [In the Matter of Samer M. El Bizri and Bizri Capital Partners, Inc., Administrative Proceeding File No. 3-11521]  The Commission found that Bizri, a resident of Los Angeles, California, and BCP were primarily responsible for investing the majority of the Funds assets through an account at a broker-dealer.  By the end of March 2001, Bizri believed that the broker-dealer had made significant errors in the account that prevented him from valuing the account.  Despite this, Bizri continued to accept new investor funds and traded the Funds assets in the account.  In addition, by the end of March 2001, Bizri knew that the account statements reported substantial losses.  Bizri received monthly account statements purporting to reflect the value of BCPs holdings in the Funds.  These statements failed to show the substantial losses that the Funds incurred in the account.  Thus, Bizri knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that investors received account statements that materially overstated the value of their interests in the Funds., Bizri and BCP, without admitting or denying the Commissions findings, consented to an order that (1) ordered Bizri and BCP to cease-and-desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act; (2) barred Bizri from association with any investment adviser, with the right to reapply for association after five years; (3) prohibited Bizri and BCP from serving or acting as an employee, officer, director, member of an advisory board, investment adviser or depositor of, or principal underwriter for, a registered investment company or affiliated person of such investment adviser, depositor, or principal underwriter, with the right to reapply for service in any such capacity after five years; and (4) directed Bizri and BCP to pay a $50,000 civil penalty., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18749.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18749.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Gibson. The Commission had charged that Mr. Gibson, 77, had engaged in insider trading in violation of the federal securities laws, specifically Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. During the relevant time period, Mr. Gibson was a member of the board of directors of Cell Pathways, Inc., a publicly-traded biotech company located in Horsham, Pennsylvania., This action was filed on September 24, 2002 against Mr. Gibson, the Estate of Harry C.

The Commission alleged that immediately after receiving this information, Mr. Gibson tipped his friend, Harry Krause, and that Harry Krause then sold 22,000 shares of his Cell Pathways stock before the information became public.  Mr. Krause was able to avoid losses of approximately $400,000 by selling his Cell Pathways stock on September 21, 2000, rather than on September 25, 2000 when the information became public and the stock price fell by approximately 70 percent., Prior to trial, the Commission settled its claims against the Estate of Harry C.

Victor Jacobowitz, et al.</i>, Civil Action No. 04 CV 2505 (E.D.N.Y.)</h2>]","[Today, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York alleging that Victor Jacobowitz, former Chairman of the Board of Directors of Allou Healthcare, Inc. (Allou), and four other former executives engaged in financial reporting fraud.  The Commissions complaint alleges that beginning in the 1990s and continuing through March 2003, the defendants engaged in a scheme to defraud Allous lenders and public investors.  The defendants falsified Allous accounting records, earnings reports, and periodic filings with the Commission by, among other things, materially overstating revenue and inventory.  The complaint alleges that the defendants manipulated Allous net income and earnings per share to meet Wall Streets expectations.  The complaint also alleges that the defendants conducted this scheme, in part, for their own personal enrichment., The complaint names the following defendants:, Victor Jacobowitz (aka Victor Jacobs), age 72, is a resident of Brooklyn, New York.  Victor Jacobs served as the chairman of Allous board of directors from 1985 to May 2003., Herman Jacobowitz (aka Herman Jacobs), age 44, is a resident of Brooklyn, New York.  Herman Jacobs served as Allous CEO from July 2000 to April 2003, and as a director from 1985 to May 2003.  Herman Jacobs is a son of Victor Jacobs., Jacob Jacobowitz (aka Jacob Jacobs), age 41, is a resident of Brooklyn, New York.  Jacob Jacobs served as executive vice president of Allou from July 2000 to April 2003, and as a director from 1985 to May 2003.  Jacob Jacobs is also a son of Victor Jacobs., David Shamilzadeh, age 58, is a resident of New York, New York.  Shamilzadeh served as Allous CFO from April 1990 to September 2001, as Allous president from July 2000 to April 2003 and as principal accounting officer from September 2001 to April 2003.  Shamilzadeh served as a director of Allou from July 1989 to April 2003., Irvin Brown, age 43, is a resident of Monsey, New York.  Brown worked at Allou from at least 1991.  As the head of the information technology department, Brown functioned as Allous de facto chief information officer., The complaint alleges the following.  Allou, currently a bankrupt distributor of pharmaceuticals and health and beauty products, defrauded its lenders of hundreds of millions of dollars, as well as its public investors.  Victor Jacobs and Herman Jacobs engaged in a scheme to misappropriate funds by overstating Allous revenue, accounts receivable, and inventory.  Specifically, Herman Jacobs recorded millions of dollars in false sales to Allou customers, and together with Victor Jacobs, manipulated Allous accounts receivable to make it appear customers were paying for the products.  David Shamilzadeh and Irvin Brown prepared a second set of books through password protected computer files to conceal the false invoices and manipulated accounts receivable.  Jacob Jacobs was aware of the scheme.  In September 2002, a fire destroyed a warehouse in Brooklyn used to store some of Allous inventory.  Allou reported in filings made with the Commission that the inventory destroyed in the fire had a cost-basis value of approximately $86 million., During the fifteen months ended in March 2003, Allou recorded approximately $220 million of falsified sales.  As a result of the defendants conduct, Allou was able to overstate its revenue and accounts receivable and to borrow from its trade creditors significantly more funds than Allous legitimate business merited.  For example, Allous Form 10-Q, dated February 11, 2003, which reported revenue of $471 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2002 included approximately $153 million of falsified sales, overstating actual revenue by forty-eight percent., In addition, Shamilzadeh and Herman Jacobs manipulated Allous net income and earnings per share by overstating inventory.  By overstating inventory, Allou could understate expenses, and therefore manipulate net income and earnings per share so they would be in line with forecasts Shamilzadeh provided to Wall Street.  Allou also borrowed funds from its lenders secured by this nonexistent inventory.  Victor Jacobs and Jacob Jacobs were aware of the scheme.  Victor Jacobs was simultaneously involved in misappropriating money from Allou by transferring millions of dollars to entities the Jacobs family controlled purportedly to pay for nonexistent inventory.   Allou made approximately $179 million in payments to affiliated entities for nonexistent inventory during fiscal year 2002., The complaint alleges that, based on the foregoing, Victor Jacobs, Herman Jacobs, Jacob Jacobs, Shamilzadeh, and Brown violated and/or aided and abetted Allous violations of the antifraud, issuer reporting, internal controls, and books and records provisions of the federal securities laws. The complaint also alleges that Victor Jacobs, Herman Jacobs, and Shamilzadeh lied to Allous auditors, and that Herman Jacobs and Shamilzadeh violated the certification requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.  The Commissions complaint seeks an order permanently enjoining each defendant and ordering them to pay disgorgement and civil penalties.  The Commissions complaint also seeks an order barring each defendant from acting as an officer or director of a public company.  The specific charges alleged in the complaint are as follows:, Victor Jacobs:  violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2; and aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A)&amp;(B) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13;, Herman Jacobs and Shamilzadeh:  violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2; and aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A)&amp;(B) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13;, Jacob Jacobs:  violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5; and aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1; and, Brown:  violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1; and aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A)&amp;(B) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13., The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York and the United States Postal Inspection Service in connection with this matter., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18751.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18751.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Marshall, a former manager of Inso Corporation.  The Court held Marshall liable for securities fraud, providing false information to accountants, circumventing internal accounting controls, and aiding and abetting Insos filing of false financial information with the Commission.  Marshall, age 56 and formerly of Lexington, Massachusetts, was a senior manager at Inso, a now defunct software company that was headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts.  The Court ordered Marshall to pay $345,685.98 in disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, plus a $25,000 civil penalty.  The Court also permanently enjoined Marshall from committing future violations, and barred Marshall from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  On November 12, 2003, Marshall was indicted on criminal charges brought by the United States Attorney for the District of Massachusetts based on the same conduct at issue in the Commissions action. , 	The Commission filed its complaint in June 2002 against Marshall and others.  The Commissions complaint alleged that Marshall arranged for a Malaysian distributor to place a $3 million purchase order on the evening of September 30, 1998, which was the close of Insos third quarter, when an anticipated sale to a major customer fell through.  The transaction was a sham and should not have been included in Insos reported financial results because Marshall promised the distributor he would not have to pay Inso for the purchase, and that Inso would resell the software.  Marshall concealed the terms of the purported sale from Insos finance department.  Consequently, Inso improperly included the $3 million purchase order as revenue in its third quarter 1998 financial statements.  Marshall took steps later in 1998 to cover up the fraudulent nature of the transaction. , 	The Courts judgment held that Marshall violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws [Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder]; circumvented Insos internal accounting controls and falsified records [in violation of Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1]; provided false information to accountants [in violation of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-2]; and aided and abetted Insos uncharged violations of the periodic reporting and books and records provisions [in violation of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-13 thereunder]. , 	For more information see Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18699.htm>18699</a> (May 7, 2004), Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18394.htm>18394</a> (October 4, 2003), and Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17578.htm>17578</a> (June 21, 2002).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18753.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Haggerty, a resident of Walnut Creek, California, and former senior vice president and officer of Qwest Communications International, Inc. (Qwest) in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Haggerty consented to the entry of judgment by the district court requiring him to pay a civil penalty of $30,000. , In addition, the Commission instituted, and simultaneously settled, a cease-and-desist proceeding against Haggerty.  In the Order, In the Matter of Steven L. Haggerty [33-8432], the Commission found that during 2000 and 2001, as well as in other time periods, in Commission filings and in public statements, Qwest emphasized its projected revenues and earnings growth, and focused investors on the revenues and growth generated from its nationwide fiber-optic network.  Qwest could not, however, meet its projected revenues and earnings growth through communications services.  Therefore, Qwest senior management relied on undisclosed Indefeasible Rights of Use (IRU) sales as a method to make up the difference between Qwests service revenues and its projected revenue targets.  An IRU is an irrevocable right to use a specific amount of fiber for a specified time period.  Qwest accounted for IRUs as sales-type leases and, unlike service revenue, recognized nearly the entire amount of the IRU revenue upfront at the time of contract execution, rather than over the life of the IRU agreement.  Qwest employees and management commonly referred to IRU sales as gap fillers, in other words, a means to make up the shortfall between the aggressive revenue projections as publicly announced by Qwest and the service revenue earned. , The Commission found that in June 2001, Haggerty, then a Qwest senior vice president, assisted in providing an undisclosed side agreement allowing a purchaser of fiber-optic cable to exchange (or port) the fiber purchased for different fiber at a later date.  The side agreement concealed from Qwests accountants and outside auditors the purchasers ability to port, since such an exchange right defeated, under generally accepted accounting principles, the upfront revenue recognition sought by Qwest.  According to the Commissions findings, Qwest improperly recognized from the IRU transaction $11.5 million of revenue in the second quarter of 2001, which contributed to Qwests ability to meet its revenue target for that quarter.  As a result, Qwests quarterly report for the second quarter of 2001, its annual report for 2001, and Qwests earnings releases for those periods, contained materially false information., Without admitting or denying the findings in the Commissions Order, Haggerty has agreed to settle the Commissions claims by consenting to the entry of an administrative order requiring him to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder, and from causing any violations and any future violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13 thereunder.  , The Commissions complaint in the district court action alleges the same conduct referenced above.

Qwest employees and management commonly referred to IRU sales as gap fillers, in other words, a means to make up the shortfall between the aggressive revenue projections as publicly announced by Qwest and the service revenue earned.  , The Commission found that in three IRU transactions executed between December 2000 and June 2001, Cruciotti, then the executive vice president of Qwests local networks, authorized subordinates to provide, or provided himself, undisclosed side agreements allowing the purchasers of fiber-optic cable to exchange (or port) the fiber purchased for different fiber at a later date.  The undisclosed side agreements concealed from Qwests accountants and outside auditors the purchasers ability to port, since such exchange rights defeated, under generally accepted accounting principles, the upfront revenue recognition sought by Qwest.  According to the Commissions findings, Qwest improperly recognized from the three IRU transactions $26.6 million of revenue in the first and second quarters of 2001, which contributed to Qwests ability to meet its revenue targets for those quarters.  As a result, Qwests quarterly reports for the first and second quarters of 2001, its annual report for 2001, and Qwests earnings releases for those periods, contained materially false information., Without admitting or denying the findings in the Commissions Order, Cruciotti has agreed to settle the Commissions claims by consenting to the entry of an administrative order requiring him to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder, and from causing any violations and any future violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13 thereunder, and to pay disgorgement plus prejudgment interest thereon in the amount of $200,000. , The Commissions complaint in the district court action alleges the same conduct referenced above.  The Commission expects the penalty to be distributed pursuant to the Fair Fund provisions of Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18755.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18755.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The SECs complaint names Helvetia Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Richard A. Anders, Nicholas Bachynsky, Arthur Scheinert, and Laurence Dean as defendants.  The complaint alleges that defendants raised money by making fraudulent statements to investors that the money would be used to operate cancer treatment clinics., According to the SECs complaint, Helvetia was a Coral Springs, Florida-based company that purported to treat cancer patients using a unique, patented therapy using heat to destroy cancer cells.  Helvetia, through Anders, Bachynsky, Scheinert and Dean, raised more than $3 million from approximately 50 investors from about January 2001 through at least August 2002, through the sale of unregistered Helvetia stock and promissory notes.  Anders held himself out as Helvetias president, Bachynsky was the companys medical director, Scheinert was Vice President and Dean was CFO., The SECs complaint alleges that the defendants used false and misleading information in Helvetias offering materials distributed to investors to raise investor funds.  Among other things, the SECs complaint alleges that the defendants failed to tell investors that: , Anders was convicted of securities fraud and that Bachynsky was convicted of defrauding the IRS and that his medical license was revoked;, Helvetias drug therapy included the use of Dinitrophenol (DNP), a banned, hazardous substance commonly found in weed killers;, Four Helvetia investors sued Helvetia, Anders and Scheinert for misrepresentations related to Helvetias securities offering; and, Investor money was not being used to fund treatment clinics, but instead was used by Helvetia insiders for personal reasons, The SECs complaint also alleges that the defendants:, Made exaggerated claims about Helvetias anticipated returns; and, Made false claims of an imminent public offering, The SECs complaint charges Helvetia, Anders, Bachynsky and Scheinert with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 [15 U.S.C. §§ 77e(a), 77e(c) and 77q] and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [15 U.S.C. §§ 78j(b)] and Rule 10b-5 thereunder [17 C.F.R. 240.10b-5].

Pa.)</h2>]","[The Commission announced that on June 22, 2004, it filed a civil action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, against Landis Associates, LLC (Landis), a registered investment adviser located in Kennett Square, PA; its principal, Michael L. Hershey (Hershey), who resides in Kennett Square, PA; Tremont Medical, Inc. (Tremont), a medical technology company located in Aston, PA; and Robert D. Lear (Lear), Tremonts former Chief Financial Officer, who resides in Warrington, PA.  The complaint seeks a permanent injunction; disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, together with prejudgment interest; and the imposition of civil penalties against each of the defendants., The complaint alleges that Hershey, individually and through Landis, egregiously misused client funds and breached his fiduciary duty to a wealthy client (the Defrauded Client) by investing in Tremont, a privately held start up company, of which Hershey was a director and shareholder.  Hershey continued to make these investments long after it was clear that the Defrauded Clients account was Tremonts only source of capital and that these investments were worthless., The Commissions complaint alleges that Hershey used his full discretion over the Defrauded Clients investments to authorize undocumented, uncollateralized, and interest-free cash advances of $8.1 million, which were falsely characterized by Lear and Tremont as purchases of Tremont common stock.  The Commission further alleges that Hershey authorized cash advances to Tremont on an open-ended line of credit totaling $4.5 million, which transactions were effected for Tremont through Lear.  The complaint charges that Hershey, acting through Landis, concealed the true nature of these transactions, and the resulting decline in value of the Defrauded Clients account, by sending monthly advisory statements he knew to be false. , As a result, the Commission alleges, the Defrauded Clients managed account was overvalued by more than $30 million.  Further, because Hershey liquidated many of the Defrauded Clients other investments to make cash available for transfer to Tremont, the complaint alleges that, by the time that the Defrauded Clients account with Landis and Hershey was closed in June 2001, the account had lost nearly 70% of its value and the Defrauded Client had lost all of the money that Hershey invested in Tremont., The complaint charges the defendants with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, thereunder, as well as violating and aiding and abetting violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 204 of the Investment Advisers Act, and Rules 204-2(a)(3) and (7), thereunder., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18757.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18757.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Burke (Burke), the former chief financial officer of Interspeed, Inc. (Interspeed), a now defunct Internet hardware developer formerly located in North Andover, Massachusetts.   Burke, of Andover, Massachusetts, without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, settled the matter by consenting to the entry of an injunction against future violations of the antifraud, periodic reporting, record keeping and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-13 and 13b2-1, and Rule 13b2-2, which prohibits officers of a company from lying to auditors.  In addition, Burke agreed to pay disgorgement of a performance bonus in the amount of $41,240, plus prejudgment interest in the amount of $9,804 and a civil penalty of $25,000, for a total of $76,044 and to be permanently barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company., The Commissions complaint alleged that Burke recorded contingent sales as revenue even though he was aware of side terms which made revenue recognition improper.  In addition, the complaint alleged that Burke altered accounting records to keep Interspeeds outside auditors from discovering that the sales were shams.  Through the alteration, the complaint alleged, Burke made it appear that Interspeed was receiving payment for one of the sales when in fact Interspeed itself was providing funds to the customer to make the payments, a fraudulent practice known as round-tripping.  , According to the complaint, Interspeeds directors uncovered the fraudulent scheme in late September 2000, and the company restated its financial results for the first three quarters of its fiscal year ended September 30, 2000, reducing its originally reported revenue of $14 million to $5 million.  Burke resigned in August 2000.  , Earlier, in a related criminal case, Burke pleaded guilty and was sentenced to three years probation and a $10,000 fine in connection with criminal charges filed against him by the U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts arising from the same fraudulent reporting scheme.   , For further information see Litigation Releases Nos. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17758.htm>17758</a>, <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18180.htm>18180</a> and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18468.htm>18468</a>., <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18758.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Wilmington Trust consented to the imposition of the penalty without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  Wilmington Trust Company, a Delaware corporation, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Wilmington Trust Corporation., According to the complaint, between September 2000 and July 2003, Wilmington Trust failed to maintain current and accurate master securityholder files for the debt securities for which it acted as transfer agent.  In particular, the complaint alleges that Wilmington Trust did not verify that the actual payments it processed were accurately recorded in the master securityholder files.  By January 2003, almost 2,000 recordkeeping items on Wilmington Trusts master securityholder files, totaling in excess of $5.8 billion, had not been reconciled against the actual payments processed.  Wilmington Trust also did not reconcile the principal balances in the master securityholder files with those in the control book.  When Wilmington Trust ultimately reconciled its records, it found 17 active debt issues for which the principal balances in the master securityholder files differed from those in the control book by approximately $185 million.  The complaint alleges that although these record differences did not represent any actual cash payment errors or financial loss to any issuers or shareholders or to Wilmington Trust, they did represent recordkeeping errors that, in many instances, had existed for one or more years., The complaint further alleges that Wilmington Trust failed to timely report these aged record differences to the issuers or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and failed to disclose the aged record differences in its Forms TA-2.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Wilmington Trust failed to either provide reports to its Board of Directors or the Audit Committee of its Board of Directors or file an independent accountants report with the FDIC and Commission concerning the adequacy of the internal accounting controls for its transfer agent operations., The complaint alleges that as a result of the conduct described above Wilmington Trust violated Section 17A(d)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 17Ad-10(a), 17Ad-10(b), 17Ad-11(b), 17Ad-11(c), 17Ac2-2 and 17Ad-13 thereunder.

Cal.)</h2>]","[Washington, D.C., June 23, 2004 -- The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a complaint in federal court in Los Angeles charging Gemstar-TV Guide International, Inc. with improperly reporting its highly touted interactive program guide licensing and advertising revenues in its financial statements from 1999 through 2002., Gemstar agreed to settle the case by, among other things, paying a $10 million civil penalty.  That money will be distributed to harmed shareholders pursuant to Section 308 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.  In assessing the penalty amount, the Commission considered the scope and severity of Gemstars misconduct, Gemstars initial failure to cooperate in the Commissions investigation or undertake remedial actions, and Gemstars significant cooperation and remediation following a change in senior management and restructuring of its corporate governance., Gemstar is a Los Angeles-based media and technology company that is publicly traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market.  Among its business activities, Gemstar publishes TV Guide magazine and develops, licenses, and markets an interactive program guide (IPG), which is a technology that enables consumers to navigate through and select television programs.  During the relevant period, Gemstar generated revenues from the IPG by licensing the technology to third parties and selling advertising space on the IPG., The Commissions complaint alleges that Gemstar materially overstated its revenues by nearly $250 million through the following means., First, Gemstar recorded revenue under expired, disputed, or non-existent agreements, and improperly reported this as IPG licensing and advertising revenue.  , Second, Gemstar recorded and reported revenue from a long-term agreement on an accelerated basis in contravention of GAAP and Gemstars own stated and disclosed revenue recognition policy, which required the recording and reporting of such revenue ratably over the terms of the agreement., Third, Gemstar inflated its IPG advertising revenue by improperly recording and reporting revenue amounts from multiple-element transactions.  Gemstars recording and reporting of this revenue was improper under GAAP because Gemstar could not determine the IPG advertisings fair value.  Additionally, some of those improperly reported transactions included so-called round-trip transactions whereby Gemstar paid money to a third party that then used those funds to buy advertising from Gemstar.  Gemstar also failed to disclose that it had structured certain settlements for the purpose of creating cookie jars of IPG advertising revenue. , Fourth, Gemstar improperly recorded and reported IPG advertising revenue from non-monetary and barter transactions.  Gemstars recording and reporting of this revenue was not in accordance with GAAP because it did not meet the revenue recognition requirements for such transactions and because Gemstar could not properly establish the IPG advertisings fair value., Finally, Gemstar improperly reported certain revenues as IPG advertising revenues when in fact those revenues were derived from the sale of print advertising.  Gemstar shifted revenues by invoicing advertisers for both IPG and print advertising, but recording the revenue only as IPG revenue., The misstatements of revenue were reported in Forms 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K filed with the Commission.  These public statements misrepresented Gemstars true financial performance and failed to disclose material information about that performance.  The complaint further alleges that when Gemstar disclosed in its 2001 Form 10-K filed on April 1, 2002, that revenue from two transactions had been recorded under an expired licensing agreement and in a non-monetary transaction, Gemstars stock price declined by approximately 37% the next day., As part of its settlement, Gemstar, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, agreed to a permanent injunction against future violations of the periodic reporting provisions of Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13, recordkeeping provisions of Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act, and internal controls provisions of Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act., In determining to accept Gemstars settlement offer, the Commission considered the following factors, among others, relating to the companys cooperation and remedial efforts:, In April 2002, immediately after Gemstar filed its 2001 Form 10-K, the Commission contacted Gemstar and commenced an investigation.  For nearly the next eight months, while Gemstars former CEO and other senior officers remained in place, the company did not conduct a thorough or comprehensive internal investigation and did not take other appropriate remedial action, even when presented by the Commission with specific evidence of fraudulent conduct., As a result of its inadequate investigation, in August 2002 Gemstar issued a restatement reversing only approximately $20 million in revenue.  Gemstar consequently continued to report overstated revenues to the investing public even after the Commissions investigation began., In November 2002, in connection with the restructuring of its corporate governance, Gemstar replaced its CEO, CFO, and general counsel and adopted extensive new internal controls.  The company also retained a new independent auditor and a new independent outside counsel.  , Following the change in senior management, Gemstar (i) initiated a comprehensive investigation and re-audit of its financial statements; (ii) restated its financials three more times, reversing revenues by a total of $377 million; (iii) provided extensive and valuable assistance to the Commission in its investigation; and (iv) voluntarily agreed not to make certain extraordinary severance payments to its former CEO and CFO for over six months, among other things., Additional information can be found in Litigation Release No. 18530 (January 6, 2003), No. 18199 (June 20, 2003), No. 18135 (May 13, 2003), and No. 18095 (April 18, 2003).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18760.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The complaint alleges that FairPaxs descriptions of its mutual fund are taken verbatim and without authorization from the description of the high yield mutual fund offered for sale by Pax World on its website.  FairPax also falsely identified Laurence A. Shadek as its chairman and Thomas W. Grant as its president.  In fact, Laurence A. Shadek and Thomas W.

Finally, the Commissions complaint alleges that the defendants promoted their fraudulent scheme with promises of a 657% annual return.  , The Commission alleged in its complaint that FairPax violated anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically Sections 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The Complaint alleges that in April 2003, Talbot bought stock in LendingTree, Inc. (LendingTree), after learning at a meeting of the Fidelity Board of Directors that LendingTree would be acquired by another company. , According to the Complaint, on April 22, 2003, at a Fidelity Board Meeting, Fidelitys Chief Executive Officer (CEO) told Talbot and other Fidelity board members that LendingTree would soon be acquired by another company at a significant premium over its then-current trading price.  At the time of the meeting, Fidelity owned 12% of LendingTree.   At the Fidelity Board meeting, the Complaint alleges, Talbot heard the CEOs comments about the potential acquisition, and wrote LendingTree on the top of his meeting agenda.   These words constituted the only notes that Talbot made during the four-hour Board meeting.  The Complaint alleges that after this information was conveyed to the Board of Directors, a Fidelity Board member cautioned the directors not to trade in LendingTree securities because they had been provided with confidential information. , The Complaint alleges that two days after the Board meeting, however, Talbot breached the fiduciary duty he owed to Fidelity and purchased 5,000 shares of LendingTree common stock at $13.50 per share on the basis of the material, non-public information he misappropriated from Fidelity.   According to the Complaint, Talbot similarly purchased an additional 5,000 shares of LendingTree at $14.50 per share on April 30, 2003.  The Complaint further alleges that on May 5, 2003, the day that USA Interactive announced that it would acquire LendingTree, Talbot sold his 10,000 shares of LendingTree stock, realizing illicit profits of $67,881.20.  , The Complaint alleges that by engaging in the foregoing conduct, Talbot violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Under the terms of the final judgment, entered by consent, Simon was ordered to pay approximately $525,000 in disgorgement, interest, and a penalty.  He was also enjoined from further violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder., The Commission filed an emergency enforcement action against Simon on Monday, October 28, 2003, only hours after Bank of America announced its acquisition of FleetBoston, and less than three days after Simon purchased FleetBoston securities.  In its complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, the Commission alleged that Simon engaged in illegal insider trading when he bought FleetBoston securities late on Friday, October 24, while in possession of material, non-public information about the acquisition that was announced the next trading day.  The day it filed its complaint, the Commission also sought a temporary restraining order and asset freeze against Simon.  Judge Nancy Gertner granted the order freezing Simons trading account and prohibiting him from transferring or disposing of the securities or any trading proceeds.  The Commission obtained the order before the transaction was concluded and as a result, was able to freeze the account before any profits could be removed or dissipated. , Specifically, the Commissions complaint alleged that Simon, a former employee at FleetBoston=s Buenos Aires office, purchased 1100 November FleetBoston call options during the last hours of trading on Friday, October 24, 2003, at a cost of about $11,000.  The complaint alleged that Simon=s options purchase represented over 50% of the total trading volume in that series of call options that day.  The complaint alleged that before the market opened on Monday, October 27, FleetBostons acquisition was announced.  In the wake of the announcement, the price of FleetBoston=s stock and call options rose dramatically, with Simons call options increasing in value by $473,000 as of the close of the day.  The complaint alleged that Simons conduct violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5. , Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, Simon consented to the final judgment entered by the court on June 9 in this matter.  The judgment permanently enjoined him from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Simon was also ordered to pay disgorgement of $473,000, prejudgment interest of $1,576.67, and a civil penalty of $51,842.36, representing the entire proceeds frozen by the court.  , In its complaint, the Commission had also named Simons wife and brother, who shared the account through which Simon traded, as co-defendants.

Measurement Specialties, Inc., and Kirk J. Dischino, 04 Civ. 3000 (KSH)(D.N.J.)</h2>]","[On June 28, 2004, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action in United States District Court for the District of New Jersey charging Measurement Specialties, Inc. (MSI), a New Jersey-based manufacturing company, with accounting fraud, and its former chief financial officer, Kirk J. Dischino, with accounting fraud and insider trading.  Both defendants have agreed to settle the Commissions charges, without admitting or denying the allegations.  MSI has agreed to pay a penalty of $1 million.  Dischino has agreed to pay disgorgement and penalty totaling in excess of $450,000, and agreed to be suspended from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant., The Commissions complaint alleges that Dischino orchestrated and carried out two separate accounting frauds at MSI.  First, the complaint alleges that, from June 2000 through September 2001, at Dischinos direction, MSI materially overstated its earnings by capitalizing overhead expenses into inventory in a manner that was inconsistent with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and that Dischino knew or was reckless in not knowing would mislead investors about MSIs earnings and the value of its inventory.  In a manner clearly inconsistent with GAAP and over the repeated objections by MSI operating division heads and internal accounting personnel, Dischino shifted certain manufacturing and overhead costs to inventory, through accounting adjustments he termed production credits.  As a result of the production credit adjustments, MSI materially overstated its earnings and its inventory in its financial statements covering the periods ending June 30, 2000 through September 30, 2001.  For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2001, largely as a resulted of the production credit adjustments, MSI overstated its pre-tax income by 435%, and for the quarters ended June 30, 2000 and June 30, 2001, the use of the production credit converted an actual loss to a reported gain.  The false and misleading financial statements were contained in the companys periodic public filings and a registration statement for an offering of MSI stock that occurred on August 1, 2001 and raised $31.2 million. , Second, the complaint alleges that, from at least October 2001 until February 2002, Dischino concealed MSIs default under its loan agreements.  In connection with the preparation of the companys quarterly report for the period ended September 30, 2001 - which did not disclose the default -- Dischino allegedly falsely represented to MSIs senior management, directors, and outside auditors that the lenders had waived the default.  To substantiate his claim, Dischino allegedly fabricated a written waiver by the lenders, which he provided to MSIs auditors.  The complaint further alleges that Dischino engaged in insider trading by selling MSI stock in December 2001 while he was aware of the true facts of MSIs overstated earnings and inventory, and its default, thereby avoiding losses of $215,734.  , On October 28, 2002, MSI restated its previously reported financial results for the each of the reporting periods from the quarter ended June 30, 2000 through the quarter ended December 31, 2001, to correct for Dischinos erroneous inventory accounting, and other errors.  The restatement reduced the value of MSIs inventory by $12.2 million, or 28%.  The complaint alleges that MSI should have restated its financial results for those periods earlier, rather than simply taking a charge for the quarter ended December 31, 2001, which it announced on May 31, 2002.  The complaint does not charge MSI with any violations as a consequence of its quarterly report for the December 31, 2001 quarter., The Commissions complaint alleges that by engaging in this conduct, the defendants violated antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and also violated, or are secondarily liable for MSIs violations of, numerous reporting, record-keeping and internal control provisions.  Specifically, the complaint alleges that: (1) MSI violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), and Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-11 and 13a-13 thereunder; and (2) Dischino violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder, and pursuant to Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, as a control person, Dischino is liable for MSIs violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13 thereunder.  , Without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, MSI and Dischino have agreed to settle the charges by consenting to permanent injunctions against further violations of the relevant antifraud, reporting, books-and-records, and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws.  In addition, MSI has agreed to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1 million, along with nominal disgorgement of $1.  Dischino has also agreed to pay disgorgement of $215,734, plus prejudgment interest of $21,932, and a civil penalty of $215,734.  In addition, Dischino has also agreed to consent to the entry of an administrative order suspending him from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant., As alleged in the complaint:, MSI is a New Jersey corporation with its principal place of business in Fairfield, New Jersey.  MSI designs, manufactures and markets a variety of sensors for electronic, automotive, military and other uses.  During the relevant period, MSI had subsidiaries and facilities located in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania; Milpitas, California; Hampton, Virginia; Slough, UK; and Shenzhen, China.  , Dischino, age 45, was MSIs chief financial officer and treasurer from February 1998 until February 14, 2002, when he was fired.  Dischino, a certified public accountant, resides in Waldwick, New Jersey., The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the United States Attorneys Office for the District of New Jersey, and Special Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigations and the United States Postal Inspection Service in the investigation of this matter., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18765.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18765.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Goldman and Mark D. Hanson</i>, Civil Action No. 04-CV-5130 (GBD) (S.D.N.Y.)</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a civil action against Siebel Systems, Inc., charging that Siebel violated Regulation FD and a Commission cease-and-desist order.  Two senior Siebel executives, Kenneth A. Goldman, the companys chief financial officer, and Mark D. Hanson, a current senior officer and the companys former Investor Relations Director, are charged with aiding and abetting Siebels violations. , The Commission also charged Siebel with violating Exchange Act Rule 13a-15, which requires issuers to maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure the proper handling of information that is required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act, and to ensure that management has the information it needs to make timely disclosure decisions.  This is the first Commission case charging a violation of this rule., Regulation FD prohibits issuers from selectively disclosing material nonpublic information to certain persons-securities analysts, broker-dealers, investment advisers and institutional investors-before disclosing the same information to the public.  In November 2002, the Commission issued an <a href=/litigation/admin/34-46896.htm>order</a> finding that Siebel violated Regulation FD and requiring Siebel to cease and desist from committing or causing any future violations.  Siebel settled that matter without admitting or denying the Commissions findings.  As part of the settlement, Siebel also agreed to pay a $250,000 civil penalty.  <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17860.htm>See Lit. Rel. No. 17860 / November 25, 2002.</a>, The Commissions Complaint alleges that, six months after the cease-and-desist order was issued, Goldman disclosed material nonpublic information during two private events he attended with Hanson in New York on April 30, 2003, a one-on-one meeting with an institutional investor and an invitation-only dinner hosted by Morgan Stanley.  The Commission charges that, at both the meeting and the dinner, Goldman made positive comments about the Companys business activity levels and transaction pipeline that materially contrasted with negative public statements Siebel made about its business in the preceding several weeks.  According to the Complaint, based on Goldmans comments in the April 30 meeting, an institutional investor converted its 108,200 share short position in Siebel stock into a 114,200 share long position-a net change of 222,400 shares.  On May 1, 2003, the day following the private meetings, the companys stock price closed approximately 8% higher than the prior days close, and the trading volume was nearly twice the average daily volume for the preceding year., The Commission alleges that Hanson, who had been put in charge of Siebels Regulation FD compliance, failed to prevent the selective disclosures, and that both Hanson and Goldman failed to cause Siebel to make a public disclosure the next day.  Finally, the Complaint alleges that Siebel failed to maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure the proper handling of information that is required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act and to ensure that management has the information it needs to make timely disclosure decisions.  , The Commissions Complaint charges Siebel with violating, and Goldman and Hanson with aiding and abetting Siebels violations of, the Commissions cease-and-desist order, Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Regulation FD thereunder by making an intentional selective disclosure of material nonpublic information or, alternatively, a non-intentional selective disclosure.  The Commissions Complaint also charges Siebel with violating Section 13(a) and Rule 13a-15 thereunder for its failure to maintain adequate disclosure controls and procedures.  The Commission is seeking an order commanding Siebel to comply with the Commissions cease-and-desist order, permanent injunctions and civil penalties against all defendants, and other equitable relief to ensure that Siebel adopts adequate Regulation FD compliance policies and practices and that it maintains adequate disclosure controls and procedures., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18766.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18766.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Jacobs with, among other things, conspiracy, wire fraud, securities fraud and making false filings with the Commission.  Masferrer was also charged with insider trading.  Masferrer, Bernace and Jacobs are the former senior executive officers of Hamilton Bancorp, Inc. (Hamilton).  If convicted, defendants face a maximum term of imprisonment of thirty (30) years and a fine of up to $1 million on each wire fraud count, a maximum term of ten (10)  years imprisonment and a fine of $1 million on each securities fraud count, and a maximum term of five years imprisonment and a fine of up to $250,000 for each count of conspiracy and the other charges contained in the Indictment., The Indictment charges that in 1998 and 1999, Masferrer, Bernace, and Jacobs engaged in swap transactions (or adjusted price trades) to hide Hamiltons losses, including $22 million-plus losses in 1998, and falsely accounted for the transactions to make it appear that no losses had been incurred.  As a result, the Indictment alleges that Masferrer, Bernace, and Jacobs fraudulently inflated the reported results of operations and financial condition of Hamilton Bancorp and defrauded the investing public and bank and securities regulators, so that they would unjustly enrich and benefit themselves through higher salaries, bonuses, and stock options, and would facilitate an upcoming registered securities offering to the investing public.  Masferrer made nearly $2 million in bonuses, and Bernace and Jacobs each made more than $100,000 in bonuses while the fraud was concealed.  In addition, the Indictment charges that while the fraud was concealed, Masferrer engaged in illegal insider trading in Hamilton Bancorps stock through the use of trust accounts., The indictment derives from the same activity that led to the Commissions filing of its complaint against Masferrer, Bernace and Jacobs in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida on September 25, 2003.  The Commissions complaint alleged that, as a result of the conduct described above, the defendants violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and aided and abetted Hamiltons violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.  The complaint further alleged that Bernacé and Jacobs violated, in addition to the above provisions, Rule 13b2-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act.  The Commission sought permanent injunctions, officer and director bars, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, plus prejudgment interest, and the imposition of civil money penalties against the defendants. On April 6, 2004, the Court entered, with Bernaces consent, a Final Judgment of Permanent Injunction and Other Relief as to Bernace.

The Complaint alleges that the Defendants, acting in concert, fraudulently offered and sold over $131 million of municipal revenue bonds to members of the public., The SECs Complaint alleges that the Defendants offered and sold the bonds in question through a series of eleven offerings underwritten by the now-defunct, Minnesota firm of Miller &amp; Schroeder Financial, Inc. (Miller &amp; Schroeder).  The Complaint alleges that the Defendants sold the bonds to more than 1,800 investors residing in thirty-six states.  The Complaint alleges that the purported purpose of each bond offering was to finance the development of a specified healthcare facility by Heritage Housing Development, Inc., a company effectively controlled by Defendant Kasirer (Heritage). The Complaint alleges that all together, there were ten Heritage facilities located in the states of Texas, Florida, Illinois and California.  The Complaint alleges that the Defendants represented in offering documents that the proceeds from each bond offering would be used to finance one specific healthcare facility.  The Complaint alleges that in fact, however, the costs of developing the Heritage facilities, including payments to Defendant Kasirer and some of his family members, outstripped the proceeds from the facilities respective bond offering.  The Complaint alleges that the Defendants covered the resulting cash shortfalls by operating a type of Ponzi scheme, commingling bond proceeds and diverting bond proceeds from more recent offerings to pay the expenses of earlier projects.   The Complaint alleges that this diversion of bond proceeds from one project to another went on for three years.  The Complaint alleges that beginning in February 2000, the Heritage facilities ran out of money and defaulted on their obligations to bondholders.  Presently, all the Heritage facilities are in default on their bonds.    , The Complaint alleges that Defendants Kasirer and Goldstein controlled Heritage and personally directed the commingling and misapplication of bond proceeds and that Defendants Iverson and Dhooge, representatives of Miller &amp; Schroeder, managed the underwriting of the various bond offerings, despite their knowledge that bond proceeds were being wrongfully commingled and diverted.  The Complaint alleges that Defendant Boehm, an attorney who acted as counsel for Miller &amp; Schroeder in the bond offerings, issued favorable legal opinions despite his knowledge that bond proceeds were being wrongfully commingled and diverted.  , The Commission seeks the entry of permanent injunctions, disgorgement of any ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and civil penalties against Kasirer, Goldstein, Boehm, Iverson and Dhooge. , <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18774.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18774.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

ABB Ltd</i>, Case No. 1:04CV1141 [RBW] (U.S.D.C., D.D.C.)</h2>]","[On July 6, 2004, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a settled enforcement action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia charging ABB Ltd, a global provider of power and automation technologies headquartered in Zurich, Switzerland, with violating the anti-bribery, books-and-records, and internal-accounting-controls provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).  Simultaneously with the filing of the complaint, and without admitting or denying its allegations, ABB consented to the entry of a final judgment enjoining it from future FCPA violations, and requiring it (i) to pay $5.9 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, (ii) to pay a $10.5 million penalty, which would be deemed satisfied by two of its affiliates payments of criminal fines totaling the same amount in parallel criminal proceedings brought by the Department of Justice; and (iii) to retain an independent consultant to review the companys FCPA compliance policies and procedures., In its complaint, the Commission charged that, from 1998 through early 2003, ABBs U.S. and foreign-based subsidiaries doing business in Nigeria, Angola and Kazakhstan, offered and made illicit payments totaling over $1.1 million to government officials in these countries.  According to the complaint, all of the payments were made to influence acts and decisions by the foreign officials receiving the payments, in order to assist ABBs subsidiaries in obtaining and retaining business.  The complaint further alleged that the payments were made with the knowledge and approval of certain management level personnel of the relevant ABB subsidiaries, and that at least $865,726 of the payments were made after ABB became a reporting company in the United States in April 2001.  Finally, the complaint charged that ABB improperly recorded these payments in its accounting books and records, and lacked any meaningful internal controls to prevent or detect such illicit payments., According to the Commission, by making these payments through its subsidiaries, ABB violated the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA (Section 30A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934).  The Commission further charged that, by improperly recording these payments, ABB violated the books-and-records provisions of the FCPA (Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934).  Finally, the Commission charged that, by failing to devise or maintain an effective system of internal controls to prevent or detect these violations of the FCPA, ABB violated the internal accounting controls provisions of the FCPA (Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934)., In determining to accept ABBs settlement offer, the Commission considered the full cooperation that ABB provided to the Commission staff during its investigation.  The Commission also considered the fact that ABB brought this matter to the attention of the Commissions staff and the U.S. Department of Justice.  Based in part upon ABBs cooperation, the Commission determined to allow ABBs $10.5 million civil penalty obligation to be deemed satisfied by two of its affiliates payments of criminal fines totaling $10.5 million in a parallel criminal proceeding brought by the U.S. Department of Justice. , In that parallel proceeding, also announced today, the U.S. Department of Justice filed criminal FCPA charges against two ABB subsidiaries, who entered guilty pleas before the Honorable Vanessa Gilmore, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Texas:  Houston-based ABB Vetco Gray, Inc., and Aberdeen, Scotland-based ABB Vetco Gray UK, Ltd.  (<i>United States v. ABB Vetco Gray, Inc. and ABB Vetco Gray UK, Ltd.</i>, Case No. 04-CR-279-01 (S.D. Texas)).  In particular, ABB Vetco Gray, Inc. and ABB Vetco Gray UK, Ltd. each agreed to plead guilty to two felony counts of violating the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA and to pay criminal fines that, between them, total $10.5 million., The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Department of Justice in its investigation, which is continuing. , <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18775.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18775.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Lay, former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Enron Corp., for violating, and aiding and abetting violations of, the antifraud, periodic reporting, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws. [Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, and for aiding and abetting the violation of Sections 13(a), and 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of the Exchange Act, and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20 and 13a-11].  In this action, the Commission is seeking disgorgement of all ill-gotten gains, civil money penalties, a permanent bar from acting as a director or officer of a publicly held company, and an injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws., The Commission today, subject to the approval of the Honorable Melinda Harman, U.S. District Court Judge, filed a Second Amended Complaint seeking to add Lay to its pending action against Jeffrey K. Skilling, Enrons former President, CEO and Chief Operating Officer, and Richard A. Causey, Enrons former Chief Accounting Officer.  The proposed Second Amended Complaint alleges that Lay and others engaged in a wide-ranging scheme to defraud by falsifying Enrons publicly reported financial results and making false and misleading public representations about Enrons business performance and financial condition.  In addition, the proposed Second Amended Complaint alleges that Lay profited from the scheme to defraud by selling large amounts of Enron stock at prices that did not reflect its true value.  The sales also occurred while Lay was in possession of material non-public information concerning Enron and generated unlawful proceeds in excess of $90 million during 2001.  Specifically, Lay sold over $70 million in Enron stock back to the company to repay cash advances on an unsecured Enron line of credit.  In addition, while in possession of material non-public information, Lay amended two program trading plans to enable him to sell an additional $20 million in Enron stock in the open market.  Lays proceeds from the sales constitute illegal gains resulting from his scheme to defraud., Specifically, the Commissions Proposed Second Amended Complaint alleges as follows:, Lays Early Participation in the Scheme to Defraud.  Lay, along with others at Enron, engaged in a wide-ranging scheme to defraud in violation of the federal securities laws.  During 2001, with specific knowledge of rapidly deteriorating performances of Enrons business units, Lay made numerous false and misleading public statements about Enrons financial condition.  As Enrons Chairman and CEO, Lay had oversight of Enrons business units and supervised the senior executives and managers of these units, reviewed drafts of public filings and draft press releases, and participated in conference calls with investment analysts., In presentations to the investing public, Lay and others heavily emphasized the performance and potential of Enron Broadband Services (EBS) and Enron Energy Services (EES).  To support what Enron had already said about EES, Lay and others concealed massive losses in EES business through fraudulently manipulating Enrons business segment reporting.  They accomplished this at the close of the first quarter of 2001 through a reorganization designed to conceal the magnitude of EES business failure, which was known to Lay as early as January 2001.  With Lays approval, Enron hid that failure from the investing public by moving large portions of EES business - which Lay and others knew at the time would have to otherwise report hundreds of millions of dollars in losses - into Enron Wholesale, which was the Enron business segment housing most of the companys wholesale energy trading operations and income.  As Lay and others knew, Enron Wholesale had ample earnings to absorb the EES losses, while at the same time continuing to meet its own internal budget targets.  Lay made the false and misleading statements to persuade investors that Enrons profitability would continue to grow, to maintain credit ratings, to influence investment analysts, and to prop up the share price of Enron stock., Lay knew of Enrons use of structured transactions - specifically prepays and the infamous Raptors - to misstate its financial results.  Enron entered into circular transactions that were characterized as prepay forward contracts in order to disguise borrowings as cash from operations.  Lay was aware of the importance and magnitude of prepay transactions to create operating cash flow and thereby maintain Enrons investment grade credit rating.  Lay was aware that the credit rating agencies were not told the magnitude of Enrons prepay obligations and that this information was not disclosed in Enrons public filings. In addition, Enron created the Raptor structures to hedge volatile assets against any potential decline in value.  The manner in which Enron structured and funded the Raptors meant that any hedging losses in the Raptors would ultimately be borne by Enron.   Lay understood that Enron used the Raptors for earnings management and that decreases in the price of Enron stock threatened the viability of the Raptors., Lay Knowledge of Additional Problems Following Skillings Resignation.  On July 13, 2001, Skilling unexpectedly told Lay he was resigning because he felt there was nothing he could do to stop the decline in Enrons stock price.  On August 14, Enron issued a press release, with Lays approval, that announced Skilling had resigned for personal reasons.  In a conference call with investment analysts later that same day, Lay repeatedly asserted that, there are absolutely no problems that had anything to do with Jeffs departure . . . there are no accounting issues, no trading issues, no reserve issues . . . unknown, previously unknown problems, issues . . . I can honestly say that the company is probably in the strongest and best shape . . . that its probably ever been in.  Regarding EES, Lay offered that weve been doubling revenue and doubling income quarter on quarter, year on year for now about the last three years.  We expect that to continue to grow very, very strong. . . ., After Skilling resigned, Lay met repeatedly with Enrons senior management, who described for him Enrons deteriorating financial condition.  Lay was advised internally of accounting improprieties regarding the Raptors and that various assets and investments were overvalued on Enrons books and records by approximately $7 billion.  During this period, Lay repeatedly received internal financial reports consistent with these problems.  In August and September, senior executives informed Lay that Enron was facing an increasing earnings shortfall, hundreds of millions of dollars in losses, a proposed non-recurring charge relating to certain investments, and an accounting error in excess of $1 billion.  Enrons problems were so severe that a senior executive informed Lay that Enron needed to consider being acquired or selling its prized pipelines., Lay Continued to Mislead the Public - August and September 2001.  Despite specific knowledge of Enrons deteriorating financial condition, Lay continued to make false and misleading public statements about Enrons financial performance.  In meetings with research analysts and in public statements, Lay falsely and misleadingly stated there were no accounting issues, no reserve issues, and no other shoes to fall at Enron.  Lay made a series of false and misleading statements during an Enron employee online forum, including that: [t]he third quarter is looking great.  We will hit our numbers.  We are continuing to have strong growth in our businesses, we have record operating and financial results, and the balance sheet is strong.  In addition, Lay misled Enron employees regarding his purchases of Enron stock when he informed them that he had purchased additional shares over the last couple of months.  In making this statement, Lay concealed that he had made net sales of over $20 million in Enron stock in the preceding two months., The October 16, 2001 Third Quarter Earnings Release.  In a meeting with other senior executives one month prior to Enrons third quarter earnings release, Lay learned that Enron had incorrectly accounted for the Raptor transactions, and as a result, Enron shareholders equity would be reduced by $1.2 billion.  Lay also knew that the Raptors were being terminated and combined with other pending write-downs that would result in an earnings charge of $1.01 billion.  Specifically, Lay knew that these two items - the $1.01 billion earnings charge and the $1.2 billion reduction of shareholder equity - were unrelated, and that the reduction to shareholders equity was required whether or not the Raptors were terminated.  Lay reviewed and approved Enrons earnings release that reported a nonrecurring earnings charge of $1.01 billion, a majority of the charge ($544 million) relating to the early termination of the Raptors.  Lay knew that the characterization of the termination of the Raptors as nonrecurring losses was erroneous and inconsistent both with advice Enron had received from its auditor and Enrons past treatment of Raptor earnings as recurring operating earnings.  Lay and others intentionally omitted any reference to the $1.2 billion equity reduction from the press release.  In a conference call with analysts to discuss the earnings release, Lay falsely stated that in connection with the early termination of the Raptors, Enrons shareholders equity would be reduced by $1.2 billion.  Lay did not disclose, as he knew, that the reduction was principally due to a significant accounting error, as opposed to the termination of the Raptors., Lays Last Ditch Efforts -- October and November 2001.  In an effort to calm deepening public concern regarding the decline in Enrons stock price, Lay participated in conference calls with analysts and others.  In these calls, Lay made false and misleading statements regarding Enrons financial health.  For example, Lay stated, [Enron is] not trying to conceal anything.  Were not hiding anything, and [w]ere really trying to make sure that the analysts and the shareholders and the debt holders really know whats going on here.  So, we are not trying to hold anything back.  In a telephone call with a prominent credit rating agency, Lay falsely stated that Enron and its auditors had scrubbed the companys books and that no additional write-downs would be forthcoming.  In fact, Lay knew that Enron was carrying its international assets at billions in excess of their fair value and that Enron had failed to disclose a $700 million goodwill impairment.  In an all-employee meeting to reassure Enrons employees, Lay falsely described Enrons liquidity, stating that [o]ur liquidity is fine.  As a matter of fact, its better than fine, its strong. . .  At the time he made the statement, Lay knew that Enron had been forced to offer its prized pipelines as collateral for a $1 billion bank loan and that the only source of liquidity was a $3 billion line of credit, which was fully utilized on Lays authority.  In addition, Lay made misleading statements about Enron stock and its prospects.  Lay misleadingly stated, as sad as the current market price is . . . [b]ut were going to get it back and that doesnt mean we cant get back up to the $80s or $90s in the not-too-distant future.  At the time he made the statement, with Enron stock trading at less than $20 per share, Lay did not disclose that he had quietly sold over $65 million of Enron stock back to the company during 2001., Lays Sales of Enron Stock Back to Enron.  From January 25, 2001 to November 27, 2001, Lay took advances on a non-collateralized $4 million line of credit with Enron in the total amount of $77,525,000.  Thereafter, in twenty separate transactions, Lay repaid the credit line by selling $70,104,762 worth of Enron stock back to the company, at prices he knew did not accurately reflect Enrons true financial condition.  For example, after learning of Enrons undisclosed plan to hide over $500 million in EES losses in ENA, Lay sold 1,086,571 shares of Enron common stock back to the company, in 11 transactions, for a total of $34,081,558.  Following Skillings resignation on August 14, 2001, at a point when Lay was learning more about Enrons deteriorating financial condition, Lay sold 918,104 shares of Enron common stock back to the company, in five transactions, totaling $26,066,474.  As Lay tried to prop up Enrons stock price following Enrons third quarter earnings release on October 16, 2001, Lay sold 362,051 shares of Enron stock back to the company, in four transactions, totaling $6,050,232.  Enrons shareholders and employees, much less the public, did not learn of Lays sales of Enron stock back to the company until February 2002, over two months after Enron filed for bankruptcy protection., Lay also made withdrawals from his line of credit totaling $7.5 million between October 24 and November 27, 2001, at a point when Enrons financial condition was crumbling., Lays Sales of Enron Stock Pursuant to Amended 10b5-1 Plans.  On November 1, 2000, Lay established two program sales plans under Commission Rule 10b5-1.  Subsequently, Lay amended both plans.  At the time Lay amended both plans, he was in possession of material nonpublic information concerning Enrons deteriorating financial condition, meaning Lay cannot use the plans as a defense to insider trading charges.  Under the amended plans, Lay unlawfully sold over 350,000 Enron shares for total proceeds in excess of $20 million., The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Enron Task Force. , The Commissions investigation is continuing., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18776.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18776.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Arrested were Daniel William Heath, 47, of Chino Hills, his father, John William Heath, 77, of Covina, Denis Timothy OBrien, 50, of Yorba Linda, and Larre Jaye Schlarmann, 46, of Carlsbad.  All four men have been charged by the Riverside DA with 233 felony counts, including selling unqualified securities, selling securities by misrepresentation, violating a court order to desist and refrain from selling securities, elder abuse, grand theft, burglary, and money laundering.  All four men have been booked and are in custody.  Bail is set at $144 million for each individual.  Two of the men arrested, Daniel Heath and OBrien, were named in an emergency civil injunctive action filed by the Commission on April 28, 2004 in federal court in Los Angeles.  The Commissions complaint alleges that Daniel Heath and OBrien lured elderly victims to workshops with the promise of a free lunch and then bilked them out of their retirement money by purporting to sell them safe, guaranteed notes.,  According to the Riverside DAs criminal complaint, the men operated D.W. Heath &amp; Associates, Inc., Private Capital Management, Inc. (PCM), Private Collateral Management, Inc., and the PCM Fixed Income Fund I, LLC (PCM Fund), as well as other investment entities with offices in Hemet, Brea, Pasadena, and Big Bear.  The defendants raised at least $144 million from hundreds of elderly investors.  The Riverside County DA conducted the arrests and executed criminal search warrants at the homes of Schlarmann and John Heath.  The Riverside DA had previously executed criminal search warrants at the offices of Heath &amp; Associates offices and at Daniel Heaths home at the time the Commission filed its complaint, and shortly thereafter, at OBriens home.  The Riverside County DA also sought asset freezes against defendants Schlarmann, John Heath, and OBrien. , The Commissions complaint alleges that Daniel Heath, OBrien, Heath &amp; Associates, PCM, Private Collateral Management, Inc., and the PCM Fund fraudulently induced at least 803 elderly investors nationwide to invest in notes in PCM and the PCM Fund (PCM notes) that purportedly paid a guaranteed return of 5.5% to 8% per year.  The defendants claimed that investor funds would be used to make secured loans to businesses.  The defendants also represented that independent IRA administrators conducted due diligence on the PCM notes, and that investors would be repaid their principal at maturity, or that they could redeem all or part of their investment before maturity, subject to a penalty.  Finally, the defendants claimed that PCM and the PCM Fund were California entities.According to the Commissions complaint, these representations were false.  The Complaint alleged that the loans were secured.  Further, the PCM notes were not liquid because the defendants failed to promptly return investor funds.  According to the SEC complaint, some investors had to threaten to file, or actually file, lawsuits against the defendants to get back their money.  Nor was it true that IRA administrators conducted due diligence.  Finally, there was no record that either PCM or the PCM Fund was a California legal entity., In its lawsuit, the Commission obtained an order freezing the assets of all defendants (except OBrien), an accounting, an order preventing destruction of documents, an order expediting discovery, and an order temporarily enjoining all of the defendants from future violations of the securities registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  At a hearing on May 3, 2004, the court appointed Robb Evans and Associates as temporary receiver over Heath &amp; Associates, PCM, Private Collateral Management, Inc., and the PCM Fund. On May 6, 2004, the court entered preliminary injunctions against all the defendants.  On May 18, 2004, the court appointed Robb Evan and Associates as permanent receiver.  , In its action, the Commission is seeking permanent injunctions, and other relief, including disgorgement and civil penalties against all defendants., See also:  L.R. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18689.htm>18689</a> / May 3, 2004,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18777.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Sport-Haley, located in Denver, Colorado, designs, markets, and contracts for the manufacture of golf apparel and outerwear under the Haley-Registered Trademark label.  According to the Complaint, LHM, a certified public accounting firm audited Sport-Haleys 1998 and 1999 financial statements.  The Commission asserts that LHM issue audit reports containing unqualified opinions on Sport-Haleys financial statements even though the firm knew or was reckless in not knowing the companys 1998 and 1999 financial statements materially misstated work-in-process (WIP) inventory, improperly capitalize period costs and materially misstated losses on the sale of headwear equipment.  The Commission also alleged that, after LHM learned of the investigation of Sport-Haley and had received requests from the Commission for documents relating to LHMs audit of Sport-Haleys financial statements, LHM personnel added information to the audit workpapers, improperly altered some of the original audit workpapers, disposed of some Sport-Haley documents in LHMs office, and destroyed review notes that had been created as part of LHMs review of past Sport-Haley audits., LHM agreed to settle the charges against the firm, without admitting or denying the allegations contained in the Commissions complaint.

Harkless of Riverside, California should not be held in civil contempt for failing to comply with the Courts Preliminary Injunction and Orders of March 8, 2004.  According to the SECs court papers, Harkless has not complied with the courts orders to provide accountings to the SEC and repatriate assets to the United States.  According to the SEC, Harkless also has dissipated assets and taken action on behalf of Mx Factors without the consent of the court or the court-appointed receiver, in direct contravention of the March 8th orders.  Should the Court hold Harkless in civil contempt, the SEC asked that the Court impose a sanction sufficiently coercive to compel his compliance with the orders.  Specifically, the SEC asked the Court to incarcerate Harkless, levy a daily fine, and confiscate his passport until Harkless complies with the orders.  The Court set a hearing for July 15 at 10:00 a.m. on the Commissions contempt application., According to the SECs contempt application, since March 8, at least $264,290 has been transferred from Mx Factors-related bank accounts in Belize to Olocun, S.A. de C.V., a crab fishing operation run by Harkless in Ensenada, Mexico.  Harkless also has failed to provide the receiver with access to any of Mxs records still in his possession or under his control and has failed to provide the SEC with accountings, even though he was to have delivered them to the SEC by March 18, 2004.  In addition, Harkless has not repatriated any assets or other property held in foreign locations, even though he was required to repatriate those assets over three months ago.  The SEC also presented the Court with evidence that Harkless traveled outside the United States recently.   , The SEC filed a complaint against Harkless and his co-defendants on February 26, 2004, in federal court in Riverside, alleging that the defendants fraudulently induced at least 247 investors nationwide and in Mexico to invest over $35 million in the notes of Mx Factors, LLC, which purportedly paid a guaranteed return of 12% in 60 or 90 days.   Mx Factors actually was operating a Ponzi scheme and used at least $19.9 million in new investor funds to pay existing investors.  The SEC obtained orders freezing each of the defendants assets, appointing a permanent receiver over Mx Factors, BBH Resources, LLC and JTL Financial, LLC, requiring Mx Factors and Harkless to repatriate assets from abroad, and preliminarily enjoining all of the defendants from future violations of the securities registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The orders also preliminarily enjoined defendants BBH Resources, JTL Financial, Daniel J. Berardi, Jr., Thomas Hawkesworth, and Randall W. Harding from future violations of the broker-dealer registration provisions.  The SEC also seeks other relief, including disgorgement and civil penalties, against all defendants.  In June, Berardi, Hawkesworth and Harding consented to permanent injunctions against future violations of the securities laws as well as permanent bars from associating with any broker or dealer.

Rose, et al.,</i> Civil Action No. H-04-CV-2799 (S.D. Texas)</h2>]","[On July 9, 2004, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil complaint against Harris D. Butch Ballow and twelve other individuals, alleging that they carried out a manipulation of two stocks, EpicEdge, Inc., and EVTC, Inc.  The complaint alleges that Ballow orchestrated the manipulation, and the other defendants include three associates of Ballow (Hector J. Garcia, Marvin M. Mike Barnwell, and Frank H. Moss) two former officers of EVTC (George J. Cannan, Sr. and David A. Keener), two former officers of EpicEdge (Charles H. Leaver and Carl R. Rose), three registered representatives at securities firms where Ballow and his associates traded the stocks (Mark K. Menzel, Earl Shawn Casias, and George J. Cannan, Jr.) and two other securities industry professionals (Lawrence A. Clasby, an investment adviser, and Stacey J. Blake, a former registered representative)., All defendants are charged with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Sections 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Defendant Clasby is also charged with violating the antifraud provisions in Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers Act).  Defendants Ballow, Garcia, Barnwell, Cannan, Sr., Cannan, Jr., Menzel, Casias, Clasby and Blake are charged with violating Rule 101 or 102 of Regulation M, an antimanipulation rule that prohibits persons involved in a stock distribution from purchasing stock during the distribution.  Defendants Ballow, Garcia, Barnwell, Moss, and Cannan, Sr. are charged with violating the stock ownership reporting provisions in Sections 13(d)(1) and 16(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13d-1, 13d-2, and 16a-3 thereunder.  Defendants Ballow, Garcia, Barnwell, Moss, Cannan, Sr., Keener, Cannan, Jr., Menzel, Casias, Clasby and Blake are charged with violating the securities registration provisions in Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act.  Defendants Cannan, Sr., Keener, Leaver, and Rose are charged with aiding and abetting violations by EVTC or EpicEdge of the periodic reporting provisions, Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1, 13a-11, and 12b-20 thereunder.  Defendants Garcia and Blake are charged with acting as unregistered broker-dealers, in violation of Section 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act., The stock prices for EVTC and EpicEdge followed similar trajectories after Ballow, a four-time convicted felon, acting with the approval of management of each company, allegedly began systematically acquiring undisclosed but significant interests in the companies in 1999.  According to the complaint, Ballow, acting largely through off-shore corporations, engaged in heavy trading designed to create artificial volume in the stocks and interfere with the true supply and demand for the stocks.  Both stocks rose sharply throughout most of 2000, then simultaneously collapsed in September 2000 when Ballow was no longer able to support the prices.  The collapse not only hurt investors, but also the broker-dealers who made large margin loans to Ballows off-shore companies and to Cannan, Sr., The complaint alleges that the scheme began when Ballow and Moss engineered a merger between a private company owned by Rose and a public shell, creating EpicEdge.  EpicEdge then issued new stock to Ballow, registered on Form S-8, which put Ballow in control of the EpicEdge public float.  Ballow then gained control over EVTC by acquiring restricted stock and used his EpicEdge stock to finance massive purchases of EVTC stock, enabling Ballow to take control of the market for EVTC stock as well.  Cannan, Sr. helped the scheme by purchasing large amounts of EpicEdge stock in the market, using his own EVTC stock as collateral, thereby propping up the value of Ballows EpicEdge stock and enabling Ballow to continue buying EVTC stock., Garcia and Barnwell participated in the scheme by ordering trades through accounts controlled by Ballow at various brokerage firms and by selling EpicEdge and EVTC stock owned by Ballow in off-market transactions designed to raise cash for Ballow without depressing the price of the stocks.  Blake and Clasby also participated in these off-market sales,  promoted the stocks to friends and, in Clasbys case, clients.  Keener, Leaver, and Rose provided Ballow with information necessary to carry out the schemes.  Cannan, Jr. and Menzel executed trades for Ballow and Cannan family members, and Casias executed trades for Ballow, that carried out the scheme, at a time when they perceived or recklessly disregarded red flags that Ballow was engaging in a manipulation.  The manipulative trades included marking the close, massive purchases of EVTC stock on margin by off-shore companies that dried up the float of EVTC, and simultaneous or near-simultaneous buying and selling of the stocks., The Commission seeks permanent injunctions against all defendants, as well as equitable relief in the form of disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18780.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>, <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18780.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Hughes of the Southern District of Texas entered a Final Judgment against Ian Schottlaender, a former Managing Director with Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) in New York City.  Schottlaender consented to the Judgment.  The Judgment resolves the Commissions claims against Schottlaender in the civil action filed against him, CIBC and others on December 22, 2003.  As part of the Judgment, Schottlaender agreed to pay approximately $528,000 in disgorgement, penalties and prejudgment interest., In its complaint, the Commission alleged that Schottlaender, among others, aided and abetted Enrons manipulation of its reported financial results through a series of complex structured finance transactions over a period of several years preceding Enrons bankruptcy.  The 34 financings were structured as asset sales for accounting and financial reporting purposes, allowing Enron to hide from investors and rating agencies the true extent of its borrowings.  Between June 1998 and October 2001, Enron used these disguised loans to increase reported earnings by more than $1 billion, to increase reported operating cash flows by almost $2 billion, and to avoid disclosure of more than $2.6 billion in debt on its financial statements.  Enrons alternative, borrowing money using the assets as collateral, would have given Enron access to cash to meet its operating expenses, but carried with it financial reporting consequences -- increased debt, no positive effect on cash flow, and no positive effect on earnings -- that would have had a detrimental impact on Enrons credit rating and stock price.  , Schottlaender consented, without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud, books and records, and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws [Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and (B), and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13 and 13b2-1].  In addition, Schottlaender has agreed to pay a total of $528,750: disgorgement of $249,000, a penalty of $249,000 and prejudgment interest of $30,750, and has agreed to the entry of an order barring him from serving as an officer or director of a publicly traded company for a period of five years.  The Commission intends to have these funds paid into a court account pursuant to the Fair Fund provisions of Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Fair Fund) for ultimate distribution to victims of the fraud., The Commission brought this action in coordination with the U.S. Department of Justice Enron Task Force, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the Canadian Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions., The Commissions investigation is continuing., <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18782.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The disgorgement amount represents funds received by Gladle as a result of his alleged unlawful conduct.  The Court enjoined Gladle from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and (c) of the Securities Act, and the broker-dealer registration provisions of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act. Without admitting or denying the allegations against him contained in the Commissions complaint, Gladle consented to the entry of the Final Judgment., According to the complaint, which was filed on March 2, 1999, Gladle and his company, TrendsGroup International, Inc., and other co-defendants violated various registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws in connection with the unregistered nationwide sales of securities issued by three general partnerships organized to develop specialized mobile radio systems (i.e., paging systems) in Albany, New York, Reno, Nevada and Anchorage, Alaska.  The Commissions complaint further alleged that Gladle functioned as a broker by selling the securities, although he was not registered as a broker as required by applicable securities laws.  The Commissions complaint also alleged that Gladle used high pressure, sales tactics in marketing the partnership units and had materially misrepresented the nature of the paging systems operation, their projected costs of development, and the projected returns, both in telephone conversations with potential investors and in documents sent to potential and actual investors., Today, the Commission also instituted settled administrative proceedings against Gladle.

Medical Disposal claimed to manufacture and sell the Needlyzer, a device which purportedly destroyed hypodermic needles safely.  Medical Disposal, however, never successfully commercially manufactured or sold the Needlyzer.  Judge Dorsey also found that Medical Disposal, LaTouche and Cartelli made false and misleading statements to induce investors to purchase investment contracts and notes.  For example, the Defendants told investors that the FDA approved the Needlyzer, when, in fact, the FDA had not.  The Defendants told investors that a company in New York manufactured the Needlyzer for Medical Disposal, when, in fact, no company was manufacturing the Needlyzer for Medical Disposal.  The Defendants told investors that Medical Disposal had negotiated contracts with foreign companies to purchase the Needlyzer, when, in fact, no such contracts existed.  The Defendants also told investors they would use their funds to manufacture Needlyzers, when, in fact, LaTouche and Cartelli used investors funds for personal purposes and to operate Medical Disposals other purported business., Judge Dorsey permanently enjoined Medical Disposal, LaTouche and Cartelli from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and barred LaTouche and Cartelli from serving as officers or directors of a public company.

In addition, the press releases made baseless projections about future orders with entities that lacked the financial wherewithal to consummate the deals., The complaint also alleges that Morrell and Haines reviewed and signed a Form 10-KSB that CyberCare filed with the Commission in April 2000 that they knew contained some of the same false information included in the press releases. , Finally, the complaint names as a defendant Paul Bornstein, a former registered representative of Connecticut Capital Markets LLC.

The complaint alleges, however, that the research report failed to disclose that at least part of Bornsteins optimism about CyberCare resulted from his simultaneous employment by CyberCares public relations firm.  CyberCare had hired the public relations firm in October 1999, and paid the public relations firm a monthly fee of $4,000, plus 24,000 shares of CyberCare stock.  The public relations firm, in turn, paid Bornstein a monthly salary of approximately $7,500., Based on this alleged misconduct, the complaint charges Morrell and Haines with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and, as control persons pursuant to Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, for CyberCares violations of Sections 10(b) and 13(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, and 13a-1 thereunder.

Relief defendant Edward Kaufer and defendant Brooksbank were ordered to pay, jointly and severally, disgorgement of $213,150.97 plus interest., The Commission filed this action in March 1998, alleging that certain defendants offered and sold securities of Electro-Optical in violation of the registration and anti-fraud provisions of the securities laws.  Brooksbank, Franklin, and Hantges, in concert with now-settled defendant George Chachas, were the principal shareholders of Curbstone, a shell corporation that merged with a private company, WTS Transnational, Inc. (WTS) in late 1997 to form Electro-Optical.  They sold over 2.5 million Curbstone management shares to certain nominee shell companies in Spain and provided the nominees options to acquire additional management shares, which were restricted securities that could not be resold to public investors unless pursuant to registration or an exemption.  These shares of Curbstone, which after the companys merger with WTS became shares of Electro-Optical, were soon resold to the public in a massive unregistered distribution in which Cavanagh and Nicolois (together with their now-deceased lawyer William Levy) pumped up the Electro-Optical stock price and pocketed millions of dollars., Judge Cote issued a preliminary injunction in April 1998, having found that the Commission had shown a substantial likelihood of success in proving that the defendants had violated the registration and antifraud provisions of the securities laws.  The injunction was affirmed on appeal.  In October 1998, the action was stayed due to the criminal investigation and prosecution of Cavanagh, Nicolois, and Levy for false statements made in connection with this litigation.

Specifically, the complaint alleged that Grubbs and Jackson, through Church Extension and UMS, embarked on a fraudulent scheme to cover up financial difficulties suffered by Church Extension and UMS from investors.  The complaint also alleged that instead of using investment note proceeds primarily to fund church loans as stated in the offering circulars, investor proceeds were used to fund speculative real estate transactions and to make interest and principal payments to prior investors., At trial, the jury determined that Grubbs and Jackson each violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The Commission charged Cash Link Systems Inc. (Cash Link) and its president, Alan Levine (Levine), with securities fraud in connection with an unregistered interstate securities offering involving cashless automated teller machines (ATMs).  The Complaint alleges that over $10 million has been raised from 680 investors nationwide.  At the request of the Commission, the Court entered a temporary restraining order halting the offering, issued orders to conserve assets for the benefit of the schemes victims, including an asset freeze, the appointment of a receiver, and an accounting.  , Named as defendants are:, According to the Complaint, the defendants are soliciting investors through an aggressive marketing campaign, including national television and newspaper advertisements.  Cash Link offers a purported turnkey ATM investment in which investors are told that they can expect a conservative return of $2,100, or 18%, <i>per month</i>, on a minimum $11,685 investment.  In addition to providing the ATMs, Cash Link agrees to place the machines in high traffic business locations, service the machines after placement, and collect and distribute the transaction fees, which are supposedly shared with investors., The Commission contends that these and other claims are false and misleading in that Cash Link has failed to deliver ATMs to certain investors and has consistently failed to place investor-owned ATMs in high traffic locations as represented.  The defendants have also failed to disclose that the few machines, which have been placed, have generated very little return for investors.  Moreover, even in the few cases, in which there is some return, Cash Link has failed to distribute most of the funds to investors.  Further, investors are not being advised that the company and Levine are the subjects of two state-issued cease-and-desist orders related to this ATM scheme, and a federal criminal investigation in which company records were recently seized.   , The <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18791.pdf>Commissions Complaint</a> charges Cash Link and Levine with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Willey </h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia alleging David M. Willey of Great Falls, Virginia, former Chief Financial Officer of Capital One Financial Corporation, engaged in insider trading in the securities of Capital One.  According to the complaint, the examiner in charge of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors examination of Capital One advised Willey that the Fed was likely to downgrade Capital Ones supervisory assessment, and that such a downgrade would result in some form of supervisory action.  Without informing other members of senior management or the Capital One Board of Directors of this material information, Willey engaged in a series of transactions in Capital One stock in May 2002 and obtained profits in stock and cash through his fraudulent trading valued at several million dollars.  , More specifically, the Commissions complaint alleges that on April 18, 2002, Willey met one-on-one with the examiner in charge of the Feds then ongoing review of Capital One.  During their one-on-one meeting, the examiner told Willey that the Fed was likely to downgrade the banks supervisory assessment and that such a downgrade was likely to result in a supervisory action, including a possible Memorandum of Understanding (MOU).  Willey did not provide Capital One senior management or board of directors with this critical adverse information.  Instead, on May 9 and 13, 2002, Willey exercised over 147,000 of his Capital One stock options through a series of stock swaps and cashless exercises, selling a significant number of Capital One shares on the market and earning Willey proceeds in stock and cash worth several million dollars.  , Subsequently, on May 13, 2002, representatives of the Fed informed other senior management at Capital One of the likely downgrade and supervisory action.  Upon learning this information, Capital Ones General Counsel placed an immediate ban on all senior management from trading in Capital One securities.  Willey, however, had already completed his transactions.  The Fed finalized its supervisory assessment of Capital One in July 2002, determining that it would require an MOU as its supervisory action.  On July 16, 2002, after the market closed, Capital One issued a press release announcing the MOU.  Capital Ones stock price plummeted 40% after the disclosure., In addition, the Commissions complaint alleges that Willey filed a Form 4 disclosure statement with the Commission that failed to report two of his May 2002 options exercises totaling 46,800 shares., The Commission is seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, an officer/director bar, and a civil penalty against David M.

LOUIS EX-CON IN FRAUDULENT STOCK SCHEME</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil complaint on July 6, 2004, against St. Louis businessman Hershey Moss.  The Commissions complaint alleges that Moss misrepresented the business plan for his company, National Pizza Corporation, in the companys registration statement for its initial public offering.  The registration statement portrayed National Pizza as a legitimate start-up company, when in fact Moss intended to sell it as a shell company to a privately-held company.  As alleged in the complaint, Mosss subterfuge allowed the company to evade regulatory scrutiny aimed at preventing common abuses (such as market manipulations) arising out of such shell company mergers., National Pizzas registration statement, filed with the Commission in February 2002, stated that the company intended to develop a national network of frozen pizza distributors.  When asked by the staff of the Division of Corporation Finance, Moss affirmed that the company had no plans to seek a business combination in the near future.  In fact, according to the complaint, at the same time Moss was making such representations, he was secretly negotiating the sale of National Pizza as a valuable public shell corporation to a private company.  Shortly after National Pizzas registration statement became effective and it became a public company, Moss closed the deal with the private entity, selling his shell company for approximately $500,000 cash and 440,000 shares in the merged company.  , Once the merger was completed, the new San Francisco-based company (then known as BSP Onelink, and later renamed One Link 4 Travel, Inc.) applied to the NASD to list shares of its stock on the OTC Bulletin Board.  Because the merger appeared to be inconsistent with National Pizzas public filings purporting to pursue a pizza business, the NASD raised questions about the timing of the merger negotiations.  According to the complaint, Moss falsely assured the NASD that he did not change his intention to run a pizza business until after the company became public.  Following Mosss misrepresentations, the NASD approved the travel companys listing application, allowing the shares to be listed on the OTC Bulleting Board.  Moss subsequently sold a portion of his shares on the open market for approximately $120,000., The suit, brought in federal district court in San Francisco, charges Moss with making false and misleading statements in connection with the companys public offering (in violation of Sections 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933) and misleading the NASD in connection with the listing of the stock for public trading (in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder)., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18795.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>, <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18795.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

(Ahold) by $700 million or more in SEC filings and other public announcements for at least fiscal years 2001 and 2002.  Resnick, Kaiser, Lee, and Carter were top executives at Columbia, Maryland based wholesale food distributor U.S. Foodservice (USF), a major subsidiary of Ahold.  The complaint alleges that they grossly inflated reported profits and induced numerous suppliers to submit false confirmations to the companys auditors in order to conceal their fraud.  The Commission alleges that Resnick, Kaiser, Lee and Carter violated the antifraud provisions; aided and abetted violations of the reporting provisions; and violated and aided and abetted violations of the books and records provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act). , The Commission also alleges that Lee engaged in repeated instances of tipping material, nonpublic information regarding Aholds April 2000 tender offer acquisition of U.S. Foodservice.  As a result of the tipping, an associate of Lee realized profits of at least $363,000 from trading in the stock of U.S. Foodservice.  The Commission alleges that Lee, through his insider tipping, violated the antifraud provisions of the Exchange Act. , The Commission seeks a final judgment ordering the defendants to disgorge all ill-gotten gains, including performance based-bonuses; imposing civil money penalties; barring each of them from serving as an officer or director of a public company; and enjoining each of them from future violations, or aiding and abetting violations, of Exchange Act Sections 10(b), 13(b)(5), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B), and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13b2-1.  The Commission also seeks a final judgment enjoining Lee from future violations of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule14e 3, and ordering Lee to disgorge jointly and severally the trading profits of his tippees., The Commissions complaint alleges that compensation for Resnick, Kaiser, Lee and Carter was based, in part, on USFs ability to meet or exceed budgeted earnings targets.  They each received a substantial bonus in early 2002 because USF purportedly satisfied earnings goals for fiscal year 2001.  They were each eligible for a substantial bonus if USF met earnings targets for fiscal year 2002.  They engaged in or substantially participated in a scheme whereby USF booked to budget -- reporting earnings equal to or greater than the targets, regardless of the companys true performance., The primary method used to carry out the fraudulent scheme to book to budget was to improperly inflate USFs promotional allowance income.  A significant portion of USFs operating income was based on payments by its suppliers, usually referred to as promotional allowances.  In a typical promotional allowance arrangement, USF would pay the full wholesale price for a product, then receive rebates of a portion of that price from the supplier if certain purchase volume and other conditions were met.  They booked to budget by, among other things, causing USF to record completely unsupported promotional allowances sufficient to cover any shortfall to budgeted earnings.  When questioned by Aholds independent auditors about the promotional allowances recorded, Resnick, Kaiser and Lee are alleged to have provided false and misleading justifications. , The Commissions complaint alleges that the defendants covered-up the false earnings by making it appear that the inflated promotional allowance income had been earned by, among other things, (a) inducing suppliers to confirm false promotional allowance income, payments, and receivable balances; (b) manipulating the promotional allowance receivable and manipulating and misapplying cash receipts; and (c) making false and misleading statements, and material omissions, to the companys independent auditors, other company personnel, and/or Ahold personnel., The Commissions complaint describes how Kaiser, Lee, and Carter, in order to keep the fraud from being discovered, participated in a systematic effort to corrupt the audit process.  Aholds auditors attempted at the end of each fiscal year to confirm with the vendors that they actually had paid, or still owed, the promotional allowances recorded by USF.  The suppliers were convinced by Kaiser, Lee, and Carter to sign audit confirmation letters even though they knew that the letters were false., Resnick, Kaiser, and Lee, in order to prevent the discovery of the fraudulent scheme, took various additional steps to make it appear that USFs promotional allowance receivable balance was being paid by the suppliers.  Among other things, they made, or caused to be made, accounting entries that unilaterally deducted material amounts from the balances that USF owed to the suppliers for the products USF had purchased, and simultaneously credited the promotional allowance receivable balance for the amount of such deductions.  These deductions were made at year-end and had the net effect of making it appear that USF had made material progress in collecting promotional allowance payments allegedly due.  Resnick, Kaiser, and Lee concealed the fact that the deductions were not authorized, were not legitimate, and that a substantial percentage of the deductions were reversed in the early part of the following fiscal year, The Commission further alleges that Resnick, Kaiser, Lee and Carter also knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that the amounts paid by some suppliers included prepayments on multi-year contracts.  But they falsely represented to USF personnel, Ahold personnel, and/or the companys independent auditors that none of the promotional allowance agreements included such prepayments.  As a result, USF treated the prepayments by suppliers as if they were payments for currently owed promotional allowances.  This made it falsely appear that USF was making material progress in collecting the inflated promotional allowance income it had recorded., The Commissions investigation is continuing.

Marano, a former senior analyst in the Life Insurance Group (Life Group) at Standard &amp; Poors Financial Rating Services (S&amp;P), his brother, William Marano, and Carl Loizzi (Loizzi), a friend and former business partner of William Maranos.  On two separate occasions, Rick Marano misappropriated material, non-public information obtained through his employment regarding proposed business transactions and tipped that information to William Marano and Loizzi.  In total, the unlawful trading produced profits of over $1,100,000., The United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York, on the same day, announced criminal charges against Rick A. Marano, William Marano and Carl Loizzi.  Rick Marano, William Marano and Carl Loizzi are charged with conspiracy to commit securities fraud and securities fraud., The Complaint alleges that:, Rick Marano, as a senior analyst in the Life Group at S&amp;P, owed a fiduciary or other duty of trust and confidence to S&amp;P and its clients to keep confidential all non-public information he obtained in the course of his employment with S&amp;P., Nevertheless, in late April 2000, through his employment at S&amp;P, Rick Marano misappropriated material, non-public information regarding a potential transaction involving ReliaStar Financial Corporation (ReliaStar) and ING Groep (ING), and, on or about April 27, tipped that information to his brother, William Marano and/or Loizzi.  Within seventy minutes of that tip, Rick Marano, William Marano and Loizzi all began purchasing ReliaStar call option contracts.  The defendants purchased 410 of the 501 May 35 ReliaStar call option contracts that were purchased on April 27.  Neither Rick Marano nor William Marano had ever before purchased ReliaStar options.  The following day, April 28, before the public news release announcing INGs proposed acquisition of ReliaStar, William Marano and Loizzi both purchased additional ReliaStar call option contracts.  Loizzi also bought 2,000 shares of ReliaStar common stock.  Based upon news of the proposed acquisition, ReliaStar common stock closed at $44 per share on April 28, up approximately 42% from its opening price of $31.75.  Loizzi, William Marano and Rick Marano reaped trading profits of approximately $596,000, $200,000 and $83,000, respectively, on their sales of ReliaStar securities., Approximately one year later, Rick Marano again misappropriated material, non-public information regarding a potential acquisition and tipped William Marano and/or Loizzi.  On April 2, 2001, Rick Marano learned of a potential acquisition of American General Corporation (AGC) by American International Group (AIG) when he and others in the Life Group attended a meeting at AIGs offices.  The next day, April 3, after the tip from Rick Marano, William Marano and Loizzi purchased AGC call option contracts.  Loizzi and William Marano purchased 606 of the 614 April 40 AGC call option contracts purchased on April 3.  Neither William Marano nor Loizzi had ever before purchased AGC securities.  Later that day, AIG announced its plan to acquire AGC.  Based upon news of the proposed acquisition, AGC stock closed at $42 on April 4, up approximately 15% from its April 3 closing price of $36.80.  Loizzi and William Marano reaped trading profits of approximately $253,000 and $20,000, respectively, on the sale of their AGC options., In its Complaint, the Commission requests that the Court issue a final judgment of permanent injunction and other relief restraining and enjoining the defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The Commissions complaint alleges that, on several occasions between April 2001 and July 2002, Wirelesss accounting group identified errors in its accounting for revenue from the sale of mobile phone products and services.  For example, between at least January 2000 and September 2001, Wireless improperly recorded revenue from mobile phone accessories that were given to customers for free as an inducement to buy other products and services.  These revenue recognition errors caused Wireless, and hence Qwest, to overstate revenue by about $57 million in 2000, $46 million in 2001, and $9 million during the first two quarters of 2002., The Commissions complaint further alleges that over the course of several months between September 2001 and July 2002, the Wireless accounting group estimated the amount by which Qwest had overstated revenue based on the errors and, on numerous occasions, informed Felicissimo of its conclusions.  Rather than telling the president of Wireless or other higher-level Qwest executives about the overstatements, Felicissimo concealed, and directed others to conceal, those overstatements.  For example, after viewing a document in about July 2002 showing that the accounting group estimated that Qwest had overstated revenue by about $20 million in 2000, $33 million in 2001, and $9 million through the first two quarters of 2002 based on all of the errors, Felicissimo told a Wireless accountant to bury the document. , The Commissions complaint seeks an order against Felicissimo enjoining him from further violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1, and from aiding and abetting violations of Exchange Act Sections 10(b), 13(a), and 13(b)(2) and Rules 10b-5, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13; imposing civil money penalties; ordering disgorgement of all ill-gotten gains, including compensation, bonuses, and stock trading profits made during the relevant period; and barring him from acting as a director or officer of a publicly held company., The Commissions investigation into the conduct of others is continuing., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18800.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18800.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

In its complaint, the Commission charged Scrivo with violations of the antifraud, reporting, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act).  The Commission also announced that it instituted settled cease-and-desist proceedings and proceedings pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the Commissions Rules of Practice against Vicons former CFO Leslie Wasser.  In the cease-and-desist proceeding, the Commission made findings that Wasser violated those same sections., In its complaint, the Commission alleged that Scrivo engaged in a fraudulent scheme to inflate Vicons inventories in its 1999 year-end financial statements by including inventory, which did not exist.  In furtherance of the scheme, Scrivo fabricated documents that reflected non-existent inventory and as a result, Vicons reported net loss was decreased by 22% in its 1999 financial statement.  Scrivo subsequently attempted to conceal and to reverse the overstated inventory by falsely reporting in Vicons second quarter 2000 Form 10-Q that the inventory was defective and had been scrapped. , Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, Scrivo consented to the entry of a final judgment enjoining him from violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2), and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder.

The jury returned its verdict after a three-day retrial presided over by U.S. District Judge Anne C. Conway., In its complaint, filed on February 3, 1999, the Commission alleged that on or before Tuesday, February 18, 1997, Yuns husband, then an officer of Scholastic, told Yun in confidence that Scholastic would announce that it expected a loss for the quarter ending February 28, 1997, and that the price of Scholastic common stock would likely decline as a result.  Yun breached her duty of confidence and disclosed the inside information at a cocktail party that Tuesday evening to her friend and colleague of six years, Jerry Burch.  During the following two days, Burch purchased 130 Scholastic put option contracts, including 10 February contracts that expired within 48 hours, that would rise in value if Scholastics stock price went down.  After Scholastic released its negative earnings announcement on February 20, 1997, Scholastics common stock price dropped approximately 40 percent, from $61.50 to $36.75.  On February 21, Burch exercised his options for a net profit of approximately $269,000 - a 1300 percent return on his two-day investment.     , The case had previously been tried in December 2000.  In the first trial, the jury also found both Yun and Burch liable for insider trading.  However, on appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit vacated the district courts judgment based on prejudicial error in the district courts jury instructions.  The appeals court remanded the case for a second trial., At the second trial, the jury determined that Yun and Burch had violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  At a later date, Judge Conway will determine the appropriate relief against Yun and Burch, which may include permanent injunctions, disgorgement of the ill-gotten gains, and civil penalties. , Related Litigation Releases:, <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17360.htm>No. 17360</a>, February 12, 2002<br/><a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr16840.htm>No. 16840</a>, December 21, 2000<br/><a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr16052.txt>No. 16052</a>, February 3, 1999, <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18805.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

These misstatements caused IBP to materially misstate its own financial results for the fourth quarter of 1999 and the first three quarters of 2000.  Specifically, the Commission alleges that Zahn, Sexauer, and Berryman directed that DFG not charge certain expense items in the period they were incurred, but instead improperly included these amounts in inventory, prepaid expense, and accounts receivable asset accounts to overstate DFGs earnings.  The Commission alleges that each of the defendants was motivated by personal compensation tied to DFGs financial performance., In its complaint, the Commission claims that, through these actions, each of the defendants violated Section 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder, and aided and abetted IBPs violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 thereunder.  It further claims that Zahn and Berryman violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 13a-13 thereunder.  The Commission seeks a final judgment enjoining all of the defendants from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering the defendants to disgorge ill-gotten gains, and imposing civil monetary penalties.  The Commission also seeks an order barring Zahn and Berryman from serving as an officer or director of a public company., Simultaneously with the filing of the complaint, Sexauer consented to the entry of an injunction against him prohibiting him from future violations of all of the provisions the Commission claims he violated.  Sexauer also agreed to pay full disgorgement of his ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $35,000.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18809.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The complaint, filed on May 1, 2003 in the U.S. District Court in Houston, charged Rice and other executives from EBS with fraud and insider trading.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, Rice has agreed to be enjoined permanently from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, and to be barred permanently from acting as an officer or director of a public company.  The Commission settled its action in coordination with the Justice Departments Enron Task Force, which entered into a guilty plea with Rice on related criminal charges.  In resolving the parallel civil and criminal proceedings, Rice has agreed to pay disgorgement and a civil penalty totaling more than $14.7 million and to cooperate with the governments continuing investigation., As alleged in the Commissions complaint, Rice and other EBS executives engaged in a wide-ranging fraudulent scheme to, among other things, inflate the value of Enron stock through a series of false and misleading statements and the omission of material information in such public statements about the technology, financial condition, performance and value of EBS.  The false and misleading statements by Rice and others were made in press releases over a two-year period as well as in presentations and statements made at Enrons annual analyst conferences in January 2000 and 2001.  As a result of the false statements, Enrons stock price was artificially inflated.  Rice then sold large amounts of Enron stock at the inflated levels, at a time when he knew that the statements were false and misleading and when he was in possession of material non-public information concerning the true status of EBS technology and commercial success.     , The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Enron Task Force.

Pursuant to the Commissions motion, the Honorable Legrome D. Davis issued an order temporarily enjoining the defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940; freezing the defendants assets; appointing a receiver; granting expedited discovery; and scheduling a hearing on the Commissions motion for a preliminary injunction for August 5, 2004., The Commissions Complaint alleges that, from November 2001 through the present, Postiglione and Lennon have raised approximately $5 million for the Fund from at least 18 private investors. Through a series of fraudulent acts, defendants Postiglione and Lennon, acting through FAM, have obtained assets fraudulently, have lulled investors into keeping their assets in the Fund, and have misused investor funds.  The Complaint alleges that, from the inception of the Fund through the present, Postiglione and Lennon have sent false quarterly statements and newsletters to investors, consistently overstating the Funds value and performance.  In addition, they have overstated the amount of Postigliones personal investment in the Fund and the Funds performance in order to lure new investments.  Further, in violation of their fiduciary duties to their clients, Postiglione and Lennon excessively traded several Fund securities accounts for the sole purpose of generating soft dollar credits, which they then withdrew as cash and used for, among other things, their own personal living expenses.

Morris, the former chief financial officer of Halliburton Company (Halliburton or the company).  Halliburton is a Texas-based provider of products and services to the petroleum and energy industries.  The Commission alleges in its complaint that Morris, at the time Halliburtons highest-ranking financial officer, improperly failed to ensure that Halliburton disclosed a change in its accounting that had the effect of materially increasing the companys reported income in 1998 and 1999.  The Commission also alleges that Morris participated in the preparation of earnings releases and in analyst teleconferences in which the company, improperly, touted its quarterly income results without clarifying that those results were materially affected by the accounting change.  In its lawsuit, the Commission is seeking a permanent injunction and a civil money penalty against Morris. , The Commission alleges in its complaint that, commencing in the second quarter of 1998, Halliburton changed its accounting in connection with several large projects to enable it to begin offsetting cost overruns with estimated recoveries on claims the company had not yet resolved with its customers.  According to the complaint, although permitted under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in appropriate circumstances, this practice was a significant departure from Halliburtons longstanding public disclosure regarding its recognition of claims revenue.  As alleged in the complaint, in the previous five consecutive years, dating back to 1993, Halliburton disclosed in its Forms 10-K that it recognized revenue from such claims only after the claim was resolved with the customer; pursuant to that practice, until the claim was resolved the company recorded losses caused by cost overruns.  , According to the Commissions complaint, as a result of Halliburtons undisclosed change in accounting practice, cost overruns and resulting losses on several projects were reduced or eliminated, triggering material increases to Halliburtons income: in its 1998 Form 10-K, by 46.1%, and in its Forms 10-Q for the second and third quarters of 1998, by 24.8% and 5.7%, respectively, and in its Forms 10-Q for the first, second and third quarters of 1999, by 14.8%, 7.5% and 11.6%, respectively.  Additionally, the Commission alleges that the change in claims recognition policy materially enhanced Halliburtons publicly disclosed 1997-1998 quarter-to-quarter income comparisons.  According to the complaint, despite the material impact of the accounting change on Halliburtons reported income, the company did not disclose the change until March 2000, in its 1999 Form 10-K - almost two years after the change went into effect.  In its civil suit, the Commission alleges that Morris violated Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and aided and abetted Halliburtons violations of the reporting provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act): Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.  , On August 3, 2004, the Commission issued a cease-and-desist order (Order) relating to Halliburtons disclosure failures and to the role of Halliburtons former controller, Robert Charles Muchmore, in those failures.  The settled Order requires that Halliburton and Muchmore cease and desist from committing or causing violations and future violations of Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act and that Halliburton cease and desist from committing or causing, and Muchmore cease and desist from causing, violations and future violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.  Halliburton and Muchmore consented to the Order without admitting or denying the findings contained in the Order.  Halliburton and Muchmore also agreed to pay civil penalties of $7.5 million and $50,000, respectively.  The Commissions Order noted that the penalty, in part, reflects the Commissions view that there were unacceptable lapses in the companys conduct during the course of the investigation, which had the effect of delaying the production of information and documentation necessary to the staffs expeditious completion of its investigation., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18817-1.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a> (Halliburton Company and	Robert Charles Muchmore, Jr.), <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18817-2.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a> (Gary V.

Shapiro, United States District Court Judge, Eastern District of Pennsylvania, entered Final Judgments against defendants William F. Buettner, Mark D. Kirstein, and Amy S. Frazier -- members of the Coopers &amp; Lybrand, LLP (now PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP) engagement team that audited the consolidated financial statements of Allegheny Health, Education and Research Foundation (AHERF) for the year ending June 30, 1997:, The defendants consented to the entry of the final judgments without admitting or denying the allegations of the Second Amended Complaint (complaint)., According to the allegations of complaint, Buettner, Kirstein, and Frazier, certified public accountants, served respectively as the engagement partner, the senior manager, and the manager on the failed audit of AHERF -- at its height the largest nonprofit healthcare organization in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.  The Commissions complaint also alleged that each of them actively participated in a fraudulent scheme to mask AHERFs deteriorating financial condition.  In so doing, the defendants participated in the creation and issuance of, and failed to correct, audit reports that contained unqualified opinions concerning AHERFs 1997 consolidated financial statements and AHERFs 1997 supplementary consolidating and combining financial information.  For its fiscal year 1997, AHERF reported net income when, in reality, it was operating at substantial net loss. , The scheme, as alleged in the complaint, involved the fraudulent transfer of $99.6 million of reserves from the books of a recently-acquired entity to the books of a group of AHERF-related entities collectively known as the Delaware Valley Obligated Group (Delaware Valley). The transferred reserves were used by Delaware Valley to either increase its own reserves or to reduce expenses related to the write-off of uncollectible accounts receivable.  According to the complaint, Buettner, Kirstein and Frazier played an active role in the fraud by, among other things, helping AHERF plan fraudulent transfers of reserves and subsequently conducting the 1997 audit in a manner intended to hide both the fraud and their involvement in it. Furthermore, they failed to expand their audit to address the improper transfers, or to investigate evidence of other transfers that violated Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), as required by Generally Accepted Auditing Standards (GAAS). , Ultimately, the complaint charged that the defendants knowingly or recklessly caused Coopers and Lybrand to issue false and misleading audit reports containing unqualified opinions that enhanced the credibility of AHERFs reported financial statements.  The audited financial statements with attached consolidating schedules were made available to, among others, investors in AHERF-related bonds. The audit reports falsely state, among other things, that the audit was conducted in accordance with GAAS and that the financial statements were in accordance with GAAP and fairly presented AHERFs financial condition. The financial statements, issued by AHERF in February 1997, materially misrepresented that AHERF and Delaware Valley had net income of $21.9 million and $23.7 million, respectively, for fiscal year 1997. Absent the fraud, AHERF and Delaware Valley would have posted substantial net losses of approximately $37.7 million and $35.9 million respectively. , On July 21, 1998, AHERF filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code on behalf of itself and four of its subsidiaries in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. By the time of the bankruptcy filing, one or more of the obligated groups were responsible for repaying a total of more than $900 million of outstanding AHERF Bonds. Subsequently, on September 2, 1998, AHERF issued a press release in which it acknowledged that its audits consolidated financial statement for 1997 were inaccurate. In the release, AHERF stated that [n]o further reliance should be placed on the financial statements or the [Coopers] report thereon. , The Commission also announced that, based upon the District Court injunction, it had instituted and simultaneously settled a Rule 102(e)(3) proceeding against Buettner.

McCloskey, Rance C. Miles, Luis E. Vallejo and Daniel Harris for engaging in insider trading in the securities of Dean Foods Company (Dean Foods) in advance of the April 5, 2001 announcement that Suiza Foods Corporation would merge with Dean Foods.  The Commissions complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, alleges that McCloskey and Miles were officers of a dairy business that had entered into a confidential milk supply contract with Dean Foods in early 2001.  According to the complaint, McCloskey and Miles obtained material nonpublic information from Dean Foods which they used to purchase Dean Foods securities the day before the Dean Foods-Suiza Foods merger announcement and to tip others including Vallejo, McCloskeys long-time friend, and Harris, Miles broker.  Collectively, the four defendants realized illegal profits totaling $113,801.  , The Commission alleges that McCloskey and Miles received the last piece of material nonpublic information on April 4, 2001, when they were given the green light to make public their previously confidential milk supply agreement.  McCloskey, in light of this and other information known to him, concluded that this meant the Suiza Foods-Dean Foods merger was coming down.  After receiving the information, McCloskey purchased 3,000 shares of Dean Foods stock on margin for $97,500.  McCloskey also tipped others, including his long-time friend Luis Vallejo.  Vallejo purchased 7,000 shares of Dean Foods stock the same day for $229,170.  According to the complaint, Miles also purchased 500 shares of Dean Foods stock and 250 out-of-the-money call options contracts for $43,050 after receiving the information about the green light from McCloskey.  Miles also tipped others, including his broker, Harris.  Harris purchased 100 shares of Dean Foods stock for $3,259.  He also tipped one of his clients, recommending that he sell short Suiza Foods stock.  , After the public announcement of the merger on April 5, 2001, Dean Foods stock increased from its April 4, 2001 close of $32.50 to as high as $38.80 on April 5, 2001, or a 19% increase.  Following the announcement, the four individuals sold their Dean Foods securities and realized substantial illegal profits.  McCloskey sold his stock on April 5, 2001, realizing one-day illegal profits of $15,900.  Miles sold his Dean Foods stock and options between April 5 and April 11, 2001, earning illegal profits of $60,530.  Vallejo sold his stock on April 5, 2001, earning $36,830 in illegal profits.  Harris sold his stock on April 5, 2001, realizing one-day profits of $541.  McCloskey, Miles, and Harris each tipped others.

Scott C. Anixter, et al.</i>, No. 02-C-3235 (N.D. Ill.) (Marovich, J.).</h2>]","[On July 29, 2004, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed an amended complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois that added Scott C. Anixter, the former Chairman of the Board of Anicom, Inc., as a defendant to its lawsuit against six top executives and other employees of the now-defunct company.  Anixter, age 55, is a resident of Glencoe, Illinois., The Commissions amended complaint alleges that from January 1, 1998 through March 30, 2000, Anixter and the other defendants carried out a massive financial fraud at Anicom in which they falsely reported millions of dollars of non-existent sales, including sales to a fictitious customer, and used other fraudulent techniques to inflate Anicoms net income by more than $20 million.  To conceal the fraud, certain of the defendants lied to Anicoms outside auditors, lied to the Audit Committee of Anicoms Board of Directors in an internal investigation, and withheld information from the Commissions staff.  When aspects of the fraud were eventually revealed to the public, Anicoms shareholders lost more than $80 million., The Commissions amended complaint alleges that the fraud had two distinct aspects.  First, Anixter and his co-defendants, President and Chief Executive Officer Carl E. Putnam, Vice President of Sales Daryl T. Spinell, Chief Operating Officer John P. Figurelli, and Billing Manager Renee L. LeVault, improperly recognized numerous sales that inflated reported revenues and net profits.  Additionally, Chief Financial Officer Donald C. Welchko, Figurelli, LeVault, and defendant Vice President of Accounting Ronald M. Bandyk, C.P.A., with Anixter and Putnams knowledge, caused Anicom in 1999 to, among other things, improperly recognize more than $11.7 million in sales to a fictitious customer called SCL Integration Corp. to minimize the effect on income of writing off earlier improper sales., Second, Anixter and Welchko improperly manipulated Anicoms expenses to bring the companys financial results in line with, or at least closer to, analysts expectations.  To that end, Welchko and Bandyk engaged in fraud by improperly charging certain expenses to a reserve account and a restructuring charge, unjustifiably inflating purchase rebates accrued, and accelerating the recognition of sales between reporting periods.  As a result of the defendants misconduct, Anicom filed with the Commission at least nine materially false and misleading periodic reports on Forms 10-Q and 10-K reports between January 1, 1998 and March 30, 2000 that, among other things, overstated the companys revenues by more than $38 million., The Commissions amended complaint alleges that the defendants conduct violated the antifraud, periodic reporting, record keeping, internal controls, and lying to the auditors provisions of the federal securities laws.  The Commission requests that the court issue a final judgment of permanent injunction and other relief, enjoining certain of the defendants from violating Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b), and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 promulgated thereunder, and aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 promulgated thereunder.

Lennon (Lennon), of Media, PA, and two companies they owned and controlled, namely, Fountainhead Fund, LP (the Fund), a hedge fund located in Wayne, PA, and its general partner Fountainhead Asset Management, LLC (FAM).

Through a series of fraudulent acts, defendants Postiglione and Lennon, acting through FAM, obtained assets fraudulently, lulled investors into keeping their assets in the Fund, and misused investor funds.  The Complaint alleges that, from the inception of the Fund through the present, Postiglione and Lennon have sent false quarterly statements and newsletters to investors, consistently overstating the Funds value and performance.  In addition, they have overstated the amount of Postigliones personal investment in the Fund and the Funds performance in order to lure new investments.  Further, in violation of their fiduciary duties to their clients, Postiglione and Lennon excessively traded several Fund securities accounts for the sole purpose of generating soft dollar credits, which they then withdrew as cash and used for, among other things, their own personal living expenses.

As of the date of filing, investor funds in the Fund totaled approximately $1.7 million., The Complaint alleges that defendants Postiglione, Lennon, FAM, and the Fund have violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that Postiglione, Lennon, and FAM have violated Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Advisers Act.

Boylan, a former senior executive of Gemstar-TV Guide International, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary, TV Guide, Inc., has agreed to settle the federal court action filed by the Commission.  As part of the settlement, Boylan will consent to a fraud injunction, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, and will pay a total of $600,000 in disgorgement and civil penalties.  The settlement is subject to approval by the court., Gemstar is a Los Angeles-based media and technology company that, among other things, publishes TV Guide magazine and develops, licenses, and markets an interactive program guide (IPG) for televisions that enables consumers to navigate through and select television programs.  During the relevant period, Gemstar generated revenues from the IPG by licensing the technology to third parties and selling advertising on the IPG.  In statements to securities analysts and the investing public, Gemstar repeatedly touted the IPG technology and IPG advertising revenues as the companys future and as the value driver of the companys stock, and downplayed expected declines in revenue from TV Guide magazine., Boylan, of Tulsa, Oklahoma, is the former co-president, co-chief operating officer and a member of the board of directors of Gemstar and the former co-chairman, chief executive officer, and co-president of Gemstars wholly owned subsidiary, TV Guide.  The Commissions complaint alleges that from June 1999 through September 2002, Gemstar overstated its total revenues by at least $248 million to meet its ambitious projections for revenue growth from IPG licensing and advertising.  The complaint further alleges that Boylan participated in Gemstars fraudulent reporting of transactions relating to IPG advertising.  According to the complaint, Boylan structured two transactions so that a portion of the amount to be paid to Gemstar was nominally and artificially allocated to the sale of IPG advertising.  The complaint also alleges that in press releases, conference calls with securities analysts, and annual reports filed with the Commission, Boylan omitted to disclose material information regarding the transactions.  The complaint charges Boylan with securities fraud, falsifying Gemstars books and records, and aiding and abetting Gemstars reporting and record-keeping violations, in violation of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13b2-1 thereunder., If approved by the court, Boylan will be enjoined from future violations, or aiding and abetting violations, of the above provisions of the federal securities laws.  Boylan is also agreeing to pay disgorgement of $300,000 and a civil penalty of $300,000.  The Commission will seek to have this money included in a fund established for harmed shareholders of Gemstar pursuant to Section 308 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. , The Commissions action is pending against four other former executives of Gemstar:  Henry C. Yuen, former chief executive officer; Elsie M. Leung, former chief financial officer; Jonathan B. Orlick, former general counsel; and Craig Waggy, former CFO of TV Guide.  The court has scheduled the trial of this matter to begin on January 18, 2005.

(CTT), a small technology company in Fairfield, Connecticut.  The defendants include six current or former brokers at four different brokerage firms, and the former CEO of Competitive Technologies, as well as the company itself.  Chauncey Steele, of Cohasset, Massachusetts, allegedly orchestrated the scheme while working as a broker at the Hyannis, Massachusetts office of Prudential Securities Inc., acting in concert with Richard Kwak, of Escondido, California, a broker at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, John Glushko of Las Vegas, Nevada, a broker at Finance 500, Stephen Wilson of Pompano Beach, Florida, a broker at Shamrock Partners at the time, and former brokers Thomas Kocherhans of Orem, Utah and Sheldon Strauss of Beachwood, Ohio. Frank McPike of Ridgefield, Connecticut, while acting as CTTs CEO, allegedly made purchases in the companys stock repurchase plan at Steeles direction in order to further the manipulative scheme and CTT is named as a defendant due to his conduct., According to the Commissions complaint, from at least 1998 through 2001, the defendants artificially raised the price of CTT stock, which is listed on the American Stock Exchange, through several manipulative practices, all designed to maximize the benefit to themselves.  On almost every trading day, defendants  painted the tape, that is, made multiple small purchases at arranged times and prices in order to give the misleading appearance of investor interest in the stock  Their favored painting technique was marking the close, placing numerous orders at or near the close of the market in order to inflate the reported closing price.  Defendants also allegedly made pre-arranged matched trades, so that any impact sales might have on CTTs price would be offset by simultaneous buys at the same price.  The complaint alleges that, employing these devices, defendants placed hundreds of purchase orders in both their own and their customers accounts, making the closing trade in the stock on almost 300 trading days during the period.  On more than 90% of those days, they succeeded in raising the reported closing price of the stock.  The complaint alleges that defendants fraudulent scheme resulted in CTTs stock trading at far above its true value.  Innocent investors bought the stock at inflated prices of over $20 per share at the stocks high point, which fell to $3 per share after the manipulation ceased. , The specific charges against the defendants in the federal court action are that they violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933,  Sections 9(a) and 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which prohibit fraudulent conduct, and that Steele also violated Section 17(a) and Rule 17a-3 of the Exchange Act by falsifying order tickets to indicate that his customers had initiated orders to buy CTT when in fact he had solicited the purchases.  TheCommission is seeking injunctive relief, disgorgement, and civil penalties, and an order permanently barring defendant McPike from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  , <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18827.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18827.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Gordon, and Jeffrey L. Pittsburg</i>, Case No. CV 04-6613 SVW (SSx) (C.D. Cal.)</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it filed a complaint in federal district court in Los Angeles against three defendants for manipulating the stock of Stan Lee Media, Inc.  The defendants are Peter F. Paul, the co-founder of Stan Lee Media; Stephen M. Gordon, its former executive vice president of operations; and Jeffrey L. Pittsburg, formerly an officer and part-owner of Pittsburg Institutional, Inc., a Commission-registered broker-dealer.  The Commission alleges that, between October 2, 2000 and November 24, 2000, Paul, Gordon, and Pittsburg manipulated the market for Stan Lee Media stock.  Stan Lee Media, located in Encino, California, was founded by comic book icon Stan Lee and Paul.  Stan Lee is not named as a defendant in this action., The complaint alleges that, during the relevant period, Paul, Gordon, and Pittsburg engaged in a scheme to maintain and control the price of Stan Lee Medias stock at artificially inflated levels by, among other things, concealing their trading in Stan Lee Media stock to create a false and misleading appearance of active trading.  The defendants engaged in the following conduct: , Paul and Gordon, who already controlled a large number of Stan Lee Media shares, used nominee accounts at Pittsburg Institutional to buy 1.6 million Stan Lee Media shares valued at $14 million in nominee accounts at Pittsburg Institutional and attempted to pay for the stock with checks that bounced., While aggressively purchasing Stan Lee Media shares, Paul and Gordon sold Stan Lee Media stock at below market prices.  Pittsburg executed and reported all of these sales transactions after the close of trading, thus avoiding public reporting of the lower sales prices., Paul failed to make required filings with the Commission regarding his beneficial ownership of, and changes to his ownership of, Stan Lee Media shares. , Pittsburg maintained the high bid for Stan Lee Media stock through the use of RediBook ECN, an electronic communications network, thereby disguising the fact that virtually all of the demand for Stan Lee Media stock was coming from Pittsburg Institutional.  When Pittsburg stopped bidding for the stock, the price of the stock collapsed in two days by 72%.  , 	Pittsburg engaged in marking-the-close.

DiBella and North Cove Ventures, LLC</i>, Civil Action No. 304CV1342 (WWE) (District of Connecticut)</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil fraud action today against William A. DiBella, the former Majority Leader of the Connecticut State Senate, and his consulting firm, North Cove Ventures, L.L.C., in Connecticut federal district court.  The Commission=s Complaint alleges that, beginning in November 1998, DiBella and North Cove participated in a fraudulent scheme with the-then Treasurer of the State of Connecticut, Paul J. Silvester, concerning Silvesters investment of $75 million of the state pension funds with Thayer Capital Partners, a Washington, DC-based private equity firm.  According to the Complaint, Silvester used the investment to reward DiBella, his friend and political supporter, for past and anticipated future services.  In connection with the investment, Silvester requested that Thayer, through its chairman, Frederic V. Malek, hire DiBella.  Thayer agreed to retain DiBella and to pay him a percentage of the state pension funds total investment with Thayer, even though DiBella had no prior involvement with the transaction and ultimately performed no meaningful work related to the investment.  DiBella understood from Silvester that there was no work to be done on the deal.  The Complaint also alleges that Silvester increased the amount of the pension fund=s investment with Thayer by at least $25 million (to a total of $75 million) solely to secure a larger fee for DiBella.  DiBella was ultimately paid a total of $374,500.  The Complaint alleges that DiBella and North Cove aided and abetted Silvester=s violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the violations by Thayer and its two affiliates of Section 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  The Commission is seeking injunctive relief, disgorgement, and civil penalties, and an order permanently barring defendant DiBella from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  In October 2000, Silvester settled related Commission charges concerning his investment of state pension fund money with two other private equity funds., The Commission also instituted separate, but related, settled administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings against Thayer, Malek, and two Thayer affiliates, TC Equity Partners IV, L.L.C. and TC Management Partners IV, L.L.C. concerning their failure to disclose to the state pension fund that, at the request of Silvester, they retained and paid DiBella nearly $375,000 in connection with the state pension funds investment with a Thayer private equity fund, Thayer Equity Investors IV, L.P.  Without admitting or denying the Commission=s findings, Thayer, Malek, and the two Thayer affiliates consented to the issuance of an order censuring them and requiring them to cease and desist from violating certain provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

The Courts order temporarily bars Smith and the other defendants from fraudulently engaging in their offerings and freezes their assets.  , The Commissions complaint alleges that between 2002 and the present, Smith and his affiliated companies, through the private offer and sale of securities, raised approximately $3.3 million from investors in Ohio and six other states.  In each of those offerings, Smith and the respective entity represented that the funds raised would be used primarily for investments in small banks.  Instead, according to the Commissions allegations, Smith diverted a significant amount of the proceeds to his own use and to keep his other companies afloat.  According to the complaint, Smith misused approximately $1.5 million in investor funds, using the money to pay such expenditures as rent, unrelated business expenses, clothing, skin care products and a dating service., The Commission has charged all the defendants with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Since 1996, Haligiannis has raised at least $27 million in the Fund by grossly misrepresenting the Funds performance to investors and potential investors.  Haligiannis and Sterling Watters distributed to investors phony account statements that recorded fictitious quarterly and annual investment gains and account balances.  Haligiannis and Sterling Watters also inflated Sterling Watters investment returns in marketing materials in an effort to induce investments in Sterling Watters.  For example, Haligiannis provided investors marketing materials that falsely claimed that the Fund had $180 million in assets and had achieved returns of over 1,500 percent since inception.  As recently as two weeks ago, Sterling Watters sent investors quarterly account statements that showed an aggregate of tens of millions of dollars of investor equity in the fund.

STOCK </h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it filed a complaint against Derrick S. McKinley (McKinley), a former vice president and medical director of Gliatech, Inc. (Gliatech).  Gliatech was a pharmaceutical company located in suburban Cleveland.  The complaint alleges that McKinley sold Gliatech stock while in possession of material, non-public information concerning problems with Gliatechs primary product, Adcon-L Adhesion Barrier Gel (Adcon-L), a gel used to reduce scarring in patients following back surgery.  During a twelve-month period from August 1999 to August 2000, McKinley sold short 221,000 shares of Gliatech stock in a series of transactions, reaping profits of approximately $1.6 million.  From the outset of his trading, McKinley was aware of three major problems involving Adcon-L.  By August 1999, McKinley (1) knew that a study of Adcon-L clinical trials (Adcon-L Study) submitted by Gliatech to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) suffered from defects that undermined its reliability; (2) knew of sterility problems resulting from defective packaging by the overseas contractor Gliatech hired to manufacture Adcon-L; and (3) knew of complaints of cerebral spinal fluid leaks (CSF leaks) in patients following surgeries in which Adcon-L had been used.  In October 1999, the FDA issued an import ban that prevented shipments of Adcon-L from entering the U.S.  The ban resulted from unresolved FDA concerns that included the defective packaging and sterility problems.  In March 2000, news of complaints about the CSF leaks became public.  In August 2000, news of an FDA investigation challenging the integrity and results of the Adcon-L Study became public.  When each of these three adverse developments became publicly known, the price of Gliatech stock dropped.  McKinley profited from each of these three declines in the price of Gliatech stock.  The complaint alleges that as a result of his conduct McKinley violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Commission is seeking an order that permanently enjoins McKinley from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and that requires McKinley to disgorge his profits from his illegal trades and to pay a civil penalty., <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18832.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The case against the fourth defendant, Sara Jane Peck (Peck), remains pending., The Commissions complaint alleges that Grabarnick and Shiner promoted investments in unregistered LLP units to the public through bulk e-mails and Internet websites.  Interested investors responded over the Internet by providing contact information, which Grabarnick and Shiner then sold as leads to LaBarre and Peck.  The complaint alleged that LaBarre and Peck used boiler room sales tactics to offer and sell the LLP units.  Investors were told they would benefit from the deregulation of the electric service provider market in California.  According to the complaint, more than 580 people nationwide invested over $10 million by purchasing units, or fractions thereof, in eight LLPs.  Each LLP consisted of 80 partnership units, each valued at $19,675, for a total of $1,547,000 per fully funded partnership.  Many investors were elderly; many rolled over money from IRA and 401(k) accounts.  According to the complaint, after all 80 units were sold, or as many as could be, investors were told that the partnerships would not be viable and they were offered Over-the-Counter penny stock in exchange for their escrowed funds.  None of the partnerships ever became operational electric companies.  The complaint alleges that investors are lef with worthless partnership units and delisted penny stock., Grabarnick, Shiner and LaBarre, without admitting or denying the allegations, settled the action by consenting to entry of court orders that: (i) permanently enjoin them from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; (ii) require Shiner to pay $5,000,000 in disgorgement, plus $1,615,760 prejudgment interest, and $480,000 in civil penalties; (iii) require Grabarnick to pay $543,170 in disgorgement, with a waiver of all but $100,000 of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties, based upon a demonstrated inability to pay; and (iv) requires LaBarre to pay $337,109 in disgorgement plus post-judgment interest, with a waiver of all but $100,000 of disgorgement, prejudgment interest and civil penalties, based upon a demonstrated inability to pay., The Commission acknowledges the assistance provided by the Department of Banking and Finance of the State of Floridas Office of the Comptroller in this matter.For tips on how to avoid Internet pump-and-dump stock manipulation schemes, visit <a href=/investor/online/pump.htm>http://www.sec.gov/investor/online/pump.htm</a>.

The filing was signed by John Masiz and stated that Vaso Actives products Athletes Relief, Osteon, and Termin8 (then called deFEET) have received FDA approval.  This statement was repeated in amendments filed with the Commission.  However, this statement was false and misleading because none of these products had received FDA approval., The Commissions complaint also alleges that, in the companys 10-KSB, filed on March 26, 2004, Vaso Active made further false and misleading statements regarding its products.  The filing states: Athletes Relief, Osteon, and Termin8 are qualified under FDA OTC monographs and have been registered as such.  This statement was false and misleading because, to the extent that these products utilize a transdermal drug delivery system, the products did not satisfy FDA monograph requirements.

At the time of the conduct alleged in the complaint, Warren was a part time resident of, and Exo-Brain was located in, Chattanooga, Tennessee.  Warren controlled E-Brain LLC and Exo-Brain., The Commissions complaint alleges that the defendants fraudulently offered and sold securities to investors at a time when no registration statement was filed with the Commission in connection with the offers and sales, and no exemption from registration existed.  The complaint alleges that in offering documents, the defendants falsely claimed to have developed a working prototype that could be used to make computers more user friendly, by enabling a person to operate a computer with voice command, and in numerous foreign languages.  The defendants also falsely represented that the company had built a launch product or commercially available product when no such product existed, and also misrepresented, among other things, the companys financial situation. , The complaint alleges that the offerings of E-Brain LLC should be integrated into a single unregistered offering because, in part, the offerings did not cease for more than a six month period of time, the sales of securities by E-Brain LLC all shared the same purpose-to fund the software development business controlled by Warren, and E-Brain LLC was involved in a single plan of financing.  The complaint further alleges, for several reasons, that the offerings of the successor company, Exo-Brain, should be integrated with the earlier offerings of E-Brain LLC, which were not exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act., The complaint alleges that by their conduct, the defendants violated Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Kornman, 61, of Dallas, Texas.  The complaint alleges that Kornman operated a tax-planning firm, The Heritage Organization LLC, which offered tax shelters and estate planning to wealthy individuals.  On two separate instances in 2001, Kornman obtained material nonpublic information concerning acquisitions of public companies in confidential discussions with prospective tax-planning clients, each of whom faced significant capital-gains taxes as a result of the planned sale of their respective companies.  Specifically, the complaint alleges:, In February 2001, Kornman learned in a confidential meeting with an executive of MiniMed, Inc., a Nasdaq-listed medical-equipment company, that there was a 70% chance that MiniMed would be acquired in approximately four months by a Fortune 100 company.  Two days after learning this information, Kornman purchased 6600 shares of MiniMed for approximately $38 per share on behalf of a hedge fund he controlled.  In May 2001, MiniMed announced it was being acquired by Medtronic, Inc. for $48 per share, and Kornmans hedge fund profited by approximately $67,000 when the merger ultimately took place in August 2001.  , In a November 2001 meeting with a board member of Hollywood Casino Corporation, an Amex-listed company, Kornman learned that Hollywood would definitely be sold to another company in the near future within a certain price range per share.  Upon learning this information, Kornman began acquiring Hollywood shares in the account of another hedge fund he controlled at an average price below the price range he had learned in the confidential meeting.  By the time Hollywood announced it was being acquired by another publicly held casino firm in August 2002, Kornmans hedge fund had acquired 29,900 shares at an average cost below the announced acquisition price.  At Kornmans direction, the hedge fund sold all of these shares for a profit of approximately $75,000 shortly after the merger was announced., The SECs complaint seeks to permanently enjoin Kornman from violating the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1034 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Upshaw, Sr. (Upshaw) and Upshaw and Associates, L.L.C. (Upshaw and Associates), enjoining them from violating the anti-fraud and registration provisions of the securities laws. The Order of Permanent Injunction also freezes the assets of the Upshaw and Upshaw and Associates pending the resolution of the appropriate amount of disgorgement and civil penalties, requires the defendants to give an accounting, prohibits document destruction and permits expedited discovery. The defendants consented to the Order of Permanent Injunction without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions complaint., In its complaint, which was filed on August 18, the Commission charged that Upshaws investment scheme was an affinity fraud, targeting members of the African-American community, including African-American churches and their members.  Upshaw is 47 years old and a resident of Oak Brook, Illinois.  The Commission alleged that, from at least October 2000 to the present, Upshaw raised at least $6.1 million from more than 130 investors through the unregistered offer and sale of securities in the form of high return promissory notes, which were issued by Upshaw &amp; Associates.  According to the complaint, Upshaw represented to investors that he would invest their funds in large-cap U.S. stocks, Treasury bills and commercial paper, guaranteeing returns of up to 10% per month.  Upshaw, however, invested little, if any, investor proceeds in the manner promised.  Instead, Upshaw used investor funds to pay returns to other investors, fund business ventures for himself, his wife, and his friends, and to purchase a luxury home and two luxury cars.  In addition, Upshaw made a series of misrepresentations regarding the safety of the investments, falsely stating that the returns were guaranteed and insured.  The majority of investors in Upshaws scheme reside in Illinois, Ohio and California., The complaint alleged that, by the above conduct, Upshaw and Upshaw and Associates violated Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Previously, on June 9, 2004, the court had entered a Final Judgment of Permanent Injunction and Other Relief against Parnell and OTM.  The Final Judgment and Order (collectively, the final judgment) were both entered following the Commissions motion for summary judgment, to which the defendants failed to respond.  The final judgment orders the defendants Parnell and OTM, jointly and severally, to pay disgorgement of $663,000, prejudgment interest of $141,051, and a $804,051 civil penalty.  The disgorgement amount represents the amount of investor funds received by the defendants as a result of their unlawful conduct.  The Court enjoined Parnell and OTM from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and (c) of the Securities Act, and the broker-dealer registration provisions of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act., According to the Commissions complaint, which was filed on September 26, 1996, Parnell and OTM and other co-defendants violated various registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws in connection with the unregistered nationwide sales of securities designated as partnership units in Internet Broadcast Group, a purported general partnership formed to engage in the wireless and hardwired cable business in Muskegon, Michigan and Mesa, Arizona.  The Commissions complaint alleged that Parnell and OTM, his wholly controlled company, functioned as brokers in selling the securities although they were not registered as brokers as required by applicable securities laws.  Further, the Commissions complaint alleged that Parnell and OTM used a variety of false and misleading sales literature, correspondence, and telephone statements to sell the securities., Parnell and OTM also were defendants in another Commission lawsuit.

The SEC alleges that the scheme was orchestrated by Piranhas former CFO and principal shareholder Richard S. Berger, 70, of Chicago, Illinois, and the companys former CEO Edward W. Sample, 53, of Plano, Texas.  , According to the SECs complaint, Piranha issued numerous misleading press releases, during 2000 and 2001, presenting the company as a promising software-technology company with the potential for huge earnings when, in truth, the company never developed a commercially marketable product and generated virtually no revenue.  Piranha is also alleged to have filed false reports with the SEC that materially overstated the value of the companys principal asset, a mathematical algorithm from which the company intended to develop various software products.  These reports also failed to disclose and wrongly accounted for $675,000 that Berger allegedly misappropriated from the company.  During the scheme, Piranhas stock price reached $65 per share, giving the company a market capitalization of over $596 million within just four months of its inception.  The complaint also alleges that Berger profited from the scheme by selling more than $1.5 million of Piranha shares individually and through his wife, Linda A. Shaughnessy, of Chicago, Illinois, who acted as his nominee in selling the shares., The SECs complaint alleges that Piranha, Berger, and Sample violated the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws found in Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5; that Berger violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933; that Piranha, aided and abetted by Berger and Sample, violated the issuer-reporting and internal-controls provisions found in Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13; that Berger and Sample violated Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1, which prohibit falsifying books and records of SEC reporting companies; and that Berger violated Exchange Act Rule 13b2-2 by making false statements to an accountant.  , The SEC is seeking permanent injunctions against Piranha, Berger, and Sample, civil penalties and officer-and-director bars against Berger and Sample, and disgorgement plus prejudgment interest against Berger.  The SEC also named Shaughnessy as a relief defendant, solely for the purpose seeking disgorgement of the proceeds from her stock sales.  Finally, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Sample consented to the entry of a permanent injunction; a five-year officer-and-director bar; and a $25,000 civil penalty.

(Shell Transport and, together with Royal Dutch, Shell), in connection with their overstatement of 4.47 billion barrels of previously reported proved hydrocarbon reserves.  Royal Dutch is a Dutch corporation headquartered in The Hague, while Shell Transport is an English corporation headquartered in London., Royal Dutch and Shell Transport agreed to settle these proceedings by consenting to a cease-and-desist order finding violations of the antifraud, internal controls, record-keeping and reporting provisions of the federal securities laws, and by paying $1 disgorgement and a $120 million penalty in a related civil action the Commission filed in U.S. District Court in Houston.  Shell also has undertaken to commit an additional $5 million to develop and implement a comprehensive internal compliance program under the direction and oversight of the Groups legal director.  The companies settled without admitting or denying the Commissions substantive findings., According to the Commissions order and complaint, Shell overstated proved reserves reported in its 2002 Form 20-F by 4.47 billion barrels of oil equivalent, or approximately 23%.  The order further concludes that Shell overstated the standardized measure of future cash flows reported in this filing by approximately $6.6 billion.  The Commissions order also finds, and the complaint alleges, that, for the years 1998 through 2002, Shell materially misstated its reserves replacement ratio (RRR), a key performance indicator in the oil and gas industry.  Had Shell properly reported proved reserves, its RRR for the one-, three- and five-year periods through 2002 would have been materially different from what it originally reported., The Commission also found and alleges that Shells overstatement of proved reserves, and its delay in correcting the overstatement, resulted from (i) its desire to create and maintain the appearance of a strong RRR, (ii) the failure of its internal reserves estimation and reporting guidelines to conform to SEC requirements, and (iii) the lack of effective internal controls over the reserves estimation and reporting process.  These failures led Shell to record and maintain proved reserves it knew (or was reckless in not knowing) did not satisfy SEC requirements, and to report for certain years a stronger RRR than it actually had achieved.  Indeed, Shell was warned on several occasions prior to the fall of 2003 that reported proved reserves potentially were overstated and, in such critical operating areas as Nigeria and Oman, depended upon unrealistic production forecasts.  In each case, Shell either rejected the warnings as immaterial or unduly pessimistic, or attempted to manage the potential exposure by, for example, delaying de-booking of improperly recorded proved reserves until new, offsetting proved reserves bookings materialized. , In accepting Shells settlement offer, the Commission took into account Shells cooperation with the staffs investigation and the remedial actions Shell has undertaken, as outlined in the order., <p class=center>**********, The cease-and-desist order finds and civil complaint alleges that Royal Dutch and Shell Transport violated Sections 10(b), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act 0f 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13b2-1 thereunder, The Commissions investigation continues as to other individuals and entities., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18844.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>, <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18844.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The Commission simultaneously filed in the civil action, and the court granted, a motion seeking an asset freeze and other emergency relief against the defendants, in order to prevent the dissipation or concealment of assets that the Commission claims should be paid as civil money penalties and disgorgement of illegal profits., In its complaint, the Commission alleged that Scott B.

The defendant, John Patrucco, was responsible for preparing reports filed with the Commission disclosing to the public material information about VaxGen.  The Commission alleges that Patrucco learned that the government had given VaxGen an important approval for one of its drugs, and then bought VaxGen stock before he prepared and filed the SEC report that disclosed the news to the public.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Patrucco has agreed to settle the enforcement proceeding by paying just over $20,000 in disgorgement, penalties, and prejudgment interest and by consenting to a permanent injunction against future securities law violations.  , According to the Commissions civil complaint, Patrucco purchased 2,950 shares of VaxGen stock on the open market on May 22 and 23, 2003, based on his advance knowledge that the Food and Drug Administration had just approved VaxGens Investigational New Drug application for a potential anthrax vaccine.  The FDAs decision allowed VaxGen to begin clinical development of the vaccine through Phase I human clinical trials, one of the major milestones before the FDA can approve a drug for sale to the public.  When the Company later announced the news on May 27, 2003 - in a press release and a report filed with the Commission and prepared by Patrucco as part of his SEC reporting duties - VaxGens stock price rose nearly 70%.  Patrucco sold the shares the following day, realizing a quick profit of nearly $8,000.  Patrucco resigned from VaxGen in July 2003., The Commissions lawsuit, brought in federal district court in San Francisco, charges Patrucco with trading on the basis of material, nonpublic information in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The Commissions complaint alleges that Diaz assisted in a scheme by Cutters management to fraudulently inflate its financial results for the fiscal quarter and year ended April 30, 2000.  Diaz assisted in the scheme by allowing the improper revenue recognition of $5.7 million in shipments to distributors functioning as Company warehouses and concealing the improper transactions from the Companys auditors and shareholders.    , Simultaneously with the filing of the complaint, Diaz agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, consenting to orders permanently enjoining her from violations of the antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws.  , The Commissions complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, alleges that Cutter was encountering declining sales as it approached the final days of its fiscal year ended April 30, 2000.  In late April, a vice president of sales negotiated deals with three distributors under which Cutter would ship them a total of $5.7 million in products, where they had no obligation to pay for any of the goods until customers located by Cutter paid the distributors.  Because of Cutters ongoing obligation to complete the sales, revenue recognition was improper under generally accepted accounting principles (known as GAAP).  In press releases and in filings with the Commission that were distributed to the public, Cutter announced revenue of $54.6 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2000 and $152.5 million for the entire fiscal year.  However, because these figures included $5.7 million in improperly recognized revenue on the distributor sales, they overstated Cutters true quarterly and annual revenue by 12% and 4%, respectively., The complaint also charges that Diaz, age 47, of Seattle, Washington, knew or was reckless in not knowing that these distributors were operating as Cutter warehouses and that revenue recognition had been improper.  Rather than take steps to ensure that revenue was not recognized, Diaz sought to conceal the agreements by hiding the distributor invoices from the Companys auditors.  Diaz also divided product returns among multiple company sales divisions in order to hide the magnitude of the returns, knowing that this was improper.  , Diaz was terminated by the Company in August 2002.  On August 12, 2002, Cutter, which had undergone a change in management, announced that it would restate its financial statements for fiscal years 2000 and 2001 as a result of the improper distributor transactions.  The announcement caused Cutters stock price to drop from $4.02 to $3.44, or 14%, the following day. , The complaint charges Diaz with aiding and abetting securities fraud (Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder), aiding and abetting Cutters reporting of false financial information to the Commission (Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1) and aiding and abetting Cutters failure to maintain accurate books and records and internal controls (Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act).  The complaint additionally charges Diaz with lying to accountants (Rule 13b2-2 under the Exchange Act) and falsifying the companys books and records (Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder)., <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18848.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Without admitting or denying the allegations of the Complaint, Koenig has agreed to be enjoined permanently from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, and to be barred from acting as an officer or director of a public company.  As part of the settlement agreement, which is subject to the approval of the U.S. District Court, Koenig will pay disgorgement and a civil penalty totaling $1,493,572.

Koenig agreed to enter into a guilty plea in connection with that charge and to cooperate with the governments continuing investigation., As alleged in the Complaint, Koenig participated in a scheme to defraud in violation of the federal securities laws when he disseminated, and approved the dissemination of, false and misleading information to the public about Enrons business in earnings releases and analyst calls., Specifically, the Commissions Complaint alleges that in his role as Executive Vice-President and Director of Investor Relations, Koenig was responsible for drafting and preparing portions of Enrons earnings releases and analyst call scripts.  Koenig reviewed and edited Enrons First, Second and Third Quarter 2001 earnings releases, and scripts for the March 23, 2001 Analyst Call and the First, Second and Third Quarter 2001 Analyst Calls.  During his efforts, Koenig learned specific information about Enrons retail energy business unit, Enron Energy Service (EES), and its telecommunications business unit, Enron Broadband Services (EBS), revealing that EES and EBS were not the successful business units described in the earnings releases and scripts, and as described by Enron in the analyst calls.

Lewis, Kraig L. Kibble, and James Y. Lin</i>, Civil Action No. CV 04-7084 PA (VBKx) (C.D. Cal.)</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed civil fraud charges against Beverly Hills, California-based broker-dealer National Clearing Corporation (NCC), its parent company, JB Oxford Holdings, Inc. (JBOH), and three NCC executives for facilitating late trading and market timing by certain NCC customers.  The SECs complaint alleges that from June 2002 until September 2003, the defendants fraudulently facilitated thousands of market timing and late trades in over 600 mutual funds., In addition to the charges against NCC and JBOH, the Commissions complaint names James G. Lewis, age 39, of Santa Monica, Calif., who was JBOHs former president and chief operating officer and NCCs former president and chief executive officer; Kraig L. Kibble, age 44, of La Crescenta, Calif., who is NCCs director of operations; and James Y. Lin, age 46, of Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif., who is NCCs vice president of correspondent services., The SECs complaint, filed in United States District Court in Los Angeles, alleges as follows:, Late trading refers to the practice of placing orders to buy or sell mutual fund shares after 4:00 p.m. Eastern time, the time as of which mutual funds typically calculate their net asset value (NAV), but receiving the price based on the NAV already determined as of 4:00 p.m.  Late trading enables the trader to profit from market events that occur after 4:00 p.m. but that are not reflected in that days price.  , Market timing includes (a) frequent buying and selling of shares of the same mutual fund or (b) buying or selling mutual fund shares in order to exploit inefficiencies in mutual fund pricing.  Market timing, while not illegal per se, can harm other mutual fund shareholders because it can dilute the value of their shares, if the market timer is exploiting pricing inefficiencies, or disrupt the management of the mutual funds investment portfolio and cause the targeted mutual fund to incur costs borne by other shareholders to accommodate frequent buying and selling of shares by the market timer., From June 2002 until September 2003, NCC facilitated thousands of late mutual fund trades in more 600 different mutual funds on behalf of select institutional customers.  NCC routinely received trading instructions from customers after 4:00 p.m. EST and executed those trades at the current days NAV.  NCC facilitated the late trading with the knowledge and at the direction of Lewis, Kibble, and Lin., NCC entered into written agreements with institutional customers who engaged in late trading and market timing.  These agreements included up to a 1% custodial fee in exchange for facilitating market timing and late trading in mutual funds.  NCC received approximately $1 million in compensation from the scheme while its customers reaped profits in excess of $8 million at the expense of long-term mutual fund shareholders., NCC received hundreds of kick-out letters from various mutual funds which rejected individual market timing trades and attempted to restrict NCCs customers ongoing market timing activities.  In response to these restrictions, NCC perpetrated a number of deceptive practices to conceal their customers fraudulent market timing.  When a mutual fund restricted market timing activities, NCC, at the direction of Lewis, Kibble, and Lin, used deceptive means such as opening additional accounts and using new account numbers instead of the previously restricted account numbers; using additional registered representative codes for the same previously restricted representatives; and using additional office identification numbers for the same previously restricted offices., JBOH reported its financial statements included within its Forms 10-Q and 10-K on a consolidated basis.  Therefore, JBOH reported as revenues the proceeds NCC received from the fraudulent scheme.  Lewis served simultaneously as an executive at JBOH and NCC and signed JBOHs 2002 and 2003 Forms 10-K. , The Commissions complaint charges JBOH, NCC, Lewis, Kibble, and Lin with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  NCC is also charged with violating Rule 22c-1, promulgated under Section 22(c) of the Investment Company Act of 1940.  This provision prohibits the purchase or sale of mutual fund shares except at a price based on the current NAV of such shares that is next calculated after receipt of a buy or sell order.  The SEC seeks an order that permanently enjoins the defendants from future violations of the above provisions; requires the defendants to disgorge all their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest; requires the defendants to pay civil penalties; and prohibits Lewis from serving as an officer or director of a public company. , <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18850.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18850.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Andersen and Grizzle, both former division vice-presidents, were enjoined from violating Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder.  All of the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgments without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions Complaint. , In addition to the injunctive relief, Wilson, Chung, Cummings and Grizzle were permanently barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  Wilson, Chung, Cummings and Grizzle were also ordered to pay disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains and prejudgment interest in the amounts of $420,000, $142,000, $75,000, $102,000, respectively.  The final judgments impose civil penalties against Chung, Cummings, Andersen and Grizzle in the amounts of $125,000, $200,000, $125,000 and $75,000, respectively.  , These civil penalties are in addition to criminal penalties assessed against Wilson, Cummings, Chung and Grizzle, each of whom pled guilty to various securities counts in a related criminal case.  In the criminal case, Wilson received a sentence of 33 months incarceration and was fined $1 million.  Cummings received a sentence of 41 months incarceration.  Chung was fined $500,000.  Grizzle received a sentence of six months incarceration and was fined $100,000.  Andersen was not a defendant in the criminal case., According to the Commissions Complaint, which was filed on January 23, 2001, Wilson, Chung, Cummings, Grizzle, Andersen, and other co-defendants perpetrated a brazen financial reporting fraud at Aurora in 1998 and 1999.  The Complaint alleged that during the relevant period, Aurora under-reported its trade marketing expenses by more than $43 million which resulted in material misstatements of earnings in Auroras financial statements.  Auroras senior management, consisting of Wilson, Chung, and Cummings, was aware that Aurora was not accurately reporting trade marketing expense.  But instead of properly booking the expense, senior management tried to conceal it from the independent auditors by directing division level officers and employees, including Grizzle and Andersen, to make false entries in various accounts on Auroras books.  Grizzle and Andersen assisted in these efforts.  As a result of the scheme, Aurora falsely and substantially inflated its financial results., Previously, defendants Aurora, Tammy Fancelli and James Elliott consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoined them from future violations of the federal securities laws.  In addition, Fancelli and Elliott were ordered to pay civil penalties in the amounts of $20,000 and $10,000, respectively.  , The litigation remains pending against defendant Keith Luechtefeld in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York., For further information, see Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr16866.htm>16866</a> (January 23, 2001). ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18851.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

(MVRI) and co-owner Mark A. Temple, stemming from a municipal bond offering conducted to finance a housing and casino project in Nevada.  The complaint alleges that MVRI and Temple defrauded investors by falsely claiming that the bonds were protected by a security interest in the property being developed, when in fact no such security interest existed.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, MVRI and Temple have agreed to settle the enforcement proceeding by paying $40,001 in disgorgement and penalties and by consenting to a permanent injunction against future securities law violations.  , According to the Commissions civil complaint, MVRI is the developer of a casino and housing project on Indian land owned by the Fort Mojave Indian Tribe near Laughlin, Nevada.  MVRI financed the development project through a $12.75 million bond offering in late 1999.  The Commission charges that MVRI and Temple falsely stated in the offering materials that the bonds being issued to investors were secured by deeds of trust on the Tribal property.  In actuality, MVRIs lease with the Tribe provided that no such security interest could be given absent approval from the Tribe and the United States Bureau of Indian Affairs.  MVRI and Temple had failed to obtain such authorization, and, as a result, the offering materials were false and investors had no security interest for the bonds.  MVRI subsequently defaulted on the bonds, and investors are owed approximately $11 million., The Commissions lawsuit, which is being brought in federal district court in the Central District of California, charges MVRI and Temple with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.

This settlement is related to the global settlement that ten other firms reached with the Commission, NASD, Inc., the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (NYSE), and state securities regulators in April 2003.  In connection with this matter, the Commission today filed a Complaint against Deutsche Bank Securities in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging violations of the federal securities laws and NASD and NYSE rules.  In the SEC action, Deutsche Bank Securities has agreed to a federal court order that will enjoin the firm from future violations of the federal securities laws and NASD and NYSE rules and require the firm to make changes in the operations of its equity research and investment banking departments.  As part of the settlement, Deutsche Bank Securities has agreed to pay $25 million as disgorgement and $25 million in penalties for the conflicts of interest.  Deutsche Bank Securities has agreed to pay an additional penalty of $7.5 million for failing to timely produce all e-mail during the investigation.  One-half of the $57.5 million total of these payments - $28.75 million - will be paid in connection with the SEC action and related proceedings by the NASD and NYSE and will be placed into a distribution fund for the benefit of customers of the firm.  The remainder will be paid to resolve related proceedings by state securities regulators.  In addition, Deutsche Bank Securities will pay, over five years, $25 million to provide the firms clients with independent research, and $5 million to be used for investor education., According to the Commissions Complaint, from at least July 1999 through June 2001, Deutsche Bank Securities research analysts were subject to inappropriate influence by investment banking at the firm.  The Complaint also alleges that Deutsche Bank Securities published exaggerated or unwarranted research or research that lacked a reasonable basis, received payments from other firms to publish research on certain companies without ensuring that such payments were disclosed, and made payments to other firms for those firms to publish research on Deutsche Bank Securities underwriting clients.  The firm also failed to maintain appropriate supervision over its research operations.  Finally, during the investigation, Deutsche Bank Securities failed to timely produce all e-mail in response to regulatory requests and subpoenas., Specifically, the Commissions Complaint alleges that:, Deutsche Bank Securities compensation system provided an incentive for research analysts to participate in investment activities and to assist in generating investment banking business.  Deutsche Bank Securities analysts also participated in pitches for investment banking business and prepared portions of pitchbooks used in such solicitations.  Some pitchbooks contained information that implied to issuers that Deutsche Bank Securities would provide positive research coverage if selected for an investment banking transaction, and that such coverage could result in rising stock prices for those companies., In certain instances, Deutsche Bank Securities published exaggerated or unwarranted research.  For example, one of Deutsche Bank Securities analysts issued positive recommendations on Oracle, notwithstanding his privately expressed view to a large institutional shareholder that the stock should be sold.  In another instance, an analyst in the software application sector referred to Eprise Corporation as permanent toast despite having a market perform rating on the company.  Finally, an analyst communicated to an executive officer of Deutsche Bank Securities investment banking client, Getty Images, Inc., about the price target he had given the company in an April 5, 2002 report.

Despite repeated inquiries from the regulators, Deutsche Bank Securities assured the staff during the investigation that its production of the e-mail was complete.  In fact, Deutsche Bank Securities had produced less than one-fourth of the responsive e-mail by April 2003.  Over the next year, Deutsche Bank Securities produced another 227,000 e-mail, more than tripling its original production and delaying completion of the investigation for over a year., Deutsche Bank Securities has agreed to settle the Commissions action and has consented, without admitting or denying the allegations of the Complaint, to the entry of a final judgment that, if approved by the court, permanently enjoins Deutsche Bank Securities from violations of Section 17(b) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 17(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and NASD and NYSE rules pertaining to just and equitable principles of trade (NASD Rule 2110; NYSE Rules 401 and 476), advertising (NASD Rule 2210; NYSE Rule 472), and supervisory procedures (NASD Rule 3010; NYSE Rule 342).

In addition, Thomas Weisel Partners must disclose on the first page of each research report whether the firm does or seeks to do investment banking business with that issuer, and when Thomas Weisel Partners decides to terminate coverage of an issuer, Thomas Weisel Partners must issue a final research report discussing the reasons for the termination.  Each quarter, Thomas Weisel Partners also will publish on its website a chart showing its analysts performance, including each analysts name, ratings, price targets, and earnings per share forecasts for each covered company, as well as an explanation of the firms rating system., Thomas Weisel Partners also has agreed as part of this settlement to retain, at its own expense, an Independent Monitor to conduct a review to provide reasonable assurance that the firm is complying with the structural reforms.  This review will begin on April 30, 2005, and the Independent Monitor will submit a written report of his or her findings to the SEC, NASD, and NYSE within 30 days from the completion of the review, but no later than October 31, 2005.

Under the terms of the Final Judgment of Permanent Injunction, Disgorgement, and Other Relief issued by United States District Court Judge Mark Kravitz, the defendants must disgorge $6 million constituting the funds raised from investors, Prater must pay $120,000 in civil penalties, Wellspring must pay $600,000 in civil penalties, and both defendants are permanently enjoined from future violations of certain provisions of the federal securities laws.  The defendants have no right to appeal.  The amounts collected from the defendants will be distributed to investors in the scheme., The Courts order approving the settlement resolves an action brought by the Commission against Prater and Wellspring on September 5, 2003.  The Commissions complaint alleged that the defendants operated a sophisticated Internet Ponzi scheme that raised millions of dollars from thousands of investors.  It further alleged that Praters scheme used a series of interrelated Internet web sites and a network of agents operating throughout the United States to guarantee prospective investors exorbitant returns through a variety of programs.  Under one set of programs, Prater, through Wellspring, promised that, in exchange for a small sum of money, it would pay investors returns as high as 1,000 percent per year in the form of payments for various living expenses of the investors, such as car loans, rent, or business expenses.  Under the terms of the settlement, the defendants neither admitted nor denied the allegations of the Commissions complaint., On April 19, 2004, the Court had previously ordered that all funds frozen by the Court at the request of the Commission be paid into the registry of the Court.  On June 7, 2004, the Court appointed a receiver, Lewis K. Wise of Rogin, Nassau, Caplan, Lassman &amp; Hirtle, LLC of Hartford, Connecticut to distribute the disgorged assets of the defendants to victims of the fraud.

The Final Judgment enjoins UST from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder.  , In a related proceeding instituted on August 26, 2004, the Commission issued an Order Instituting Proceedings pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Exchange Act against UST.

Gregory Earls, misappropriated approximately $13.8 million from investors who believed they were giving Earls money to purchase preferred stock and warrants from UST.  According to the complaint, Earls carried out this scam through a limited liability company he created called USV Partners LLC.  The complaint charged that Earls falsely told investors in USV Partners that the entity was created solely to purchase and hold UST stock and warrants, and that he would not take any management fees.  According to the complaint, Earls lured more than one hundred investors into giving him more than $20 million to purchase UST stock and warrants through USV Partners.  Although UST badly needed the capital infusion, according to the complaint, Earls bought only a small portion of the stock he promised investors.  He then allegedly misappropriated $13.8 million of their money by paying himself $4.7 million in management fees and $9.1 million that he falsely classified as Legal and Accounting expenses.  As alleged in the complaint, neither UST nor Earls has ever publicly disclosed Earls diversion of these investor funds. , On April 23, 2004, in a related criminal proceeding, a jury convicted Earls of 22 counts of securities fraud, mail fraud and wire fraud arising out of the same events and activities alleged in the Commissions complaint.  <i>United States v.

IN CONTEMPT OF COURT AND IMPOSES SANCTIONS </h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on August 11, 2004, U.S. District Judge Irma E. Gonzalez in San Diego issued an order finding defendant Alfred Louis Bobby Vassallo, Jr. to be in civil contempt.  The court found that Vassallo willfully violated prior orders of the Court designed to assist the Court-appointed permanent receiver over Vassallos former company, Presto Telecommunications, Inc. (Presto) of San Diego.  The Courts contempt order provides for sanctions against Vassallo of incarceration and monetary compensation to the receiver for losses that Vassallos past non-compliance has caused.  The Commission supported the receivers contempt application against Vassallo., The Courts contempt order found that Vassallo, 54, of La Jolla, California,  violated the Courts March 9, 2004 Order, which provided, among other things, for Vassallo to transfer control of Prestos 49% interest in Presto Telecomunicaciones, S.A. de C.V. (Presto Mexico) and Vassallos authority as legal representative of Presto Mexico to the receiver.  The Courts contempt order, modified by Judge Gonzalez on August 13, 2004, provided that by Thursday, August 19, 2004, Vassallo must comply with specific provisions of the Courts prior orders.  The Courts contempt order states that should Vassallo fail to strictly comply with the mandates of the contempt order, a warrant will issue for his arrest and he will be incarcerated until compliance is achieved.  In a separate order issued on August 19, 2004, the Court imposed a fine of $13,228 on Vassallo as compensation to the receivership estate for losses as a result of Vassallos contempt, which Vassallo must pay no later than September 10, 2004., The Commissions complaint against Presto and Vassallo, filed on January 27, 2004, in federal court in San Diego, alleged that the defendants induced more than 800 investors in 42 states to invest in Presto with promises that the company had significant business relationships with AT&amp;T, Sprint, MCI, and Qwest.  These four telecommunications companies had purportedly expressed interest in acquiring Presto or in making capital investments in the company.  Further, investors were advised that Presto was a partner to and has alliances with Cisco Systems and Unisys.  Investors were also told that the U.S. Commerce Department was lobbying Mexican telecommunications regulators on Prestos behalf, and that their funds would be used to build and operate a telecommunications network in Mexico.  According to the complaint, these representations were false.  , Additionally, the complaint alleged that while Vassallo and others have represented that investor funds would be used to pay Prestos business expenses, primarily fiber optics and equipment, in fact only 16% of investor and company funds were used for equipment and fiber, and Vassallo himself has misappropriated at least $1.2 million in investor and company funds for personal use.  Vassallo used the misappropriated funds to purchase jewelry and luxury automobiles, to make a down payment on an expensive home, and for mortgage payments, home improvements, political and charitable contributions, and school tuition for his children., On March 1, 2004, the District Court issued an order that preliminarily enjoins Presto and Vassallo from future violations of the registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Also on March 1, the District Court granted the other relief that the Commission sought, including an order freezing Prestos and Vassallos assets, and appointing Thomas F. Lennon as a permanent receiver over Presto.  In addition to the preliminary relief granted on March 1, the Commission seeks permanent injunctions, and other relief, including disgorgement and civil penalties, against Presto and Vassallo.  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18858.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Tel-One, Inc. et al.</i>, Civil Action 8:02-120-T-30TGW (M.D. Fla. 2002), in which the Commission alleged that Carapella and Lipstein orchestrated a pump-and-dump fraud involving the common stock of Tel-One, a Tampa, Florida company.  Following the entry of the injunctions, the Commission entered administrative orders in July 2002, on consent, that barred Carapella and Lipstein from participating in offerings of penny stocks., The Commissions most recent complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, alleges that despite the entry of those prior orders, the defendants participated in a penny stock offering in late 2003 and early 2004 by attempting to merge a Florida company they control with a private cellular telephone retailer and take the newly-created company public through a reverse merger or an initial public offering.  According to the Commissions complaint, the defendants fraudulently represented themselves as experienced consultants who had successfully taken companies public and concealed their history of criminal convictions, securities law violations, and enforcement actions against them.  , The Commission also alleges that Carapella and Lipstein currently control a Nevada shell company and are violating the Commissions penny stock bars by actively seeking a company to merge into that shell., The Commissions complaint charges the defendants with violating Sections 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933, and with participating in penny stock offerings in violation of Section 15(b)(6)(B)(i) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

The complaint alleges that from early 2000 through September 2002, Kimberly Securities registered representatives, or brokers, participated in a scheme to defraud their customers by repeatedly executing unauthorized, unsuitable transactions in their customers accounts, and churning these customers accounts.  , The complaint names the following defendants:, The complaint alleges the following.  From early 2000 until September 2002, Kimberly Carrella and Vincent Carrella directed the scheme to defraud Kimberly Securities customers.  In the initial phase of the scheme, Kimberly Carrella, Mancuso, Barton, Hourican, and Belmonte misrepresented, and failed to disclose, material information to investors to persuade them to open brokerage accounts at Kimberly Securities and to invest significant funds.  Once customers invested their funds, Kimberly Carrella, Mancuso, Barton, and Hourican executed numerous transactions that were unauthorized by, and unsuitable for, these customers, and the registered representatives churned their customers accounts.  When the customers accounts were depleted of funds through commission charges and trading losses, the defendants lured new, unsuspecting customers into opening accounts at Kimberly Securities, and repeated the same conduct.  Kawas assisted the scheme by, among other things, failing to address red flags that registered representatives were executing unauthorized trades and churning accounts, and by obstructing customers efforts to stop the improper trading in their accounts.  Through this scheme, defendants enriched themselves at their customers expense.  For example, from January 2000 to September 2002, Kimberly Securities charged customers approximately $4.5 million in commissions.  During the same time period, customers lost in excess of $4 million through trading losses and commission charges., The Commissions complaint charges Kimberly Carrella, Vincent Carrella, Mancuso, Barton, Hourican, and Belmonte with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The Commissions complaint alleged that the defendants, based in Orange County, perpetrated a $29.5 million securities fraud.  As part of the settlement, Nathanson and the defendant entities, controlled by a court-appointed receiver, consented to permanent injunctions, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint.  Additionally, the defendant entities agreed to disgorge all of their funds and assets pursuant to one or more plans of distribution approved by the court, less any court-approved receivership fees and expenses.  Nathanson consented to disgorge $4.7 million.  In satisfaction of this debt, Nathanson agreed to disgorge to the receiver all of his real property, including three parcels of land he owns in Orange County, as well as certain personal property that he owns.  Payment of the remainder of the $4.7 million is waived, based upon Nathansons demonstrated inability to pay., The Commissions complaint, filed on March 25, 2004, in federal court in Orange County, alleged that since 2001, Nathanson and his companies raised $29.5 million from over 1800 investors nationwide through four fraudulent investment schemes.  At the time the Commission filed its complaint, Nathanson was continuing to raise funds from investors in at least two of his schemes.  The first of Nathansons schemes involved selling securities in a golf equipment company he controlled, Giant Golf Co., which purportedly was preparing to conduct an IPO.  The second scheme was a Ponzi scheme involving several entities that would purportedly purchase air time to air Giant Golfs infomercials.  In the third scheme, Nathanson sold investment interests through the Nathanson Investment Trust in a purported unnamed software company that he claimed would soon be bought-out by a larger, unnamed, company.  Finally, the complaint alleged that Nathanson sold securities in a company known as Millennium Technical Group that Nathanson said would exploit certain FCC licenses purchased in 1994.  The Commission alleged that in these four schemes, the defendants lied to investors regarding how they would use the investor funds.  The complaint alleged that without the investors knowledge or consent, Nathanson commingled the investors monies, and used the commingled funds to operate both the unprofitable defendant businesses and his other various unprofitable businesses. , Additionally, the Commissions complaint alleged that since February 2001, Nathanson used at least $1 million of investor funds to support his extravagant lifestyle, including three homes and payment of $346,500 in gambling-related debts.  Finally, the Commission alleged that, in Ponzi-like fashion, Nathanson caused over $5 million of the $29.5 million raised to be paid to certain investors either as purported returns on their investments when, in fact, their investments were not profitable, or as purported returns of their principal., The Commission previously obtained a temporary restraining order against all defendants.

In resolving the parallel civil and criminal proceedings, Hannon has agreed to pay disgorgement and a civil penalty totaling $3.2 million and to cooperate with the governments continuing investigation., As alleged in the Commissions complaint, Hannon and other EBS executives engaged in a wide-ranging fraudulent scheme to, among other things, inflate the value of Enron stock through a series of false and misleading statements and the omission of material information in such public statements about the technology, financial condition, performance and value of EBS.  The false and misleading statements by Hannon and others were made in press releases over a two-year period as well as in presentations and statements made at Enrons annual analyst conferences in January 2000 and 2001.  As a result of the false statements, Enrons stock price was artificially inflated.

The Court also ordered the Defendants to preserve all documents.  The Commissions Complaint and Motions further request the entry of orders of temporary, preliminary and permanent injunction, disgorgement, civil penalties and other relief against the Defendants.  The Court has set a hearing for Tuesday, September 7 on the other relief sought., The Commission coordinated its investigation with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  The CFTC simultaneously filed an action in the same court and has obtained an order of similar relief against Harris and Tradewinds L.L.C. for fraud under the Commodity Exchange Act., The Commissions Complaint alleges that Defendants fraudulently raised at least $10 million from at least 30 investors for Tradewinds II, a private investment hedge fund, since July 2001.  The Complaint further alleges that the Defendants made false and misleading statements to investors regarding Tradewinds IIs past rates of return, net asset value and the use of investor funds., The Complaint alleges that, in July 2004, Harris sent certain investors e-mails and a DVD in which he confessed that he had falsely reported a 12% annual profit to investors in Tradewinds II for 2003, when in reality, Tradewinds II lost a significant amount of money.  Harris also claimed to have fled the country and to have taken the claimed remaining investor assets offshore.  , The Complaint also alleges that, while Harris told investors in 2003 that Tradewinds IIs net asset value was between $18 and $23 million, trading account statements reflect a total value of at most $1.1 million during 2003, and approximately $30,000 at the end of the year., The Complaint further alleges that, contrary to representations to investors, Harris used investor funds for purposes other than trading.  The Complaint alleges that, in 2003 and 2004, at least $2.4 million of investor funds were never transferred to the trading accounts, but were used instead for Harris personal and business expenses and to repay investors at artificially inflated rates, while Tradewinds II secretly incurred losses., The Courts Order finds that there is good cause to believe that Defendants have violated and will continue to engage in violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder unless immediately restrained and enjoined., <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18868.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Somoza, 36, of Beverly Hills.  As alleged in the complaint, prime bank instruments are supposedly high-yield, low-risk, and confidential investments.  One form of a prime bank scheme involves a supposed bank trading program where investor funds are purportedly used to trade high-grade bank notes.  In fact, such bank notes do not exist and are used to defraud investors., The complaint alleges that, from September 2002 to May 2003, the defendants offered and sold $6.7 million worth of notes to fifty investors nationwide, claiming that the funds would be used to finance a purported trading program that would buy and sell high-grade AA and AAA-rated bank notes, which is a common form of prime bank instrument.  The complaint also alleges that the defendants represented that investors would receive a guaranteed 120% per year return.  The complaint further alleges that, contrary to their representations, the defendants instead operated a Ponzi scheme, whereby they used $3.11 million in new investor funds to pay existing investors.  The complaint also alleges that the defendants misappropriated another $2.61 million in investor funds to support their lavish lifestyles, such as down payments on two luxury homes in Southern California and weekends at posh resorts, and to finance other business ventures.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, contrary to the defendants representations, there was no bank note trading program., The complaint, which was filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California - Western Division, alleges that each of the defendants violated the securities registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Johnson of Newfane, Vermont and Brooklyn, New York, was criminally indicted on mail fraud and money laundering charges by a federal grand jury convened by the United States Attorney for the District of Vermont.  Johnson was arraigned and pleaded not guilty on July 9.  The Commission charged Johnson with violations of the federal securities laws, in December 2000, based on related conduct., According to the indictment, Johnson was the registered agent for Kultivar, Inc., a Vermont corporation that held itself out to the public as being involved in the research, development and marketing of herbal and natural products.  Johnsons wife was the secretary, a director and the majority shareholder of Kultivar.  The indictment alleges that, between 1997 and 2000, investors throughout the United States were solicited to purchase shares of Kultivar stock and, through the solicitation, approximately 150 people were induced to invest a total of about $2 million in Kultivar.  The indictment further alleges that the promotional materials used in the solicitation contained materially false and fraudulent statements and representations, including claims regarding, among other things, Kultivars real estate holdings and other assets, research and cultivation facilities, patents, contracts, products ready for market and projected revenues and profits.  According to the indictment, Johnson wrote or participated in writing the promotional materials that were sent to prospective investors.  The indictment also alleges that Johnson personally made false and fraudulent representations to prospective investors regarding a future public offering of Kultivar stock and the significant increase of the stocks price that would follow.  In addition, the indictment alleges that Johnson diverted some of the proceeds from the sale of Kultivar stock to his own use and that he used several bank accounts in an effort to conceal his diversion of the funds.  The indictment charges Johnson with fourteen counts of mail fraud and one count of money laundering., In the civil action brought by the Commission in December 2000, the United States District Court in Vermont issued a temporary restraining order against Johnson, Kultivar and others in connection with the fraudulent stock offering.  In August 2002, by consent, the Court permanently enjoined Johnson from future violations of the antifraud and securities registration provisions of the federal securities laws and ordered him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains.  Also in August 2002, in settled administrative proceedings based on the entry of the injunction, the Commission barred Johnson from participation in any offering of penny stock.

MCNAUGHTON, INDIVIDUALLY AND D/B/A THE HAVEN EQUITY COMPANY, AND ANDREW K. LECH,</i> Civil Action No. 1:03cv1249 (N.D. OH. Filed June 23, 2003) (Judge Dan A. Polster)</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that it has filed a First Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Other Equitable Relief (Amended Complaint) in the above matter to add allegations of fraud against Defendant Andrew K. Lech (Lech).  The Court has also entered, pursuant to his consent, an order of Final Judgment and Order of Disgorgement against Defendant Gary L. McNaughton, individually and d/b/a The Haven Equity Company (McNaughton)., According to the Amended Complaint, from at least 1999 to June 2003, McNaughton raised at least $17 million from approximately 150 investors through the unregistered offer and sale of securities in the form of notes issued under the name of The Haven Equity Company. The Amended Complaint alleges that in selling these notes, McNaughton fraudulently guaranteed an annual return of 15% to 20% on a principal investment.  McNaughton told investors that they would receive their returns in the form of monthly interest payments.  The Amended Complaint alleges that McNaughton told investors that he would send their money to his wealthy childhood friend, Lech, who was supposed to use his expertise in options trading to generate the guaranteed returns.  The Amended Complaint also alleges that although McNaughton told Lech that he was sending him Haven Equity investor funds, Lech did not invest the funds.  Rather, Lech merely sent the investors funds back to McNaughton who used them to pay other investors their monthly interest.  According to the Amended Complaint, Lech knew that because the funds solicited from investors were not invested, it was impossible to realize the guaranteed returns. , According to the Amended Complaint, McNaughton and Lech also perpetuated the Haven Equity scheme by convincing investors to transfer their investment to Lech who offered his own notes (Lech notes).  Under the Lech notes, Lech personally guaranteed Haven Equity investors their principal and interest.  However, investors who executed Lech notes neither received their returns as guaranteed nor were repaid their principal.  The Amended Complaint also alleges that Lech lacked the financial resources to fulfill the notes he guaranteed.  Moreover, Lech used funds from bank accounts into which investor funds were deposited to pay numerous personal expenses.  The Amended Complaint adds allegations of fraud against Lech based on his involvement in the scheme and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains and a civil penalty against him.  The previous orders against Lech based on his unregistered offer and sale of securities, including an order freezing assets, remain in effect.  , On August 23, 2004, the Commission obtained, pursuant to McNaughtons consent, a Final Judgment and Order of Disgorgement which ordered that McNaughton was liable for disgorgement plus prejudgment interest of $6,228,351, representing profits he gained from his scheme.  The Final Judgment required McNaughton to pay $11,815.24 and waived the remainder of the disgorgement based on his sworn financial statement which showed that he could not pay more.  McNaughtons obligation to pay $11,815.24 will be satisfied by the same amount of funds currently frozen in a securities account belonging to Gary McNaughton.  , <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18875.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>, <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18875.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The Court likewise found Templin liable for operating his own Oxford website, as well as additional internet investment scams offering similarly incredible risk-free returns.  Through these fraudulent schemes, Roor and Templin each obtained at least $1 million from unsuspecting investors.  , The Court permanently enjoined Roor and Templin from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Judge Baer also ordered Roor and Templin to disgorge $1 million and $1,502,265.04, respectively, in funds that they fraudulently obtained from investors.  Roor also received a $100,000 civil money penalty.  Judge Baer refrained from ordering a civil money penalty against Templin, due to Templins prior criminal conviction concerning the same fraud.  Finally, the Court ordered that over $900,000 in previously-frozen funds associated with Templin and/or Roor be turned over to the Commission in partial satisfaction of the ordered disgorgement.  , Roor is a Dutch citizen who resides in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.  The Court previously held Roor in contempt for his failure to repatriate investors funds that Roor held overseas, and issued a warrant for Roors arrest upon entry into the United States., On May 13, 2003, in a separate criminal proceeding concerning the same fraudulent scheme, Templin pled guilty to two counts of a federal securities fraud indictment.  On September 9, 2003, Templin was sentenced in that proceeding to a prison term of 5 months and ordered to pay $40,000 in restitution., <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18876.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Conway of the Middle District of Florida in an insider trading case against Orlando real-estate agents Donna Yun of Longwood, Florida, and Jerry Burch of Heathrow, Florida.  The judgment ordered defendants Donna Yun and Jerry Burch to disgorge ill-gotten profits in the amount of $269,000, plus pre-judgment interest, and ordered them each to pay $100,000 in civil penalties for their illegal insider trading.  , On July 22, 2004, after a three-day retrial, a federal jury found Yun and Burch liable for fraud as a result of insider trading in options on the stock of Scholastic Corporation.  In its complaint, filed on February 3, 1999, the Commission alleged that on or before Tuesday, February 18, 1997, Yuns husband, then an officer of Scholastic, told Yun in confidence that Scholastic would announce that it expected a loss for the quarter ending February 28, 1997, and that the price of Scholastic common stock would likely decline as a result.  Yun breached her duty of confidence and disclosed the inside information at a cocktail party that Tuesday evening to her friend and colleague of six years, Jerry Burch.  During the following two days, Burch purchased 130 Scholastic put option contracts, including 10 February contracts that expired within 48 hours, that would rise in value if Scholastics stock price went down.  After Scholastic released its negative earnings announcement on February 20, 1997, Scholastics common stock price dropped approximately 40 percent, from $61.50 to $36.75.  On February 21, Burch exercised his options for a net profit of approximately $269,000 - a 1300 percent return on his two-day investment.  , 	The case had previously been tried before a jury in Tampa, Florida, in December 2000.  In the first trial, the jury also found both Yun and Burch liable for insider trading.  However, on appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit vacated the district courts judgment based on the district courts jury instructions.  The appeals court remanded the case for a second trial.  , The second jurys verdict finding insider trading in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, resulted in todays entry by the Clerk of the Court of the final judgment against Yun and Burch, requiring both defendants jointly and severally to pay disgorgement of the $269,000 illegal profits plus prejudgment interest, and imposing a $100,000 civil penalty on each., No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18805.htm>18805</a>, July 28, 2004<br/>No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17360.htm>17360</a>, February 12, 2002<br/>No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17047.htm>17047</a>, June 22, 2001<br/>No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr16840.htm>16840</a>, December 21, 2000<br/>No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr16052.txt>16052</a>, February 3, 1999,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18877.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The Commission alleges in its complaint that the defendants committed securities fraud in connection with a fraudulent scheme that has elicited at least $1.8 million from investors, many of whom are also securities brokerage customers of the defendants.  , In its complaint, the Commission alleges that the defendants are defrauding investors in the following manner: 1) Montana promises investors that M &amp; M Financial will purchase at a discount, with the investors pooled funds, large blocks of securities that he will select using his vast securities industry expertise; 2) Montana promises investors, and apparently in some instances guarantees investors, an annual return of up to 15 percent; 3) Montana assures the investors that their funds will remain safe, claiming that their moneys are SIPC insured; 4) on a monthly or quarterly basis, as evidence of the purported success and safety of the investments, Montana prepares and mails to the investors account statements purportedly reflecting the composition and value of their investments, and furnishes some investors automatic principal withdrawals.  The Commission further alleges that the defendants are fraudulently failing to disclose the following facts: 1) that the defendants are misappropriating a large portion of the investors funds; 2) that the defendants are not purchasing the securities reflected on the account statements Montana prepares and disseminates to the investors; and 3) the defendants, in classic Ponzi fashion, are using the investment monies of new investors to redeem the investments of preceding investors. , The Commission named in its complaint, as a relief defendant, Karen E.

The SEC also charged a former manager of Homestore for assisting in the fraudulent scheme.  Homestore, Inc. is a Westlake Village, Calif. company that provides real estate listings and related services on the Internet., With these charges, the SEC has sued a total of 14 individuals for their roles in the scheme, nine of whom have been criminally charged by the United States Attorney in Los Angeles.  , The SECs civil complaint and the United States Attorneys criminal informations, filed yesterday in United States District Court in Los Angeles, charge the following two defendants., <i>Clayton Chan</i>, 39, of San Francisco, California, was the vice president of Homestores Strategic Alliances Group (SAG) from January 2001 until July 2001 and was later promoted to senior vice president of SAG., <i>Geoffrey Infeld</i>, 36, of Thousand Oaks, California, is currently an officer and part-owner of Cyberhorse, Inc., a private sales and marketing company involved in the fraudulent transactions.  He was formerly a SAG salesperson at Homestore.  Infeld owned or controlled several private Internet companies that he used to assist Homestore in its fraud., In addition, the SECs civil complaint also charges the following defendant, who is not named in the criminal case:, <i>Gregory Antoniono</i>, 42, of Thousand Oaks, California, was the contracts manager at Homestore during 2001.  He later became Homestores director of contracts., The civil and criminal actions allege that the defendants participated in or assisted in negotiating, implementing and executing the fraudulent round-trip transactions.  The purpose of these transactions was to artificially inflate Homestores on-line advertising revenues.  All of the defendants knew that the essence of these transactions was a circular flow of money by which Homestore recognized its own cash as revenue.  Chan and Antoniono took steps to conceal the round-trip nature of the transactions from Homestores auditors.  Infeld used his companies as intermediaries in the round-trip transactions, knowing that Homestores revenues would be inflated as a result., The SEC charged Chan with violating numerous provisions of the federal securities laws, including the antifraud provisions, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; reporting provisions, Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-13 thereunder; record-keeping provisions, Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder; internal controls provisions, Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act; and lying to the auditors provisions, Rule 13b2-2 under the Exchange Act.  Antoniono and Infeld were charged with aiding and abetting Homestore or Homestore managements violations of the above provisions.  Additionally, the SEC alleged that Chan violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933., The United States Attorneys Offices criminal action, based upon a joint investigation by the SEC, United States Attorneys Office and FBI, charges Clayton Chan with one count of securities fraud in violation of Title 15, United States Code, Sections 78j(b) and 78ff, and Title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, Section 240.10b-5 and Geoffrey Infeld with one count of wire fraud in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1343., Chan and Infeld have agreed to settle the SECs lawsuit, to plead guilty to the criminal charges, and to cooperate with the government in its ongoing investigations.  Antoniono has agreed to settle the SECs lawsuit.  All three defendants settled the SEC lawsuit without admitting or denying the allegations, simultaneously with the filing of the complaint. , In the SEC case, Chan will be enjoined from committing future violations of the charged federal securities laws, will repay $179,124 in profits from his exercise of Homestore stock options and commissions he earned during the fraud, plus interest, and will pay a $50,000 civil penalty.  Chan will also be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for a period of ten years.  In the criminal action, Chan will plead guilty to securities fraud, carrying a maximum sentence of ten years. , In the SEC case, Infeld will be enjoined from committing future violations of the charged federal securities laws, will repay $17,400 representing profits from the fraudulent transaction with Homestore, plus interest, and will pay a civil penalty of $35,000.

The other entities and individuals operate as unregistered brokers., The Commissions complaint, filed today in United States District Court in San Diego, alleges that, since early 2003, the brokers have cold called prospective investors and solicited investments in Global Health, which, they represent, has developed a cancer treatment that is on the verge of FDA approval and, subsequently, has obtained FDA approval.  To convince prospective investors to invest in Global Health, or to induce existing investors to add to their investment, the defendants have disseminated letters on FDA letterhead that state that Global Healths cancer treatment has been approved by the FDA and that Global Health can soon begin marketing its product.  The defendants instruct investors to send their checks to one of two San Diego-area addresses used by the brokers.  , The complaint alleges that the FDA letters are forgeries, and the statements contained therein are false.  The letters were not authored by any employee or representative of the FDA and, in fact, the FDA has no record of Global Health or of any product purportedly manufactured by it.  Contrary to the representations in the letters, Global Health does not have any cancer treatment or other product that is undergoing the FDAs approval process.  Moreover, the addresses for the brokers are merely commercial mail drops from which the proposed defendants take investors checks across the border to Mexico, where they cash or deposit them in accounts at a Mexican bank in Tijuana., The Commission obtained an order temporarily restraining Global Clearing, Global Strategies, Goldman, Dory and Adams from committing securities fraud in violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and from violating the broker-dealer registration provisions of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act.

The Court waived payment of all but $75,000 of disgorgement and prejudgment interest owed by DOnofrio based on his demonstrated inability to pay.

Those offerings, which generally targeted unsophisticated investors, involved fraudulent misrepresentations and omissions regarding, among other things, the risk of the investment, the financial condition of the issuers, and the use of proceeds.  In addition, Sobieralski, DOnofrio, Walters, and Oslosky violated the registration provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) by failing to register as brokers or dealers before offering and selling those securities.  The defendants raised more than $2.3 million in these three offerings, and used the money to benefit themselves, pay salaries and other business and personal expenses, and pay existing investors.  Little if any of the money raised was used to grow the business of Mortgage Bankers or Commonwealth Capital as the defendants had told investors. No registration statement was on file or in effect with the Commission at any time for any of the three securities offerings., As part of the settlement, DOnofrio, Walters, Oslosky and Riley each agreed to have the Commission impose orders barring them from association with any broker or dealer, and from participating in any offering of a penny stock.  Sobieralski previously agreed to the imposition of such an order, which the Commission issued May 24, 2004.

The Commission also announced settled enforcement proceedings against three Fleming suppliers, five of these suppliers employees, and against former employees of two other Fleming suppliers, for causing certain of Flemings violations.  , To settle these charges, Fleming, the suppliers and the supplier employees each consented to Commission administrative orders to cease and desist from such violations.  The suppliers and supplier employees also agreed to pay civil penalties - ranging from $100,000 to $400,000 for the suppliers and from $25,000 to $75,000 for the supplier employees - that the Commission will obtain through related civil complaints it filed today in U.S. District Court in Sherman, Texas.  All parties settled without admitting or denying the Commissions non-jurisdictional findings., The Commissions administrative orders find that, over several quarters in late 2001 and into 2002, Fleming improperly accounted for a number of transactions - described internally as initiatives - to sustain an illusion of growth and financial strength when, in fact, its earnings were under tremendous pressure from a series of business reversals, including the failure of Kmart Corporation, its largest customer.  Over this span, Fleming became increasingly reliant on these initiatives to bridge the gap between Wall Street expectations and disappointing actual operating results. , The Commissions complaints in the civil actions allege that Fleming obtained misleading side letters from the suppliers to justify improperly accelerating accounting recognition of up-front payments the suppliers made to secure forward-looking contracts.  The Commission alleges the following suppliers and employees engaged in these types of improper transactions (the numbers in parentheses are the civil penalties each agreed to pay in the civil actions):, Dean Foods Company ($400,000), a publicly traded dairy product supplier based in Dallas, and John D. Robinson ($50,000), a senior executive in its dairy division;, Kemps LLC, f/k/a Marigold Foods LLC ($150,000), a privately held dairy product supplier headquartered in Minneapolis, and its CEO, James Green ($50,000), and vice president of financial services, Christopher Thorpe ($50,000);, Digital Exchange Systems, Inc.

Hall is Chairman of D.C. Advisory Neighborhood Commission 6C, an elected DC governmental position. , First United is a Washington, DC limited liability corporation incorporated in 2001.  In promotional materials sent to investors, First United purported to be a multi-million dollar DC based [financial services] consulting firm., Willis, 30, is also a Washington, DC resident and was the Chief Operating Officer of First United from May 2001 to November 2002. , The Commissions Complaint alleges that, from at least June 2001 until August 2003, the defendants offered and sold securities called Asset Placement Agreements in unregistered transactions to more than 150 investors in at least 18 states.  Through cold calls, seminars, sales agents and newspaper advertisements, First United raised over $1.38 million.  In connection with the offer and sale of securities, according to the complaint, Hall and Willis made misrepresentations and omissions of material fact to investors concerning, among other things, the use of investor funds, expected returns, and the investment risks, including the following., The Asset Placement Agreements offered fixed rates of return as unrealistically high as 15% per month or 180% per year., First United, Hall and Willis represented that the investment did not pose any risk to investors principal. , First United, Hall and Willis represented that investors pooled funds would be invested in real estate in Washington, DC to assist lower and moderate income residents in a friendly real estate development system to assist residents who might be displaced by the market pressures of gentrification.  In fact, the defendants invested no funds in real estate projects in Washington, DC or elsewhere., First United, Hall and Willis used most of the funds invested to pay the capital gains of earlier investors, and dissipated the remaining funds in personal use and in paying the alleged operating expenses of First United.  The defendants did not inform investors that their funds would not be invested in real estate but instead would be used to pay the capital gains of earlier investors.  , First United, Hall and Willis issued misleading account statements to investors misrepresenting returns on investments that did not exist., The Commission alleges that the proposed defendants violated Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act, and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Commission is seeking permanent injunctions, disgorgement with prejudgment interest and civil penalties from each of the proposed defendants.  The Commission also seeks a permanent conduct-based injunction enjoining Hall from participating in any sale or offer of any security in an unregistered transaction. , The Commission acknowledges the assistance and cooperation of the United States Attorneys Office for the District of Columbia and the United States Postal Inspection Service in this matter.

Laggos, of Homer Glen, Illinois and the owner and publisher of Money Makers Monthly, an Illinois-based magazine. , 	The Complaint alleges, among other things, that Converge and TeleWrx jointly issued a press release on Monday, June 24, 2002 which falsely claimed in the headline that, as the result of its recent weekend national launch, TeleWrx had raised over $1 million.  The release also falsely claimed that, as a result of the weekend launch, TeleWrx had signed up nearly 1,000 distributors (to distribute its telecommunications equipment).  The Complaint further alleges that Brown and Fink were responsible for drafting and issuing the false June 24 press release.  The Complaint also alleges that, on Tuesday, June 25, Laggos Money Makers Monthly issued a press release with the headline TeleWrx Explosive Launch May Set New Records and reiterating the $1 million figure used in the June 24 press release.  The June 25 release went on to note that [t]here have been companies in the network marketing industry that have reached a billion dollars faster than Microsoft.  TeleWrx is destined to be one of these companies.  The June 25 release also predicted that [b]y the end of its first year, it will be a surprise if TeleWrx is not operating at a hundred million dollar annual rate.  In fact it is quite possible that TeleWrx will reach the billion dollar rate within the first three years.  Fifteen days earlier, on June 10, Laggos Money Makers Monthly had issued another laudatory press release concerning TeleWrx.  Finally, Laggos Money Makers Monthly published a laudatory article concerning TeleWrx in its July 2002 issue.  The Complaint alleges that Laggos was compensated by Converge and/or TeleWrx, in both stock and cash, for issuing the above-mentioned press releases and article.  Laggos failed to disclose said compensation in any of the aforementioned publications., 	As a result of the conduct described in the Complaint, the Commission has charged Converge, TeleWrx, Brown and Fink with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder (antifraud provisions) and Laggos with violations of Section 17(b) of the Securities Act of 1933 (touting provision).

The balance of these accounts totals approximately $27.6 million, money which the Commission intends to recommend be distributed to defrauded investors.

A.C.L.N. formerly claimed to ship used vehicles to North and West Africa and to sell new cars in that region.  Following the SECs imposition of a trading suspension in March 2002, the New York Stock Exchange de-listed A.C.L.N.s securities, the first such action by the Exchange since 1975.  The SEC alleged, in its complaint filed October 8, 2002, that from 1998 through the third quarter of 2001, A.C.L.N. operated an elaborate financial fraud resulting in losses totaling millions of dollars to investors in the U.S. and abroad.  , Without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions complaint, A.C.L.N., Labiad and Scandinavian Car Carriers consented to the entry of an order that they disgorge the balance of certain frozen bank accounts in Europe they controlled.

Tsao, a former executive at MedImmune, Inc., a biotechnology company based in Gaithersburg, Maryland.   The Commissions complaint, originally filed on June 2, 2003, alleged that Tsao engaged in three separate episodes of insider trading between September 1999 and December 2001, from which he realized aggregate illicit profits of $146,850.00.  The Commissions Complaint also alleged that when Tsao testified before the SEC staff during the investigation of this matter, he falsely denied having placed or authorized any of the relevant trades in two of the three separate instances of insider trading - and provided a false alternative explanation for the trading., Without admitting or denying the allegations of the Complaint, Tsao consented to the entry of a Final Judgment against him that (i) permanently enjoins him from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, (ii) bars him from acting as an officer or director of a public company, (iii) requires him to disgorge $146,850.00 in illicit profits, and $24,758.30 in pre-judgment interest thereon, and (iv) orders him to pay civil money penalties, pursuant to Section 21A of the Exchange Act, in the amount of $220,275.00 and a Remedies Act penalty, pursuant to Section 21(d)(3) of the Exchange Act, of $110,000.00.   The Final Judgment permits Tsao to offset his payment of disgorgement and civil penalty by the corresponding amounts, if any, of restitution and criminal fine, respectively, he pays in connection with the parallel criminal proceeding described below.  The Final Judgment is subject to the approval of the United States District Court. , Also today, in a related criminal proceeding, the United States Attorneys offices for the District of Maryland and for the District of Columbia announced that Tsao -- in a proceeding held today before the Honorable Henry H. Kennedy, Jr., United States District Court Judge for the District of Columbia -- has plead guilty to one felony count of criminal insider trading and one felony count of perjury arising from false statements that Tsao made to the SEC staff during the investigation. , The Commissions complaint alleged that on each of three occasions, within days after learning that MedImmune was involved in confidential negotiations concerning a possible business combination with another public company - the first being U.S. BioScience, Inc., the second ImClone Systems, Inc., and the third Aviron - Tsao bought stock in the other company (and, in the case of ImClone, MedImmune stock as well).  On each occasion, according to the complaint, Tsao bought the stock over the Internet in a securities account that, although nominally held by his parents in Taiwan, Tsao had opened, controlled, treated as his own, funded with his own assets, and used to pay his household expenses.  The complaint also alleged that, after Tsao learned that NASD Regulation, Inc. (NASDR) was investigating trading in one of the stocks at issue, he took steps to distance himself from this account, and later provided a false explanation of his trading to the SEC staff., The Commissions complaint alleged as follows:, On September 16 and 17, 1999, Tsao bought 6,000 shares of U.S. BioScience after he had previously learned that MedImmune was at an advanced stage in confidential negotiations concerning a possible acquisition of U.S. BioScience.  The acquisition was publicly announced on September 22, 1999, and Tsao sold the U.S. BioScience stock on September 30, 1999 for a profit of $18,000., On December 4 and 14, 2000, Tsao bought 2000 shares of MedImmune stock and 2000 shares of ImClone stock, respectively, based on limit orders placed in late November.  The purchases were made after Tsao had learned that the two companies were involved in negotiations to jointly manufacture ImClones then leading cancer drug in development.  Ultimately, the contemplated venture fell through, but ImClone eventually consummated a similar agreement with a major pharmaceutical company nearly a year later, which involved a partial tender offer from which Tsao realized profits of $50,475 upon the tender of some of the ImClone shares., On November 23, 2001, Tsao bought 10,000 shares of Aviron after he had previously learned that MedImmune was in confidential negotiations concerning a possible acquisition of Aviron.  The acquisition was publicly announced on December 3, 2001, and Tsao sold the Aviron stock on December 26, 2001 for a profit of $146,132.  , After learning in February 2002 that NASDR was investigating trading in Aviron securities, Tsao called his online brokerage firm on several occasions to obtain information that would facilitate his creation of an innocent explanation for his Aviron trading.  In one call, during which he claimed to be his father, Tsao also changed the password for Internet access to the account in question, which had previously consisted of characters reflecting his own personal information.  He later changed the e-mail address on the account, which had previously been his own e-mail address at MedImmune., When Tsao testified before the SEC staff on October 15, 2002, he falsely denied having placed or authorized any of the relevant trades in U.S. BioScience or Aviron, and provided a false alternative explanation for the trading., The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the United States Attorneys Offices for the District of Maryland and for the District of Columbia, and the FBI in the investigation of this matter.

From the fall of 1999 until the summer of 2000, iShop conducted a series of fraudulent and unregistered securities offerings.  IShop distributed offering memoranda and other documents to investors that misrepresented, and failed to disclose, material information concerning iShops business operations.  Knight, Yeroushalmi, and Brockop also made oral misrepresentations to investors falsely indicating that iShop had imminent plans to conduct an initial public offering of stock, and that after the IPO, iShops stock would dramatically increase in value.  Knight also established a boiler room operation at iShop, which Brockop supervised.  Through this boiler room, employees cold-called potential investors, and made material misrepresentations to induce them to purchase iShop stock.  Through the offerings, iShop sold approximately 6,748,600 shares of stock to over 350 investors, and obtained proceeds of approximately $2.3 million.  IShop did not file a registration statement for the sale of these securities, and there was no registration statement otherwise in effect., The Commissions complaint charges iShop, Knight, Yeroushalmi, and Brockop with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The SEC alleges that from 1998 to 2000, Computer Associates routinely kept its books open to record revenue from contracts executed after the quarter ended in order to meet Wall Street quarterly earnings estimates. In total, Computer Associates prematurely recognized $2.2 billion in revenue in FY2000 and FY2001 and more than $1.1 billion in premature revenue in prior quarters.

Woghin has agreed in a partial settlement to a permanent injunction and officer and director bar with monetary sanctions to be decided at a later point., The SECs complaints, filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, allege as follows:, With no regard for generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) or their financial reporting obligations, the defendants manipulated Computer Associates quarter end cutoff to align Computer Associates reported financial results with market expectations., During the period from at least Jan. 1, 1998, through Sept. 30, 2000, Computer Associates prematurely recognized over $3.3 billion in revenue from at least 363 software contracts that Computer Associates, its customer, or both parties, had not yet executed, in violation of GAAP., Executives, including defendants Kumar, Richards, and Woghin, held Computer Associates books open for several days after the end of each quarter to improperly record in that quarter revenue from contracts that were not executed by customers or Computer Associates until several days or more after the expiration of the quarter. As a result of this improper practice, Computer Associates made material misrepresentations and omissions about its revenue and earnings in SEC filings and other public statements.  For example, in the first, second, third and fourth quarters of FY2000, respectively, Computer Associates inflated its properly recorded revenue by approximately 25%, 53%, 46%, and 22% by improperly including prematurely recognized revenue. , After Computer Associates substantially refrained from recognizing revenue prematurely from contracts that its customers had signed after quarter end during the first quarter of its fiscal year 2001, the company missed its earnings estimate and Computer Associates stock price dropped over 43% in a single day., Computer Associates continued the improper practice of improperly recognizing revenue from contracts that Computer Associates signed after quarter end through the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2000., The individual defendants furthered Computer Associates fraud as follows:, Kumar (1) oversaw and implemented Computer Associates extended quarters practice while knowing, or recklessly disregarding the fact that, such practice would result in Computer Associates prematurely and improperly recognizing revenue; (2) signed Forms 10-K and 10-Q, filed by Computer Associates with the SEC, which contained materially false and misleading revenue and earnings results; and (3) signed at least two contracts which were backdated or misleadingly dated, and participated in obtaining other backdated contracts, while knowing, or recklessly disregarding, that such contracts would result in improper revenue recognition by Computer Associates., Richards (1) participated with other Computer Associates executives in the practice of extending Computer Associates fiscal quarters; (2) instructed and allowed subordinates to negotiate and obtain contracts after quarter end while knowing, or recklessly disregarding the fact that, Computer Associates would improperly recognize the revenue from those contracts; and (3) failed to alert Computer Associates Finance or Sales Accounting Departments that Computer Associates salespersons that reported to Richards were obtaining contracts with backdated signature dates after quarter end., Woghin (1) signed a Form S-4 and a Form S-4 amendment that Computer Associates filed with the SEC in February and March 2000, while knowing, or recklessly disregarding the fact that, those filings contained materially false and misleading information regarding Computer Associates prior revenue and earnings per share; (2) approved backdated contracts, including drafting a contract with misleading dates; and (3) allowed Computer Associates Legal Department to approve contracts obtained by the sales force while knowing, or recklessly disregarding the fact that, those contracts contained false and misleading signature dates and that Computer Associates would recognize revenue from those contracts in the incorrect fiscal quarter., While the accounting fraud was occurring, defendants Kumar, Richards and Woghin received ill-gotten gains in the form of compensation they received from Computer Associates. In addition to committing securities fraud, the defendants interfered with the SECs investigation.  During the course of the SECs investigation, Kumar made materially false and misleading statements in a joint proffer session with the SEC and the United States Attorneys Office.  During the same relevant period, Richards made materially false and misleading statements in sworn investigative testimony and Woghin encouraged several Computer Associates employees to make false and misleading statements to the SEC and/or Computer Associates outside counsel. , Computer Associates has agreed to the following relief:, A permanent injunction against future violations of the antifraud, reporting, books and records and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws., Forward looking remedial relief, including, for at least 18 months, that Computer Associates will be subject to the review of an Independent Examiner, reporting to the SEC, the Justice Department and Computer Associates Board of Directors.  Also, Computer Associates will establish a comprehensive new ethics and compliance program, overseen by a new Chief Compliance Officer, and a new Compliance Committee of its Board of Directors., A deferred prosecution agreement with the USAO requiring Computer Associates to pay $225 million to injured shareholders and directing Computer Associates to undertake the same remedial measures in the SEC consent judgment., Woghin has consented to a partial judgment imposing a permanent injunction prohibiting him from violating the antifraud reporting, books and records and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws.  The partial judgment also permanently bars Woghin from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  The Commissions claims for disgorgement and civil penalties against Woghin, and all of its claims against the other individual defendants, remain pending.

(Mobile Billboards), International Payphone Company (International Payphone) itself and doing business as Outdoor Media Industries (Outdoor Media), Reserve Guaranty Trust (Reserve Guaranty), Michael A. Lomas (Lomas) and Michael L. Young (Young).  Mobile Billboards is a Delaware corporation with offices in Newbury, Ohio and Bridgeton, Missouri.  International Payphone, a Delaware corporation, maintains its principal office in Norcross, Georgia. Outdoor Media is a division of International Payphone and has offices in Newbury, Ohio and Bridgeton, Missouri.  Reserve Guaranty, a Delaware statutory trust, is located in Washington, DC.  Lomas, who resides in Long Beach, California, is the chairman of Mobile Billboards.  Young is the president and a director of Mobile Billboards and resides in Bridgeton, Missouri., 	The complaint alleges that from 2001 through the present, defendants Lomas, Young, Mobile Billboards, Outdoor Media and Reserve Guaranty operated a Ponzi scheme involving the sale and leaseback of mobile billboards, selling more than $60.5 million of mobile billboard investments to more than 700 investors nationwide.  According to the complaint, Mobile Billboards sold to investors a billboard frame that attached to the sides of a truck and a GPS monitoring system for $20,000. Mobile Billboards also entered into an agreement with the investor to buy-back the frame from the investor at the end of the seven year lease for its original purchase price. The complaint alleges that Outdoor Media leased the billboard frames back from investors for seven years for monthly payments equivalent to 13.49% annually.  The complaint also alleges that Reserve Guaranty issued Trust Secured Certificates that guaranteed funding for Mobile Billboards commitment to buy back the billboard frames at full price at the end of each seven-year lease.   According to the complaint, the collective business did not generate sufficient advertising revenue to make monthly lease payments to investors and, instead, relied on new investor money to make those payments.  The complaint also alleges that Mobile Billboards sales materials made false claims grossly overstating the number of operational billboards and misrepresented the value of assets contributed to Reserve Guaranty., The complaint charges the defendants with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Lomas and Young  with aiding and abetting violations of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act,.

Small lot baiting or spoofing involves an order placed by a market participant with the intention of briefly triggering a market movement from which the participant or others may benefit by trading the opposite side of the original manipulative order.  The Complaint further alleges that to carry out the scheme, Awdisho, Kundrat and Smolinski placed limit orders for a small number of options contracts on one options exchange to artificially raise or lower that exchanges quoted bid or offer.  Awdisho, Kundrat and Smolinski then purchased or sold much larger opposite positions on other exchanges that matched the artificially raised or depressed price displayed at the first exchange.  After their larger orders were executed, the Awdisho, Kundrat and Smolinski immediately sent an order to cancel the initial bait order.  As a result of the scheme, the Complaint alleges that Awdisho, Kundrat and Smolinski unfairly profited at least $25,000 by obtaining execution of their larger orders at more favorable prices than otherwise available in the market., Simultaneous with the filing of the Commissions Complaint, Awdisho, Kundrat and Smolinski consented, without admitting or denying the allegations of the Complaint, to permanent injunctions against future violations of Sections 9(a)(2) and 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, the antimanipulation and antifraud Sections of the Exchange Act.

The defendants consented to the entry of Final Judgments without admitting or denying the allegations of the Complaint. , The Complaint, which was filed on July 10, 2003, alleged that, from September 1997 through October 2000, the defendants raised $8.9 million from the sale of AlphaCom securities to over 1000 investors.  The Complaint alleged that the defendants raised these funds by falsely representing that AlphaCom owned exclusive rights to novel Internet technologies, Network Utilities (NU) and Very Minimal Shift Keying (VMSK), that were supposed to increase Internet downloading speeds and the speed of access to the Internet.  The Complaint alleged that, contrary to the representations, AlphaCom did not own the technologies.  The Complaint further alleged that AlphaCom had merely entered into contingent agreements to acquire the technologies, but failed to fulfill the agreements because it did not pay a total of $4 million required under the agreements.  The Complaint also alleged that Snyder falsely represented that AlphaCom owned the exclusive rights to sell the Insat Wireless Modem, a modem that provides wireless access to the Internet, when, in reality, he had failed to acquire those rights., In addition, the Complaint alleged that Snyder and AlphaCom misrepresented that investors funds would be used for AlphaComs business.  The Complaint alleged that Snyder misused $451,000 of the AlphaCom offering proceeds to buy a home and $500,000 to make a loan to Kendron, who did not repay the loan.

Dooley, who served as Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer and then Chief Executive Officer of Electro Scientific Industries, Inc. (ESI), and James E. Lorenz, III, the companys former Corporate Controller.  ESI, which makes manufacturing equipment for electronics and other high-technology manufacturers, is one of Portland, Oregons largest public companies.  According to the Commissions complaint, Mr. Dooley and Mr. Lorenz engaged in a scheme to improperly inflate ESIs financial results, reporting a false profit rather than a loss for ESIs quarter ended August 31, 2002, and a substantially reduced loss for the quarter ended November 30, 2002.  After the fraud was discovered in 2003, ESI was later forced to correct the results for both quarters in a restatement of its financial results., In a separate action, the Commission also charged that John E. Isselmann, Jr., ESIs former General Counsel, failed to provide important information to ESIs Audit Committee, Board of Directors, and independent auditors regarding the key accounting transaction that enabled ESI to report a profit rather than a loss in the quarter ended August 31, 2002.  Without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, Mr. Isselmann agreed to settle the enforcement action by paying a $50,000 civil penalty and consenting to an order prohibiting certain securities law violations., According to the complaint against them, beginning in at least the fall of 2002, Mr. Dooley, 50, of Cape Coral, Florida, and Mr. Lorenz, 41, of Portland, Oregon, conspired to falsely inflate ESIs declining financial results by covering up significant expenses through various accounting devices.  The fraud reached its climax during a late-night meeting on September 12, 2002 when Mr. Dooley and Mr. Lorenz secretly and unilaterally decided to eliminate all retirement and severance benefits for ESIs employees in Asia in order to increase ESIs bottom line for the quarter by $1 million.  The accounting fraud caused ESI to issue press releases and file quarterly reports with the Commission containing materially false financial statements that understated expenses and overstated net income.  In certifications required by the recently enacted Sarbanes- Oxley Act, Mr. Dooley also falsely stated that ESIs quarterly reports filed with the Commission were truthful.  As a result of the restatement, ESIs net income for the quarter ended August 31, 2002, was restated from a profit of $158,000 to a net loss of $3,394,000, and ESIs net loss for the quarter ended November 30, 2002, was restated from $9,548,000 to $12,908,000., With respect to the former General Counsel Isselmann, the Commission alleged that, although not involved in Mr. Dooley and Mr. Lorenzs late-night activities on September 12, 2002, Mr. Isselmann failed to provide important information to the Audit Committee, Board of Directors, and outside auditors relating to one of the restated accounting transactions.  Isselmann attended a meeting with ESIs Audit Committee and independent auditors to review the financial results for the quarter ended August 31, 2002, where he did not question a false statement by Dooley that the decision to eliminate the retirement benefits for employees in Asia had been reviewed by legal counsel.  Isselmann also was provided a document written for ESIs independent auditors stating that ESI was under no legal obligation to provide retirement benefits to its Japanese employees.  Isselmann later received written legal advice that contradicted what the Audit Committee and outside auditors had been told.  The advice stated that the law prohibited the unilateral elimination of such benefits.  Despite having opportunities to convey the advice to ESIs Audit Committee, Board, and independent auditors, Isselmann failed to do so.  Isselmanns failure allowed Dooley and Lorenz to hide an ongoing fraud.  Moreover, while in possession of the written legal advice stating that the law prohibited the unilateral elimination of the benefits, Isselmann was involved in the review process for ESIs quarterly report filed with the Commission describing the elimination of the benefits and the resulting impact on ESIs income.  Isselmanns conduct was a cause of the Company reporting materially false financial results for ESIs first quarter ended August 31, 2002, and violated a Commission rule prohibiting officers of public companies from omitting to state material facts to independent auditors., The Commissions civil complaint against Mr. Dooley and Mr. Lorenz, filed in federal district court in Portland, alleges that they violated or aided and abetted violations of the antifraud, internal controls, and books-and-records provisions of the federal securities laws (Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-13, and 13b2-1 thereunder).  The complaint also charges that Dooley and Lorenz lied to ESIs outside auditors in violation of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-2, and that Dooley falsely certified that ESIs Commission filings were truthful in violation of Exchange Act Rule 13b-14.  The complaint seeks an injunction, civil monetary penalties, disgorgement, and an order barring Mr. Dooley and Mr. Lorenz from serving as an officer or director of a public company., The Commissions lawsuit against Isselmann charges that he omitted to state necessary material facts to ESIs independent auditors in violation of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-2.  Under the settlement, without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, Mr. Isselmann agreed to pay a $50,000 civil penalty and consented to an injunction against similar securities law violations, and a Commission order directing that he cease and desist from causing violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-13.  , The Commission also announced today that it would not bring any enforcement action against ESI because of its swift, extensive, and extraordinary cooperation in the Commissions investigation. This cooperation included reporting its discovery of possible misconduct to the Commission immediately upon the Audit Committees learning of it, conducting a thorough and independent internal investigation, sharing the results of that investigation with the government (including not asserting any applicable privileges and protections with respect to written materials furnished to the Commission staff), terminating responsible wrongdoers, facilitating the Commission staffs investigation overseas, and implementing remedial actions designed to prevent the recurrence of fraudulent conduct.  These actions, among others, significantly facilitated the Commissions expeditious investigation of this matter., In a separate action, the United States Attorneys Office for the District of Oregon announced the filing of criminal securities fraud charges against Dooley and Lorenz.

Carney in Los Angeles found a Southern California real estate developer and its manager committed securities fraud and ordered them to pay a total of $5.9 million in penalties.  The Court found that the developer, Pacific Golf Community Development LLC (Pacific Golf), and its manager, Manoucher Sarbaz, misled purchasers of municipal bonds used to finance a portion of the planned Rancho Lucerne housing development and golf course in Lucerne Valley, California.  , In a 24-page decision, Judge Carney found that Pacific Golf and Sarbaz knew that land purchased with the bond proceed and pledged as security for repayment was not worth $28,000 per acre  the amount stated in documents offering the bonds to the public.  The Court found that various companies controlled by Sarbaz acquired the land for an average price of $1,812 per acre.  The Court further found that Pacific Golf and Sarbaz had no reasonable basis for their projections that they could sell hundreds of lots within the development each year.  The Court observed that, to date, not a single lot had been sold nor had the golf course been completed.  The Court found that more than $53 million in bonds were in default.  , The Court entered a judgment ordering Pacific Golf to pay a civil penalty of $4,900,000 and ordering Sarbaz to pay a civil penalty of $980,000.  The Court also issued an injunction that ordered both parties to refrain from fraudulent activities in the future.  , A third defendant in the action, appraiser Lee Andrew Hill, settled with the Commission prior to trial.  As part of the settlement, the Court ordered Hill to refrain from future securities fraud. , The case against Pacific Golf and Sarbaz was the second action brought by the Commission concerning municipal bonds sold for the Rancho Lucerne development.

(AFamily Heritage@), a privately held company located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  , The Commission=s Complaint alleges that, from 1998 through April 2003, Atkinson and Walker defrauded investors through the offer and sale of unregistered securities, in the form of investment contracts, issued by Family Heritage.  The defendants fraudulently raised $6.34 million from approximately 324 investors, to whom they sold purported investments in automatic teller machines (AATMs@).  To date, investors have lost approximately $4.3 million., The Complaint alleges that Atkinson and Walker, directly and through their salespersons, fraudulently induced individuals to purchase these securities by making numerous material misrepresentations and omissions concerning, among other things, the cost of purchasing and installing each ATM, and the Company=s high operating costs and corresponding lack of profitability.  Walker also falsely told investors that their Family Heritage investment Acould not lose money,@ and that their money could be withdrawn at any time.  The Complaint further alleges that the defendants did not tell investors that Family Heritage=s ATM operations were not making money, and that new investor funds were being used to make monthly payments to other investors.  In addition, beginning in October 2001, Atkinson and Walker stopped purchasing ATMs but continue to accept investor funds.  During the course of the fraud, Atkinson, who was President of Family Heritage, and Walker, who was its Executive Vice-President, took $408,727 and $433,266, respectively, from Family Heritage, largely consisting of investor funds. , The Complaint alleges that Atkinson and Walker violated Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement together with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18899.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>, <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18899.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The order requires Nguyen to disgorge ill-gotten profits in the amount of $185,559, plus prejudgment interest, and orders him to pay $371,118 in civil penalties.  In May 2004, Nguyen consented to the entry of final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In consenting to the injunction, Nguyen neither admitted nor denied the allegations in the Commissions complaint, except that he agreed to the Commissions allegations being accepted and deemed true by the court for the purpose of determining appropriate monetary remedies.  In July 2004, the Commission filed its motion for disgorgement, prejudgment interest and civil penalties, which Nguyen contested.  The court granted the Commissions motion without a hearing., 	In addition, in the same insider trading case, a final judgment was entered on September 23, 2004, against Chanh Nguyen of Chanhassen, Minnesota.

Chanh Nguyen consented to the entry of the judgment, but in doing so neither admitted nor denied the allegations in the Commissions complaint., 	The Commission alleged in its complaint against Phong Nguyen and Chanh Nguyen, filed on January 16, 2003, that Phong Nguyen bought 71,000 shares of iNTELEFILM Corporation, a Minnesota-based advertising company, shortly before the company publicly announced on December 8, 1999 that it was working with AT&amp;T Corporation to develop an Internet-based product called Intelesource.org and that he made $185,559 in profits when the stock price increased immediately after the announcement.  Nguyen was a data networking account executive for AT&amp;T during the relevant time period, worked on the Intelesource.org project, and knew that iNTELEFILM was planning a public announcement about it.  The Commission also alleged that Chanh Nguyen bought 5,000 shares of iNTELEFILM stock shortly before the Intelesource.org project was announced and made $14,062.  A close friend of Phong Nguyen, Chanh Nguyen worked for Business Integration Services, an agent of AT&amp;T that was procuring computer hardware for Intelesource.org.

The Commission alleged that the Ensors illegally sold TALX shares in advance of a negative press release issued by the company after the close of trading on November 14, 2002.  Linda Ensor, a former executive assistant at TALX Corporation, learned of the contents of the press release on the morning of November 14, 2002, when she performed various administrative tasks in preparation for the releases issuance.  After completing these tasks, Linda Ensor drove to her home and called Stephen Ensor to inform him of the contents of the forthcoming announcement.  During the phone call, Stephen Ensor began placing online orders to sell all 5,510 shares held in the couples retirement accounts.  The illegal sales generated total proceeds of $70,298 and enabled the Ensors to avoid the effects of a dramatic decline in TALXs stock price the following day.  , The Complaint charges the Ensors with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. § 78j(b), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5.

Garg (Garg) and Garg Data International, Inc. (Garg Data) with aiding and abetting violations of the antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws.  According to the complaint, the defendants aided and abetted a fraudulent scheme to artificially inflate the first quarter 2001 (Q1 2001) revenues of PurchasePro.com, Inc. (PurchasePro or the Company), a Las Vegas-based Internet company now known as Pro-After, Inc.  Defendants Garg and Garg Data have agreed to settle the charges against them by consenting to the entry of final judgments, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, that will impose full injunctive relief and that will, in the case of Garg, also impose a civil penalty of $50,000., 	The Commissions complaint against Garg and Garg Data alleges that the defendants aided and abetted PurchasePros fraudulent inflation of its Q1 2001 reported revenues by knowingly: (i) engaging in a sham wash transaction with PurchasePro; (ii) signing a contract for the wash transaction after the close of Q1 2001 that used an earlier misleading effective date that Garg knew was designed to allow PurchasePro to improperly record the transaction in Q1 2001; and (iii) causing the return of a false and misleading confirmation of the transaction to PurchasePros outside auditors. , The complaint alleges that in the second quarter of 2001, Garg completed negotiations with PurchasePro for, and then executed a contract to buy, a $3.5 million marketplace license for PurchasePro software that Garg had no intention to use and that Garg Data could not afford.  In fact, the complaint alleges, Garg Data already owned a marketplace license for PurchasePros software that it had purchased several months earlier. The complaint further alleges that PurchasePro effectively funded its own revenues by agreeing to buy approximately $10 million of goods and services from Garg and forwarding $4 million to Garg  -- which Garg then used to cover Garg Datas payment for the $3.5 million marketplace license.   As alleged in the complaint, this $3.5 million sham sale was improperly booked by PurchasePro in Q1 2001 and alone accounted for over 20% of PurchasePros reported revenues for the quarter. , 	Based on these allegations, the Commission charged both Garg and Garg Data with aiding and abetting PurchasePros violations of the antifraud provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) (Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder), and the reporting, books and records, internal accounting controls, and lying-to-auditors provisions of the Exchange Act (Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B), and Rules 12b-20, 13a-13, and 13b2-2)., The Commissions investigation in this matter is continuing.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18903.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

HASHMAN, YINZI CAI, DOUGLAS WACHTEL and BRUCE RIGIONE</i>, United States District Court for the Northern District of California, Civil Action No. C-04-4088 FMS</h2>]","[On September 28, 2004, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed securities fraud charges against the former Chairman, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and three other senior officers of NextCard, Inc., a San Francisco, California-based credit card issuer.  NextCard, which is now in bankruptcy, was the first major credit card issuer to offer cards exclusively over the Internet., According to the Commissions complaint, beginning in at least November 2000, NextCard began to suffer higher than expected delinquencies and losses on its credit card loans-a reflection of customers paying their credit card bills late or not paying them at all.  Instead of revealing these problems to investors, NextCards senior officers made a series of undisclosed, after-the-quarter accounting adjustments on NextCards books.  The adjustments - which NextCards then-CEO described in his own handwritten notes as accounting gimmickry - made it appear that NextCards customers were paying their bills in a timely fashion, a key indicator of the financial health of a credit card issuer., In fact, NextCards business model of issuing credit cards over the Internet resulted in NextCard issuing cards to many customers with relatively poor credit who could not pay back their credit card loans in a timely fashion and, in many instances, not at all.  Instead of accounting for these as bad loans and writing them off as uncollectible, as NextCard had done in previous quarters, NextCard simply reclassified many of these accounts as fraudulent accounts, which were not separately reported to the public, and then failed to tell anyone.  Thus, defendants led stock analysts and investors to believe falsely that NextCard was meeting its projections and that its late-paying and uncollectible loans were rising only moderately, when in fact they were escalating rapidly., The Commissions complaint charges the following former NextCard officers with financial fraud: former Chairman Jeremy Lent of Holualoa, Hawaii; former CEO, John Hashman of Danville, Calif.; former President and Chief Operating Officer Yinzi Cai of Palo Alto, Calif.; former Controller, Douglas Wachtel of San Francisco, Calif.; and former Chief Financial Officer, Bruce Rigione of New Canaan, Conn.  The complaint, which was filed in federal district court in San Francisco, also charges Lent, Hashman, Cai and Wachtel with insider trading, based on their sale of NextCard stock at inflated prices during the course of the fraud.  Lent sold approximately $7 million worth of NextCard stock, Hashman sold $321,000, Cai sold $423,000 and Wachtel sold $105,000.  Lents stock sales were carried out through the Lent Family Trust, which is also named in the complaint as a relief defendant., The complaint alleges that NextCard failed to disclose to investors reclassifications or changes in its accounting methodology for late paying and uncollectible loans in its earnings releases and periodic reports for the fourth quarter of the 2000 fiscal year and the first and second quarters of 2001.  In addition, the complaint alleges that for the second quarter of 2001 NextCard changed its methodology for calculating reserves for its uncollectible loans.  This change reduced the amount of reserves the company had to set aside to cover expected losses on its loans by 15% to 25%, and artificially inflated the companys reported net income for the second quarter of 2001., According to the complaint, in October 2001 the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), which regulated NextCards subsidiary, NextBank, required NextCard to reverse the reclassifications and changes in accounting methodology.  On October 31, 2001, NextCard issued a press release stating that it was changing its accounting for uncollectible loans and that the OCC considered NextBank to be significantly undercapitalized.  NextCards stock price fell 84% that day, and the company went into bankruptcy the following year., The Commissions complaint charges the defendants with committing and aiding and abetting fraud in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as aiding and abetting NextCards violations of the same statue.  The complaint also charges Lent, Hashman, Rigione and Wachtel with aiding and abetting NextCards violations of the reporting provisions of the Exchanges Act, Section 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.  Further, Lent, Hashman, Cai and Wachtel are charged in the complaint for violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and for insider trading in violation of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint also charges Lent, Hashman and Cai as control persons for NextCards violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and  Hashman and Lent as control persons for NextCards violations of Section 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder., This is the second action brought by the Commission as a result of the financial fraud at NextCard.  In September 2003, the Commission charged three former employees of NextCards independent auditors, Ernst and Young (E&amp;Y), for altering and destroying E&amp;Ys working papers for the fiscal year 2000 audit of E&amp;Y client NextCard, Inc., The Commission acknowledges the assistance and cooperation of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18905.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18905.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Kelly immediately tipped his friends, Latvaaho and Angel, about the impending acquisition.  Between May 10 and May 17, Angel purchased 330 GSB call option contracts based on his advance knowledge that Citibank was planning to acquire GSB.  Angel also tipped his colleague, Buck, who purchased 150 call options and 2000 shares of GSB stock for his own account and 34,000 shares of GSB for other accounts that he managed for his employer. During the same period, Latvaaho purchased 100 GSB call options.  The following week, Citibank and GSB announced the news to the public, and GSBs stock price rose nearly 9%.  Angel, Buck and Latvaaho immediately sold their respective investments in GSB securities, yielding quick profits of nearly $250,000 collectively., The Commissions lawsuit, brought in federal district court in Dallas, charges Kelly with tipping, and Angel, Buck and Latvaaho with trading, on the basis of material, nonpublic information in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Latvaaho has agreed to settle the action by disgorging his profits of $30,857 and paying a civil penalty of $30,857.  Latvaaho also consented to a judgment enjoining him from violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder., The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the U.S. Attorneys Offices for the Northern District of California and the Northern District of Texas, the FBI, the American Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange in this matter.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18906.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The Commission charged Van Waeyenberghe with violations of the federal securities laws based on related conduct in July 2000., According to the indictment, Van Waeyenberghe was the President and Chief Operating Officer of First Choice, which marketed and serviced finance receivables in the form of Enhanced Automobile Receivables (EARs) and Realty First Mortgages (RFMs).  The indictment alleges that from November 1999 through July 2000, Van Waeyenberghe used promotional materials that contained materially false and misleading statements to induce prospective clients to purchase receivables through First Choices EAR and RFM programs and attempted to lull clients into refraining from seeking the return of their money by sending false account activity statements.

The judgment enjoined Ruttenberg from further violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder and his aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.  Ruttenberg consented to the entry of the judgment without admitting or denying any of the allegations of the Commissions Complaint.  The court also ordered Ruttenberg to pay disgorgement of $40,000, together with prejudgment interest of $17,294.97.  Ruttenberg was furthered ordered to pay a civil penalty of $50,000 and was prohibited from acting as an officer or director of any issuer that has a class of registered securities. , The Complaint alleged that, in connection with the audit of Just for Feet, Inc.s fiscal 1998 financial statements in the spring of 1999, Ruttenberg caused vendors to provide fraudulent confirmations used to confirm the validity of unearned receivables Just for Feet had recognized from its vendors. The complaint also alleged that Ruttenberg caused vendors to provide other confirmations that were fraudulently used to confirm the validity of income Just for Feet had improperly recognized through the acquisition of merchandise display booths from its vendors. The overstatement of income and assets resulting from this misconduct was reflected on Just for Feets financial statements included in its Form 10-K filed for fiscal year 1998, Forms 10-Q filed for the first and second quarters of fiscal year 1999, and in its registration statements on Forms S-8 and S-4 filed in May and June of 1999, respectively., See also:  L.R. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18139.htm>18139</a> / May 15, 2003; L.R. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18571.htm>18571</a> / February 6, 2004; L.R. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18575.htm>18575</a> / February 13, 2004; L.R. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18595.htm>18595</a> / February 25, 2004; and AAER No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18595.htm>1964</a> / February 25, 2004	,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18908.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Cassandro, and two stock promoters, Michael C. Cardascia and Stephen E. Apolant, in a case that arose out of a fraudulent scheme to manipulate the price of Spectrum Brands Corporations stock by exploiting the fear of bio-terrorism following September 11, 2001.  Specifically, the complaint alleges that Spectrum Brands was secretly managed and controlled by a group of stock promoters in Hicksville, New York, some of whom were convicted felons.   The complaint further alleges that to conceal its true ownership from the investing public, Spectrum Brands stated in a Form 8-K filed with the Commission on or about October 31, 2001, that a Michael J. Burns was the sole officer and director of the company and that the corporate address was in Hauppauge, New York.  In truth, Burns had little or no management responsibility for Spectrum Brands and the Hauppauge address was a mail drop.  The complaint alleges that Cassandro participated in drafting the false and misleading statements in the Form 8-K while knowing that the statements were false and misleading.  Also, according to the complaint, Michael Cardascia and Apolant helped promote Spectrum Brands stock via internet, radio, bulk e-mail, and fax while knowing that these communications contained false and misleading statements regarding the identity of the persons controlling and managing Spectrum Brands.   The complaint also alleges that Michael Cardascia bought Spectrum Brands stock privately at a discount and that his wife Joan Cardascia, who was named as a relief defendant, was unjustly enriched when she sold it at inflated prices. , The Commission charged Cassandro with primary and aiding and abetting violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Commission charged Michael Cardascia and Apolant with aiding and abetting violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Commission seeks permanent injunctions, an accounting of all gains garnered, disgorgement of such gains, with prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  The Commission also seeks an order providing that Joan Cardascia disgorge the amount by which she was unjustly enriched, with prejudgment interest.  This case is related to Securities and Exchange Commission v. Spectrum Brands Corp., Saverio (Sammy) Galasso III, David Hutter (a/k/a David Green), Charlie Dilluvio and Michael J.

WITH SCHEMES TO INFLATE ADVERTISING EARNINGS </h2>]","[The United States Securities and Exchange Commission today announced the filing of civil charges against Marcy Wilson Roke for her participation in schemes to improperly inflate the earnings of Advanced Marketing Services, Inc. (AMS).  AMS is a San Diego-based wholesaler of general interest books that provides a variety of other services, including promotional and advertising services.  Roke, age 37, of San Diego, California, was director of advertising at AMS from 1999 through 2004.  , The Commissions complaint, filed today in U.S. District Court in San Diego, alleges that Roke participated in schemes to improperly manipulate AMSs earnings that were carried out primarily through AMSs advertising department.  The complaint alleges that the fraudulent schemes caused AMS to overstate its pre-tax earnings by about 9% in fiscal year 2001, 10% in fiscal year 2002, and 19% in fiscal year 2003.  , The complaint alleges that AMS fraudulently overstated its earnings through two schemes.  The first scheme involved the production of fewer advertising vehicles than AMS had contracted with publishers to provide.  One advertising service that AMS provides to publishers is to print and mail advertising vehicles - such as inserts, catalogs, and post-cards - for books the publishers produce.  Through Rokes involvement, AMS improperly recognized revenue on the full quantity of advertising vehicles it had agreed to distribute, because it did not in fact produce the agreed-upon number of vehicles.  As a result, AMS recorded revenue for these services contrary to generally accepted accounting principles, and thereby improperly overstated its earnings. , The complaint further alleges that Roke participated in a scheme to increase AMSs income by improperly reversing certain accrued liabilities relating to retail cooperative advertising.  AMS recorded liabilities for credits that it expected retailers to take for certain advertising and promotional services that the retailers provided.  When the retailers did not take the credits due to them, instead of contacting the retailers and reconciling amounts, Roke directed advertising and sales personnel to hide the discrepancies from the retailers, so that AMS could improperly reverse the liability and thereby decrease expenses and increase its income. , Roke profited from her participation in the fraudulent schemes from her receipt of annual bonuses and sales of AMS stock, which totaled more than $200,000.  , The complaint alleges that Roke violated the antifraud provisions (Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder) and the books and records provisions of the federal securities laws (Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act) as well as aiding and abetting violations of and violating the record-keeping provisions of the federal securities laws (Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder).

Alleged to have participated in a scheme to fraudulently inflate Liberates revenue over four successive quarters in 2002 and 2003 are former Chief Operating Officer and head of sales Donald M. Fitzpatrick, of Sydney, Australia, and former sales vice president Thomas R. Stitt of Redwood City, California.  Stitt has reached a settlement of the charges against him.  , The Commissions complaint, which was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, alleges that Fitzpatrick, on his own and with assistance from Stitt on several deals, devised a series of fraudulent transactions to inflate Liberates quarterly and year-end financial results.  As a result, Liberates quarterly revenue was artificially inflated by as much as 17% during the companys 2002 and 2003 fiscal years.  Liberate ultimately restated its financial statements in September 2003 to reverse and defer revenue from the fraudulent transactions.    , According to the complaint, Fitzpatrick employed various devices to inflate Liberates reported results.  For instance, Fitzpatrick, aided by Stitt, effectuated an improper round-trip deal whereby Liberate supplied its customer with the money to make the purchase.  In this deal, Liberate received no net economic benefit, essentially using its own funds to create the false appearance of legitimate revenue.  In another fraudulent transaction, Fitzpatrick negotiated a side agreement with a customer that granted the customer future financial concessions, and then hid the agreement from Liberates finance department.  The concessions Fitzpatrick secretly granted, if accounted for properly, would have wiped out the revenue Liberate reported to the public for the sale., The complaint also alleges that Fitzpatrick and Stitt lied to Liberates outside auditors and to Liberates own financial group, which enabled the fraud to remain undetected. , The Commissions complaint charges Fitzpatrick with securities fraud and lying to accountants.   The complaint seeks injunctive relief, civil monetary penalties, disgorgement of Fitzpatricks ill-gotten gains (including commissions and bonuses), and an order barring Fitzpatrick from serving as an officer or director of a public company., Stitt is charged in the Commissions complaint with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and with aiding and abetting Liberates reporting of false financial information to the Commission and Liberates failure to maintain accurate books and records and internal controls.  The complaint additionally charges him with lying to accountants, circumventing accounting controls, and falsifying the companys books and records.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Stitt agreed to pay a total of $78,000, including $28,000 in disgorgement and a $50,000 civil monetary penalty.  Stitt also agreed to the entry of a court order barring him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for 10 years and enjoining him from future violations of these laws.   , The Commissions district court complaint charges Fitzpatrick with securities fraud (Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder) and lying to accountants (Rule 13b2-2).  The Commissions action charges Stitt with the same Exchange Act violations as well as violations of other Exchange Act provisions and rules, specifically, aiding and abetting Liberate in filing false periodic reports under Section 13(b) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13; aiding and abetting Liberate in maintaining inaccurate books under Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act; aiding and abetting Liberate in having inadequate internal accounting controls under Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act; and circumventing internal accounting controls under Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1., The United States Attorneys Office for the Northern District of California, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, today also announced criminal charges against Fitzpatrick for his role in the financial reporting fraud.  , The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the United States Attorneys Office for the Northern District of California.  , <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18911.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>, <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18911.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The Commissions complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado, alleges that while working as a financial consultant for Crown, Jensen obtained material nonpublic information that he used to earn illegal trading profits. , The Commission alleges that on October 7, 2003, Crown hired Jensen to work as a financial consultant.  On that same day, Jensen learned that Crown was going to be acquired and that a public announcement was imminent.  Based on that nonpublic information, Jensen began buying Crown stock.  Following the close of the financial markets on October 8, Crown announced it had been acquired.  As a result, on October 9 the price of Crown stock increased.

(Judge Andersen).</h2>]","[	The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) announced today that, on September 28, 2004, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois entered final judgment as to defendant Bruce D. Tobecksen in the federal civil enforcement action filed by the Commission.  Tobecksen was the former vice president of finance at Waste Management, Inc. (Waste Management or Company).  The Judgment permanently bars Tobecksen from acting as an officer or director of a public company and enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws.  The Judgment also requires Tobecksen to pay a $120,000 civil penalty and $689,159 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest.  Tobecksen consented to the Judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint., The complaint in this action charges the founder, Tobecksen, and four other former top officers of Waste Management with perpetrating a massive financial fraud lasting more than five years.  The Commission alleges that, beginning in 1992 and continuing into 1997, defendants engaged in a systematic scheme to falsify and misrepresent Waste Managements financial results with profits being overstated by $1.7 billion.  The fraud resulted in what at the time was the largest restatement in history., Tobecksen was Waste Managements vice president of finance from March of 1993 until December of 1997.  The Commissions complaint alleges that, starting in 1994, Tobecksen was involved in two particular accounting manipulations - he recorded unsupported and erroneous depreciation entries and assisted in recording purported miscellaneous reclassification entries referred to as geography.  According to the complaint, Tobecksen had responsibility for creating a new and improper methodology for calculating depreciation expense in 1994.  The complaint alleges that when told that the new method was flawed and overstated income, Tobecksen and other defendants let the error stand and grow and concealed it from the Companys outside auditors.  By 1996, the complaint alleges, they knew that the cumulative impact of the error exceeded $100 million.  The complaint alleges that geography worked by simply moving tens-of-millions of dollars from one income statement category of expense to another - from the correct one to an incorrect one.  According to the complaint, the entries improved or smoothed over the Companys reported operating margins or other quarterly trends discussed in the Company=s filings with the Commission. , The complaint seeks disgorgement of Tobecksens earnings-based performance bonuses and enhanced retirement benefits that were based on fraudulently overstated earnings.  The complaint charges Tobecksen with securities fraud, falsifying Waste Managements books and records, and aiding and abetting Waste Managements reporting and record keeping violations, in violation of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, and 13b2-1 promulgated thereunder, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933., The Judgment permanently bars Tobecksen from acting as an officer or director of a public company and enjoins him from future violations, or aiding and abetting violations, of the above provisions of the federal securities laws.  Tobecksen also must pay disgorgement in the amount of $403,179, prejudgment interest thereon in the amount of $285,980, and a $120,000 civil penalty.  The Judgment permits the Commission to later file a motion to distribute the funds pursuant to the Fair Fund provisions of Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. , The Commissions litigation is continuing as to the five other former executives of Waste Management:  Dean L. Buntrock, Waste Managements founder, chairman of the Board of Directors, and chief executive officer during most of the relevant period; Phillip B.

Specifically, the Commission alleged that Darmstadter conducted ten unauthorized stock transactions and ordered two wire transfers out of the account.  The Commission alleged that Darmstadter accomplished these transactions by transferring shares of unregistered Childrens Beverage stock into the employees account from a Canadian brokerage account which Darmstadter controlled and then falsely advising the employees brokerage account representative that the employee was physically incapacitated and unable to communicate by telephone.  The Commission alleged that Darmstadter sent the account representative forged letters of authorization purporting to contain the employees signature with transfer instructions.  The letters instructed the account representative to transfer the unregistered Childrens Beverage stock to friends, family and business associates of Darmstadter. , The Court entered an order of permanent injunction, enjoining Darmstadter from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and ordered Darmstadter to pay disgorgement of $11,557, plus prejudgment interest of $4,997 and a civil penalty of $55,000.

Wachtel, a defendant in an action filed by the Commission in April 2002.  The Commission alleged in its complaint that Wachtel and others participated in a fraudulent offering scheme that raised at least $52 million from investors.  In the default judgment, the Court permanently enjoined Wachtel from future violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and ordered him to pay approximately $16.6 million in disgorgement, interest and a penalty., 	The Commission filed its action against Wachtel and eight other defendants and a relief defendant on April 1, 2002, alleging that Wachtel and others participated in a scheme that made fraudulent representations to investors about a purported high yield trading program.  According to the Commissions complaint, the scheme raised approximately $52.75 million from six investors, and was perpetrated by Wachtel and others through entities formerly known as Brite Business S.A. and Brite Business Corporation.  The Commission alleged that Wachtel, who held himself out as the U.S. representative of Brite Business, solicited one investor to invest $12.5 million and made misrepresentations to this investor that the rate of return on the investment could be 10% per week.  The Commissions complaint alleges that as a result of the misconduct of Wachtel and others, that investors $12.5 million investment was misappropriated.

Stephen P. Gardner, et al.</i>, Civil Action No. 04 CV 2002 JAH (RBB) (S.D. Cal.) (October 5, 2004)</h2>]","[On October 5, 2004, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed civil fraud and related charges against six former senior officers of San Diego-based Peregrine Systems, Inc. who orchestrated and attempted to cover up a massive accounting fraud at the company.  , According to the Commissions complaint filed in the United States District Court in San Diego, the Peregrine defendants fraudulently inflated the product revenue Peregrine reported in its filings with the Commission and elsewhere.  The defendants employed deception and lies to portray Peregrine as a company with constantly growing sales while covering up Peregrines persistent failure to fulfill revenue forecasts.  At the same time, some of the Peregrine defendants unloaded Peregrine stock into an unsuspecting market, enriching themselves, in some instances by millions of dollars, at the expense of the investing public., In February 2003, Peregrine restated its financial results for eleven quarters during fiscal years 2000, 2001 and 2002, reducing previously-reported revenue of $1.34 billion by more than $507 million.  , The Commissions complaint names: Stephen P. Gardner, Peregrines former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Gary L. Lenz, the former President and Chief Operating Officer; Douglas S. Powanda, the former Executive Vice President of Sales; Berdj J. Rassam, the former Controller; Joseph G. Reichner, the former Senior Vice President for Alliances and Business Development; and Peter J. OBrien, the former Director of Strategic Alliances., The Commission also charged Daniel F. Stulac, a certified public accountant and former Arthur Andersen LLP engagement partner on the Peregrine audit, with fraud, and Larry A. Rodda and Michael D. Whitt, former principals of two Peregrine channel partners (customers), with aiding and abetting Peregrines fraud., According to the Commissions complaint, the heart of Peregrines fraud was the recording of millions of dollars in revenue on the improper basis of non-binding arrangements with resellers (channel partners) - companies that purchased software from Peregrine for resale to end-users.  Peregrines senior management would determine near the ends of quarters how much additional revenue the company needed to meet or exceed analyst expectations.  They would then enter into sham deals with channel partners (including backdated contracts and contracts made contingent by oral or written side agreements).  Peregrine executives arranged a number of these fraudulent deals with defendants Rodda and Whitt., Peregrine improperly recorded the resulting revenue in order to mislead investors into believing that Peregrines financial condition was significantly better than it was and to inflate artificially Peregrines stock price.  Gardner, the former CEO who was actively involved in the fraud, and Powanda, the former Executive VP of Sales who devised many of the sham deals, sold over $11 million and $24 million worth of Peregrine stock, respectively, during the fraud, resulting in millions of dollars in profits., The complaint further alleges that, as the uncollected receivables from the fake channel sales swelled on Peregrines balance sheet, senior officers at the company devised a temporary solution to make it appear that Peregrine was collecting cash on a timely basis.  Uncollectible receivables were purportedly sold to banks and removed from Peregrines balance sheet.  These receivable financing transactions, however, were in reality loans and not sales because, under the terms of the deals, the banks had recourse against Peregrine if the customers did not pay.  Peregrines removal of the receivables from its balance sheet was therefore fraudulent., According to the complaint, to prevent the banks from discovering that some of the channel sales underlying the receivables were bogus, Peregrine often repurchased the receivables from the banks.  To remove the uncollectible receivables from Peregrines books, Peregrine executives, including former Controller Rassam, with the knowledge of outside engagement partner Stulac, then improperly wrote off millions of dollars of the repurchased receivables (and other unpaid receivables) as acquisition costs, even though the receivables were wholly unrelated to acquisitions.  The complaint also alleges that outside auditor Stulac permitted Peregrine to record revenue improperly.  Stulac knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that Peregrines fiscal 2001 financial statements were materially false and misleading.  Despite Stulacs knowledge or reckless disregard of this improper accounting, he caused Arthur Andersen to issue an unqualified opinion attesting to the accuracy and completeness of Peregrines fiscal 2001 financial statements., Based on this conduct, the Commissions complaint alleges the following:, Defendants Gardner, Powanda, Lenz, Rassam and OBrien violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act)., Defendants Gardner, Powanda, Lenz, Rassam, Reichner and OBrien violated Sections 13(b)(5) and 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Exchange Act Rules 13b2-1 and 10b-5 and aided and abetted violations of Exchange Act Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13., Defendants Gardner and Lenz violated Exchange Act Rule 13b2-2., Defendant Stulac violated Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5 and aided and abetted violations of Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Exchange Act Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13., Defendants Rodda and Whitt aided and abetted violations of Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5., This is the fifth civil fraud action the Commission has filed in this investigation.  In November 2002, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action against Ilse Cappel, the former Senior Treasury Manager at Peregrine (Litigation Release No. 17859A).  In April 2003, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action against Matthew C. Gless, Peregrines former Chief Financial Officer (Litigation Release No. 18093).  In June 2003, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action against Steven S. Spitzer, a former Vice President of sales at Peregrine (Litigation Release No. 18191), and a partially-settled civil injunctive action against the company (Litigation Release No. 18205A).  In August of 2003, the Commission announced that it had fully settled its case against Peregrine and that the United States District Court in San Diego had entered final judgment (<a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18290.htm>Litigation Release No. 18290</a>)., The United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of California also announced criminal charges against the nine individuals named in the Commissions complaint, and others who participated in Peregrines financial fraud., The Commissions investigation of the financial fraud is continuing.

The SEC also simultaneously settled its action against Borman in consideration for Bormans agreeing to disgorge 106,000 options on RTIN common stock, a $25,000 civil penalty, and a permanent injunction against violations of the deception of auditors provisions, and against aiding and abetting violations of the antifraud and reporting provisions of the federal securities laws., In the civil action filed against Stanley Swanson, Curtis Swanson and Cavender, the SEC is seeking, against each of them, a permanent injunction, an officer and director bar, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, an accounting, and a civil money penalty, based on violations by each of them of the registration, antifraud, falsification of records, deception of auditors, circumvention of controls and certification provisions, and on their each aiding and abetting RTINs violations of the antifraud, reporting, books and records and internal controls provisions., According to the SECs complaint, in 2002 and 2003, RTIN materially inflated its reported revenue by selling franchise agreements to start-up franchisees in exchange for worthless stock and promissory notes, and then immediately recognizing revenue from the transactions, despite the franchisees known inability to pay.  The SEC further alleges that the Swansons, together with Cavender, fraudulently supported the companys inflated revenue figures by recording fictitious payments by franchisees and by using funds from undisclosed, unregistered distributions of RTIN stock to pay RTINs debts and management bonuses.  The SEC further alleges that Borman, while he was a director of RTIN, assisted the company in misleading the companys auditors about the authenticity of a sham certificate of deposit, allegedly issued to pay for the purchase of an RTIN franchise license.  The revenue-inflation scheme caused RTIN to overstate by material amounts its net income in periodic reports the company filed with the Commission throughout 2002 and 2003. , In its complaint, the SEC alleges that RTIN, Stanley Swanson, Curtis Swanson, and Cavender violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that Stanley Swanson, Curtis Swanson and Cavender violated Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13b2-1, 13b2-2 and 13a-14 thereunder.

To convince prospective investors to invest in Global Health, or to encourage existing investors to add to their investment, the defendants have disseminated letters on FDA letterhead that state that Global Healths cancer treatment has been approved by the FDA and that Global Health can soon begin marketing its product.  The defendants instruct investors to send their checks to one of two San Diego-area addresses used by the brokers. , The complaint alleges that the FDA letters are forgeries, and the statements concerning the FDA approval are false.

Global Health does not have any cancer treatment or other product that is undergoing the FDAs approval process.

The Commissions complaint alleged that Bond received over $6.9 million in commission kickbacks from three brokerage firms.  Subsequently, the Commission amended its complaint, alleging that Bond later orchestrated an improper trade allocation or cherry-picking scheme.  The second amended complaint alleged that Bond realized nearly $6.6 million in profits from this cherry-picking scheme., The Commissions complaint alleged that Bond, from at least September 1993 through November 1998, through his former investment advisory firm, Bond, Procope Capital Management, received over $6.9 million in commission kickbacks from three brokerage firms.  The kickbacks, which were siphoned off of the investment returns of Bonds clients in the form of mark-ups or mark-downs on principal trades, were used by Bond to finance an opulent personal lifestyle that included the purchase of more than 75 luxury and antique automobiles and a large home and beachfront condominium in Florida.  On August 10, 2001, the Commission filed an amended complaint seeking emergency relief,  and added allegations that beginning in March 2000, Bond, through his advisory firm, Albriond, participated in an ongoing trade allocation or cherry-picking scheme, in which Bond allocated the majority of profitable trades to himself, realizing actual profits of nearly $6.6 million, and the majority of unprofitable trades to three of his advisory clients, causing them to lose a total of over $56.8 million., Bond and his investment adviser, Albriond Capital Management, LLC, without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 207 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and additionally enjoining Bond from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933. , In two related criminal actions, Bond was convicted of investment advisory fraud, mail fraud, and conspiracy to commit investment advisory fraud, wire fraud, and commercial bribery, based on the same conduct alleged in the Commission=s complaint.

Murphy, a resident of Texas, was American Rices president at the time of the violations.  Kay, also a resident of Texas, was an American Rice vice president of operations and reported to Murphy.  The defendants are to be sentenced on January 6.  This criminal action, brought by the Department of Justice, arose out of a joint investigation with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  , According to the indictments against Murphy and Kay, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, in advance of certain rice shipments to Haiti between January 1998 and October 1999, Kay directed an American Rice employee to prepare false shipping records that underreported the tonnage of rice on the relevant vessels.  Haitian customs officials used the false records to clear the American Rice vessels through customs.  After the vessels cleared customs, Kay allegedly directed American Rice employees in Haiti pay cash bribes to certain customs officials.  To hide the payments, Kay then directed American Rices controller in Haiti to improperly record the bribery payments as routine business expenditures.  American Rice employees made at least 12 bribery payments totaling approximately $500,000.  In exchange, American Rice illegally avoided approximately $1.5 million in Haitian import taxes.  The indictments further allege that Murphy knew about the bribery scheme, but took no action to stop the payments.  , The Securities and Exchange Commission has also filed a civil action against Murphy and Kay in the Southern District of Texas.  The Commissions complaint alleges that Murphy and Kay violated the civil provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and aided and abetted American Rices violations of certain bookkeeping and internal controls provisions of the securities laws relating to falsely recording the bribery payments in American Rices books and records.  The complaint also alleges that another individual, Lawrence Theriot aided and abetted Murphy and Kays violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.  The Commissions civil action has been stayed pending the outcome of the criminal trial., <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18925.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The Final Judgments also order Awdisho and Kundrat each to pay a $10,000 civil penalty and order Smolinski to pay a $20,000 civil penalty., The Commissions Complaint, filed on September 21, alleges that approximately 75 times between September and December of 1999, Awdisho, Kundrat and Smolinski each manipulated the price of stock options by engaging in a scheme commonly referred to as small lot baiting.  Small lot baiting or spoofing involves an order placed by a market participant with the intention of briefly triggering a market movement from which the participant or others may benefit by trading the opposite side of the original manipulative order.  The Complaint further alleges that to carry out the scheme, Awdisho, Kundrat and Smolinski placed limit orders for a small number of options contracts on one options exchange to artificially raise or lower that exchanges quoted bid or offer.  Awdisho, Kundrat and Smolinski then purchased or sold much larger opposite positions on other exchanges that matched the artificially raised or depressed price displayed at the first exchange.  After their larger orders were executed, Awdisho, Kundrat and Smolinski immediately sent an order to cancel the initial bait order.  The Complaint alleges that, as a result of the scheme, Awdisho, Kundrat and Smolinski unfairly profited at least $25,000 by obtaining execution of their larger orders at more favorable prices than otherwise available in the market., For further information, see Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18894.htm>18894</a> (September 23, 2004), <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18926.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Perry, who resides in Atlanta, is the president of Market-Timing.  , The complaint alleges that from at least November 2002 to September 2004, the defendants actively solicited investment advisory clients through internet websites that advertised eight different asset management programs.  The programs used models that, based on short term market trends, identified when Market-Timing and Perry should shift clients investments among various mutual funds within a fund family.

(Ahold) and three former top executives:  Cees van der Hoeven, former CEO and chairman of the executive board; A. Michiel Meurs, former CFO and executive board member; and Jan Andreae, former executive vice president and executive board member.  The Commission also filed a related administrative action charging Roland Fahlin, a former member of Aholds supervisory board and audit committee, with causing violations of the reporting, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the securities laws.  The SECs complaints allege that, as a result of the fraudulent inflation of promotional allowances at U.S. Foodservice, Aholds wholly-owned subsidiary, the improper consolidation of joint ventures through fraudulent side letters, and other accounting errors and irregularities, Aholds original SEC filings overstated:  (a) net income by approximately 17.6%, 32.6%, and 88.1% for the fiscal years 2000, 2001 and first three quarters of 2002, respectively; (b) operating income by approximately 28.1%, 29.4%, and 51.3% for the fiscal years 2000, 2001 and first three quarters of 2002, respectively; and (c) net sales by approximately 20.8%, 18.6%, and 13.8% for the fiscal years 2000, 2001 and 2002, respectively.  Ahold and three of the individual defendants have agreed to settlements with the Commission., With respect to the fraud at U.S. Foodservice (USF), Aholds wholly-owned subsidiary based in Columbia, Maryland, the Commissions complaint against Ahold alleges as follows: , The earnings inflation at USF, which began at least a year before Aholds acquisition, is the subject of the SECs complaint against four former USF executives filed July 27, 2004 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, With respect to the fraudulent consolidation of joint ventures, the Commissions complaints against Ahold, van der Hoeven, Meurs, and Andreae allege as follows:, In its administrative action against Fahlin, the Commission alleges the following:  , Ahold has agreed to settle the Commissions action, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, by consenting to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining the company from violating the antifraud, reporting, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws (Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act); Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act); and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-16).  The Commission noted in the complaint that Ahold cooperated fully in the SEC staffs investigation. , Van der Hoeven and Meurs have agreed to settle the Commissions action, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, by consenting to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining each of them from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2, and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) and Exchange Act Rules 13a-1 and 13a-16.  Van der Hoeven and Meurs have also consented to orders barring each of them from serving as an officer or director of a public company., Fahlin has agreed to settle the Commissions administrative action by consenting to the entry of an order, without admitting or denying the findings in the order, directing him to cease and desist from causing any violations and any future violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-16 thereunder., The Commission has not reached a settlement with Andreae.  The Commission has charged Andreae with fraud (Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5), falsifying accounting records, and lying to auditors (Exchange Act Section 13(b)(5) and Exchange Act Rules 13b2-1 and 13b2-2) or, in the alternative, aiding and abetting violations of Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2.  The Commission has also charged Andreae with aiding and abetting violations of the books and records and reporting requirements (Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 13a-1 and 13a-16).   The Commission seeks an injunction against future violations of the above provisions, an order prohibiting Andreae from acting as an officer or director of any public company, and disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest., The Commission has not sought penalties in the enforcement actions for several reasons.  First, the Dutch Public Prosecutors Office, which is conducting a parallel criminal investigation in The Netherlands, has requested that the Commission not seek penalties against the individuals because of potential double jeopardy issues under Dutch law.  Because of the importance of this case in The Netherlands and the need for continued cooperation between the SEC and regulatory authorities in other countries, the Commission has agreed to the Dutch prosecutors request.  , The Commission also did not seek a penalty from Ahold, among other reasons, because of the companys extensive cooperation with the Commissions investigation.  Ahold self-reported the misconduct and conducted an extensive internal investigation.  On its own initiative, Ahold expanded its internal investigation beyond the fraud at U.S. Foodservice and the improper joint venture accounting to analyze accounting practices and internal controls at seventeen operating companies.  Ahold promptly provided the staff with the internal investigative reports and the supporting information and waived the attorney-client privilege and work product protection with respect to its internal investigations.  Ahold also made its current personnel available for interviews or testimony, significantly assisted the staff in arranging interviews with, or testimony from, former Ahold personnel located in the United States and abroad.  Ahold promptly took remedial actions including, but not limited to, revising its internal controls and terminating employees responsible for the wrongdoing.  , This is the second round of enforcement actions the Commission has filed in this investigation.  On July 27, 2004, the Commission filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Michael Resnick, Mark P. Kaiser, Timothy J. Lee, and William Carter in connection with the financial fraud at USF and (with respect to Lee) insider trading of USF securities (Litigation Release No. 18797).  The Commission also filed a related complaint against Peter O.

The Commissions complaint charged:  Learn Waterhouse, Inc. (LWI), a Texas corporation based in Jacksonville, Florida and Tyler, Texas; Randall T. Treadwell, 46, of Savannah, Georgia; Rick D. Sluder, 47, of Tyler, Texas; Larry C. Saturday, 57, of Savannah, Georgia; and Arnulfo M. Acosta, 41, of  Pasadena, Texas.  The Honorable Irma E.

According to the complaint, LWI pooled investor funds to engage in buy/sell transactions in a secret, invitation only bank trading program that generated investor returns ranging from 5% to 50% per month.  The defendants represented that one such trading program purportedly earned investors 500% in just 60 days.  The defendants also represented that an investors principal was secured by a pre-funded, cash-back instrument issued by a top U.S. bank, which purportedly restricted LWIs bank trading program to completely risk-free transactions.  , The complaint alleges that, contrary to the defendants representations, they were instead promoting a fictitious prime bank trading program and operating a Ponzi scheme.  The defendants paid investors and sales agents $17.5 million, but at least $8.2 million, or 46.9%, of those investor returns came from investor funds.  The defendants also misappropriated at least $2.5 million in investor funds to support themselves and finance other businesses., The Commission obtained an order temporarily restraining LWI, Treadwell, Sluder, Saturday, and Acosta from committing securities fraud in violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.   The order also temporarily restrains the defendants from violating the securities registration provisions of Section 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act.  , The Courts order provided that the temporary restraining order and asset freeze would remain in effect until November 1, 2004, at which time the Court scheduled a hearing on the Commissions motion for a preliminary injunction.  In addition to the interim relief already granted by the Court, the Commission seeks a final judgment against the defendants enjoining them from future violations of the foregoing antifraud and securities registration laws, ordering them to disgorge all ill-gotten gains, and assessing civil penalties., The Commission would like to acknowledge the substantial assistance of the United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of California, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Arizona Corporation Commission, Alabama Securities Commission, the Florida Department of Financial Services, the Texas State Securities Board, and the Iowa Insurance Divisions Securities Bureau., For more information about prime bank frauds, visit the SECs Prime Bank Information Center at <a href=/divisions/enforce/primebank.shtml>http://www.sec.gov/divisions/enforce/primebank.shtml</a>.

A sentencing date is scheduled for January 24, 2005. , The Reeders and Cornerstone were previously enjoined by the Commission for their fraudulent conduct.  During the course of the lawsuit, a court-appointed receiver liquidated all of the defendants assets, including the Reeders home, which had been paid for with investor funds and distributed these liquidated assets, totaling approximately $7 million, to the victims of the Reeders fraud., The Commissions lawsuit, filed in November 1999, alleged that the Reeders fraudulent operation, based in Forth Worth, Texas, raised over $16.5 million from over 600 investors, many of whom were elderly, through internet postings and cold-call sales.  The complaint further alleged that the defendants promised investors that their business operations would generate 120% annual returns when, in reality, they had no significant business revenue.  Finally, the Complaint alleged the Reeders were operating a classic Ponzi scheme wherein the funds of new investors were used to make promised payments to existing investors., On April 14, 2000, Judge Means, who also presided over the civil lawsuit, entered a Permanent Injunction against Cornerstone Prodigy Group, Inc. and its principals Gary Reeder, a convicted felon, and Sandra Reeder, a licensed securities professional.

The Commission also alleged that Hoover solicited and obtained investments in the hedge fund by making fraudulent misrepresentations to prospective investors, and that Hoover attempted to conceal his misappropriations by distributing fictitious account statements to investors., As previously announced, on February 11, 2003, the court entered a Final Judgment, by consent, ordering Hoover and/or his wholly-owned entities to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains and prejudgment interest in the amount of $1,011,007.48, and permanently enjoining them from future violations of the relevant provisions of the federal securities laws.  On February 26, 2003, the Commission entered an administrative order, by consent, that permanently bars Hoover from association with an investment adviser.  In a related criminal proceeding, Hoover pleaded guilty to criminal charges that he defrauded investment advisory clients out of nearly $200,000 in violation of Section 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Hoover is currently serving 3 years of supervised release, following an 18 month prison sentence.  , For more information see Litigation Release Nos. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17981.htm>17981</a> (February 11, 2003), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17825.htm>17825</a> (November 1, 2002), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17666.htm>17666</a> (August 8, 2002), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17487.htm>17487</a> (April 24, 2002), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17284.htm>17284</a> (December 19, 2001), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17240.htm>17240</a> (November 19, 2001), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17236.htm>17236</a> (November 16, 2001) and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr16983.htm>16983</a> (May 2, 2001)., <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18934.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

McCracken,</i> Civil Action No. 8:04-CV-02288-SDM-MAP (M.D. FL)</h2>, <h2>SEC Sues Former CEO and Former CFO of a Florida Airplane Instrument Manufacturer in Financial Fraud Spanning Over Five Years</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed fraud charges on Monday against John Mervyn Nabors, the former Chief Executive Officer, and Eric J. McCracken, the former Chief Financial Officer, of Aerosonic Corporation (Aerosonic), a Clearwater, Florida airplane instrument manufacturer.   Nabors, who resides in Clearwater Beach, Florida, has settled this action with the SEC.   McCracken, formerly of Clearwater, Florida, currently resides in New York.   The case, filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, has been assigned to Judge Steven D. Merryday., According to the SECs Complaint, from January 1999 through December 2002, Nabors and McCracken implemented various accounting schemes designed to artificially inflate Aerosonics reported pre-tax earnings.   Among their schemes, Nabors and McCracken allegedly caused Aerosonic to overstate inventory by falsifying inventory records and by failing to provide adequate reserves for Aerosonics obsolete and slow moving inventory.   In addition, Nabors and McCracken allegedly caused Aerosonic to report inflated earnings by recording fictitious and premature revenue.   As a result of these and other accounting tricks, Aerosonic reported earnings in its periodic filings with the SEC that were overstated by at least 35% to as much as 825%.  The Complaint further alleges that during the same time period, Nabors and McCracken caused Aerosonic to issue a series of false press releases touting the Companys strong financial performance when, in fact, the Company had actually suffered losses totaling over $3.9 million.   Both Nabors and McCracken financially benefited from their fraudulent activities by reaping lucrative bonuses and, in the case of McCracken, selling his Aerosonic stock while its price was artificially inflated as a result of Aerosonics false filings and press releases.  Both Nabors and McCracken resigned from Aerosonic in December 2002.  , After Nabors and McCracken resigned, Aerosonics new management discovered inventory and other accounting improprieties totaling in the millions.   On March 17, 2003, Aerosonic issued a press release announcing approximately $3 million in overstated revenue and inventory for its fiscal years ended 2001 through 2003, and its ongoing internal investigation to identify additional accounting misstatements.   In November 2003, Aerosonic restated over $8.6 million in revenue and inventory-related items for its fiscal years ended 1999 through 2002, and for its first three quarters of 2003.     , Nabors has reached a settlement of this matter with the SEC.  Accordingly, concurrently with its Complaint, the SEC filed Nabors Consent, without admitting or denying the allegations of the SECs Complaint, and proposed Final Judgment of Permanent Injunction and Other Relief (Final Judgment), and has requested that the District Court enter the Final Judgment.  The Final Judgment will permanently enjoin Nabors from violating the antifraud provisions, requirements that public companies maintain accurate books and records, and provisions prohibiting public companies from making false filings.  The Final Judgment will further bar Nabors from serving as an officer or director of a public company and will order Nabors to pay disgorgement of $210,200 and civil money penalties of $50,000.   The SEC intends to direct that disgorgement and penalties paid in this case be paid to a Fair Fund for the benefit of defrauded investors, including those who held Aerosonics shares during the time period alleged in the SECs Complaint, pursuant to Section 308 (Fair Funds for Investors) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.   The SECs case against McCracken is pending., The SECs Complaint alleges that, as a result of their conduct, Nabors violated Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, 13b2-2, and 13a-14, thereunder, and that he aided and abetted Aerosonics violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13 (b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13, thereunder.   The Complaint also alleges that McCracken violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), and Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, 13b2-2, and 13a-14, thereunder, and, that he aided and abetted Aerosonics violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13 (b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13, thereunder.

The Commission’s complaint alleges that, between 1999 and 2002, Qwest fraudulently recognized over $3.8 billion in revenue and excluded $231 million in expenses as part of a multi-faceted fraudulent scheme to meet optimistic and unsupportable revenue and earnings projections.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Qwest consented to entry of a judgment enjoining it from violating the Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2), and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13, 13b2-1, 14a-3, and 14a-9 thereunder., The judgment also directs Qwest to pay a civil penalty of $250 million and $1 disgorgement.  The entire penalty amount will be distributed to defrauded investors pursuant to the Fair Funds provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.  In assessing the penalty amount, the Commission considered Qwest’s current financial condition., In addition, Qwest is required to maintain permanently a chief compliance officer (“CCO”) reporting to a committee of outside directors and responsible for ensuring the company conducts its business in compliance with the federal securities laws.  The CCO shall aid the board in maintaining, implementing and enforcing standards of conduct for the corporation.  The CCO shall also respond to employee concerns that may implicate matters of ethics or questionable business practices., The Commission’s complaint, which was filed in United States District Court for the District of Colorado, alleges as follows:, After its initial public offering in 1997, Qwest touted itself as a progressive, new-generation technology company with enormous growth potential.  Beginning in 1999, in fact, Qwest’s CEO consistently predicted publicly that Qwest would achieve double-digit revenue and earnings growth.  By mid-1999, it became clear to Qwest senior management that the market for telecommunications services was declining and that revenue from those services would not sustain Qwest’s projected revenue and earnings growth. , To “fill the gap” between its actual and projected revenue, Qwest, at the direction of its senior management, began selling indefeasible rights of use (“IRUs”).  An IRU is an irrevocable right to use a specific fiber strand or specific amount of fiber capacity for a specified time period.  Thus, to meet revenue expectations that it created, Qwest sold what the company had previously identified in Commission filings and press releases as its “principal asset.”  When the demand for IRUs declined, Qwest engaged in IRU “swaps” whereby Qwest bought IRUs from other companies in exchange for agreements from those companies to buy IRUs from Qwest.  As another “gap filler,” Qwest sold capital equipment., Both IRU and equipment sales were referred to internally as “one hit wonders.”  Indeed, the investment community generally discounted such non-recurring revenue sources when valuing telecommunications companies because non-recurring revenue sources were not sustainable.  Qwest’s use of one-time transactions to fill the gap between actual and projected revenue became so common that many Qwest employees likened the practice to an “addiction” and the non-recurring IRU and equipment sale transactions as Qwest’s “heroin.”, In Commission filings and other public statements, Qwest fraudulently characterized non-recurring revenue from IRU and equipment transactions as recurring data and Internet service revenues, thereby masking its declining financial condition and artificially inflating its stock price., In addition to fraudulently characterizing non-recurring revenue as recurring revenue, Qwest ignored generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) by recognizing upfront revenue from IRU transactions and equipment sales.  Qwest, in fact, employed fraudulent devices such as backdated contracts and secret side agreements to conceal the fact that its IRU and equipment transactions did not meet GAAP’s requirements for upfront revenue recognition.  Under GAAP, Qwest should either have not recognized any revenue on these transactions or recognized revenue ratably over the lives of the contracts., Qwest engaged in a variety of other fraudulent conduct.  In particular:, Qwests lack of internal controls and inadequate books and records resulted in numerous other accounting errors during the same period, including a $56 million overstatement in operator services revenue, $200 million in improper capitalized costs associated with its design service centers, and a total of $850 million understatement of expenses in accounting for its merger with US West, Inc. and in certain restructuring charges.  Further, Qwest failed to disclose a related party transaction with Anschutz Company and sold unregistered securities., In February 2003, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action against former Qwest officers Joel M. Arnold, William L. Eveleth, Grant Graham, Thomas W. Hall, Douglas K. Hutchins, Bryan K. Treadway, John M. Walker, and Richard L. Weston (<a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17996.htm>Litigation Release No. 17996</a>).  In September 2003, the Commission instituted a settled cease-and-desist proceeding and filed a related civil action for penalties against Loren D. Pfau, a former Qwest sales manager (<a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18374.htm>Litigation Release No. 18374</a>).  In June 2004, the Commission instituted settled cease-and-desist proceedings and filed related civil actions for penalties against Augustine M.

Draper, the former Chief Operations Officer; and Victor L. Ziller, the former Vice President-Brazil (Defendants).  The Commissions complaint charges that the defendants made materially false and/or misleading public statements in an effort to manipulate the public trading market for stock issued by Platforms., The Commissions complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California, alleges that Platforms, Martin, 63, Nelson, 67, Perry, 65, Draper, 58, and Ziller, 52, violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  During 2000 and 2001, Defendants issued a series of fraudulent press releases as part of a scheme to falsely portray Platforms business activities and support its stock price.  Platforms claimed to have an aerial system, the ARC System, for transmitting cellular telephone calls and other types of electronic data, using either fixed-wing aircraft or a blimp to carry transmission equipment.  Platforms used these press releases to convince investors to purchase its stock and to support its share price on the secondary market.  , According to the Commissions complaint, Platforms press releases were false.  In reality Platforms never had a complete ARC System.  It has never owned a blimp, nor has it ever had the money to manufacture or purchase one.  Platforms did take several steps to create the false impression that it was producing an ARC System.  It engaged a subcontractor to construct the antenna portion of the ARC System and conducted a demonstration of that equipment for investors and invited guests.  However, nothing resembling the ARC System as described in Platforms press releases was demonstrated.  No actual telephone call was transmitted by the system, and the antenna portion of the ARC System hung indoors from a crane rather than being suspended from an airborne blimp.  Despite its public statements to the contrary, Platforms never had any real prospect of manufacturing or selling an ARC System., The complaint further alleges that during 2000 and 2001 Platforms, Martin, Nelson, Perry, Draper and Ziller intentionally misled investors for the purpose of unlawfully making a profit themselves.  During this period, they were profiting from payments they received from the company, from illegal stock sales into the secondary market, and/or from stock sales made directly to investors. , The Commissions complaint charges Platforms and Draper with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act).  It charges Martin with violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and with causing Platforms violations of Section 5 of the Securities Act.  Finally, the Commissions complaint also charges Nelson, Perry, and Ziller with violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Commission seeks to enjoin all defendants from committing future violations of these provisions and to compel them to pay monetary penalties and disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains, with prejudgment interest.  It also seeks to bar Martin, Nelson, Perry, Draper and Ziller from serving as officers or directors of any public company in the future, and from being associated with any penny-stock company.  , <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18939.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>, <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18939.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Barry, Thomas P. Daniels (Daniels), John M. Irwin (Irwin), and Mark P. Miszkiewicz (collectively, the Defendants).  Under the terms of the final judgment signed today by U.S. District Court Judge Lewis A. Kaplan, the Defendants are permanently enjoined from violating various antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and ordered to pay more than $2.4 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and $2 million in penalties.  Further, the four principals have consented to be barred in a separate administrative proceeding from associating with any investment adviser.  The Commission expects the disgorgement, prejudgment interest and penalties from the Defendants to be distributed to victims of the fraud pursuant to the Fair Fund provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.  , <b>The alleged misconduct.</b>  The Commissions amended complaint, filed on June 15, 2004, alleged the following:  , The four principals of Beacon Hill together implemented a fraudulent scheme that resulted in investors losing more than $300 million.  From at least the beginning of 2002 through October 2002, Beacon Hill misrepresented and manipulated its valuation procedures for Beacon Hill Master, Ltd. (the Master Fund), the core hedge fund that held and traded securities in Beacon Hills three feeder hedge funds.  As the value of these hedge funds decreased over the summer of 2002, Beacon Hill increasingly inflated the prices of the securities in the Master Fund to maintain the appearance of positive returns.  At the same time, contrary to what it was telling investors, Beacon Hill made an increasing and ultimately unsuccessful bet on interest rates rising in an attempt to cover its hidden losses., In addition, Beacon Hill entered into a series of trades between the Master Fund and certain other accounts it managed for two institutional clients (the managed accounts) at prices that defrauded the Master Fund and allowed the managed accounts, whose performances had also declined, to reap substantial profits.  Beacon Hill was able to hide the losses resulting from these fraudulent trades by inflating the value of the securities in the Master Fund to an even greater extent., Finally, in September 2002, as the Defendants scheme started to unravel, three of the four principals - Barry, Daniels and Irwin - liquidated an account in which they were the only investors by selling the securities in their account to the Master Fund without disclosure to investors.  In early October 2002, when Beacon Hills prime broker challenged the valuation of the Master Fund and Beacon Hill was forced to admit it had sustained losses, the principals misrepresented the magnitude of the actual losses in an attempt to save Beacon Hills operations and make the losses appear to be the result of market conditions.  On October 17, 2002, Beacon Hill announced much larger investor losses, admitting that, as of September 30, the Net Asset Values of its hedge funds had declined 54% from previously reported August 31, 2002 levels, and further acknowledging that it had mis-priced securities in the funds prior to August., <b>The District Courts final judgment.</b>  The final judgment signed by the Court today permanently enjoins the Defendants from violations of anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws (Section 17(a)(1), (2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), (2) and (3) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers Act)).  The Defendants have consented to the entry of that judgment without admitting or denying the allegations of the amended complaint.  Beacon Hill will pay a $600,000 civil penalty and $1 in disgorgement; Barry will pay a $500,000 civil penalty and $653,275 in disgorgement and pre-judgment interest; Daniels will pay a $500,000 civil penalty and $1,053,945 in disgorgement and pre-judgment interest; Irwin will pay a $200,000 civil penalty and $554,227 in disgorgement and pre-judgment interest; and Miszkiewicz will pay a $200,000 civil penalty and $219,792 in disgorgement and pre-judgment interest.  Each Defendant is jointly liable for the full disgorgement and pre-judgment interest in the event that the other Defendants do not pay their respective shares of these liabilities., <b>The administrative settlement.</b>  Finally, Barry, Daniels, Irwin and Miszkiewicz have agreed to administrative proceedings under Section 203(f) of the Advisers Act, pursuant to which, based on the entry of the injunctions described above, Barry, Daniels and Irwin would be permanently barred from association with any investment adviser, and Miszkiewicz would be barred from association with any investment adviser, with the right to reapply after four years.   , In connection with the settlement with the Defendants, and with the consent of the Commission, the District Court dismissed from the civil action Relief Defendants Jennifer Tindell, Nancy Daniels, Marie Irwin and Ellen Lynch.  , For further information, see Litigation Release Nos. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17831.htm>17831</a> (November 7, 2002) and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18745a.htm>18745A</a> (June 16, 2004)., <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18950.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The Commission alleges that Kuretski materially misrepresented the nature, liquidity, risks and expected return of the investments.  According to the Commissions complaint, Kuretski told investors, among other things, that (i) their principal investment was guaranteed, (ii) they were investing in a basket of various stocks with risk-free annual returns of at least 12%, and (iii) they could withdraw funds from their investment.  In reality, Kuretski misappropriated investors funds through cash withdrawals, personal expenses, and by financing unrelated businesses, while continually refusing to distribute or refund investors funds.  The brokerage and bank records for AHF and Worldwide demonstrate that the vast majority of investors funds were dissipated by Kuretski.  In addition, Kuretski was selling these securities without association with any broker-dealer., The complaint charges the defendants with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Neurotech is purportedly in the business of marketing rapid deployment healthcare systems, including prefabricated hospitals, in developing countries.  , The Commission=s Complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, alleges that, during the period from at least May 1999 through January 2003, Neurotech, acting through its officers, Bernard Artz and his son Lawrence Artz, violated the federal securities laws by making false and misleading statements in its Commission filings and press releases concerning its purported receipt of millions of dollars in Indonesian bank guarantees and billions of dollars in construction contracts.  The statements concerning the bank guarantees were false and misleading because the purported instruments were, in fact, fraudulent.  In addition, the statements concerning the construction contracts were false and misleading because the vast majority of the contracts were unenforceable.  In fact, Neurotech received only $5.5 million in revenue from the $3.7 billion in construction contracts it claimed to have signed during the relevant period.  The statements concerning the construction contracts were false and misleading because, taken both individually and collectively, they falsely suggested that Neurotech was an active, viable company with an imminent revenue stream.  Bernard Artz, the companys chairman, chief executive officer and chief financial officer signed and certified Neurotechs Commission filings and reviewed the companys press releases.  Lawrence Artz, the companys vice president, also signed the Commission filings and prepared the press releases., The Complaint alleges that Neurotech and Bernard and Lawrence Artz violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder (antifraud provisions) and that Neurotech violated, and that the Artzes aided and abetted its violations of, Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder (reporting provisions).

The Commission is seeking injunctive relief, disgorgement of all ill-gotten gains, including those related to the Artzes sales of Neurotech stock during the relevant period, civil penalties, and officer and director and penny stock bars against the Artzes.												, The Commission today also instituted separate public administrative proceedings pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Exchange Act against Neurotech, to determine whether its common stock should be suspended or revoked given its failure to comply with Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder by failing to file required annual and quarterly reports with the Commission since the period ended December 31, 2002., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18952.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>, <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18952.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Kaplan consented, without admitting or denying the allegations against him, to a final judgment that requires him to disgorge $128,770 in ill-gotten gains and interest and imposes a $100,000 civil penalty.  The final judgments also reincorporate equitable relief that Rivard and Kaplan previously consented to in partial judgments entered by the court at the time the Commission filed the complaints.  The equitable relief includes permanent injunctions prohibiting Rivard and Kaplan from violating Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder, and from aiding and abetting any violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a) and 13(b)(2) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13.  In addition, the court permanently barred both Rivard and Kaplan from serving as an officer or director of a publicly held company.  On April 8, 2004, the Commission filed complaints alleging that Rivard and Kaplan participated in a widespread practice that resulted in the improper recognition of revenue by CA, one of the worlds largest software companies.  During at least CAs fiscal year 2000, which ran from April 1, 1999 through March 31, 2000, CA prematurely recognized revenue from software contracts that had not yet been consummated, in violation of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. The Commissions complaints allege that, based on this conduct, Rivard and Kaplan violated Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder.  The complaints further allege that Rivard and Kaplan are also liable for aiding and abetting CAs violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.  , The Commissions investigation is continuing., For further information see Litigation Releases No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18552.htm>18552</a> (January 22, 2004), No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18665.htm>18665</a> (April 8, 2004) and No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18891.htm>18891</a> (September 22, 2004)., <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18954.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The complaint also alleges that GetAnswers, through its offering and marketing materials and/or sales representatives, made numerous false representations and omissions to investors relating to, among other things, the experience of GetAnswers president and chief executive officers in starting successful Internet companies, GetAnswers affiliation with a college, the use of investor proceeds, the safety and profitability of an investment in the company, and its compliance with all securities laws.  In addition, the complaint alleges, among other things, that Schneer drafted, reviewed or approved GetAnswers private placement memoranda and marketing materials that were replete with the material misrepresentations and omissions set forth above, and that Schneer participated in the diversion of investor money to fund business projects such as an offshore Internet bank and a multimedia center.  The complaint charges Schneer with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Commission is also seeking a sworn accounting, a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten profits, and the imposition of a civil money penalty and a penny stock bar., Previously, on January 10, 2003, the Commission filed an emergency civil injunctive action against GetAnswers, James Koenig, GetAnswers chief executive officer and president, and Robert Cournoyer, GetAnswers chief operating officer, seeking to halt an on-going fraudulent offering of unregistered securities by GetAnswers.

Marks, of Wayland, Massachusetts, from violations of the antifraud provisions, and barring him from acting as an officer or director of a public company.  Marks was also ordered to pay $53,000 in disgorgement.  Marks is currently in federal prison serving a sentence of a year and a day as the result of a related criminal proceeding., In its complaint, filed December 3, 2002, the Commission alleged that Marks, who at the time was Vertexs highest-ranking attorney, learned on September 20, 2001, that Vertex planned to announce the suspension of clinical trials of one of its promising drugs on September 24.  According to the Commissions complaint, on September 21, Marks liquidated all of his Vertex stock despite having previously acknowledged in writing that the impending release would not be viewed favorably by Wall Street and that he should not sell his Vertex shares.  The Commission alleged that, by selling his holdings prior to the companys public announcement on September 24, Marks avoided a loss of $105,999.   , According to the Commissions complaint, at the time he traded, Marks was the designated attorney for employees to consult regarding compliance with Vertexs employee securities trading policy.  In that capacity, the Commission alleged, Marks wrote Vertexs CEO an email on September 20, advising him to make sure that an employee who had requested permission to trade had no knowledge of the impending press release.  In the e-mail, Marks wrote:   , <p class=em2>I guess that I am troubled about any employee trading prior to that release because it is likely to have an effect on the stock (looks like I cant sell any shares) and, depending on the degree of that effect, could create the perception of insider trading. , On September 21, less than 24 hours after writing this email to the CEO, the Commission alleged, Marks sold 20,900 shares of Vertex at an average price of $22.81 per share, receiving $476,765.  Vertex announced its decision to terminate clinical trials at approximately 7:10 a.m. on September 24.  Vertexs shares closed that day at $17.74, down $5.33 from the previous close on volume of 9.8 million shares, more than eight times average daily volume. , In its complaint, the Commission alleged that Marks traded in breach of a fiduciary duty to Vertex and its shareholders not to trade in the companys stock while in possession of material, nonpublic information about the company.  As a result of the conduct described in the complaint, the Commission charged Marks with violations of the antifraud provisions of federal securities laws, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.  The order holds Marks liable for disgorgement of $105,999, the full amount sought in the Commissions complaint, but waives payment of all but $53,000 based on sworn financial information that Marks submitted to the Commission.  In addition, pursuant to an ancillary Commission administrative proceeding, Marks has been suspended from appearing or practicing before the Commission under Rule 102(e)(2) of the Commissions Rules of Practice., On October 3, 2003, in the related criminal action, Marks had pled guilty to a one-count information filed by the U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts charging him with unlawful insider trading in connection with his sale of Vertex stock.  On January 12, 2004, a federal judge sentenced Marks to a year and a day in prison for his conduct., For further information see Litigation Rel.

Thomas, et al.,</i> Civil Action No. 04-12315 (PBS) (D.MA November 1, 2004).</h2>]","[SEC Charges Treyton L. Thomas and Pembridge Group, Ltd. With Securities Fraud and Stock Manipulation, The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on November 1, 2004, it filed civil fraud charges against Treyton L. Thomas, a resident of Boston, Massachusetts, and a company he founded, Pembridge Group, Ltd., for engaging in a scheme to manipulate the securities of Imagis Technologies, Inc., a Canadian software company quoted on the OTC-Bulletin Board., In a complaint filed in United States District Court in Boston the SEC alleges that from at least 1999 through 2002, Thomas generated several false press releases in which he claimed to be the chairman of Pembridge, a purported multi-faceted investment firm that managed several hundred million dollars and provided growth capital to formative companies.  In fact, it is alleged, Pembridge had no such assets under management and instead was simply a front that Thomas used to gain credibility and further his fraudulent scheme.  The Commission charges that, after several of the false press releases were disseminated, Thomas manipulated the stock of Imagis by causing Pembridge to propose a fraudulent cash tender offer for all of Imagis outstanding stock.  On March 6, 2002, Pembridge publicly announced the proposed tender offer with a potential offer price of over $4.00 per share (almost double the price at which Imagis stock was trading in previous months).  Pembrdiges March 6 announcement sent the price of Imagis stock up to a 52-week high of $3.40.  As alleged, neither Thomas nor Pembridge controlled or had access to hundreds of millions of dollars let alone the resources necessary to buy out Imagis shareholders.  , The SEC further alleges in the complaint that prior to announcing the false tender proposal, Thomas had arranged for an offshore entity  known as Indo Sakura Trust  to acquire over 100,000 warrants of Imagis stock.  Shortly before the fraudulent March 6 tender offer announcement, Indo Sakura converted 70,000 warrants to shares and, a few days after the bogus release, Indo Sakura exercised its remaining 35,000 warrants.  Pembridge also acquired warrants to purchase 50,000 shares of Imagis stock at $2.20 (CDN) a share.   In addition, Thomas advised purported clients to purchase Imagis stock.  The Defendants illicit scheme artificially inflated the value of Indo Sakuras Imagis stock, as well as the securities held directly by Pembridge and its purported clients., The SEC alleges that Thomas and Pembridge violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, by their fraudulent scheme to manipulate the market in Imagis stock.  The Commission further alleges that the defendants violated Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 14e-8 thereunder by their false and fraudulent communication of the tender offer.  The relief sought in the complaint as to each of the Defendants includes permanent injunctions from further violations of the general and tender offer anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgement interest, civil monetary penalties, penny stock bars, and a permanent bar prohibiting Thomas from serving as an officer or director of a public company., <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18957.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The Complaint alleges that Old Wachovia and First Union failed to disclose in quarterly reports and in a joint proxy statement-prospectus filed in connection with the merger the total number of shares of First Union common stock (FTU) that Old Wachovia intended to and did purchase during the period when First Union and SunTrust Corporation (SunTrust) were engaged in a hostile takeover battle for Old Wachovia.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Wachovia consented to entry of a judgment enjoining it from violating the Sections 13(a) and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 12b-20, 13a-13 and 14a-9 thereunder and to pay a civil penalty of $37 million.  , The Commissions complaint alleges:, With respect to these purchases, neither First Union nor Old Wachovia disclosed in their Forms 10-Q and 10-Q/A filed in May and June 2001, or in their joint proxy sent to over two hundred thousand shareholders on June 29, 2001, that: a) Old Wachovia authorized the purchase of FTU shares; b) subject to regulatory filings, Old Wachovia intended to purchase up to $500 million worth of FTU shares; and c) the total number of FTU shares that Old Wachovia purchased in May and June 2001.  This material information was not disclosed until August 2001, after the shareholders voted on the merger.  Old Wachovia should have publicly disclosed more detailed information about its purchases of FTU stock so that the market would be able to evaluate the effect of those purchases on FTUs stock price during that period.  By failing to disclose this material information, First Union and Old Wachovia violated Sections 13(a) and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. , During the course of the SEC staffs investigation into this matter, Wachovia provided incomplete and untimely document productions and failed to ensure comprehensive and complete responses to requests made and subpoenas issued by the SEC staff.

Saturday, 57, of Savannah, Georgia; and Arnulfo M. Acosta, 41, of  Edinburg, Texas.  The defendants have raised at least $24.5 million from the offer and sale of fictitious prime bank instruments.  The Honorable Thomas J. Whelan, United States District Judge for the Southern District of California, also granted additional relief that the Commission sought, including orders freezing assets, appointing a permanent receiver over LWI, and requiring the defendants to repatriate assets from abroad., The Commissions complaint, filed on October 12 in federal court in San Diego, alleges that the defendants raised at least $24.5 million from 1700 investors nationwide by conducting a fraudulent prime bank scheme.  According to the complaint, LWI pooled investor funds to engage in buy/sell transactions in a secret, invitation only bank trading program that generated investor returns ranging from 5% to 50% per month.  The defendants represented that one such trading program purportedly earned investors 500% in just 60 days.  The defendants also represented that an investors principal was secured by a pre-funded, cash-back instrument issued by a top U.S. bank, which purportedly restricted LWIs bank trading program to completely risk-free transactions.  , According to the complaint, these representations were false.  The defendants instead were promoting a fictitious prime bank trading program and operating a Ponzi scheme.  At least $8.2 million, or 46.9%, of the returns paid to investors came from investor funds.  The defendants also misappropriated at least $2.5 million in investor funds to support themselves and finance other businesses.  The complaint also alleges that there was no bank trading program, nor were investor funds secured by a pre-funded, cash-back instrument; rather, the bank trading program and the extraordinary returns promised by the defendants were part of a prime bank investment fraud., In its lawsuit, the Commission obtained an order freezing each of the defendants assets, an order appointing Thomas Lennon as a permanent receiver over LWI, an order requiring the defendants to repatriate assets from abroad, and a preliminary injunction prohibiting all the defendants from future violations of the securities registration and antifraud provisions -  Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Also today, the United States Attorney for the Central District of Illinois announced that, following his arrest in El Paso, Texas on federal criminal charges involving the same conduct charged in the Commissions complaint, Stapleton was transported last night to Springfield, Illinois to face those charges, and that he is expected to appear in federal court there today.  , According to the Commissions complaint, Stapletons victims included an active-duty U.S. Army Sergeant, a U.S. Defense Department civilian schoolteacher and a civilian employee of a U.S. defense contractor, all of whom resided in Germany.  The complaint alleges that Stapleton, age 51 and a retired U.S. Army sergeant, also resided in Germany at the time of his conduct.  According to the complaint, Stapleton was associated with Nalico Equity Corporation, which is a U.S.-registered broker-dealer having offices in Texas and in Europe.  The complaint further alleges that, in each instance, after persuading the victim to give him funds for investment, Stapleton invested only a portion of the funds as instructed, misappropriating the rest.  Stapleton, the complaint further charges, supplied phony account statements to two of his three victims for several years thereafter to conceal his theft.  Finally, the complaint alleges that Stapleton fled Germany in August 2001 when questions were raised concerning funds that appeared to be missing from his automobile insurance business; and that Stapleton has, more recently, been residing in El Paso, Texas and working at an automobile dealership there., The complaint charges Stapleton with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and seeks permanent injunctive relief, a disgorgement of Stapletons ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, an accounting of his assets and of what he did with the misappropriated funds, and civil penalties.

The Commissions complaint charged Ohana International, Inc. (Ohana), a Nevada corporation based in Riverside, California; Financial Solutions, an entity based in Riverside, California; and Christiano Hashimoto, 44, of Riverside, California.  The Honorable Robert J. Timlin, United States District Judge for the Central District of California, (1) granted the Commissions emergency application for a temporary restraining order; (2) froze the defendants assets; (3) ordered accountings from the defendants; (4) prohibited the destruction of documents; (4) expedited discovery; and (5) appointed a temporary receiver over Ohana and Financial Solutions., The Commissions complaint alleges that, from at least July 2003 to the present, the defendants sold renewable 30-day notes in Financial Solutions (FS Notes) to an unknown number of investors in several states.  Although the defendants have admitted that they raised $8 million from investors, their recent solicitations of hundreds of potential investors at lavish sales presentations suggest they may have raised millions more.  The defendants appear to have been targeting the African-American community with their fraudulent scheme.  , According to the complaint, the defendants represented that the FS Notes paid returns of 10% to 20% per month and that investments were secured by a $100 million government bond.  The defendants also represented that Financial Solutions used investor funds to make loans to government contractors and provided financing specifically to Gentech Fabrication, Inc. (Gentech), a privately held company in Chino, California.  The defendants represented that Gentech had $13 million in federal government contracts and that it received progress payments from the federal government sufficient to finance the monthly returns promised to investors.  The defendants had also claimed that they were raising money to finance a government contract to build invisible walls for the FBI., The complaint alleges that, although some investors may have received returns of 10% or more per month, these returns could not have been financed by the government contracts, and it appears that the defendants were actually operating a Ponzi scheme.  In addition, contrary to defendants representations, Gentech, in fact, had less than $1.4 million, not $13 million, in government contracts.  That amount was insufficient to finance the interest payments due on the $8 million that the defendants claim to have raised for Gentech.  , The Commission obtained an order temporarily restraining Ohana, Financial Solutions, and Hashimoto from violating the securities registration and antifraud provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The order also temporarily restrains Ohana and Hashimoto from violating the broker-dealer registration provisions of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act. , The Courts order provided that the temporary restraining order and asset freeze would remain in effect until November 12, 2004, at which time there will be a hearing on the Commissions motion for a preliminary injunction and the appointment of a permanent receiver.  In addition to the interim relief already granted by the Court, the Commission seeks a final judgment against the defendants enjoining them from future violations of the foregoing securities registration, broker-dealer registration, and antifraud laws, ordering them to disgorge all ill-gotten gains, and assessing civil penalties., <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18961.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The Court found that defendants took most of the money for themselves.  The Court enjoined Wright from future violations of the securities laws, ordered him to disgorge $654,057 in ill-gotten gains (with interest) and pay a $50,000 penalty.  The Court enjoined Nelson from future violations of the antifraud provisions of the securities laws and ordered him to pay a $10,000 penalty.  Following trial, the Court also ordered Nelson to disgorge $93,987., A third defendant, Michael Alexander of Solana Beach, California, consented to entry of judgment against him prior to trial without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations against him.  The Court enjoined Alexander from future securities law violations, ordered him to disgorge $1.29 million (with interest) and pay a $500,000 penalty., On October 10, 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission sued Nelson, Wright, and Alexander for running a fraudulent mortgage lending scheme.  The Commission alleged that the defendants advertised The Rose Fund in major metropolitan newspapers throughout California, promising investors a 12 to 15% annual rate of return secured by California real estate.  The advertisements also described the investments as safe, IRA/401K approved, and secured by California real estate.  The Commission also alleged, and the Court later found, that defendants duped investors by making  purported interest payments to investors from money obtained from new investors - a classic Ponzi scheme.  , The Court appointed a receiver to take control of The Rose Fund LLC, The Rose Fund, Inc. and TRF Holdings, Inc., all based in San Diego, California.

The Commissions contempt motion alleges that Goto violated the asset freeze order and a subsequent modification of the asset freeze by filing a voluntary petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code., The Commissions complaint, filed on November 14, 2003, alleges that Goto misappropriated more than $5 million of investor funds by falsely stating that the money would be invested in a Boston-based hedge fund and in a food services business.  Instead of investing the funds in the businesses he purported to represent, Goto diverted investor funds to his own bank accounts for his own personal gain., In its contempt motion, the Commission alleges that the asset freeze order and a subsequent modification of the asset freeze order, which subject all of Gotos assets to the jurisdiction of the federal district court, prohibited Goto from seeking protection of his assets in bankruptcy court.  Defendant Gotos assets have been frozen since November 14, 2003, when the Court entered a temporary restraining order and asset freeze against Goto and his wife, a relief defendant in the Commissions action.  On December 3, 2003, the court entered a preliminary injunction and asset freeze against Goto and his wife.

Wozniak on October 25, 2004., The Commission filed its civil injunctive action against Wozniak, Aqua Vie, and Aqua Vies CEO, Thomas Gillespie, on February 23, 2004, following the Commissions 10-day suspension of trading in Aqua Vie common stock on May 2, 2003.  The Commissions complaint alleges that Aqua Vie and Gillespie fraudulently promoted Aqua Vies common stock by means of millions of false and misleading tout sheets faxed to homes and businesses.  In addition, from November 2002 through May 2003, Wozniak  offered millions of shares of Aqua Vie common stock publicly, without any registration statement in effect as to the offering, in violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933.  , The unregistered public offering by Wozniak, done at the request of Aqua Vie and Gillespie, paid for a massive distribution of promotional faxes touting Aqua Vie stock and also provided cash to Aqua Vie.  The purpose of the fax campaign was to create and strengthen the market for Aqua Vie stock.  Wozniak provided the 2.75 million shares used to pay the fax disseminator, Fax.com, Inc.  In addition, Wozniak sold 3.2 million shares in his own account and transferred $1.2 million of those proceeds to Aqua Vie.  This two-pronged unregistered offer and sale effectively kept afloat a struggling company that was far more successful at marketing its stock that its only product, bottled water.  , The Judgment entered by the Court on October 25, 2004 barred Wozniak from participating in an offering of penny stock for a period of two years and ordered him to pay a civil penalty of $35,000.

A recovery room advance fee scheme is a fraud wherein the perpetrators prey on investors who have lost money on particular stocks they purchased in the past.  The perpetrators purport to offer these investors valuable assets in exchange for their nonperforming stocks but insist that the investors first pay an advance fee. , The SECs complaint alleges that the defendants carried out their fraudulent scheme by setting up companies that, while purporting to be legitimate tax and investment planning companies, in fact functioned as illegal boiler room operations.  According to the SECs complaint, to bolster their credibility as established businesses, the defendants created websites for each company with content that was plagiarized practically in toto from the websites of legitimate tax and investment planning companies.  The defendants then contacted the investors, all of whom had purchased nonperforming shares of stock from other boiler rooms in the past, and offered them an opportunity to divest themselves of their nonperforming shares., The SECs complaint alleges that the defendants lured their victims by two similar fraudulent mechanisms, both of which required an advance fee payment by the targeted investors.  Purportedly acting on behalf of a client, the defendants Crescent Financial Group, Inc., Berkshire Tax Consultants Co., Warfield Capital Management Co. and SpencerFerguson Receivables Corp., offered to swap one of their fictitious clients shares of a blue chip stock, such as Microsoft Corp. or Phillip Morris USA, for the investors nonperforming shares.  These defendants required an advance fee from their victims purportedly to make up the difference in value between the two securities.  The complaint alleges that defendants Thompson &amp; Whitehurst Acquisition Consultants (Thompson) and McKenzie Goldstein &amp; Associates (McKenzie), on the other hand, claimed to be agents for a buyer interested in acquiring a majority stake in the companies that had issued the nonperforming shares.  These defendants offered to buy the targeted investors nonperforming shares for an attractive price otherwise not available on the market, but first required that the investor make an advance payment for a portion of the purchase price of a refundable indemnity bond purportedly underwritten by a well-known insurance company, such as one of the Prudential Financial group members.  The ostensible purpose of these indemnity bonds was to guarantee that the nonperforming shares could be re-registered in the names of either Thompsons or McKenzies clients. , According to the SECs complaint, in many cases, to enhance further the appearance of the legitimacy of their schemes, the defendants told the targeted investors that the transactions were subject to monitoring by a federal regulator, either the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or the SEC.  In these instances, once an investor had wired the advance payment into a defendants bank account, he was told that either the FTC or the SEC required a further payment.  According to the SECs complaint, the defendants then sent the investors fabricated documents purporting to be from either the SEC or FTC that explained the reason for the additional payment.  In all cases, after the investors sent their payment (or payments) to the defendants, they received neither the stock they had been promised nor, alternatively, the payment they had been promised.  The SECs complaint alleges that these frauds were very lucrative for the defendants.  According to the SECs complaint, at least sixty (60) investors lost over $650,000 as a result of the frauds perpetrated by Crescent, Warfield and Berkshire alone.  , The SECs complaint alleges that each of the defendants violated the anti-fraud and broker-dealer registration provisions of the federal securities laws contained within Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Complaint seeks injunctive relief against future violations, disgorgement, prejudgment interest and civil penalties against all of the defendants.  , In a related criminal case, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of Florida today announced the arrests of several individuals allegedly connected to the operation of several of the same consecutive recovery room advance-fee schemes alleged in the SECs complaint. The SEC wishes to acknowledge the cooperation and assistance provided by the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of Florida and the Postal Inspection Service in this matter.  The SEC would also like to thank the Financial Services Authority (FSA) in the United Kingdom for their assistance in this matter.  The SEC will continue to work with domestic and foreign law enforcement authorities to combat the proliferation of boiler rooms and advance fee schemes so that these international frauds will not find a safe haven from which to operate. , In order to assist investors, the Commission has released an Investor Alert entitled Worthless Stock: How to Avoid Doubling Your Losses.  The Investor Alert warns that con artists across the globe have stepped up their efforts to rip off investors, especially non-U.S. residents who have lost money in the U.S. securities markets.

The Commission also charged the five individuals, and a sixth individual, Eric Littman, with selling unregistered securities., The Commissions complaint, filed in United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, alleges the following: In June 2000, defendants Simmons, Gilbert, Zankowski and Kennedy conducted a reverse merger of Nutraceutical into a publicly traded shell company named October Project II Corp. (which then was renamed Nutraceutical).  At the same time, they secretly purchased from defendant Littman and another individual, who together owned the shell company, nearly all of the shares issued by the shell company.  Three months after the merger, in September 2000, securities lawyer Zankowski and the shell owner Littman deceived the companys stock transfer agent into removing legends from the shares stock certificates identifying certain resale restrictions on the shares.  Once the legends were removed from the stock certificates, defendants Simmons, Kennedy and Siciliano pumped up the stock price and trading volume of Nutraceutical common stock in October and November 2000.  Specifically, then-CEO Simmons disseminated false and misleading publicity about the company, while, at the same time, stock promoters Kennedy and Siciliano falsely touted Nutraceutical stock on an Internet message board and manipulated the market for the companys stock through fraudulent stock trading.  During the course of the manipulation, all of the defendants, except Littman, sold shares of Nutraceutical.  In addition, stock promoters Kennedy and Siciliano failed to disclose, as required by the federal securities laws, compensation they had received to tout Nutraceutical.  As a result of their violations, the Defendants reaped ill-gotten gains of approximately $1.8 million., The Commissions complaint further alleges that as a result of the conduct described above, all of the defendants violated the registration provisions of the federal securities laws (Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933), and all, except Littman, violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws (Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder).  The complaint also alleges that Kennedy and Siciliano violated the anti-touting provisions of the federal securities laws (Section 17(b) of the Securities Act). The Commission seeks against each of the defendants permanent injunctions, civil money penalties, penny stock bars, and disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest.

In its order, the Court noted that Ware had continued to act in bad faith, even after the Court had imposed multiple monetary sanctions on him., In its complaint, filed July 14, 2004, the Commission alleged that the Defendants conducted a fraudulent scheme involving the stock of Investment Technology, Inc., a Las Vegas, Nevada publicly-traded company, with a purported on-line gambling casino.  The complaint charged that Thomas D. Vidmar (Vidmar), of Las Vegas, Nevada, the companys CEO and chairman, and Ware, of Atlanta, Georgia, the companys investment banker and securities counsel, caused Investment Technology to file two false and misleading registered securities offerings with the Commission.  Thereafter, the complaint alleged, the Defendants issued numerous press releases and analyst reports recommending the purchase of Investment Technology stock based on various unfounded claims regarding the companys purported on-line gambling casino operation.

Phoenix, which has been under the control of a court appointed receiver since shortly after the Commission filed this case, consented to the entry of the final judgment without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions complaint.  The Commission withdrew its claims against Phoenix for disgorgement and civil penalties., Phoenix, through the efforts of its codefendants, engaged in fraud in the offer and sale of unregistered investment contracts in a scheme involving pay telephone lease-backs.  The Commission alleged that the defendants promoted a massive fraudulent scheme through the use of insurance agents and over the Internet, in which Phoenix raised more than $74 million from more than 2,000 mostly elderly investors.  All of the individual defendants in this action have been permanently enjoined in earlier orders, and have been ordered to pay disgorgement and other relief., In earlier orders, the Court concluded that the scheme was based upon purported investments in customer owned, coin-operated telephones offered and sold in units, involving a telephone, site lease, lease-back agreement and  buy-back agreement, that constituted securities, and further concluded that no registration statement was filed with the Commission in connection with those securities.  Phoenix was the source of lease payments on the telephones and was the insurer of the investment.  Investors were not told that Phoenix was losing money, had a negative net worth, and was dependent on revenue from new investors to sustain its operations., See also:  <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17089.htm>L.

NCFE, a private corporation located in Dublin, Ohio, and its subsidiaries collapsed suddenly in October 2002 when investors discovered that the companies had hidden massive cash and collateral shortfalls from investors and auditors.  The collapse caused investor losses exceeding $1 billion.  , Snoble, a resident of Columbus, Ohio, consented to a permanent injunction prohibiting him from violating the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws; an order barring him from serving as an officer or director of a public company; and disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty, with those amounts to be determined at a later hearing., The complaint alleges that two wholly owned subsidiaries of NCFE purchased medical accounts receivable from health-care providers and issued notes that securitized those receivables.  From at least 1999 to 2002, the subsidiaries offered and sold at least $3.25 billion in total notes through private placements to institutional investors., The complaint further alleges that senior NCFE officials improperly advanced to health-care providers $1 billion or more of the capital raised from investors without receiving required medical accounts receivable in return.  These advances were essentially unauthorized, unsecured loans to distressed or defunct health-care providers-some of which were partly or wholly owned by NCFE or its principals.  The unsecured advances were inconsistent with representations made by senior NCFE officials in offering documents provided to investors., According to the complaint, Snoble aided other NCFE officials in concealing their fraud from trustees, investors, potential investors, and auditors by executing unsecured advances, by executing fraudulent fund transfers, and by providing independent auditors with materially misleading information in connection with yearly audits of NCFE., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Snoble consented to the entry of an order that: (1) permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder; (2) permanently bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company; and (3) orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil monetary penalty, with those amounts to be determined at a later hearing., The Commission filed its action at the same time that the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of Ohio unsealed a criminal information against Snoble for the conduct that is the subject of the Commissions complaint.

The Commissions complaint alleges that Hobbs, then an administrative vice president and director of internal audit for Granite State, obtained material, nonpublic information in late October and early November 2002 concerning the upcoming acquisition of Granite State by Chittenden Corp., a bank holding company based in Vermont.  According to the complaint, Hobbs tipped Mayhew, his friend and partner in an investment club, and both Hobbs and Mayhew thereafter bought shares of Granite State prior to the public announcement of the acquisition.  On November 7, 2002, Granite State and Chittenden announced the acquisition, causing Granite States stock price to rise by over $7 per share.  The defendants illegal insider trading netted profits totaling approximately $146,000., The Commissions complaint alleges that, as a result of his position as an insider at Granite State, beginning in late October 2002, Hobbs learned certain confidential information about the acquisition of the company.  Among other things, at least two Granite State employees who reported to Hobbs discussed with him unusual document requests they had received from Granite State executives that suggested due diligence was being performed on Granite State or that an acquisition involving Granite State was going to happen.

Wilson, a former licensed registered representative, with securities fraud.  In its complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, the Commission charges that Wilson sought to manipulate the price of stocks he traded and illegally obtain material, non-public information from public companies by impersonating officials from the NASDAQ Stock Market and the American Stock Exchange (AMEX).  , The complaint alleges the following:  From at least June 2003 through April 2004, Wilson, a 43-year-old resident of Rocky River, Ohio, engaged in a scheme to profit illegally from trading in the securities of at least five NASDAQ-listed issuers and two AMEX-listed issuers.  After seeing an unusual upward spike in the share price or trading volume of a stock, Wilson would telephone the issuer at or about the time he traded the stock.  Wilsons trading strategy generally was to sell the securities short prior to the calls.  During these calls, Wilson used an alias and told a corporate officer of the issuer that he was an employee of NASDAQ or AMEX, depending on where the issuers stock was listed.  Using that false authority, Wilson then asked the corporate officers if they knew of a reason for their companies unusually high share price or trading volume.  Wilson was seeking-and in several of these telephone calls received-material, non-public information: that the company knew of no reason for the increased price or volume.  In all but one case, Wilson instructed the company to issue a press release confirming that it knew of no reason for the increased price or volume.  Two of the companies followed Wilsons instructions and issued such releases.  Wilson knew that the companies stock prices would drop as a result of these press releases. , The complaint also alleges that Wilson illegally attempted to drive down the share price of at least one issuers stock by posting false and misleading information regarding that issuer on the Yahoo Finance internet message boards.  In one such message, the Commission alleges, Wilson falsely stated that the issuer was being investigated for stock manipulation by the Commission., The Commissions complaint charges that, as a result of his alleged misconduct, Wilson violated three antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws (Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder).

Howes  have consented to the entry of judgments against them, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions Complaint.  The Commissions Complaint is pending against William Baker, the former General Manager of the 2D Business Unit of Robotics ACIM division.    , In its Complaint, the Commission alleged that during its fiscal year 2000, Robotics ACIM division improperly recorded revenue from approximately 36 purported sales to distributors totaling approximately $4.73 million in order to meet its revenue and sales goals.  According to the Complaint, between December 1999 and September 2000, ACIM negotiated numerous purported sales to its distributors and customers which contained non-standard terms that deferred, conditioned or even negated the distributors obligations to pay for the ACIM products.  Recognizing revenue from these transactions was contrary to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).    , According to the Complaint, most of the non-standard deals were negotiated or approved by defendant Tatkow, the former Senior Vice President of Worldwide Sales, who pressured his sales staff to induce ACIMs distributors to place such orders at the end of each quarter so that ACIM could meet its sales and revenue targets.  Prior to the filing of the companys Form 10-K for fiscal year 2000, defendants Edwards (Robotics former CFO), Cohen (Robotics former Corporate Controller) and Howes (the former Acting President of ACIM) knew or were reckless in not knowing that the sales contained consignment terms and knew or were reckless in not knowing that the recognition of revenue from such deals had been improper.  Nevertheless, they did not correct the improper revenue recognition, nor did they inform Robotics Board of Directors, Audit Committee, or outside auditors of what they had learned.  As a result, the company overstated its net income by 13.5% and its revenue by 2.1%.  , In their Consents to Final Judgment, the defendants agreed, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, to the following relief:, The Commissions Complaint also alleges that Baker, the sole remaining defendant, told a distributor in your [purchase order] to us you cannot state that you have the right to return the product because [w]hen you do that, we cant book the order as revenue.  The improper transactions Baker negotiated, coupled with the other consignment transactions, resulted in Robotic materially overstating its revenue and net income for fiscal year 2000. , The Commission also instituted and settled cease-and-desist proceedings against Robotic and one of its distributors, ID Integration, and the President of ID Integration, Gary Moe.  In the Orders, which were consented to by Robotic, ID Integration and Moe without admitting or denying the allegations in the Orders, the Commission found that Robotic committed violations of the antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws, while ID Integration and Moe caused violations of the antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws. , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18980.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The complaint further alleges that Bristow and Sinha each reviewed and approved the arrangement to repay the settlement payment to the affiliated entity, knowing that the future consulting fees would approximate the amount of the settlement payment, and that they were reckless in causing eFunds to recognize the $2.1 million as revenue in the second quarter of 2001.  , Bristow, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, has consented to the entry of a Final Judgment against him enjoining him from violating Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder, and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-13 thereunder.  The Final Judgment also requires Bristow to pay $53,680 in disgorgement plus $6,999.89 in prejudgment interest and imposes a $30,000 civil penalty for his wrongdoing., Sinha, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, has consented to the entry of a Final Judgment enjoining him from violating Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder, and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-13 thereunder.

Mead, Michael J. Ricks, and John H. Woody, former employees of  LendingTree, Inc. (LendingTree), a financial services company based in Charlotte, North Carolina.  The Commissions complaint alleges that Mead (Vice President of National Accounts), Ricks (Senior Director of Strategy and Sales) and Woody (Senior Director of Sales and Product Management) purchased LendingTree securities prior to the May 5, 2003 public announcement (the Announcement) of the proposed merger between LendingTree and USA Interactive, after learning of the proposed transaction during the course of their employment.  As alleged in the complaint, LendingTrees stock price rose sharply on the day of the Announcement to close at a 41% premium over the closing price of the previous trading day.  By trading on this material, nonpublic information, the complaint alleges, Mead, Ricks and Woody realized substantial illicit profits and violated the antifraud provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act)., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Mead, Ricks, and Woody consented to the entry of final judgments against them that permanently enjoin them from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The final judgments also require Mead, Ricks, and Woody to disgorge illegal trading profits of $62,756, $62,102.50, and $86,612.50, respectively, and pay prejudgment interest thereon.   Finally, the final judgments order each defendant to pay a civil penalty in an amount equal to their disgorgement obligations, pursuant to Section 21A of the Exchange Act., The Commissions complaint alleges that while working as LendingTree employees, Mead, Ricks, and Woody learned of the pending merger between LendingTree and USA Interactive by observing unusual activity at LendingTrees headquarters related to the merger, including a senior management meeting with USA Interactive.  The complaint also alleges that Mead, Ricks and Woody worked in close proximity to LendingTree executives and employees who were aware of the merger negotiations -- and all three had access to pertinent information and documents related to the pending merger.  The complaint further alleges that just prior to the Announcement, Mead, Ricks, and Woody approached LendingTrees senior management and asked whether the unusual activity at headquarters signified that LendingTree was going to be acquired.  Furthermore, the complaint alleges that most of the illegal trading by Mead, Ricks and Woody in LendingTree securities occurred on Friday, May 2, 2003 -- the last trading day before the Announcement.  Finally, the complaint alleges that Meads, Ricks and Woodys trades in the days leading up to the Announcement were their first purchases of LendingTree equities in the secondary market - as well as the first purchases by Ricks and Woody of LendingTree option contracts., The Commissions investigation in this matter is continuing.

Keesee and Eduardo Lautieri.  The Commission had charged the defendants with securities fraud in connection with an unregistered interstate offering and sale of securities in the form of interests in a pooled foreign currency trading account.  Due to the Commissions early discovery of the fraudulent offering, the Commission halted the offering in January 2004 after the defendants had obtained funds from only 15 investors., On January 28, 2004, the Commission filed a complaint against the defendants in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, Dallas Division (District Court), SEC v. First Access Financial, LLC, et al, Civ. No. 3-04-CV-168-H (N.D. Tex.).  The Commissions complaint alleged that defendants, using aggressive cold calling, an Internet website, television infomercials and paid radio spots, claimed to provide investors access to foreign exchange markets at the special Interbank level supposedly accessible only to the most profitable and largest financial institutions in the world. The Complaint also alleged that the defendants further claimed to have a Currency Management Team with a five-year track record of 100% returns, headed by a world-renowned institutional money manager who is a Top 10 certified and rated trader.  The Commission contended these claims, as well as others that defendants made, were false and that First Access Financial was, in fact, merely a five-month-old boiler room outfit.  Defendants raised $243,000 from investors in at least seven states and two foreign countries, with no investor funds going to Interbank level foreign currency trading., First Access Financial, First Access, Keesee and Lautieri consented to the entry of a final judgment enjoining them from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act).

AGREES TO SETTLE CHARGES OF VIOLATIONS OF ANTIFRAUD AND OTHER PROVISIONS OF THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) today filed a civil action against American International Group, Inc. (Defendant AIG) for violating antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and for aiding and abetting violations of reporting and record-keeping provisions of those laws.  The Commissions action arises out of the conduct of Defendant AIG, primarily through its wholly owned subsidiary AIG Financial Products Corp. (AIG-FP), (collectively referred to as AIG) in developing, marketing, and entering into transactions that purported to enable a public company to remove certain assets from its balance sheet.  Defendant AIG, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions Complaint has consented to the issuance of a final judgment (1) permanently enjoining it from violating, and from aiding and abetting violations of, certain provisions of the federal securities laws, (2) ordering it to comply with its undertaking to retain an independent consultant to examine certain prior transactions and to establish a transaction review committee to review future transactions, and (3) ordering Defendant AIG to disgorge the amount of fees that it received.  In consenting to settle the Commissions action and related, criminal charges, AIG has agreed to pay disgorgement, plus prejudgment interest, and penalties totaling $126,366,000. , In its Complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, the Commission alleged that from at least March 2001 through January 2002, Defendant AIG, primarily through AIG-FP, developed a product called a Contributed Guaranteed Alternative Investment Trust Security (C-GAITS), marketed that product to several public companies, and ultimately entered into three C-GAITS transactions with one such company, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC).  For a fee, AIG offered to establish a special purpose entity (SPE) to which the counter-party would transfer troubled or other potentially volatile assets.  AIG represented that, under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the SPE would not be consolidated on the counter-partys financial statements.  The counter-party thus would be able to avoid charges to its income statement resulting from declines in the value of the assets transferred to the SPE. The transaction that AIG developed and marketed, however, did not satisfy the requirements of GAAP for nonconsolidation of SPEs., The Commission alleged that while AIG was marketing the product, independent auditors for some potential counter-parties raised issues about whether certain features of the C-GAITS product could cause the product not to satisfy the GAAP requirements for nonconsolidation of SPEs.  AIG did not inform the other potential counter-parties of these issues, except in one instance in which a potential counter-party used the same independent auditor as the potential counter-party that had communicated the issue to AIG.  The Commission further alleged that AIG entered into three C-GAITS transactions with PNC to enable PNC to remove a total of $762 million in loan and venture-capital assets from its balance sheet.  AIG was reckless in not knowing that these transactions did not satisfy the GAAP requirements for nonconsolidation of the assets by PNC., In its Complaint, the Commission alleged the following:, The Commission further alleged in its Complaint that Defendant AIG (a) recklessly made misstatements of material facts, and omitted to state material facts, about whether the C-GAITS product satisfied the GAAP requirements for nonconsolidation of an SPE and (b) entered into the three PAGIC transactions with PNC that it was reckless in not knowing did not satisfy the GAAP requirements for nonconsolidation of the SPEs by PNC., Defendant AIG, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, has consented to the  issuance of a final judgment (a) permanently enjoining it from violating of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-1, 13a-1, and 13a-13, (b) ordering it to disgorge the $39,821,000 in fees that it received, plus prejudgment interest of $6,545,000, which will be paid to the victim restitution fund established in connection with the prior resolution of criminal charges by the Department of Justice against a PNC subsidiary  and (c) ordering Defendant AIG to retain an independent consultant to examine certain of its prior transactions and to establish a Transaction Review Committee to review the appropriateness of certain future transactions.  The independent consultant will conduct an examination of transactions that Defendant AIG entered into with a public company between January 1, 2000 and the date of the final judgment that involved the use of SPEs or variable interest entities, or that were marketed or entered into by Defendant AIG with a primary purpose of enabling a public company to obtain an accounting or financial reporting result.  The Transaction Review Committee will review transactions proposed to be undertaken with a public company that were or are developed, marketed, or proposed by Defenant AIG or a public company and that involve heightened legal, reputational, or regulatory risk, including transactions with a primary purpose of enabling a public company to obtain an accounting or financial result.  The independent consultant will conduct a review related to certain policies and procedures adopted by the Transactional Review Committee., Separately today, the Fraud Section of the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice (Fraud Section) announced a resolution of related, criminal charges against Defendant AIG and two of its subsidiaries.  In resolving the civil and criminal charges, AIG has agreed to pay disgorgement and penalties totaling $126 million.  Todays civil and criminal actions are the result of investigations by the Commission, the Fraud Section, and the Pittsburgh office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. , The Commission previously brought a prior settled proceeding against PNC.

Cal., November 30, 2004</h2>, <h2>SEC CHARGES FORMER NETWORK ASSOCIATES FINANCIAL OFFICER WITH INSIDER TRADING</h2>]","[On November 30, 2004, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against Evan S. Collins, a former senior financial officer for Network Associates, Inc., now known as McAfee, Inc.  The complaint charges that Collins traded in the securities of Network Associates while in possession of material, nonpublic information concerning fraudulent accounting practices at Network Associates and that his profits from the illegal trading were approximately $253,000., Also today, the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California filed criminal charges against Collins in connection with the same conduct., Simultaneously with the filing of the complaint, Collins has consented, without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, to the entry of an order permanently enjoining him from violating, directly or indirectly, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, which are antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  Collins also has consented to the entry of an order that bars him for five years from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  Collins has further consented to disgorge his unlawful trading profits of $253,125, together with prejudgment interest thereon in the amount of $63,336, for a total disgorgement of $316,461, and to pay a civil penalty of $253,125., The Commissions complaint alleges that, in September 2000, Collins, who formerly had served as Network Associates Controller, was serving as Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of a Network Associates majority-owned subsidiary, McAfee.com.  At about that time, Collins learned that his successor at Network Associates, Terry Davis, had made journal entries in Network Associates general ledger that improperly inflated the companys accounts receivable reserve.  By accessing the Network Associates accounting system from his computer at work, Collins confirmed this information and determined that Davis had transferred $15 million from the companys tax reserve account to an accounts receivable reserve account.  Collins knew that Daviss $15 million transfer was not in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), which provide that accounts receivable reserves should only be increased by a corresponding reduction to Network Associates revenue., The complaint further alleges that, in October 2000, Collins learned that Davis was warning certain colleagues that they should sell their Network Associates stock.  Based on this and his knowledge of the material, nonpublic information concerning the improper accounting entries, Collins concluded that Network Associates had misstated its financial statements and, as a result, was in danger of not meeting its publicly announced revenue targets for the fourth quarter ending December 31, 2000., The complaint further alleges that on or about November 1, 2000, Collins exercised options on 30,000 shares of Network Associates stock and sold the shares in advance of Network Associates fourth quarter earnings announcement.  On December 26, 2000, Network Associates stated in a press release that its sales for the fourth quarter 2000 would be only $55 million, dramatically lower than the companys earlier prediction of $245 million.  The news sent Network Associates stock price down sharply and slashed more than $1 billion from the companys market capitalization.  By trading in advance of the fourth quarter 2000 earnings announcement, Collins realized unlawful profits of $253,125., The Commissions action against Collins is its third civil enforcement action related to the accounting fraud at Network Associates.  Previously, the Commission filed civil actions against Network Associates former Controller Terry Davis (Litigation Release No. 18189) and former Chief Financial Officer Prabhat Goyal (Litigation Release No. 18748).  Both of these actions are pending.  , The Commission acknowledges the assistance and cooperation of the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Northern District of California and the Federal Bureau of Investigation., The Commissions investigation into matters related to the fraud at Network Associates, now known as McAfee, Inc., is continuing. , <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp18986.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>, <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18986.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The SECs Complaint, which was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, alleges that these individuals caused Kmart to issue materially false financial statements by improperly accounting for millions of dollars worth of vendor allowances.  Kmart obtained allowances from its vendors for various promotional and marketing activities.  According to the Complaint, defendants caused Kmart to recognize allowances prematurely on the basis of false information provided to the companys accounting department.  A number of vendor representatives participated in the fraud by co-signing false and misleading accounting documents, executing side agreements, and, in some instances, providing false or misleading third party confirmations to Kmarts independent auditor, Pricewaterhouse- Coopers LLP.  As a result, Kmarts net income for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended January 31, 2001, was overstated by approximately $24 million or 10 percent, as originally reported.  The company restated its financial statements after filing for bankruptcy to correct these and other accounting errors., The Kmart defendants are John Paul Orr, former Divisional Vice President of Kmarts photo division; Michael K. Frank, former Divisional Vice President and General Merchandise Manager of Kmarts food and consumables division; and Albert M.

Fla., filed March 21, 2002)</h2>, <h2>Florida Boiler Room Operator Settles SEC Charges For Selling Bogus Limited Liability Partnership Interests </h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced on November 29, 2004, the Honorable Joan A. Lenard of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida entered a final judgment by consent against Sara Jane Peck (Peck), a resident of Aventura, Florida.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, Peck agreed to be enjoined permanently from violating various antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws and to pay $200,000 in disgorgement. The three other defendants in the case, Larry Grabarnick (Grabarnick), Marc David Shiner (Shiner) and Donald LaBarre (LaBarre) have previously settled to judgments requiring them to collectively pay over $7 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest and civil penalties., The Commissions complaint alleges that Grabarnick and Shiner promoted investments in unregistered LLP units to the public through bulk e-mails and Internet websites. Interested investors responded over the Internet by providing contact information, which Peck and LaBarre then purchased as leads from Grabarnick and Shiner.  The complaint alleges that Peck and LaBarre used boiler room sales tactics to offer and sell the LLP units. Investors were told they would benefit from the deregulation of the electric service provider market in California. According to the complaint, more than 580 people nationwide invested over $10 million by purchasing units, or fractions thereof, in eight LLPs. Each LLP consisted of 80 partnership units, each valued at $19,675, for a total of $1,547,000 per fully funded partnership. , According to the Complaint, Peck made numerous material misrepresentations and omissions to investors regarding, among other things, the use of investor funds, the profitability of the investment, its likelihood of success, the risks associated with the investment, and the need to invest quickly.  After all 80 units were sold, or as many as could be, investors were told that the partnerships would not be viable and they were offered Over-the-Counter penny stock in exchange for their remaining escrowed funds. None of the partnerships ever became operational electric companies.  Many investors were elderly; many rolled over money from IRA and 401(k) accounts.  All of the investors were left with worthless partnership units and delisted penny stock., Peck, without admitting or denying the allegations, settled the action by consenting to entry of a court order that: (i) permanently enjoins her from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and (ii) requires her to pay $333,725 in disgorgement.  Peck has consented to pay $200,000 in disgorgement.  She was not ordered to pay a civil penalty and the remainder of her disgorgement obligation was waived based upon a demonstrated inability to pay more., The Commission acknowledges the assistance provided by the Department of Banking and Finance of the State of Floridas Office of the Comptroller in this matter.

The offering through D&amp;E, which unlawfully raised approximately $6 million, constituted an unregistered offering of securities, which was integrated with the earlier unregistered, non-exempt offerings.	, See also:  <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18645.htm>L.

Gratz, a former stockbroker who conducted business as Phoenix World Wide Enterprises, Inc. (Phoenix), was sentenced on November 19, 2004, to a term of imprisonment of eighty-seven months by United States District Court Judge Jose E. Martinez in Miami, Florida.  Judge Martinez also ordered Gratz to pay restitution in the amount of approximately $8 million to victims of his securities fraud scam., On July 19, 2004, Gratz pleaded guilty to one count of mail fraud, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 1341 and 2; one count of wire fraud, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 1343 and 2; one count of securities fraud, in violation of Title 15, United States Code, Sections 78j(b) and 78ff(a); and one count of criminal contempt, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 401(3).  , This case arose out of Gratzs illegal conduct while under an injunction from a prior Commission case.  On April 30, 1992, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida in the case of <i>SEC v. Delta Rental Systems, Inc., et al.</i>, Case No. 91-2136-CIV-DAVIS (S.D. Fla.) entered a Final Judgment of Permanent Injunction and Other Relief (the Permanent Injunction) against Gratz.  The Permanent Injunction prohibited Gratz from committing future violations of, among others, the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  In violation of the Permanent Injunction, from November 1998 to March 2003, Gratz, while doing business through Phoenix, conducted a scheme through which he defrauded various investors located in different states throughout the country, including investors residing in the Southern District of Florida.  , On March 20, 2003, the Commission filed an emergency civil contempt action against Gratz in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida in order to put a halt to the scheme.  In that action, the Commission charged Gratz with disobeying the provisions in the Permanent Injunction that enjoined him from future violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The following day, the Court granted the SECs request for emergency relief, entered a temporary asset freeze, and appointed a Receiver to take over Phoenix.  On May 20, 2003, with Gratzs consent, the Court entered an order on civil contempt sanctions, ordering Gratz to disgorge all ill-gotten gains, imposing an asset freeze, and awarding attorneys fees.  On October 22, 2003, with Gratzs consent, the Court entered a Final Judgment on Civil Contempt and ordered Gratz to disgorge his ill-gotten proceeds.   , The Commissions filing of its emergency civil contempt action against Gratz in March 2003 was based on the same activity that led to the criminal case.  To carry out his scheme, Gratz solicited individuals to invest money with him in return for guaranteed annual interest payments ranging from 25% to 50%.  During investor solicitations, Gratz falsely represented to investors, among other things, that he would invest all of their funds in the stock market.  In truth, Gratz misappropriated over $3 million in investor funds for his and his familys personal use and benefit, including to purchase, among other things, a luxury home, real estate properties, two Mercedes Benz automobiles, artwork, jewelry and watches, home furnishings, a vacation to St. Barthelemy and a country club membership; and to pay for personal credit card expenses, which included, among other things, vacations, airfare, lodging, cruises, limousines, restaurants, designer clothes, and retail store purchases.  Gratz induced investors to invest money by making false statements and omissions of material facts concerning, among others, the use of investor funds, the profitability of his securities trading, and his prior criminal and disciplinary history.

The Commission previously charged First Choice and its President, Gary Van Waeyenberghe, with violations of the federal securities laws based on related conduct in July 2000.  Van Waeyenberghe  was criminally indicted on conspiracy, mail fraud, wire fraud and money laundering charges based on related conduct in September 2004., According to the information to which Morris pled guilty, Morris was President of Integras Capital Group, which became the marketing office for First Choice securities offerings in or around December of 1999.  The information alleges that from in or around November 1999 through July 2000, Morris knowingly and intentionally participated in a scheme to defraud prospective First Choice investors through the use of false and fraudulent representations regarding securities offerings by First Choice known as Enhanced Automobile Receivables (EARs) and Realty First Mortgages (RFMs). , Shortly after the filing of the Commissions Complaint in July 2000, the Court issued a Temporary Restraining Order and subsequently a Preliminary Injunction freezing First Choices and Van Waeyenberghes assets and appointed a receiver to manage First Choices assets during the pendency of the litigation.  On January 8, 2003, by consent, the Court permanently enjoined First Choice and Van Waeyenberghe from future violations of the antifraud and securities registration provisions of the federal securities laws, ordered First Choice and Van Waeyenberghe jointly and severally to pay $31.3 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest and imposed a $110,000 civil penalty on Van Waeyenberghe.

Min T. Ma and his girlfriend Joyce Manni Ng helped prepare documents relating to upcoming, but still unannounced, mergers and acquisitions involving clients of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Inc.  The Commissions Complaint alleges that from May through November 2003, Ma and Ng invested several times their annual income in the targets of mergers they had learned about through their work on confidential deal documents and access to Merrill Lynch computer files.  Shortly thereafter, when the mergers were announced and the stock prices skyrocketed, Ma and Ng liquidated their shares and doubled their money.  , According to the Complaint, filed in the Northern District of California, Ma and Ng were employed as desktop publishing specialists by Bowne Business Solutions since 2000.  During that period, they worked onsite at the Palo Alto, California office of Merrill Lynch, preparing merger and acquisition presentations, deal proposals, and other documents; they also had complete access to shared computer drives housing confidential deal documents.  The Complaint alleges that Ma and Ng repeatedly bought stock in companies that were either Merrill Lynch clients seeking to be acquired, or acquisition targets of Merrill Lynch clients.  On numerous occasions between May and November 2003, Ma and Ng bought stock in three public companies - Oak Technology, Inc., SangStat Medical Corporation, and Applied Molecular Evolution, Inc. - shortly after working on confidential deal documents.  They did so notwithstanding having signed confidentiality agreements expressly prohibiting them from engaging in such trading.  All told, Ma and Ng invested over $400,000 in these illegal trades, several times their combined annual income., The respective acquisitions of these companies were announced to the public soon after defendants stock purchases, in each instance causing the stock price to skyrocket.  Ma and Ng sold their shares following the announcements to obtain gross proceeds of more than $850,000, essentially doubling their money through the use of inside information.  By selling their shares after the public announcements, Ma and Ng made illegal profits totaling approximately $438,000., The Complaint charges Ma and Ng with trading on the basis of material, nonpublic information in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

According to the complaint, the defendants-R. Geoffrey Layne, James S. Sholeff, Dale Boeth, and Shawn McGhee-participated in a fraudulent scheme to artificially inflate the first quarter 2001 (Q1 2001) revenues of PurchasePro.com, Inc., a Las Vegas-based Internet company now known as Pro-After, Inc.  All four individuals, who were officers or senior employees of PurchasePro, settled the charges without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations., The Commissions complaint alleges that in Q1 2001 and continuing through April 2001, each defendant took knowing and deliberate steps designed to inflate PurchasePros revenues in contravention of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  In particular, the complaint alleges that, Layne, while serving as PurchasePros Executive Vice President, (i) entered into, and concealed the existence of, reciprocal agreements that rendered it improper to recognize $1 million in revenue from two marketplace license sales to PurchasePro customers; and (ii) took steps to make it falsely appear that a purported Statement of Work contract between PurchasePro and AOL, valued at $3.65 million, was executed during Q1 2001, when in fact it was never properly executed.  The complaint further alleges that Boeth, PurchasePros Senior Vice President of Consulting Services, and Sholeff, a PurchasePro Vice President, also took steps to make it falsely appear that the Statement of Work agreement was executed during Q1 2001, and that Sholeff took similar steps with respect to a $3.7 million marketplace license sale.  According to the complaint, McGhee, PurchasePros Chief Operating Officer during the relevant period, took steps to (i) make it falsely appear that a $3.5 million marketplace license sale had been entered into during Q1 2001; and (ii) conceal the existence of reciprocal agreements that rendered it improper to recognize any revenue from that sale.  Each of these transactions had a misleading impact on the revenues announced and reported by PurchasePro.  As reflected in the complaint, by including these transactions, PurchasePro artificially and materially inflated its publicly announced revenues by at least 34% and its reported revenues by over 37%.    , In addition, the complaint alleges that, during April 2001, Layne and Sholeff attempted to conceal their conduct by destroying certain documents.  In particular, the complaint alleges that Sholeff and Layne deleted, or requested others to delete, their AOL-related emails, and that Sholeff shredded all of his AOL related documents and destroyed his laptop.  The complaint further alleges that in February 2002, Layne and Sholeff lied to the Commission staff during testimony in order to conceal their fraudulent conduct.  Finally, the complaint alleges that in April 2001, PurchasePro paid Layne a $200,000 retention bonus and that at or about the same time, PurchasePro paid Boeth a total of $150,000 in retention bonuses. , Based on these factual allegations, the Commission charged: (i) Layne and McGhee with violating Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2, and with aiding and abetting PurchasePros violations of Exchange Act Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B), and of Exchange Act Rules 12b-20 and 13a-13; (ii) Sholeff with violating Exchange Act Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1, and with aiding and abetting PurchasePros violations of Exchange Act Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B), and of Exchange Act Rules 12b-20 and 13a-13; and (iii) Boeth with violating Exchange Act Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2.  Without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, each defendant consented to final judgments that would permanently enjoin each of them from violating the foregoing securities law provisions, and that would: (i) in the case of Layne, permanently bar him from acting as an officer or director of any public company, and order Layne to pay disgorgement of $200,000 plus prejudgment interest; (ii) in the case of Sholeff, permanently bar him from acting as an officer or director of any public company, and order Sholeff to pay a $35,000 civil penalty; (iii) in the case of Boeth, permanently bar him from acting as an officer or director of any public company, and order Boeth to pay disgorgement of $150,000 plus prejudgment interest, but waive payment, and not impose a civil penalty, based on Boeths demonstrated inability to pay; and (iv) in the case of McGhee, bar him for five years from serving as an officer or director of any public company.  The final judgment against Layne permits him to offset his payment of disgorgement by the corresponding amount of any restitution he pays in connection with the parallel criminal proceeding described below; while the final judgment against Sholeff permits him to offset his payment of civil penalties by the corresponding amount of any criminal fine he pays in connection with that same parallel criminal proceeding.

LESLIE FOR FRAUDULENT WASH SALES AND FREE-RIDING SCHEMES</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a settled federal court action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against David James Leslie (Leslie), a resident of Marietta, Georgia, alleging that Leslie engaged in two fraudulent trading schemes.  The complaint alleges that in the first scheme, Leslie executed over 200 wash sales or matched orders in at least four different stocks between various brokerage accounts that he controlled.  As alleged in the complaint, Leslie placed near-simultaneous matching limit orders to buy and sell the same security in two of the accounts that he controlled.  These matching limit orders were often placed at prices that were away from the existing market price.  Leslie was able to match up his orders at artificial prices by choosing relatively illiquid stocks and by trading those stocks in the less liquid after-hours market using the Instinet ECN.  Leslies trading operated as a fraud or deceit upon the market because the wash sales, along with the contrived prices at which they were traded, were reported to the market and thereby created a false appearance of market activity, and did not accurately reflect the supply and demand for the stocks he was trading., In the second scheme, the complaint alleges that Leslie engaged in an unlawful free-riding scheme, in which he induced his broker to unwittingly assume the risks of his trading by misrepresenting or concealing the material fact that he was financing purchases in his cash account with the anticipated proceeds from the sale of the very same securities.  In so doing, Leslie violated the federal securities laws (Regulation X) by willfully causing his broker to extend him credit in violation of the federal securities laws (Regulation T), because he obtained, received, and enjoyed the beneficial use of extensions of credit for the purpose of purchasing and carrying securities:  (1) without there being sufficient funds in his cash account and without his intending in good faith promptly to make full cash payment in his relevant cash account when payment was due; and (2) by placing sell orders for such securities prior to making payment for the purchase of said securities., Simultaneously with the filing of the complaint, Leslie consented, without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions complaint, to the entry of a final judgment that:  (i) permanently enjoins him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Section 7(f) of the Exchange Act and Regulation X promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board, and (ii) requires him to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $30,000., <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19000.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Arel of Nashua, New Hampshire, concerning false and misleading disclosures by Pennichuck Corporation during Arels tenure as chief executive officer and a director of the company.  The action, filed in federal district court in New Hampshire, charges Arel with violating or aiding and abetting violations of the antifraud, proxy statement, and reporting provisions of the federal securities laws in connection with Pennichucks materially false and misleading statements and omissions concerning the companys real estate operations in its periodic filings with the Commission.  In a related action instituted today, the Commission issued a settled cease-and-desist order against Pennichuck.  Without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, Arel consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the federal securities laws.  Arel also agreed to a permanent bar from serving as an officer or director of a public company., The Commissions complaint alleges that Arel caused Pennichucks false statement in a Commission filing that an executive officer of the company purchased a home from one of Pennichucks real estate joint ventures on the same terms that were available to any independent third party.  In fact, Arel, the Pennichuck officer referred to in the filing, obtained favorable terms on his purchase of a home from one of Pennichucks joint ventures that were worth approximately $70,000 and were not available to other purchasers.  Arel also aided and abetted Pennichucks failure to disclose in its Commission filings that Pennichucks real estate joint ventures repeatedly hired a company controlled by Arels son to perform landscaping work, and paid a total of approximately $800,000 to that company during the period 1998 to 2002., The complaint further alleges that, from 1998 through 2002, Arel aided and abetted Pennichucks failure to disclose all material information concerning its relationship with its main real estate joint venture partner.   According to the complaint, a single real estate developer was Pennichucks partner on six separate real estate joint ventures, and the same developer obtained multiple contracts and loans from Pennichuck.  Pennichucks Commission filings during this period failed to disclose that these joint ventures and other transactions were all with the same developer, and that this developer was the joint venture partner that provided Arel with favorable terms on his home purchase, and repeatedly hired Arels son for landscaping work., In its complaint, the Commission charged Arel with violating Sections 10(b), 13(b)(5), and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-2, and 14a-9 thereunder, and aiding and abetting Pennichucks violations of Sections 13(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 13a-1, 13a-13, and 12b-20 thereunder.  Arel has consented to entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the above laws.  Arel has also agreed to be permanently barred from serving as an officer or director of a publicly-traded company., In related proceedings based on the same conduct, the Commission today issued a settled cease-and-desist order against Pennichuck that prohibits Pennichuck from violating Sections 10(b), 13(a), and 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, and 14a-9 thereunder.

In 2000, Direct Capital Investments Ltd. (DCI), an Israeli corporate shell whose securities were trading on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, was being revived by its promoter, CEO and controlling shareholder, through a private placement of stock in the United States and Israel.

At the promoters request, Weiss submitted two false written confirmations to DCIs attorney claiming that $300,000 from four U.S. investors had been deposited into his escrow account for the purchase of DCI shares.  In fact, Weiss held no investor money in escrow at that time.  DCIs auditors accepted the false confirmations as authoritative and gave their approval to DCIs financial statements for the quarter ended June 30, 2000, which were published and filed with the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Weiss consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from aiding and abetting violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and requiring him to pay a civil penalty of $25,000., The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Israel Securities Authority in this matter., <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19002.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The charges stem from Markss role in a scheme to improperly boost the companys revenue by shipping products to warehouses, and his subsequent efforts to conceal the wrongdoing from the companys auditors and shareholders., Simultaneously with the filing of the complaint, Marks agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, consenting to orders permanently enjoining him from violations of the antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws  and requiring him to pay $45,777 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest.  Marks also consented to the entry of an order barring him from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and an order prohibiting him from practicing before the Commission as an accountant.  , According to the Commissions complaint, filed in the Western District of Washington, Marks pushed Cutters sales department to avert a revenue shortfall confronting the company in the closing days of the fiscal year ended April 30, 2000.  Cutter negotiated deals with three purported distributors under which Cutter would ship them a total of $5.7 million in products.  Cutter recognized revenue for the supposed sales, which constituted over 10% of the quarters revenue.  In reality, the distributors had no obligation or ability to pay for any of the goods unless and until Cutters sales force found actual customers to purchase the products.  The distributors essentially acted as warehouses, rendering revenue recognition for the shipments improper under generally accepted accounting principles (known as GAAP).  Marks signed Cutters annual Commission filings falsely announcing revenue of $54.6 million for the fourth quarter and $152.5 million for the fiscal year; because these amounts included $5.7 million in bogus revenue on the distributor sales, they overstated Cutters true quarterly and annual revenue by 12% and 4%, respectively.  , By early 2001, when Cutter sales personnel failed to deliver customers for the products, the distributors returned the products to the company.  The Commissions complaint alleges that Marks asked Cutters then-CFO to divide the product returns among multiple sales divisions on the companys financial records in order to conceal the magnitude of the returns from the Companys board of directors and independent auditors., The Commissions complaint charges Marks with securities fraud (Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder) and causing Cutter to report false financial information to the Commission (Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1).  The complaint also charges Marks with lying to accountants (Rule 13b2-2 under the Exchange Act), falsifying the companys books and records (Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder), and causing Cutters failure to maintain accurate books and records and internal controls (Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act).  , <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp19004.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>, <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19004.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

In its complaint, the Commission alleged that the defendants deceived investors, promising to generate investment returns through the development of real estate in Texas, Virginia and South Carolina.  In fact, according to the Commission, the defendants spent little, if any, of the investors money to develop land, and instead used it to make ponzi payments to investors, support their own extravagant lifestyles and funnel money to companies that they controlled.  Further, the complaint alleges that Fleder failed to disclose to investors a cease and desist order that the Commissioner of the Texas State Securities Board entered against him in October 2002 in response to a previous fraudulent offering.  On December 8th, U.S. District Judge Michael H. Schneider granted the Commissions motion for the appointment of a receiver to collect and preserve investors assets., In its action, the Commission charged the following individual defendants:, In its complaint, the Commission alleges that, beginning in May 2002, Brown, who was previously licensed as a securities broker, offered investors in the Tyler, Texas area the opportunity to invest in three purported real estate developments - Tyler Real Estate, Smith Mountain Lake, and Prairie Lake Estates (the Issuers) - each of which was created by Fleder, Ware and Sherman.  According to the complaint, Brown solicited investors using offering documents, which, among other things, falsely claimed that: investor monies would be used to develop tracts of real estate in South Carolina, Virginia and Texas; that investors would share in the profits realized from sale of the developed land; and that specific entities owned the land, and would convey the land to one of the Issuers.  The Commission further alleges that investors were told the investments were safe and were secured by the real estate being developed with their money.  Further, in each instance, the entity that allegedly owned the real estate, and was supposed to convey it to one of the Issuers, was controlled by Fleder, Sherman, and Ware, and did not own the real estate.  , According to the complaint, investor funds were used for virtually everything but the development of real estate - including making ponzi payments to investors and purchasing a house and a sailboat for Fleder.  In all, the complaint alleges, the Defendants raised $5,971,300 from investors in the Tyler, Texas area in connection with the three offerings, and, of this amount, more than $450,000 was used to make ponzi payments to investors, while at least $3.5 million was diverted to companies controlled by Fleder, Ware, Sherman and Brown.  The Commission charged those companies as relief defendants in its complaint., Finally, the complaint alleges that Fleder failed to disclose to investors that he was the subject of a cease and desist order issued by the Texas State Securities Board.  Specifically, in October 2002, Fleder agreed to the entry of a cease and desist order that found he had engaged in fraud in the offering of an investment called Sunshine Real Estate Development, Inc.  As an undertaking, Fleder agreed, and was ordered by the Texas State Securities Board, to disclose the cease and desist order to potential investors in all future offerings.  The cease and desist order was entered on October 23, 2002, after which Fleder, through Brown, solicited an additional $3,986,600 in investor funds without disclosing the existence of the order to the investors. , The Commission alleges in its complaint that the defendants violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In addition to seeking the appointment of a receiver, the Commission is seeking orders of permanent injunction, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties. The Commission is also seeking disgorgement against numerous entities as relief defendants, because they hold title to, or received proceeds from the sale of, assets allegedly acquired with investor funds., On December 13th, at the Commissions request, the Court conducted a hearing on the Commissions request for a preliminary injunction against the defendants.  Brown, Sherman and Ware consented, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, to the entry of the preliminary injunction, which the Court entered.  Since Fleder could not be located prior to the hearing, the Court continued the preliminary injunction hearing until February 7, 2005, to allow the Commission additional time to serve him with the papers in the case.  The Court further granted the Commissions motion to enter an order freezing Fleders personal assets and entered an agreed order modifying the receivership order and freezing certain assets belonging to Brown and entities he controls., The Commission gratefully acknowledges the assistance and cooperation of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Texas State Securities Board, and the California Department of Corporations., <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19005.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The judgment enjoins Chavez from violating the antifraud, registration, and penny stock disclosure provisions of the federal securities laws and permanently bars Chavez from participating in any penny stock offerings.  Chavez consented to entry of the final judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint.  , In its complaint, filed on April 16, 2004, the Commission alleged, among other things, that Chavez -- a registered broker at Preferred Securities Group -- engaged in various sales practice abuses in connection with the sale of the stock of Orex Gold Mines Corporation, allowed unregistered brokers to use his name while they solicited investments in Orex, made false and misleading statements about Orex, failed to disclose the actual amount of compensation he and others received from the transactions in Orex, and otherwise engaged in a variety of conduct which operated as a fraud and deceit on investors.  See Litigation Release No. 18669 (April 19, 2004).

Humphrey, who is currently in Chapter 13 bankruptcy, permanently enjoins him from future violations of the registration, antifraud and lying to auditors provisions of the federal securities laws, permanently bars him from acting as an officer or director of a public company, and orders him to pay a $50,000 civil penalty over two years with interest, subject to the approval of the bankruptcy court.  The final judgment against Richard E. Lee permanently enjoins him from future violations of the registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a $50,000 civil penalty over three years with interest. , In a prior ruling on February 20, 2003, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued default judgments against defendant Texas American Group, Inc., permanently enjoining it from violating the registration, antifraud and reporting provisions of the federal securities laws, and against defendant William Grosvenor, permanently enjoining him from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  , In its complaint, the Commission alleged that in 1995 and 1996, the defendants repeatedly made false statements about the companys assets and financial condition in filings with the Commission, at investor seminars, and in promotional materials and advertisements.  The complaint further alleged that during the same period, Texas American Group issued over 170 million unregistered shares of its common stock in sham offshore transactions., According to the complaint, the defendants claimed that Texas American Group owned the Amarilla Golf and Country Club, purportedly a $148 million resort in the Canary Islands, even though Texas American Group never actually owned Amarilla.  The complaint also alleged that Texas American Group falsely claimed to own various other assets, including internet lottery and casino games, a hotel development and management company, and a London pathology testing service.  The complaint further alleged that Texas American Group falsely claimed in national advertisements recommending the stock that it had $300 million in assets., In addition, as alleged in the complaint, the defendants issued over 170 million unregistered shares of Texas American Group stock to various offshore persons and entities, for the purported purpose of obtaining real estate and other assets.  Notwithstanding the offshore nature of the transactions, the complaint alleged that the issuance of this stock did not qualify for the Regulation S safe harbor from registration because Texas American Groups actions constituted a scheme to temporarily place the securities offshore in order to evade the registration requirements of the federal securities laws.  The complaint alleged that Texas American Groups scheme to evade the registration requirements of the federal securities laws was evidenced by the fact that:  (i) many, if not all, of the transactions for which Texas American Group issued stock were shams; (ii) in many cases the stock was issued to entities that appeared to be controlled by individuals associated with Texas American Group; and (iii) the stock flowed back into the United States almost immediately after the expiration of what was then the 40-day restricted period under Regulation S., The complaint alleged that by their conduct, all of the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), as set forth in Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint also alleged that Texas American Group, Humphrey and Grosvenor violated the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), as set forth in Section 17(a).  The complaint further alleged that Texas American Group, Humphrey and Lee violated the registration provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act.

Degenhart, who resides in Columbia, South Carolina, is an owner and the controlling person of UC Group and UC Properties.  UC Group is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Columbia, South Carolina.  UC Properties is a South Carolina limited liability company with its office in Columbia, South Carolina.  , The Complaint alleges that from November 1998 through May 2002, the defendants operated a Ponzi scheme through a series of twenty-one securities offerings  they made with the assistance of Southern Financial Group, Inc., a former South Carolina broker-dealer which served as underwriter for these offerings.  The face value of these offerings totaled approximately $100 million, but because many of the investments were rolled-over, the actual amount raised was approximately $29.8 million.   The Complaint alleges that the defendants knew, or were severely reckless in not knowing, but failed to disclose to investors, that the note offerings operated as a Ponzi scheme, because funds from new investors were required to pay the returns promised to earlier investors.  The Complaint further alleges that the defendants knew, or were severely reckless in not knowing, that the information presented to investors in connection with these offerings failed to disclose that the collateral was insufficient to secure the payment of the notes, and that the offering materials presented to investors falsely represented, among other things, the interest rates and amounts of UC Group and UC Properties outstanding obligations.    , The Complaint charges the defendants with violations of Sections 17(a)(1), 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Ullom, a relief defendant in a civil injunctive action filed by the Commission in April 2002, in connection with an alleged fraudulent scheme that raised at least $52 million from investors.  The Commission named Ullom as a relief defendant in its complaint.  The complaint alleges that Ullom received approximately $190,000 in investor funds to which he has no legitimate claim. , The Commission alleges in its complaint that individuals associated with an entity formerly known as Brite Business made fraudulent representations to investors, promising exorbitant returns through a high yield trading program.  According to the Commissions complaint, most of the Brite Business investor funds were maintained in a brokerage account at the Cranston, Rhode Island office of Raymond James Financial Services, Inc.  The complaint alleges that at all relevant times, Ullom was the branch office manager of Raymond Jamess Cranston office, and Dennis Herula was both a registered representative at the Cranston office of Raymond James and was the designated representative for the Brite Business account.  The complaint further alleges that, between 1999 and 2001, Herula and others associated with Brite Business misappropriated, transferred or lost approximately $20 million in investor funds.  According to the Commissions complaint, Ullom received $190,000 in Brite Business investor funds to which he was not entitled and for which he performed no services.  The Commission alleges that those funds should be returned to investors.  On July 17, 2002, the Court issued a Memorandum and Order freezing $190,000 of Ulloms assets, based on its finding that the Commission was likely to succeed in proving that Ullom has no legitimate claim to those funds., In the December 6, 2004 final judgment, the Honorable Mary M. Lisi ordered that Ullom is liable for disgorgement of $190,000, representing profits gained by Ullom, together with prejudgment interest in the amount of $49,309.75, for a total of $239,309.75.  Based on Ulloms sworn representations and other documents and information submitted to the Commission, however, the Court waived payment of all but $10,000 of the disgorgement and prejudgment interest.  According to the final judgment, the Courts determination to waive payment of all but $10,000 is contingent upon the accuracy and completeness of Ulloms financial statements., For further information, please see, Litigation Release No. 17633 (July 26, 2002) [$190,000 asset freeze as to Ullom]; Litigation Release No. 17514 (May 13, 2002) [asset freeze as to Ullom and preliminary injunction order and asset freeze as to certain defendants]; Litigation Release No. 17461 (April 5, 2002) [asset freeze as to Ullom and temporary restraining order and asset freeze as to certain defendants]., <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19010.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The Indictment also alleged that Lefebvre and Herula misappropriated several million dollars of those investor funds.  For his role in the scheme, Herula pled guilty and his guilty plea was accepted by U.S. District Court Judge Robert Blackburn on October 26, 2004.  Herula is scheduled to be sentenced on February 11, 2005.  After a bench trial, Judge Blackburn found Lefebvre guilty on all 15 counts of the Indictment.
