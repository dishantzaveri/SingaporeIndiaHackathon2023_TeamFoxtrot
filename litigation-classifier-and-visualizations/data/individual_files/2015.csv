23171,2015,[<h3>SEC Charges Massachusetts-Based Investment Advisers with Misappropriation of Money from an Investment Fund</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that it has filed charges against Massachusetts-based investment advisers, their principal, and others concerning the alleged misappropriation of at least $16 million belonging to an investment fund managed by some of the defendants., In a complaint filed today in federal court in Boston, the SEC charged as defendants:, The SECs complaint alleges that GL Capital Partners, LLC and its principal, Daniel Thibeault, were the investment advisers to a fund called the GL Beyond Income Fund, and that they misappropriated at least $16 million of the money that belonged to this fund.  According to the complaint, the GL Beyond Income Funds assets consisted primarily of individual variable rate consumer loans.  According to the complaint, Thibeault and other defendants solicited investments in the GL Beyond Income Fund by representing that investors money would be pooled and used to make or purchase consumer loans.  These consumer loans would then constitute assets of the GL Beyond Income Fund, and would provide a return to the investors when interest and principal payments were made on the loans.  The SEC alleges that from at least 2013 to the present, Thibeault and other defendants engaged in a scheme to create fictitious loans to divert investor money from the GL Beyond Income Fund, and to report these fake loans as assets of the GL Beyond Income Fund, thereby concealing the fact that Thibeault and the other defendants had misappropriated millions of dollars from the GL Beyond Income Fund. According to the SECs complaint, the scheme involved the fabrication of paperwork purporting to reflect numerous six-figure consumer loans using the names and personal information of individuals who were unaware that loans were being originated in their names.  The complaint further alleges that money from the GL Beyond Income Fund was disbursed to fund these fictitious loans, but the borrowed money did not go to the purported borrowers whose names appeared on the documentation.  Instead, it went to Thibeault and other defendants. The SEC alleges that Thibeault and other defendants misappropriated the money from these fake loans and used it for personal expenses and to run businesses other than the GL Beyond Income Fund, as well as to perpetuate the scheme by making interest payments on fake loans., The SEC alleges that the defendants violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and that Thibeault, GL Capital Partners, LLC, and GL Investment Services, LLC, also violated Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  The SEC seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against each of these defendants. , The SEC also charged two other parties as relief defendants based on their receipt of investor funds: GL Advisor Solutions, Inc., a corporation based in the Philippines that is controlled by Graduate Leverage, LLC and Thibeault; and Shawnet Thibeault, who is Daniel Thibeaults wife.  The SEC seeks disgorgement plus prejudgment interest from these relief defendants., In addition, the SEC has asked the court to consider certain preliminary relief against the parties, including, variously, temporary restraining orders, preliminary injunctions, asset freezes, an accounting of investor funds and all assets in their possession, a prohibition from soliciting or accepting additional investments, and other preliminary relief., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2015/comp23171.pdf>SEC Complaint</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2015/lr23171.htm</i><br/>]"
23172,2015,[<h3>Connecticut Investment Adviser Sentenced to 40 Months in Prison for Cherry-Picking Scheme</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that Noah L. Myers of Lyme, Connecticut and the former owner of MiddleCove Capital, LLC, an investment adviser formerly registered with the SEC, was sentenced to 40 months in prison followed by three years of supervised release following his conviction on one count of securities fraud.  On October, 20, 2014, Myers waived his right to indictment and pleaded guilty to one count of security fraud.  , On January 16, 2013, the SEC accepted offers of settlement from Myers and MiddleCove and instituted a cease-and-desist order against them.  The SEC order found that from approximately October 2008 to February 2011, Myers engaged in fraudulent trade allocation - cherry-picking - at MiddleCove.  Myers executed his cherry-picking scheme by unfairly allocating trades that had appreciated in value during the course of the day to his personal and business accounts and allocating trades that had depreciated in value during the day to the accounts of his advisory clients.  Myers did this by purchasing securities in an omnibus account and delaying allocation of the purchases until later in the day (and sometimes the next day), after he saw whether the securities appreciated in value.  When a security appreciated in value on the day of purchase, Myers would often sell the security and disproportionately allocate the purchase and the realized day-trading profit to his own accounts or to accounts benefiting himself or his family members.  In contrast, for securities that did not appreciate on the day of purchase, Myers would disproportionately allocate these purchases to his clients accounts and his clients would hold the position for more than one day.  Myers carried out his cherry-picking scheme with regard to several securities, but was most active with an inverse and leveraged exchange traded fund (ETF).  Myers finally ceased these practices in February 2011 when one of his employees threatened to contact the Commission.  , The SECs January 16, 2014 order found that Myers and MiddleCove willfully violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 207 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  The SEC order revoked the registration of MiddleCove as an investment adviser, barred Myers from the securities industry, and ordered Myers and Middlecove to pay disgorgement of $462,022, prejudgment interest of $26,096, and a civil money penalty of $300,000. ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2015/lr23172.htm</i><br/>]"

Milrud provided the traders with access to trading accounts and technology and instructed them on how to avoid regulatory scrutiny while engaging in layering strategies.  The SECs complaint also alleges that to distance himself from certain transactions, Milrud wired funds to an offshore bank account and had the money delivered to him in a suitcase filled with cash., In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the District of New Jersey announced criminal charges against Milrud., According to the SECs complaint, Milrud inserted numerous middlemen into his scheme in an effort to evade detection.  He had his traders use multiple computers, Internet protocol (IP) addresses, and user names.  Traders were provided at least two accounts, one to do what Milrud called the dirty work of layering and one to execute what he termed clean trades at prices affected by the dirty work of the first account.  Milrud instructed the traders to conduct layering on a wide variety of stocks while limiting the number of trades and the price changes, hoping to minimize attention to the manipulative trading., The SECs complaint charges Milrud with violating and aiding and abetting violations of anti-fraud provisions of federal securities laws and the SECs antifraud rule, and with liability for the conduct of the traders under his management.  The SEC is seeking a final judgment ordering Milrud to return his allegedly ill-gotten gains with interest plus penalties and permanently barring him from future violations., The SECs investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Simona Suh, Barry P. OConnell, A. Kristina Littman, and Lynn H. OConnor of the Market Abuse Unit and by Elzbieta Wraga of the New York Regional Office.

According to the complaint, Elm, formerly known as Frederic Elmaleh, his unregistered investment advisory firm, and three funds misled investors and used most of the money raised to make Ponzi-like payments to the investors.

Edmunds of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan entered a final judgment against defendant Marsha Bass, who was the chief operating officer and a part-owner of Detroit-based MayfieldGentry Realty Advisors, LLC.  The final judgment imposes on Bass a permanent injunction against future violations of certain antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and orders Bass to pay a civil penalty of $35,000., In its Complaint, the SEC alleged that Chauncey C. Mayfield, the founder, president, and CEO of MayfieldGentry, took nearly $3.1 million from the Police and Fire Retirement System of the City of Detroit without obtaining permission. He used it to purchase two strip malls in California and title them in the name of a MayfieldGentry affiliate.  Other executives at MayfieldGentry, including Bass, gradually became aware that Mayfield had siphoned money away from their biggest client.  Rather than come clean about the theft and risk losing the sizeable business the firm received from the pension fund, MayfieldGentry officials instead devised a plan to secretly repay the pension fund by cutting costs at the firm and selling the strip malls.  Their plan ultimately failed when MayfieldGentry could not raise enough capital to put the stolen amount back into the pension fund., Without admitting or denying the SECs allegations, Bass agreed to settle the case against her.  The final judgment permanently enjoins Bass from violating Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  In addition, the final judgment orders Bass to pay a civil penalty of $35,000.  Mayfield and MayfieldGentry previously settled the case against them.

On February 3, 2011, the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut appointed a receiver in the case to marshal the assets of a number of entities formerly owned or controlled by defendants Illarramendi, Highview Point Partners, and Michael Kenwood Capital Management.  The receiver has collected and distributed over $264 million to parties harmed by the defendants alleged wrongdoing.  The receiver plans to make additional distributions to harmed parties at a later time as additional funds become available. , Also, on August 3, 2011, the Commission issued an Order by consent barring Illarramendi from association with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, transfer agent, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization.  , The SEC acknowledges and appreciates the work of the U.S. Attorneys Office for the District of Connecticut and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  , For further information, see Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr21828.htm>21828</a> (January 28, 2011), No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr21875.htm>21875</a> (March 7, 2011); No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr21970.htm>21970</a> (May 16, 2011); Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr22015.htm>22015</a> (June 28, 2011), Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22245.htm> 22245</a> (January 31, 2012), Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr23122.htm>23122</a> (October 28, 2014). ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2015/lr23185.htm</i><br/>]"

Epstein of Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania with insider trading based on material nonpublic information that Epstein misappropriated from his son regarding Nationwide Mutual Insurance Companys merger with Harleysville Group, Inc.  On the morning of September 29, 2011, Nationwide and Harleysville, a Pennsylvania-based insurance provider, announced that Nationwide would acquire all publicly-traded shares of Harleysville for $60 per share.  At the end of trading on September 29, Harleysvilles stock price closed at $58.96, approximately 87% higher than the previous days close.  Epstein has agreed to settle the matter.  The settlement is pending final approval by the court., According to the SECs complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, Epsteins son learned about the impending Harleysville merger from his long-time girlfriend who was a legal assistant at a law firm that was advising Harleysville on the transaction.  On or before September 2, 2011, Epsteins son told him the information he learned from his girlfriend.  The complaint further alleges that, between September 2 and September 28, 2011, in breach of a duty of trust and confidence owed to his son, Epstein misappropriated the information that he received from his son and purchased 4,000 shares of Harleysville stock.  Epstein sold the shares after the public announcement of the acquisition, realizing ill-gotten gains of $113,503., The SECs complaint also alleges that Epstein tipped four people who each purchased 1,000 shares of Harleysville stock between September 21 and September 26, 2011.  All four tippees sold their shares on the day of the public announcement, realizing total ill-gotten gains of $123,511., Epstein has consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and requiring him to pay disgorgement of $237,014, the amount of his and his tippees ill-gotten gains, plus prejudgment interest of $21,599, and a civil penalty of $237,014.  , The SECs investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Kelly L.

According to the SECs complaint, filed yesterday in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, the Division of Enforcement had reached a tentative settlement with Cooper and Total Wealth in the previously-instituted administrative proceeding that required Cooper to escrow $150,000.  However, after learning that Cooper intended to pay this amount using funds misappropriated from clients, the Division terminated this settlement and the agency brought this emergency action in federal district court.  Coopers use of investor funds for his settlement with the SEC was never disclosed to or authorized by clients, and was a breach of Total Wealths and Coopers fiduciary duty to their clients.  According to the complaint, Cooper admitted to taking $150,000 in investor monies to fund his escrow settlement, although he claims that it was a loan., According to the complaint, Cooper has also admitted that he and Total Wealth have used investor monies to pay unspecified legal expenses related to the Division of Enforcements previously-instituted administrative proceeding as well as a private class action lawsuit filed in California state court.  The complaint alleges that Total Wealth has been charging investors unexplained, inflated administrative fees to pay those expenses and that Total Wealth and Cooper have failed to provide any accounting or meaningful explanation for the fees to investors, despite investors repeated requests.  , The Honorable Cynthia Bashant for the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California issued an order temporarily enjoining Cooper and Total Wealth from future violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and rule 206(4)-8 thereunder, as well as orders (1) freezing Coopers and Total Wealths assets; (2) appointing a temporary receiver; (3) prohibiting the destruction of documents, (4) expediting discovery; and (5) requiring accountings.  Cooper and Total Wealth stipulated to the entry of the court orders without admitting or denying the SECs allegations.  The SEC also seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions, return of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and financial penalties against Cooper and Total Wealth.  , A hearing on whether a preliminary injunction should be issued against the defendants and whether a permanent receiver should be appointed is scheduled for February 13, 2015., Investors may direct their inquiries to the temporary receiver, Kristen A.

23190,2015,"[<h3>SEC Charges Accountant with Violating Commission Suspension Order, Seeks Disgorgement of Compensation Received During Suspended Period, and Also Seeks Contempt for Non-Payment of Moneys Owed On Prior Judgment.</h3>]","[The Commission today announced that on February 5, 2015, it filed two applications in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York against David Rivard, a former certified public accountant.  The first is an application seeking to enforce a prior Commission order suspending Rivard from practicing accounting before the Commission. Securities and Exchange Commission v. David Rivard, 15 Misc 0221 (E.D.N.Y.). The second seeks an order holding Rivard in contempt of a money judgment entered against him in a prior action. SEC v. Rivard, No. 04 Civ. 1464 (E.D.N.Y. Apr. 8, 2004) (2004 Action).  Rivard is a resident of East Setauket, New York, and had previously been licensed as a certified public accountant by the State of New York from February 1992, until he surrendered his license, effective March 2008., The Commission alleged that Rivard violated an October 27, 2004 Commission Order issued under Rule 102(e)(3)(i) of the Commissions Rules of Practice (2004 Commission Order) that suspended Rivard from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant. In The Matter of David Rivard, CPA, Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rel. No. 50598, Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Rel. No. 2130, Administrative Proceeding File No. 3-11722 (October 27, 2004).  According to the application, from at least April 2009 to April 2014, Rivard violated the 2004 Commission Order.  Specifically, in April 2009, Rivard became a financial consultant to Verint Systems, Inc. (Verint), a reporting company under the Exchange Act, whose stock is publicly traded on the NASDAQ.  Verint engaged Rivard to help the company restate several years of financial statements.  In that capacity, Rivard participated in Verints financial reporting process by, among other things:  editing footnotes to financial statements; compiling data in support of those footnotes; reviewing sales contracts for proper categorization under applicable revenue recognition rules and principles; and preparing internal memoranda on certain accounting processes. , In the related application in the 2004 Action, the Commission also alleges that from at least April 2009, Rivard hid assets and income and failed to make payments due under a final judgment entered on consent on November 4, 2004 (2004 Final Judgment).  Judge I. Leo Glasser issued the 2004 Final Judgment in a civil injunctive action the Commission filed against Rivard, stemming from his role in the $1.4 billion securities and accounting fraud at Computer Associates.  In that action, the Commission alleged that Rivard, as the head of Sales Accounting and the companys revenue recognition expert, had allowed Computer Associates to record revenue prematurely from software contracts, backdated his signature on contracts, and lied to outside counsel and the companys auditor, and obstructed the companys internal investigation and the Commissions investigation.  Among other things, the 2004 Final Judgment ordered Rivard to pay a total of $158,700.96, comprised of disgorgement ($65,000), prejudgment interest ($18,700.96), and a civil penalty ($75,000).  The Commissions application alleges that despite being paid nearly one million dollars in income since April 2009, Rivard has not willingly made a single payment toward his indebtedness.  In fact, Rivard actively sought to evade paying his debt by setting up a company in his wifes name, to which he diverted his earnings from Verint during the period of his consultancy.  And Rivard made false or misleading statements about his financial and employment situation on sworn financial disclosure forms he submitted to the United States Department of Treasury in connection with his offers to compromise his indebtedness., The Commission seeks an order directing Rivard to comply with both the 2004 Commission Order and 2004 Final Judgment, requiring Rivard to disgorge moneys earned by violating the 2004 Commission order, imposing an asset freeze, directing Rivard to provide an accounting, and imposing a finding of civil contempt that Rivard can cure by demonstrating his satisfaction of the 2004 Final Judgment.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2015/lr23190.htm</i><br/>]"

Kostelecky, who was the companys only senior executive in the U.S., was among those responsible for Poseidons fraudulent reporting of approximately $100 million in revenues for contracts that were either non-existent or uncollectable.  Poseidons business in the U.S. was focused on renting above-ground fluid storage tanks for oil-and-gas hydraulic fracturing operations.  According to the SECs complaint filed in federal court in North Dakota, Kostelecky directed Poseidons accounting staff to record revenues for inadequately documented transactions and made false assurances to several members of Poseidons management in Canada that transactions with U.S. customers were valid and collectible.  Poseidon consequently issued three quarterly financial statements from January to November 2012 with materially inflated revenues while its stock was trading in the U.S. and Canada.  The magnitude of the overstatements was substantial, comprising approximately 64 to 72 percent of total revenues reported over the first three fiscal quarters of 2012., When Poseidon later announced publicly that it would need to restate its financials due to the inflated revenues, its stock price collapsed and the company eventually filed for bankruptcy.  Poseidon was based in Calgary and operated a subsidiary with offices in Denver and Dickinson, N.D., where Kostelecky still resides., Kostelecky agreed to settle the SECs charges by paying a $75,000 penalty and being barred from serving as an officer or director of a U.S. publicly-traded company.  Without admitting or denying the SECs allegations, Kostelecky consented to a final judgment enjoining him from violations of Sections 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.  The SECs action against Kostelecky was filed in conjunction with an enforcement proceeding by the Alberta Securities Commission against Poseidons senior management, including Kostelecky., The SECs investigation was conducted by Lee Robinson, Donna Walker, and Ian Karpel in the Denver Regional Office.

The scheme involved concealing the practice of routing trading orders to an offshore affiliate in order to take hidden mark-ups and mark-downs commonly referred to as trading profits or TP.  Lax authorized employees to temporarily suspend taking TP when a customer asked for a certain report that could reveal the hidden charges.  Lax also authorized the use of a proprietary trading algorithm to hide the charges from a customer in an otherwise transparent market.  To avoid potential questions from customers about why one particular trader was located offshore, Lax requested new business cards falsely indicating the trader was located in New York., In settling the SECs charges, Lax additionally agreed to be barred from the securities industry for at least five years., Lax consented to the entry of a judgment, subject to court approval, permanently enjoining him from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.

Although he raised $840,774 from investors, his fund never made real investments and never held more than $90,177 in assets as Malik continually withdrew the cash and spent it as his own.  Despite repeated demands from investors for the return of their money, Malik has flatly refused or delayed the bulk of their redemption requests.  He allegedly went so far as to create a fictitious fund employee who sent one investor an e-mail claiming that Malik had died., According to the SECs complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Malik has been continuing to solicit investors amid the redemption requests.

Glatfelter and K2 consented to the entry of a final judgment without admitting or denying the allegations against them.  The final judgment imposes on both Glatfelter and K2 a permanent injunction against future violations of antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws, and imposes on Glatfelter a bar from serving as an officer or director of a publicly-traded company.  Glatfelter was also held liable for disgorgement in the amount of $340,369.77, which the final judgment deemed was satisfied by an order of restitution entered against her in December 2014 following her criminal conviction of wire fraud for unrelated conduct., In its Complaint, filed September 19, 2011, the Commission alleged that beginning in 2007, Glatfelter, through her companies K2 and 211 Ventures, LLC, and with a co-defendant, Robert Rice, offered investments in fraudulent trading programs that purportedly involved bank guarantees and promised sky-high returns with guarantees against loss.  In fact, the Commission alleges that the bank guarantees were fictional and the trading programs non-existent.  According to the Commission, Glatfelter, through K2 and 211 and with Rice, defrauded investors of more than $1.8 million through that fraudulent scheme.  According to the Commissions complaint, in early 2009, Glatfelter became associated with another defendant also charged in the federal complaint, Robert Anderson, and began with him to offer fraudulent investments, also based in part on fictitious financial instruments, causing additional investor losses of at least $425,000.  The Commission also alleged that Glatfelter falsely assured investors that she was not a scam artist, by pointing to her position with a separate, publicly-traded company., The final judgment permanently enjoins Glatfelter and K2 from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933; Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act; and Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act.

The final judgment found that Glatfelter was liable for disgorgement to investors in the amount of $340,369.77, representing her personal ill-gotten gains.  The judgment deemed that Glatfelters disgorgement is satisfied by the order of restitution entered on December 18, 2014 in the criminal case, <i>United States v. Diane Glatfelter</i>, Criminal No. 12-cr-10247-MLW (D. Mass.).  In that case, a Massachusetts federal court entered a judgment against Glatfelter following her conviction of 4 counts of wire fraud, and sentenced Glatfelter to 30 months of imprisonment and to pay $1.575 million in restitution., The judgments against Glatfelter and K2 conclude the SECs litigation in this matter.  On March 13, 2013, the court entered final judgments by default against defendants 211 Ventures, LLC, and Robert S.

The U.S. Attorney <a href=http://www.justice.gov/usao/nys/pressreleases/February15/HartStevenInformationPR.php>announced the action</a> on February 17., The alleged criminal acts took place during an SEC investigation involving Hart, which culminated in a federal injunctive action in which Hart agreed to pay over $1.3 million to settle the SECs charges (<a href=/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22567.htm>Securities and Exchange Commission v.

In one scheme, Hart illegally matched 31 pre-market trades to benefit his own fund at the expense of one of his employers funds.  In the other scheme, Hart conducted insider trading in the securities of 19 issuers based on material non-public information he learned after being solicited to invest in the issuers confidentially-marketed securities offerings.  In addition, Hart signed two securities purchase agreements in which he falsely represented that he had not traded in the issuers securities prior to the public announcement of the offerings in which he had been confidentially solicited to invest.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Hart consented to the entry of judgment enjoining him from future violations of certain antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.

Cohen, the companys Chief Executive Officer, with securities fraud and other violations., Proteonomix and Cohen have agreed to settle the SECs charges and pay monetary amounts to be determined by the Court.  Cohen also has agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a publicly-traded company and from participating in any penny stock offering., According to the SECs complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, from approximately 2008 through 2012, Proteonomix and Cohen - who was the companys Chief Executive Officer, Chairman of its Board of Directors, and at times its Chief Financial Officer - committed multiple violations of the securities laws that enabled Cohen to pocket more than $600,000 for his own or his familys benefit.  The SEC alleges that Proteonomix and Cohen fraudulently issued and transferred millions of Proteonomix shares to corporate entities that were named after Cohens wife and children and nominally controlled by Cohens father-in-law.  In fact, however, Cohen secretly controlled brokerage and bank accounts in the names of these entities.  Cohen directed the issuance and transfer of Proteonomix shares to these entities, directed the subsequent sale of these shares into the open market, and directed that proceeds from these share sales be transferred to Cohen or spent for his direct benefit.  The SEC alleges that Proteonomix and Cohen falsely recorded these share issuances and transfers on the companys accounting books and records and failed to disclose in the companys SEC filings that the transactions with his father-in-laws entities were related party transactions.  The SEC also alleges that Cohen improperly directed his father-in-laws entities to transfer shares of Proteonomix stock in unregistered transactions to pay the companys debts, and that Cohen falsely certified the accuracy of Proteonomixs reports and financial statements that were filed with the SEC., In a parallel case, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the District of New Jersey today announced that Cohen has pleaded guilty to a criminal information.  , The SEC alleges that the defendants violated, among other provisions, the registration, antifraud, reporting, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the securities laws.

(CBI)., The SEC alleges that while serving as vice president of construction operations at Baton Rouge-based Shaw in the summer of 2012, Zeringue traded company securities based on confidential information he learned on the job about an impending acquisition by CBI.  In the weeks leading up to the public announcement of the merger, Zeringue purchased 125 shares of Shaw common stock and asked his brother-in-law, Jesse Roberts III, a dentist who lives in Ruston, Louisiana, to also purchase Shaw stock on his behalf.  Roberts reaped more than $765,000 through his illicit trading of call option contracts, and others made more than $154,000 based on his tips.  Roberts rewarded Zeringue for the original tip by giving him $30,000 in cash in November 2013.

The Settling Defendants consented to the entry of the final judgments without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions Complaint.  Defendant Mark A. Lefkowitz consented to the entry of a partial judgment, described below, which was entered by the Court on February 18, 2015., The Commissions Complaint, filed on May 30, 2012, alleged that seven defendants, including Unico, a penny stock company with headquarters in New Orleans, Louisiana, Lopez, Unicos former chief executive officer, and Peacock, Traveller, and Lefkowitz, three penny stock financiers, violated the federal securities laws by engaging or providing substantial assistance in the illegal unregistered distribution of billions of shares of penny stocks through the repeated misuse of the exemption from registration contained in Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act).  Section 3(a)(10) permits a public company to issue common stock to public investors other than pursuant to an effective registration statement to settle bona fide debts and other claims.

The SEC previously filed a civil enforcement action against Thibeault and others in January 2015.  The criminal indictment charges Thibeault with securities fraud, wire fraud, and aggravated identity theft.  The indictment also charges Thibeault with obstruction of justice, alleging that Thibeault sought to obstruct the SECs prior investigation by intentionally misleading SEC examiners., The allegations in the criminal indictment stem from the same misconduct underlying the SECs pending civil enforcement action against Thibeault and the associated entities concerning the alleged misappropriation of money from an investment fund.  In a complaint filed in federal court on January 9, 2015, the SEC named Thibeault as a defendant, along with the following entities, all believed to be controlled by Thibeault: Graduate Leverage, LLC; GL Capital Partners, LLC; GL Investment Services, LLC; and Taft Financial Services, LLC.  The SEC also charged two other parties as relief defendants based on their alleged receipt of investor funds: GL Advisor Solutions, Inc., a corporation based in the Philippines that is controlled by Graduate Leverage, LLC and Thibeault; and Shawnet Thibeault, who is Daniel Thibeaults wife., The SECs complaint alleges that GL Capital Partners, LLC and its principal, Daniel Thibeault, were the investment advisers to a fund called the GL Beyond Income Fund, and that they misappropriated money that belonged to this fund.  The GL Beyond Income Funds assets consisted primarily of individual variable rate consumer loans.  The SEC alleges that beginning in 2013 or earlier, Thibeault and the other defendants engaged in a scheme to divert investor money from the GL Beyond Income Fund by creating fake loans and reporting those fake loans as assets of the GL Beyond Income Fund, using the names and personal information of individuals who were unaware that loans were being originated.  The complaint further alleges that the GL Beyond Income Fund disbursed millions of dollars to fund these fictitious loans, but the borrowed money did not go to the purported borrowers whose names appeared on the documentation; instead, the SEC alleges, it was transferred to Thibeault and the other defendants who used the money for personal expenses and to run businesses other than the GL Beyond Income Fund, and used it to conceal and perpetuate the scheme by making interest payments on fake loans., Thibeault was originally charged by a criminal complaint and was arrested on December 11, 2014.  The SECs action against Thibeault and the other defendants, which is pending, seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus pre-judgment interest and penalties and permanent injunctions against further violations of the securities laws.

However, Wings Networks revenues actually came solely from selling memberships to investors, not from the sale of any products.  The company relied upon the recruitment of new members, and commissions were paid to earlier investors with money received from later investors.  The scheme raised at least $23.5 million from thousands of investors, including many in Brazilian and Dominican immigrant communities in Massachusetts., According to the SECs complaint, the scheme was orchestrated by Wings Network officers Sergio Henrique Tanaka of São Paulo, Brazil and Davie, Fla., Carlos Luis da Silveira Barbosa of Lisbon, Portugal, and Claudio de Oliveira Pereira Campos of Lisbon, Portugal.  After establishing a network of lead promoters, recruitment of new members surged through the use of social media such as Facebook and YouTube.  The promoters used Facebook to publicize business meetings that took place at hotels and other locations in Connecticut, California, Florida, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Texas, Georgia, and Utah.  The promoters also set up storefronts or training centers to lure investors into attending Wings Network presentations.  For example, one promoter used a storefront in downtown Philadelphia to make presentations to prospective investors, and another promoter rented office space in Pompano Beach, Fla., and spread the word in the local Latino community to attract prospective investors to come in and hear presentations., Several of the schemes promoters charged in the SECs complaint live in Marlborough, Mass., while others reside in Clinton, Mass., Sandy, Utah, Duluth, Ga., and Waco, Texas., The SECs complaint alleges that the Portuguese entities and principals Tanaka, Barbosa and Campos violated antifraud provisions Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10-b-5 thereunder, and registration provisions Section 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act, and that the promoter defendants violated Section 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act., The SECs investigation was conducted by Scott R.

Gray, Jr. and his firms Archipel Capital LLC and BIM Management LP solicited money for a fund created to invest in pre-IPO shares of Twitter Inc. that would be delivered to investors with profits once the company went public.  Gray raised nearly $5.3 million from investors, which was enough to purchase 230,000 pre-IPO Twitter shares under the terms of the funds offering documents.  However, only 80,000 shares were actually purchased before Twitter went public in November 2013.  Faced with increasing pressure from investors to deliver the promised shares and profits, Gray allegedly stalled and stole to make up the shortfall by tapping three other unrelated funds he managed to pay investors in the Twitter-related fund., According to the SECs complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, the majority of money used to make these Ponzi-like payments came from one investor who was told he had bought the entirety of a fund supposedly investing in $5 million worth of stock in Uber Technologies Inc.  In an attempt to show the investor that the fund had purchased Uber stock while his money actually was being used to pay other investors, Gray fabricated a document using the signature pages of an earlier legitimate stock purchase agreement for shares in a completely different company.  The alleged seller of the Uber shares never even owned Uber stock., The SECs complaint charges Gray and his firms with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8.  Gray is additionally charged with aiding and abetting Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 violations.  The SECs complaint seeks, in addition to preliminary relief and a temporary restraining order, permanent injunctions and disgorgement against all defendants and a financial penalty.  The SECs complaint names several relief defendants associated with Archipel Capital and BIM for the purposes of recovering proceeds they received from the fraud., The SECs investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Hane L. Kim, Victor Suthammanont, Steven G. Rawlings, Elizabeth Baier, George OKane, Debbie Chan, and Douglas Smith of the New York Regional Office.  The litigation will be led by Nancy A.

Williky of Colleyville, Texas perpetrated an illegal market manipulation and insider trading scheme in the stock of Imperial Petroleum, Inc., a public company based in Evansville, Ind., that is itself the subject of an earlier SEC lawsuit.  <i>SEC v. Imperial Petroleum, Inc., et al.</i> (S.D. Ind. No. 13-cv-1489)., The SEC alleges that between 2010 and early 2012, while working as an investor relations consultant for Imperial, Williky artificially pumped up the volume of Imperial stock through match and wash trades and engaged in fraudulent scalping by touting Imperial stock in mass email communications without disclosing that he was contemporaneously selling his own shares.  In the course of his fraud, he acquired more than 5 percent of Imperials shares and failed to disclose this ownership stake as required by the federal securities laws.  The SEC also alleges that while working for Imperial, Williky learned that the company was involved in significant fraudulent activity of its own, and he sold hundreds of thousands of Imperial shares based on that nonpublic information.  , The SECs complaint charges Williky with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 9(a)(1), 10(b) and 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 13d-1 thereunder.  It also seeks additional relief, including disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, a civil penalty, a permanent injunction against further violations of the securities laws, and to bar Williky from acting as an officer or director of a public company., Williky settled previous claims of securities fraud filed by the SEC in <i>SEC v. Williky, et al.</i> (N.D. Tex. No. 94-cv-2088) and in 1996 consented to the entry of an order barring him from association with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, investment company or municipal securities dealer.  , The SECs continuing investigation is being conducted by Scott J.

Among other things, the judgments order the Keoughs to pay a total of over $350,000 in disgorgement of ill-gotten gains., The Keoughs were defendants in a lawsuit brought by the Commission against Inofin, its former executives, and its sales agents alleging they illegally raised at least $110 million from hundreds of individual investors through the sale of unregistered Inofin notes and that Inofin and its executives lied about the companys financial performance and how Inofin was using its investors money.  The Commission alleged that Kevin Keough unlawfully earned commissions by promoting and selling Inofins unregistered securities and that he concealed his activities from his broker-dealer employers by directing Inofin pay his illegal commissions to his wife, Nancy, who was named as a relief defendant in the Commissions action for the purpose of recovering these funds from her. , The judgment against Kevin Keough was entered on February 20, 2015.  Kevin Keough consented to the entry of this judgment.  The court entered summary judgment against Nancy Keough on September 25, 2014.

(Optima), its CEO, Ahmad Fnaikher Alyasin (Alyasin), and, on March 3, 2015, against their lawyer Gary Eugene Patterson (Patterson)., The Commissions Order finds and its complaint alleges that, from at least September 2010 through at least March 2011, Alyasin and Optima engaged in a fraudulent scheme to obtain and sell purportedly unrestricted shares of China North East Petroleum Holdings Limited (CNEP) in unregistered transactions.  Their attorney, Patterson, issued two baseless Rule 144 legal opinions, allowing the restrictive legends to be improperly removed from the securities.  Alyasin and Optima loaned $3.5 million to the former Chief Executive Officer and President and current director of CNEP (Borrower).  The loan was secured by a pledge of 2.5 million shares of restricted CNEP control stock.  Under the provisions of the lending agreements, Alyasin and Optima agreed not to sell those restricted shares for the term of the loan., According to the Commissions Order and complaint, Alyasin and Optima, however, immediately took steps to remove the restrictive legends from the shares, allowing them to margin and then, in contravention of the federal securities laws and the stated terms of the lending agreements, to sell those securities into the open market.  Patterson caused this fraudulent scheme by issuing two baseless Rule 144 opinion letters incorrectly stating that the restrictive legends on the CNEP stock certificates could be removed based on the terms of the lending agreements.  , By engaging in the unregistered offer and sale of securities, the Commission alleges in its complaint that Alyasin, Optima, and Patterson each violated the registration requirements of Sections 5(a) and (c) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act).   In addition, Alyasin and Optima are alleged to have violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 by engaging in the fraudulent scheme, and Patterson caused Alyasins and Optimas violations of those antifraud provisions. , Without admitting or denying the findings, Patterson agreed to settle the SECs claims against him.  As part of his settlement with the Commission, Patterson, consented to the issuance of an order that requires him:  (1) to cease-and-desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; (2) to pay a civil penalty of $30,000.

China Infrastructure Investment Corp.s 2011 SEC Forms 10-K and 10-K/A and its first quarter 2012 SEC Form 10-Q contained material omissions and misrepresentations, including multiple forged signatures and certifications of CIICs former chief financial officer.  CIIC is a company incorporated in Nevada and engaged in the construction and operation of a toll road in China.  The company and its chief executive officer and corporate secretary filed the false reports with the SEC to conceal the fact that the companys CFO had resigned and that CIIC had no CFO at the time of the filings., The SECs complaint alleges that CIIC hired Li Lei as CFO on June 27, 2011.  On September 21, 2011, less than three month later, Lei resigned effective immediately.  Within the week following Leis resignation, the companys corporate secretary, Wang Feng, falsely reported that the Lei had decided to continue as CFO for a transition period.  CEO Li Xipeng and Feng knew at the time of Leis resignation that NASDAQ had decided to delist CIIC for failure to maintain a minimum share price of at least $1.00, and CIIC was appealing the delisting decision.  As the complaint further alleges, Feng believed that public disclosure of the resignation of the CFO could have a negative impact on CIICs share price, and thus forged Leis signatures on the filings as part of a scheme to create the false impression that CIIC continued to have a CFO.  In furtherance of the scheme, CIIC sent correspondence to NASDAQ and its auditors bearing Leis forged signature., The SECs complaint alleges that all three defendants violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; that CIIC violated Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder by filing materially false annual and quarterly reports, and that Xipeng is also liable for these violations as a control person of CIIC, and that Xipeng and Feng aided and abetted these violations; that Xipeng and Feng violated Rule 13b2-2 by making materially false statements to CIICs auditors in connection with required reports; and, that Xipeng violated Rule 13a-14 by falsely certifying that CIICs reports contained no untrue statements of material fact, and that Feng aided and abetted this violation.  The SECs complaint seeks permanent injunctions and civil money penalties against all three defendants and officer-and-director bars against Xipeng and Feng.  In related actions, the SEC issued an Order suspending trading in the securities of CIIC and issued an Order instituting proceedings to determine if the registration of CIICs securities should be suspended or revoked., The SECs investigation was conducted by Nancy Singer and Andrew Shirley under the supervision of Conway Dodge.

Given their positions within the company, they had access to databases, which contained confidential information about the credit card activity of millions of Capital Ones customers.

Kroning (Kroning), a promoter (someone paid by BioChemics to solicit investors); and a (iii) Craig Medoff, another promoter and, at one point, BioChemics interim director of Finance (Medoff, and, collectively, the Individual Defendants)., The Commissions Complaint alleged that from 2009 until mid-2012, BioChemics and the Individual Defendants raised at least $9,000,000 from approximately 70 investors by misrepresenting, among other things:  (a) that BioChemics had ongoing research and development collaborations with certain pharmaceutical companies when in fact the collaborations with those companies had either never begun or had ended;  (b) that BioChemics had two drugs currently under FDA review, when in fact it had no products under any type of FDA review; (c) the status and results of clinical trials for BioChemics drugs; and (d) that certain purported valuations of BioChemics at between $500 million and $2 billion were independent and reliable when they were not.  The Complaint also alleged that BioChemics and the Individual Defendants misrepresented Masizs background and use of investor proceeds--for example, they failed to disclose to investors that Masiz was the subject of a prior Commission securities fraud action that resulted in a final judgment against him in 2004, and that BioChemics investor funds were used to pay for Kroning and Masizs personal expenses., In February 2014, BioChemics agreed to a partial settlement with the Commission, consenting to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it, without admitting or denying the substantive allegations in the Complaint, from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act (Securities Act) of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act)  and Rule 10b-5 thereunder (the antifraud provisions), and leaving disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties to be decided by the Court.  On March 18, 2015, the Court entered this consented-to judgment permanently enjoining BioChemics from violating the antifraud provisions of the securities laws., The judgment entered on March 25, 2015, supplements the March 18, 2015 judgment, and requires BioChemics to disgorge $15,105,325 in ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $2,042,559, and pay a civil penalty of $750,000.  The civil penalty is a third tier penalty.  Under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, a third tier penalty is one where the violation involved fraud, deceit, manipulation, or deliberate or reckless disregard of a regulatory requirement, and such violation directly or indirectly resulted in substantial losses or created a significant risk of substantial losses to other persons. , The Commissions case remains pending against the Individual Defendants., For further information, please see <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22572.htm>Litigation Release Number 22572</a> (December 14, 2012) [filing of complaint]., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2015/comp23220.pdf>SEC Complaint</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2015/lr23220.htm</i><br/>]"

23222,2015,[<h3>SEC Charges New York-Based Brokerage Firm with Faulty Underwriting of Public Offering by China-Based Company</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against a New York-based brokerage firm responsible for underwriting a public offering despite obtaining a due diligence report indicating that the China-based companys offering materials contained false information., Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of global financial services firm Macquarie Group Limited, has agreed to settle the SECs charges by paying $15 million and separately covering the costs of setting up a Fair Fund to compensate investors who suffered losses after purchasing shares in the public offering by Puda Coal.  The SEC <a href=/News/PressRelease/Detail/PressRelease/1365171487402>previously charged the Puda Coal executives</a> behind the offering fraud at the company, which is no longer in business., The SEC also charged former Macquarie Capital managing director Aaron Black and former investment banker William Fang for failing to exercise appropriate care in their due diligence review.  Black agreed to pay $212,711 and Fang agreed to pay $35,000 to settle the charges., According to the SECs complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan, Macquarie Capital was the lead underwriter on a secondary public stock offering in 2010 by Puda Coal, which traded on the New York Stock Exchange at the time and purported to own a coal company in the Peopleâs Republic of China (PRC).  In the offering documents, Puda Coal falsely told investors that it held a 90-percent ownership stake in the Chinese coal company.  Macquarie Capital repeated those statements in its marketing materials for the offering despite obtaining a report from Kroll Associates showing that Puda Coal did not own any part of the coal company.  According to corporate registry filings in the PRC that Kroll accessed in its due diligence review, Puda Coals chairman had transferred ownership of the coal company to himself and then sold nearly half of his interest to the largest state-owned investment firm in the PRC.  As a result, Puda Coal no longer had any ownership stake or source of revenue., According to the SECs complaint, Kroll provided its report to Fang, who read it but failed to act on the information revealing that Puda Coal no longer owned the coal company.  Instead, Fang circulated the report to other members of the Puda Coal deal team and stated in the e-mail that no red flags were identified.  Black, who served as one of the transaction directors on the Puda Coal deal, received the report from Fang and read portions stating that Puda Coals chairman owned 50 percent of the coal company of which Puda Coal was claiming to own 90 percent.  Black likewise failed to act on the information.    , The SEC alleges that Macquarie Capital made a net profit of $4.17 million as lead underwriter on the Puda Coal offering, which sold stock to investors at a price of $12 per share.  When reports about Puda Coals false claim appeared on the Internet based on the same PRC filings that Kroll Associates accessed for its report, Puda Coals stock price plunged as low as pennies per share., The SECs complaint charges Macquarie Capital, Black, and Fang with violating Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933.  They agreed to settle the charges and accept permanent injunctions without admitting or denying the allegations.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  In addition to the monetary penalties, Black has agreed to be barred from supervisory positions in the securities industry and Fang has agreed to be barred from the securities industry, both for at least five years.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2015/lr23222.htm</i><br/>]"
23224,2015,[<h3>SEC Charges Day-Trader with Manipulating Stock Prices in Order to Obtain NASDAQ Listing for Company</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against a New Jersey-based day-trader who allegedly manipulated the securities of a microcap company in order to drive-up and maintain the companys stock price above the minimum price required for listing on a national exchange.  According to the SEC, apart from helping the company get listed on the exchange, the day-trader also profited from his scheme by more than $650,000., The SEC alleges that Michael J. Ling repeatedly engaged in marking-the-close trades and entered into matched trades in shares of Cyberdefender Corp., a now-defunct computer software company, in order to maintain the price of the microcap company at or above $4.00 per share over the period September 2009 through June 2010.  Maintaining a closing bid price at $4.00 per share or higher for 90 consecutive trading days prior to application was a prerequisite for listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market.  Marking-the-close is the practice of attempting to influence the closing price of a stock by executing orders at or near the close of the market.  A matched trade occurs when an order for the purchase (or sale) of a security is entered with the knowledge that a substantially similar order for the sale (or purchase) of the security has been or will be entered.    , According to the SECs complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, over a period of 144 trading days, Ling traded in Cyberdefender Corp. stock on 127 days, and on 54 of those 127 days, Ling traded in the final fifteen minutes of the trading day.  Further, Ling was the last trade of the day, and thus set the closing price, on 48 days.  Ling also engaged in 23 matched trades that were coordinated with an acquaintance.  , The Commission alleges that Ling profited from his scheme by more than $650,000, mainly by exercising warrants he received at bargain prices.  After the manipulation concluded, Cyberdefenders share price slowly fell, leaving unsuspecting shareholders who purchased at elevated prices with a loss., The SECs complaint alleges that Ling violated Sections 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5(a) and 10b-5(c) thereunder.  , The Commissions investigation has been conducted by William Finkel, and Thomas P.

In reality, StratoComm had no product and no revenue.  The SEC argued that StratoComm, Shearer and Danzig sold investors more than $4 million worth of StratoComm stock in unregistered transactions. , The judgment orders StratoComm and Shearer to pay a total of $4,968,709.68 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest.  It also orders Stratocomm to pay $100,000 as a civil penalty, and orders Shearer and Danzig to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $50,000 and $25,000, respectively.

The Order will remain in effect until a final disposition of the case., Judge Jesse M. Furman of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York imposed the Preliminary Injunction Order based on the SECs Complaint, Memorandum of Law in Support of Emergency Application, and supporting evidence submitted by the SEC., The Complaint and Emergency Application, filed March 11, 2015, allege that by the middle of 2011, David Craven and Alexander Craven, British citizens residing in Switzerland and England, respectively, gained control of over 87% of the shares of AEDC through nominee companies under their control. Between October 2011 and February 2012, the Cravens inflated AEDCs share price through deceptive wash trading and matched trading, and then secretly funded a $1.6 million promotional campaign for AEDC stock that featured a 16-page mailer sent to 1.2 million U.S. residents in April and May 2012. The Cravens deceptive conduct succeeded in driving up the price and volume in AEDC stock, which allowed the Cravens to dump over $4 million worth of artificially inflated AEDC stock on unsuspecting investors through numerous overseas trading accounts., The Cravens failed to offer any evidence or argument opposing the Preliminary Injunction Order.  As a result, and based on the evidence submitted by the SEC, the Court issued detailed Finding of Fact and Conclusions of Law, and concluded that the SEC had established a likelihood of success on the merits warranting entry of the Preliminary Injunction Order.

The final judgment follows a five-day trial in November 2014, in which the jury found that Kokesh had committed securities fraud by misappropriating and misusing tens of millions of dollars at two registered investment advisers he controlled. , From at least 1995 through July 2007, Kokesh controlled two registered investment-adviser firms, though which he controlled and provided investment advice to four business-development companies (BDCs).  Together, the BDCs had approximately 21,000 investors located throughout the United States.  Through his control over the investment advisers, Kokesh was able to misappropriate investor funds by causing the BDCs to pay illegal distributions, performance fees, bonuses, and expense reimbursements to the investment advisers, which Kokesh then used for his own benefit.  Kokesh tried to hide his scheme by directing the investment advisers to distribute misleading proxy statements to investors, and to have the BDCs file false reports with the Commission.  , After short deliberations, the jury found that Kokesh had violated Section 37 of the Investment Company Act of 1940.  The jury also found that Kokesh had aided and abetted violations of Sections 205, 206(1), and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and Sections 13(a) and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, and 14a-9 thereunder., The case was tried by David Reece, Jennifer Brandt, and Timothy McCole of the Commissions Fort Worth Regional Office.

Burtka and Eric C. Waidelich, the mayor and city administrator of Allen Park, Michigan.  Both judgments bar the defendants from participating in any municipal bond offerings and enjoin them from future violations of certain antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The judgment against Burtka also imposed a $10,000 civil penalty.  , The Commission’s Complaints, and an administrative proceeding the Commission filed against the City of Allen Park, arose from the city’s issuance of $31 million in general obligation bonds to support a movie studio project.  The Commission alleged that the city began planning the studio project in late 2008 in the hope it would bring much-needed economic development.  The state of Michigan had just enacted legislation that provided significant tax credits to film studios conducting business within the state.  The original plan detailed a $146 million facility with eight sound stages led by a Hollywood executive director, and the city planned to repay investors with $1.6 million in revenue from leases at the site.  The city issued bonds on November 12, 2009 and June 16, 2010 to raise funds to help develop the site., The Complaints alleged that, by the time the bonds were issued, the city’s plans to implement and pay for the studio project had deteriorated into merely building and operating an onsite vocational school.  However, none of these changes were reflected in the bond offering documents or other public statements.  Investors were left uninformed not only about the project’s deterioration, but also about the substantial impact it would have on the city’s ability to service the bond debt, which comprised approximately 10% of the city’s total budget.  Moreover, the city used outdated budget information in the bond offering documents that did not reflect the city’s budget deficit of at least $2 million for fiscal year 2010.  The studio project collapsed within months of the second bond issuance, and the state appointed an emergency manager in October 2010, citing the failed project as a primary factor in the city’s deteriorating economic condition., The Complaint against Waidelich alleged that, as city administrator, he reviewed and approved the offering documents provided to investors.  Those documents contained false and misleading statements about the scope and viability of the movie studio project as well as Allen Park’s overall financial condition and its ability to service the bond debt.  The Complaint against Burtka alleged that he was an active champion of the studio project and in a position to control the actions of the city and Waidelich with respect to the fraudulent bond issuances.  Based on this control, the Complaint charged Burtka with liability for violations committed by the city and by Waidelich.  This was the first time the Commission charged a municipal official under a federal statute that provides for “control person” liability., Burtka and Waidelich consented to the entry of the Commission’s proposed judgments against them.  On November 25, 2014, Judge Avern Cohn held a status conference and asked the Commission for briefing on specific developments that occurred between the issuance of the first and second bonds, the harm caused by the fraud, and whether additional parties should be held responsible.  On January 28, 2015, the Court entered the judgments, imposing a $10,000 civil penalty against Burtka and enjoining him from further violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and enjoining Waidelich from further violations of Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Court also barred Burtka and Waidelich from participating in any municipal bond offerings.  Judge Cohn also posted comments explaining the basis for his decisions. , For further information, see <a href=http://www.sec.gov/News/PressRelease/Detail/PressRelease/1370543373355>Press Release No. 2014-249</a> (November 6, 2014).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2015/lr23229.htm</i><br/>]"

The court entered asset freezes and other preliminary relief that same day against the defendants., According to the SECs complaint, former professional football player William D. Allen and his business partner Susan C. Daub claimed to make loans to professional athletes who were short of cash.  Allen and Daub told investors that they could profit by funding the loans and receiving interest of up to 18 percent paid by the athletes.  The complaint alleges that from July 2012 through February 2015, the defendants paid approximately $20 million to investors while receiving a little more than $13 million in loan repayments from athletes.  To fill the nearly $7 million gap, Allen and Daub used money from some investors to pay other investors, the hallmark of a Ponzi scheme., The SECs complaint alleges that Allen of Davie, Fla., and Daub, a financial professional formerly of Acton, Mass. who now lives in Coral Springs, Fla, advanced approximately $18 million to athletes while raising more than $31 million from investors.  Allen and Daub allegedly misled investors about the terms, circumstances, and even the existence of some of the loans and used some investor funds to pay personal expenses such as charges at casinos and nightclubs, or to fund other business ventures., The SECs complaint alleges that Allen, Daub, Florida-based Capital Financial Partners Enterprises LLC, and Boston-based Capital Financial Partners LLC and Capital Financial Holdings LLC violated federal anti-fraud laws and related SEC anti-fraud rules.

Life settlement investors purchase an interest in a life insurance policy and in exchange receive a share of the death benefit., The SECs complaint alleges that since 2004, Pacific West and Calhoun, a Beverly Hills, California, life insurance agent, have raised nearly $100 million from life settlement investors.  Since at least 2012, Pacific West and Calhoun are alleged to have defrauded investors by using proceeds from the sale of new life settlements to continue funding life settlement investments sold years earlier.  The complaint alleges that Pacific West and Calhoun did not disclose this practice to investors and undertook it to make life settlement investments appear successful when in fact, Pacific West had used up the primary reserves to pay premiums on those policies., According to the complaint, Pacific West and Calhoun also made false and misleading statements about the risks of investing in life settlements, including the risk of investors having to make increased premium payments as insured individuals lived longer than Pacific West and Calhoun anticipated.  Pacific West and Calhoun also are alleged to have misled investors about annual returns and to have falsely represented to investors that their investments had nothing to do with Pacific Wests efforts and fortunes., The complaint charges Pacific West and Calhoun with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Pacific West and Calhoun are also charged with the unregistered offer and sale of the life settlements in violation Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act and acting as unregistered brokers in violation of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act.  The SECs complaint further alleges that in the alternative, under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, Calhoun is liable as Pacific Wests control person for its alleged violations of Exchange Act Sections 10(b) and 15(a) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Also named as defendants are Ohio-based PWCG Trust, which held and serviced the insurance policies, and five sales agents of Pacific West, Brenda C.

Cannon of Lakewood, California, and his company Century Point, LLC, and Michael W. Dotta and Caleb A. Moody, both of Los Angeles.  PWCG Trust and the sales agents are all charged with the unregistered offer and sale of the life settlements in violation of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act; the sales agents were also charged with acting as unregistered brokers in violation of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act.  The complaint seeks permanent injunctions against all defendants and return of allegedly ill-gotten gains with interest and penalties against Pacific West, Calhoun, and the sales agents., Todd Brilliant, Dora Zaldivar, Kelly Bowers, and Robert Conrrad conducted the SECs investigation.

23234,2015,[<h3>Court Orders U.K. Man to Pay More Than $3 Million in U.S. Stock Manipulation Scheme</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that on April 7, 2015, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Jonathan E. Bryant of Crewe, Cheshire, United Kingdom which ordered Bryant to pay a total of $3,168,184.70 in a stock manipulation case filed by the Commission in 2012.  Bryant is the Chief Executive Officer of 8000, Inc., a now defunct Virginia-based company.  The Commission alleges that, in 2009 and 2010, Bryant directed a scheme to inflate 8000, Inc.s stock price while secretly controlling a majority of the companys shares and directing its operations.   , In addition to Bryant, the Commissions complaint, filed on September 27, 2012, also charged 8000, Inc., the companys former Chief Executive Officer, Thomas Kelly of Levittown, Pennsylvania, and the companys attorney, Carl N. Duncan of Bethesda, Maryland.  The complaint alleged that the defendants participated in a scheme to manipulate the trading volume and price of 8000 Inc.s common stock by disseminating false information about the company and simultaneously selling or facilitating the sale of its securities which were not supposed to be for sale to the general public.  According to the complaint, from November 2009 through October 2010, Bryant and Kelly disseminated financial reports and press releases falsely representing that 8000, Inc. had millions of dollars in capital financing and revenues when, in fact, the company had neither.  As 8000, Inc.s stock price rose based on the false information they were disseminating, Bryant profited by selling 56.8 million restricted shares of 8000, Inc. into the market.  Because the shares were restricted, they should not have been sold into the market at that time.  The complaint alleged that Duncan provided false legal opinions removing the trading restrictions on the stock, and that Kelly profited from the scheme by buying and selling the companys securities in the secondary market.  The complaint alleged that the defendants scheme increased the volume of trading in 8000, Inc. by 93% and the companys stock price from less than $0.01 per share to $0.42 per share between November 2009 and October 2010., Bryant consented to the entry of this final judgment.  The final judgment permanently enjoins Bryant from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The final judgment also orders Bryant to disgorge the $2,969,525 in profits that he realized from selling 8000, Inc.s restricted securities and to pay $198,659.70 in pre-judgment interest.  Additionally, the final judgment bars Bryant from acting as an officer or director of any issuer that has a class of securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act, and permanently bars him from participating in an offering of a penny stock.  , The final judgment against Bryant follows a judgment by consent that the court entered against Kelly on June 6, 2013, which permanently enjoins Kelly from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  It also permanently bars Kelly from acting as an officer or director of any issuer that has a class of securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act, and permanently bars him from participating in an offering of a penny stock.  On September 2, 2014,  after a hearing, the court ordered Kelly to pay $415,569 in profits that he realized from trading in 8000 Inc.s securities in the secondary market and to pay $46,697 in pre-judgment interest.   , Duncan agreed to settle the Commissions action at the time it was filed.  In December 2012, the court entered a final judgment against Duncan that permanently enjoins Duncan from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act, permanently enjoins him from participating in the preparation and issuance of certain opinion letters, bars him from participating in an offering of a penny stock, and ordered him to disgorge $15,570 in unlawful proceeds and to pay $524.98 in prejudgment interest and a $25,000 civil money penalty.  Duncan also consented to an administrative order issued pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3) of the Commissions Rules of Practice permanently suspending him from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an attorney.   , The Commissions motion for a default judgment against 8000, Inc. is pending., For additional information, see <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr23110.htm>Litigation Release No. 23110</a> (Oct. 10, 2014), <a href=/litigation/admin/2012/34-68501.pdf>Exchange Act Release No. 68501</a> (Dec. 20, 2012), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22495.htm>Litigation Release No. 22495</a> (Sept. 27, 2012), and <a href=/litigation/suspensions/2010/34-63242.pdf>Exchange Act Release No. 34-63242</a> (Nov. 4, 2010). ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2015/lr23234.htm</i><br/>]"

Nadel, his broker-dealer, Warren D. Nadel &amp; Co. (WDNC), and his investment advisory firm Registered Investment Advisors, LLC , while also denying the Defendants motion for summary judgment in its entirety.   The Securities and Exchange Commission filed its civil action on January 13, 2011, alleging that the Defendants fraudulently induced clients to invest tens of millions of dollars in a purported investment program in order to receive over $8 million in commissions and fees from 2007 through 2009. The Complaint alleged, among other things, that the Defendants inflated the amount of assets they held under management, and repeatedly misrepresented to clients and prospective clients that they were executing open-market transactions on their behalf with other broker-dealer, when in fact, in the vast majority of transactions (numbering in the thousands), the trades consisted of cross trades between advisory client accounts, controlled by Defendants, or in principal transactions with his own firm, at prices determined by Nadel himself.   , In its Order granting the Commissions motion, and denying Defendants motion in its entirety, the Court held that the Commission was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on its claims that Defendants violated (1) Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, by deliberately inflating  the amount of assets they had under management by a factor of 300% to 600%; (2) Section 206(3) of the Advisers Act, by conducting thousands of cross-trades among their clients, and principal transactions with client accounts, without notifying and obtaining consent from their clients in advance of each of those transactions that they were cross-trades or principal transactions; and (3) Rule 10b-10 of the Exchange Act, because Nadel and WDNC falsely disclosed to their clients the capacity under which WDNC was acting in their cross trades and principal transactions. , The Order directs Magistrate Judge Tomlinson to hold further proceedings to determine the appropriate relief., For further information, please see <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr21812.htm>Litigation Release 21812</a> (January 13, 2011).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2015/lr23235.htm</i><br/>]"

Janus Spectrum held itself out as a service provider that prepares cellular spectrum license applications on behalf of third parties.  The complaint alleges that although Alcorn and Maerki had third parties offer and sell securities based on the licenses to investors, they were personally involved in presentations to investors and Maerki appeared in misleading videos, including one called Money from Thin Air., The SEC alleges that investors in the scheme were promised potentially lucrative returns based on Janus Spectrum obtaining FCC licenses in the Expansion Band and Guard Band portions of the 800 megahertz (MHz) band.  Janus Spectrum and the fundraising entities claimed that investors could profit because Sprint and other major wireless carriers needed licenses in this spectrum.  In fact, the value of the licenses was small because this spectrum cannot support cellular systems and is generally used for push-to-talk services for local law enforcement or businesses like pizza delivery companies that require less bandwidth., The SECs complaint alleges that the scheme raised more than $12.4 million from investors from May 2012 to October 2014.  The fundraising entities funneled a significant percentage of the investors funds to Janus Spectrum, which used only a small portion to prepare applications for FCC licenses.  The complaint alleges that instead, all of the individuals in the scheme kept a significant portion of investor funds for personal use.  , Four individuals and 11 companies were named as fundraising entities:		, The SECs complaint alleges that all of the defendants violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In addition, the SECs complaint alleges that Janus Spectrum, Alcorn, Maerki, Bank, Jones, Johnson, and Chadwick violated Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act.

23237,2015,[<h3>SEC Announces Fraud Charges Against Former Accounting Executive At Japanese Subsidiary</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced fraud charges against the former controller of a suburban Chicago companys Japanese subsidiary who cost his company millions of dollars in trading losses and manipulated accounting records to avoid detection., The SEC alleges that Katsuichi Fusamae, who was a senior accounting officer at Molex Japan Co. Ltd., engaged in unauthorized equity trading in the companys brokerage accounts that resulted in losses of more than $110 million.  He concealed the massive trading losses by taking out unauthorized and undisclosed company loans with Japanese banks and brokerage firms, and he used loan proceeds to replenish account balances and engage in additional trading.  When Fusamaes long-running scheme came to light and the parent company Molex Incorporated restated its financial statements in 2010, it recognized $201.9 million in cumulative net losses, which included both trading losses and borrowing costs from the unauthorized loans.Fusamae agreed to settle the SECs charges by admitting wrongdoing and accepting a permanent bar from serving as an officer or director of a publicly-traded company.  Possible monetary sanctions will be determined by the court at a later date., Molex Incorporated, which is based in Lisle, Ill., and designs, manufactures, and sells electronic components, agreed to a cease-and-desist order finding that the company filed inaccurate financial statements as a result of Fusamaes fraud.  Molex also failed to maintain accurate books and records and sufficient internal accounting controls., Fusamae took advantage of internal control weaknesses at Molex to falsify records, monopolize the flow of information from banks and broker-dealers, and circumvent external and internal audit processes.  His actions left Molex shareholders in the dark about the companys true financial condition, said Timothy L. Warren, Associate Director of the SECs Chicago Regional Office., According to the SECs complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Fusamaes scheme began in the late 1980s when he began investing Molex Japans excess cash in riskier securities, including substantial trading of equities on margin. No one at Molex or Molex Japan authorized Fusamae to engage in the riskier trading, nor were they aware of his trading activities.  Shortly after Fusamae started his unauthorized trading, Molex Japan began suffering substantial losses on Fusamaes investments.  Fusamae falsified Molex accounting records and general ledger entries and intentionally utilized dormant general ledger accounts to conceal the unauthorized and undisclosed trading as well as the concealed borrowing.  At the peak of his scheme, Molex Japan had accumulated approximately $222 million in unauthorized loan obligations as a result of Fusamaes misconduct.  Molex consequently filed financial statements that failed to account for the trading losses and unauthorized loans. , The SECs complaint charges Fusamae with violating Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1.  Fusamae also is charged with aiding and abetting Molexs violations of Section 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13.  In addition to the officer-or-director bar, the settlement permanently enjoins Fusamae from future violations and provides the court with the authority to determine whether he obtained any ill-gotten gains and whether disgorgement is appropriate.  The settlement is subject to court approval., The SECs order against Molex finds that the company violated Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13.  Molex neither admits nor denies the findings., The SECs investigation was conducted by Jeffrey A. Shank and Kevin A. Wisniewski in the Chicago Regional Office.

The Commission alleged that Proteonomix and Cohen fraudulently issued and transferred millions of Proteonomix shares to corporate entities that were named after Cohens wife and children and nominally controlled by Cohens father-in-law. In fact, however, Cohen secretly controlled brokerage and bank accounts in the names of these entities. Cohen directed the issuance and transfer of Proteonomix shares to these entities, directed the subsequent sale of these shares into the open market, and directed that proceeds from these share sales be transferred to Cohen or spent for his direct benefit. The Commission alleged that Proteonomix and Cohen falsely recorded these share issuances and transfers on the companys accounting books and records and failed to disclose in the companys SEC filings that the transactions with his father-in-laws entities were related party transactions. The Commission also alleged that Cohen improperly directed his father-in-laws entities to transfer shares of Proteonomix stock in unregistered transactions to pay the companys debts, and that Cohen falsely certified the accuracy of Proteonomixs reports and financial statements that were filed with the SEC., In addition to the relief described above, the District Courts judgment against Cohen provides that Cohen shall pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty in an amount to be determined by the Court.  , On February 19, 2015, Cohen also pled guilty to a criminal charge related to some of the same conduct alleged in the Commissions Complaint.  <i>See United States v.

Two of Miekas salesmen, Robert William Myers, Jr. and Stephen Romo, were charged with acting as unregistered brokers., The SEC alleges that, between September 2010 and October 2011, Blankenship and Mieka raised $4.4 million from approximately 60 investors by selling interests in joint ventures that were to drill and complete two gas wells.  The SEC further alleges that, in truth, Blankenship immediately spent all of the offering proceeds on unrelated expenses and projects, leaving no money to drill one of the promised wells, or complete the other well.  Blankenship then misled investors about these facts through deceptive investor update newsletters and misleading public filings by Vadda, which he signed and certified., Romo and Myers participated in the scheme by marketing and selling the joint venture interests to the public - for which they together received approximately $190,000 in commissions - without being registered as broker-dealers, or associated with any SEC-registered broker-dealer., The complaint charges Blankenship and Mieka with violating Section 17(a) of the  Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Azzata of Boca Raton, Fla., CEO of eCareer Holdings, Inc., to sell unregistered stock shares in the company.  Investors were told their money would be used as working capital to develop eCareers online job staffing business, however about 30 percent of investor proceeds has been diverted to pay exorbitant fees to the brokers and sales agents.  These payments were mischaracterized in eCareers corporate filings as dispensed to third parties for consulting and advisory services rather than to the sales agents.  Company filings and offering materials also misrepresented that eCareer shares would be sold only to accredited investors when in reality stock has been pitched and sold to people not necessarily meeting that definition, including some non-accredited investors aged 85 to 98 years old., According to the SECs complaint unsealed on April 9, 2015, Esposito, DeVito, and Birks were subjects of <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20456.htm>a prior SEC enforcement action</a> that resulted in them being barred from acting as a broker or dealer or participating in any offering of a penny stock.  Therefore, they were prohibited from earning transaction-based compensation from the sale of eCareers stock.  In an attempt to circumvent these prohibitions and disguise the true nature of their compensation, Esposito, DeVito, and Birks and their companies entered into agreements typically signed by Azzata that miscategorized their compensation as advisory fees and finders fees., The SEC alleges that eCareer, Azzata, Esposito, DeVito, and Birks fraudulently raised more than $11 million in funds from more than 400 investors since August 2010.  In addition to approximately $3.5 million paid out of investor funds in the form of undisclosed exorbitant fees, Azzata diverted $650,000 to pay expenses related to his motorsports hobby as well as other family expenditures such as private school tuition for his children and shopping bills for his wife.  Corporate filings by eCareer falsely claimed that private offering funds were used for working capital purposes and concealed Azzatas misappropriation of investor proceeds., The SECs complaint charges eCareer, Azzata, Esposito, DeVito and Birks with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 as well as Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 along with Rule 10b-5.  The SECs complaint also charges eCareer Holdings, Inc. for its violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13, and the complaint charges Azzata for aiding and abetting and control person liability for eCareers violations among other violations.  The SEC seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and financial penalties among other relief for investors.  The court has granted the SECs request for a temporary restraining order and temporary asset freeze, and temporarily barred Azzata from serving as an officer or director of eCareer Holdings and voting the companys shares. , The SEC also suspended trading in shares of eCareer Holdings due to questions that have arisen about the accuracy and adequacy of publicly disseminated information in its filings.

Among other things, the Preliminary Injunction Order, pending a final disposition of the action, enjoins defendants from violating the securities laws provisions that the SEC alleges defendants violated, freezes defendants assets, orders defendants to provide verified written accountings, and prohibits the destruction, alteration, or concealment of documents., The SEC filed this as an emergency action against defendants on February 13, 2015.  The Court entered a temporary restraining order the same day.  The SECs complaint alleges that, since May 2011, Malik deceived investors when he sold them limited partnership interests in his hedge fund, variously known as Wall Street Creative Partners, Seven Sages Capital, LP, American Bridge Investment Group, LLC, and Wolf Hedge LLC.  Malik defrauded at least sixteen investors by falsely claiming to be operating a hedge fund open to high net worth, sophisticated investors that consistently yielded high positive rates of return.  Malik described his fund to investors as a privately held Global Investment Management firm dedicated to the individuals and institutions around the world.  Malik also claimed that his fund had approximately $100 million in assets under management., In fact, the complaint alleges, Malik conducted an egregious fraud.  Although he raised $840,774 from investors, his funds trading account, which has been closed since September 2013, never held more than $90,177 in assets.  Instead of legitimate investments, Malik misappropriated more than $700,000 of investor funds for his own use while simultaneously ignoring investors repeated requests to return their funds., The SECs complaint charges Malik and his fund with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5(b), and charges Malik with violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8.

Among other things, the Agreed Preliminary Injunction, pending a final disposition of the action, enjoins defendants from violating the securities laws that the SEC alleges defendants violated, freezes defendants assets, orders defendants to provide an accounting, and prohibits the destruction, alteration, or concealment of documents., On April 13, 2015, the SEC obtained a temporary restraining order and emergency asset freeze against Leroy Brown, Jr. and his firm, LB Stocks and Trades Advice LLC to halt this ongoing and fraudulent scheme.  The SECs complaint accuses Brown and LB Stocks and Trades Advice LLC of using false pretenses to solicit funds from investors, many of whom are active members of the U.S. military, including those serving at Fort Hood in Killeen, Texas.  Brown exploited relationships he made during his time in the military, as well as his own military experience, to gain investors trust.  He assured investors that he had years of experience in the securities markets, and that he and companies he controlled had all necessary licenses and registrations with the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).  Brown promised investors he would double or triple their money, and that his investments could not lose., According to the SEC, these claims were false.  Brown and his companies have no securities licenses, and Brown himself has no evident experience with investments., The SECs complaint charges Brown and LB Stocks and Trades Advice LLC with violating the antifraud and securities registration provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The SEC obtained a temporary restraining order and emergency asset freeze to halt the scheme., According to the SECs complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, in 2013 and 2014, Veros Partners, Inc., its president, Matthew D. Haab, and two associates, attorney Jeffrey B. Risinger and Tobin J. Senefeld, fraudulently raised at least $15 million from at least 80 investors, most of whom were Veros advisory clients. The investors were informed that their funds would be used to make short-term operating loans to farmers, but instead, significant portions of the loans were to cover the farmers unpaid debt on loans from prior offerings. According to the SECs complaint, Haab, Risinger and Senefeld used money from the two offerings to pay millions of dollars to investors in prior farm loan offerings and to pay themselves over $800,000 in undisclosed success and interest rate spread fees., In addition to Veros, Haab, Risinger, and Senefeld, the SEC charged Veros Farm Loan Holding LLC and FarmGrowCap LLC, the issuers of the offerings, and PinCap LLC.

The final judgment, to which Asti consented, permanently enjoins him from violating Sections 10(b) and 13b(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1, and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13, and it permanently bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  The judgment also requires Asti to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $90,952, and it forgoes imposition of a civil monetary penalty based on Astis early and substantial cooperation with the Commission staff and the criminal authorities, as well as his guilty plea and sentence to three years probation in a parallel criminal action brought by the United States Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York (USAO)., The Commission has now obtained final judgments against all thirteen former Symbol executives named as defendants in three separate actions filed in connection with the Symbol accounting fraud, including Symbols chief executive officer, chief financial officer, two chief accounting officers, the companys general counsel and its head of sales.

The Court also ordered Hixon Jr.s father and former girlfriend to disgorge the profits they obtained through his trading., Based on the entry of the injunction by the District Court, the Commission separately instituted a settled administrative proceeding against Hixon Jr. that permanently barred him from associating with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal advisor, transfer agent, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization, or from participating in any offering of a penny stock., According to the Commissions Complaint, filed in the District Court on February 20, 2014, Hixon Jr. used material nonpublic information he learned in the course of his work as an investment banker to make or cause trades in the brokerage accounts of his father, Frank P. Hixon, Sr., and former girlfriend, Destiny Robinson, from at least October 2011 to January 2013.  Hixon Jr. regularly logged into Robinsons brokerage account from work and elsewhere, and sometimes executed trades within minutes of learning confidential information.

Sheeran of the Bay County Circuit Court in Bay City, Michigan sentenced Joel Wilson to concurrent prison terms of 105 months to 20 years and 80 months to 10 years on six criminal counts.  The Court ordered that he pay $6.5 million in restitution, plus $11,000 to the Michigan Attorney Generals Office for the costs of extraditing him from Germany.  Wilson, 32, of Saginaw, Michigan, had been previously found guilty by a jury in March 2015 of fraudulent sale of securities, sale of unregistered securities, and continuing a criminal enterprise or racketeering and larceny., The criminal charges arose out of the same facts that were the subject of a civil enforcement action that the Commission filed against Wilson on November 15, 2012.  According to the Commissions complaint, Wilson defrauded investors who bought unregistered securities offered by his company, Diversified Group Partnership Management, LLC, and sold through his brokerage firm, W R Rice Financial Services, Inc.  Wilson raised approximately $6.7 million from approximately 120 investors who bought Diversified Groups securities from September 2009 through October 2012, and used the funds to finance his business of buying, renovating, and selling houses in and around Bay City, the Commission alleged., Although Wilson promised investors that he would invest their money in real estate that would yield returns of 9.9% per year, he used most of it to make unsecured loans to his real estate business, which did not generate enough income to repay the investors.  Wilson also diverted $582,000 of investor money to pay personal expenses, including $75,000 he used to buy W R Rice Financial, $46,780 he spent on travel, and $35,000 for his wifes business.  In addition, Wilson used investors money to pay for a sponsorship and tickets to the Saginaw Sting football team and to buy thousands of dollars worth of tickets to the Detroit Red Wings., The Commission also alleged that Wilson raised additional funds for his real estate business through stock sales for another of his companies, American Realty Funds Corporation, which traded on the OTC Bulletin Board under the symbol ANFDE at the time and is now no longer listed.  The complaint alleged that there were misrepresentations and omissions in some of the reports the company filed with the Commission, which Wilson signed, including that American Realty had failed to make loan payments and that its purportedly independent directors have undisclosed personal and business relationships with Wilson., The Commissions complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, charged Wilson and Diversified Group with violations of the registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and American Realty with violations of the antifraud and reporting provisions of the federal securities laws.  When Wilson failed to answer the Commissions complaint, the Court granted the Commissions motion for entry of a default judgment against him.  On July 26, 2013, the Court entered a Second Amended Final Judgment against Wilson, which permanently enjoined Wilson from future violations of the federal securities laws and ordered him to pay disgorgement of $6,403,580, prejudgment interest of $290,319, and a civil penalty of $7,500 for a total of $6,701,399.  The Commission also entered a final administrative order on October 17, 2014, barring Wilson from associating with a broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, transfer agent, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization, and from participating in an offering of penny stock., For additional information, see <a href=http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22537.htm>Litigation Release No. 22537</a> (November 20, 2012).,  <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2015/lr23250.htm</i>, <br/>]"

As alleged in the complaint, Koester and Pameijer, a career insurance salesman, agreed to a profit sharing arrangement for clients Pameijer brought to Koester and his entity, Rykoworks Capital Group, LLC. The complaint alleges that, starting in 2010, Pameijer and his daughter, Sayer, began soliciting clients to invest with Rykoworks through promissory notes which purported to guarantee investor principal while offering risk free returns from forex trading. As alleged in the complaint, Pameijer and Sayer misappropriated the majority of funds they raised from investors for personal use, and the remaining funds they transferred to Koester, Koester depleted through trading losses and misappropriation., To resolve the remaining monetary claims, Pameijer consented to a final judgment ordering disgorgement of $1,226,703 and prejudgment interest of $217,826, with the disgorgement obligation offset, and no civil penalty imposed, in light of Pameijers sentence in a related state criminal case.

Gavin and Daniel J. Hogan have raised over $62 million from hundreds of investors in various states in the U.S. and foreign countries for interests in one of four man camp projects.  According to the SECs complaint filed yesterday in U.S. District Court for the District of North Dakota, investors bought units in NDDs projects motivated by the Defendants promises of exceptionally high annual returns, up to 42%, and that NDD would jointly manage all of the units as a fully-developed short-term housing facility with amenities typically found in a hotel.  The SEC also alleges that the Defendants offered investors the option of receiving a guaranteed annual return of up to 25% of the purchase price of their unit without regard to actual rental income.  As further inducement to invest, Defendants also promised investors that the various projects would be operational in a very short time frame, often within months.  In reality, the SEC alleges, despite the substantial amount of funds raised by the Defendants since May 2012, at the present time, none of the projects are fully operational and one of the projects offered does not even have governmental approval for construction to begin. , According to the SECs complaint, Defendants directly or indirectly made material misrepresentations and omissions regarding the use of investor funds, the payment of commissions, and the return on the investment.  Among other things, the SEC alleges that NDDs first project was delayed and unprofitable.  The SEC alleges that, despite the lack of profits, the Defendants made Ponzi-style payments to certain early investors by paying their guaranteed returns using funds provided by later investors.  The SEC also alleges that instead of developing the projects as promised, the Defendants have misappropriated over $25 million of investor funds to pay undisclosed commissions to sales agents, make payments to Gavin and Hogan, make investments in unrelated Bakken area projects for Gavins and Hogans personal benefit, and to make the Ponzi-like payments. , On May 5, 2015, the Honorable Daniel L.

Merchant had resigned his CEO and CFO positions with no successors named, and the companys outside auditor also has resigned - none of which had been disclosed in a Form 8-K. , In an earlier order dated November 25, 2013, Merchant was permanently enjoined from violations of Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 13a-14 and 13b2-1 thereunder; from aiding and abetting, and being liable as a control person under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act for, Southern USAs violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 10b-5, 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13, and 13a-15 thereunder.  Merchant consented to the entry of that order without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions complaint.  In addition to finding disgorgement, prejudgment interest and civil penalties appropriate, the Court also imposed an officer and director bar, and a penny stock bar against Merchant., In an order dated April 20, 2015, the Court granted the Commissions motions for summary judgment against Merchant and for default judgment against Southern USA.  In a separate order the same day, Southern USA was permanently enjoined from Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13 and 13a-15 thereunder.   In addition the court found disgorgement, prejudgment interest and civil penalties appropriate, but concluded there was no evidence of disgorgement against either defendant.   Judge Jones made preliminary findings that Merchants conduct involved a third tier civil penalty.  Two weeks later, in the final judgment, the Court imputed Merchants scienter to Southern USA and concluded that the corporate defendant also engaged in fraud and deceit, which caused a significant risk of substantial losses to other persons., See also: L.R. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2013/lr22878.htm>22878</a> (November 25, 2013), <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2015/comp23253.pdf>SEC Complaint</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2015/lr23253.htm</i><br/>]"

Gibson, former Chief Operating Officer and President Robert V.A. Harra, former Controller Kevyn N. Rakowski, and former Chief Credit Officer William B. North.  The complaint alleges that Gibson, Rakowski, and North omitted approximately $351 million of matured loans 90 days or more past due from Wilmington Trust’s disclosures in the third quarter of 2009, so that the bank disclosed only $38.7 million of such loans.  The four former officials allegedly omitted approximately $330.2 million of these loans in the fourth quarter of 2009, so that the bank’s annual report disclosed just $30.6 million in matured loans 90 days or more past due.  , In addition, the complaint alleges that Gibson, Rakowski and North schemed to materially misreport this category of past due loans in the first half of 2010.  Gibson also is alleged to have materially understated the amount of non-accruing loans in Wilmington Trust’s portfolio in the third quarter of 2009 and the bank’s loan loss provision and allowance for loan losses in the fourth quarter of 2009.  Gibson, Harra, Rakowski and North are each charged with violating or aiding and abetting violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  Each also is charged with aiding and abetting violations of the reporting, recordkeeping, and internal controls provision of the federal securities laws.  The SEC is seeking to have all four return allegedly ill-gotten gains with interest and pay civil monetary penalties, and to have Gibson and Harra barred from serving as corporate officers or directors., In a related action, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Delaware today announced criminal charges against Rakowski and North., The SEC’s investigation has been conducted by Margaret Spillane, James Addison, and Thomas P.

The complaint alleges that Churchville and ClearPath used a variety of deceptive acts and misleading accounting tricks to conceal their fraud from auditors, accountants, fund administrators, and their own staff., The SECs complaint alleges that, when many of ClearPaths investors requested distributions of their investments in September 2013, Churchville prolonged the scheme by lying to investors about the status, worth, and disposition of those investments., ClearPath and Churchville allegedly misappropriated and misused investors cash and assets through a years-long scheme that lulled investors into believing that their assets were safe, according to the complaint filed today., The SECs complaint charges ClearPath and Churchville with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers Act) and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.  The complaint further charges ClearPath with violating Rules 206(4)-2 and 206(4)-7 under the Advisers Act, and charges Churchville with aiding and abetting ClearPaths violations of those rules.

Novinger and Brady J. Speers, who live in Mansfield, Texas, and host a financial radio show.  The SECs complaint alleges that from 2012 to 2014, they sold approximately $4.3 million in life settlement interests to 26 investors. , Interests in life settlements are investments based on potential payouts on insurance policies held by others.  Typically they can only be sold to investors who meet certain income or net worth levels.  The SEC alleges that, to get around those limits, Novinger and Speers provided prospective investors with a net worth calculator that factored in future income to artificially inflate client assets.  For example, according to the SEC complaint, one couples non-homestead assets falsely ballooned from $263,000 to nearly $1.5 million when the calculator improperly included 20 years worth of Social Security and retirement payments the couple anticipates receiving in the future., In addition to the charges against Novers Financial and the two principals, the SEC charged ICAN Investment Group LLC and Speers Financial Group LLC for acting as unregistered broker-dealers., The complaint charges Novinger, Speers, and Novers Financial with violating Sections 5(a) and 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

ITT formed both of these student loan programs, known as the PEAKS and CUSO programs, to provide off-balance sheet loans for ITTs students following the collapse of the private student loan market.  To induce others to finance these risky loans, ITT provided a guarantee that limited any risk of loss from the student loan pools., According to the SECs complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, the underlying loan pools had performed so abysmally by 2012 that ITTs guarantee obligations were triggered and began to balloon.  Rather than disclosing to its investors that it projected paying hundreds of millions of dollars on its guarantees, ITT and its management took a variety of actions to create the appearance that ITTs exposure to these programs was much more limited.  Over the course of 2014 as ITT began to disclose the consequences of its practices and the magnitude of payments ITT would need to make on the guarantees, ITTs stock price declined dramatically, falling by approximately two-thirds., The SECs complaint alleges that ITT, Modany, and Fitzpatrick engaged in a fraudulent scheme and made a number of false and misleading statements to hide the magnitude of ITTs guarantee obligations for the PEAKS and CUSO programs.  For example, ITT regularly made payments on delinquent student borrower accounts to temporarily keep PEAKS loans from defaulting and triggering tens of millions of dollars of guarantee payments, without disclosing this practice.  ITT also netted its anticipated guarantee payments against recoveries it projected for many years later, without disclosing this approach or its near-term cash impact.  ITT further failed to consolidate the PEAKS program in ITTs financial statements despite ITTs control over the economic performance of the program.  ITT and the executives also misled and withheld significant information from ITTs auditor., The SECs complaint alleges that this conduct violated the antifraud, reporting, books and records, internal controls, lying to auditors and false certification provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SECs complaint also alleges that Modany and Fitzpatrick failed to comply with Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley).  The SEC seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and civil monetary penalties.  With respect to Modany and Fitzpatrick, the SEC also seeks officer-and-director bars and reimbursement pursuant to Section 304 of Sarbanes-Oxley., The SECs investigation has been conducted by Zachary Carlyle, Jason Casey, and Anne Romero with assistance from Judy Bizu.  The case has been supervised by Laura Metcalfe, Reid Muoio, and Michael Osnato of the Complex Financial Instruments Unit.

The complaint alleges that Ahmed transferred approximately $27.5 million in illegal profits to accounts under his control at the expense of investors in the Oak funds, including public pension investors., According to the SECs complaint, Ahmed had Oak funds pay $20 million for a $2 million stake in an Asian e-commerce joint venture in December 2014, pocketing the $18 million difference for himself.  It alleges that in another investment in August 2014, an Oak fund overpaid for shares in a China-based e-commerce company, allowing Ahmed to pocket $2 million.  In a third transaction, the complaint alleges that in 2013, Ahmed advised an Oak fund to invest $25 million in a U.S.-based e-commerce company without disclosing his interest in I-Cubed Domains LLC, which had a significant stake in the same company.  The following year, at Ahmeds advice, the Oak fund paid $7.5 million to I-Cubed to buy shares in the company that I-Cubed had acquired for $2 million.  The complaint alleges that Ahmed again failed to disclose his ties to I-Cubed, violating his duty to act in the best interest of the Oak fund investors and avoid self-dealing., The SECs complaint charges Ahmed with violating federal antifraud laws and related SEC antifraud rules.  The SEC is seeking a preliminary injunction to continue the freeze of Ahmeds assets and seeks to have Ahmed return his allegedly ill-gotten gains with interest and pay civil monetary penalties.  The complaint names two firms allegedly controlled by Ahmed, Iftikar Ali Ahmed Sole Prop and I-Cubed Domains LLC, as relief defendants for the purpose of recovering allegedly ill-gotten gains., The emergency court order obtained by the SEC freezes up to $55,089,446 million of Ahmeds assets, prohibits him from destroying evidence and orders expedited discovery., The SECs investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Jay A.

The SEC filed its complaint under seal on May 11, 2015, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland., <a href=http://investor.gov/investing-basics/avoiding-fraud/types-fraud/advance-fee-fraud>Advance fee frauds</a> solicit investors to make upfront payments before purported deals can go through, and perpetrators fool investors with official-sounding terminology to add an air of legitimacy to the investment programs., According to the SECs complaint, which the Court unsealed yesterday at the SECs request, Thomas G. Ellis and Yasuo Oda, through their company, North Star Finance LLC, and Michael K. Martin and Sharon L. Salinas, through their companies, Capital Source Lending LLC and Capital Source Funding LLC, have collected approximately $5 million from defrauded investors since at least January 2013.  The SEC alleges that North Star and the Capital Source entities promised investors that, for an advance fee that would be safely held in escrow accounts and used only for transactional expenses, they could monetize bank guarantees to generate millions of dollars.  North Star and Capital Source promised that this windfall could then be made available to investors in the form of project funding on highly favorable terms.  The SEC alleges that the bank guarantees that served as the backbone of North Stars and Capital Sources programs were a fiction, and underscores that several government agencies have warned investors away from transactions involving such instruments.  Even if these bank guarantees did exist, the SEC alleges, they could never be monetized as there is no formal or informal market on which they might be bought or sold., The SEC alleges that, with the assistance of Thomas H. Vetter, a trusted member of the NAHB community, Ellis first pitched North Stars scheme at an annual meeting of the NAHB in February 2014, managing to convince multiple building concerns to sign up.  Thereafter, Ellis, Vetter, and Martin allegedly repeatedly lied to investors about the existence of the supposed bank instrument investments and the use of investor funds.  Ellis and Oda sent several emails in which they pressured investors to sign phony documents, on the false pretenses that the investment program was both legitimate and available for only a limited time.  Martin falsely told one of these investors that he had personally been involved in seven other transactions in 2014 in which he had secured and monetized bank guarantees.  Salinas participated in and aided and abetted the scheme by establishing bank accounts for Capital Source Funding, by falsely representing herself to be an escrow officer, and by signing at least one document that fraudulently purported to be an escrow agreement for the safekeeping of investor funds., The SEC further alleges that, more than a year after signing up their first investors from the NAHB, the defendants have yet to produce any funding.  During this time, Martin, Ellis, Oda, and Vetter have lulled investors by giving them a string of phony updates promising funding was just around the corner; blaming delays on fictitious bank processes; and admonishing those investors who asked detailed questions about the status of their investments.  Instead of using investor funds to secure the promised bank instruments and subsequent funding, the defendants converted the funds for their own personal use or unlawfully transferred the funds to third parties., The Honorable George J. Hazel for the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland granted the SECs request for a temporary restraining order to prevent the defendants from engaging in their bank instrument investment programs.  The Court also granted the SECs request for an order freezing the assets of all the defendants, requiring accountings, prohibiting the destruction or alteration of documents, and allowing for expedited discovery.  A court hearing has been scheduled for May 26, 2015, on the SECs motion for a preliminary injunction., Separately, the Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested Martin on May 11, 2015, on wire fraud charges., The Commissions complaint alleges violations of the antifraud, and securities and broker-dealer registration provisions of the federal securities laws.  Specifically, it alleges that North Star, Ellis, Oda, Martin, Capital Source Funding and Capital Source Lending violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and, except as to Salinas, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.  The complaint further alleges that North Star, Ellis, Oda, Vetter, Martin, and Salinas aided and abetted violations of Securities Act Section 17(a), Exchange Act Section 10(b), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and Ellis, Oda, Martin, and Salinas aided and abetted violations of Securities Act Sections 5(a) and 5(c).  Finally, the complaint alleges that Ellis, Oda, Vetter, and Martin violated Exchange Act 15(a).

23263,2015,[<h3>Massachusetts Resident Pleads Guilty to Criminal Contempt for Violating Court Orders Obtained by the SEC</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that, on May 14, 2015, Steven Palladino pled guilty to 25 counts of criminal contempt charged by the United States Attorneys Office for the District of Massachusetts based on his repeated violations of court orders obtained by the Commission in its civil action filed in 2013 against Palladino and his Massachusetts-based company, Viking Financial Group, Inc. (collectively, Defendants).  The Commissions action charged that Defendants were operating a fraudulent Ponzi scheme.  The court in the Commissions civil action entered orders with certain preliminary relief beginning in April 2013, including an asset freeze against Defendants.  The U.S. Attorney alleged in April 2014 that Palladino knowingly and willfully disobeyed court orders in the Commissions action that froze all of Defendants assets and required that Defendants deposit all funds in their possession into a court-ordered escrow account.  Based on his guilty plea to these contempt charges, Palladino, who is currently serving a prison sentence based on convictions in state court for the same conduct alleged by the Commission in its case, could face additional incarceration.  , On April 30, 2013, the Commission filed an emergency enforcement action against Defendants in federal district court in Massachusetts.  In its complaint, the Commission alleged that, beginning in April 2011, Defendants misrepresented to at least 33 investors that their funds would be used to conduct the business of Viking - which was purportedly to make short-term, high interest loans to those unable to obtain traditional financing.  The Commission also alleged that Palladino misrepresented to investors that the loans made by Viking would be secured by first interest liens on non-primary residence properties and that investors would be repaid their principal, plus monthly interest at rates generally ranging from 7-15%, from payments that borrowers made on the loans.  The complaint alleged that Defendants actually made very few real loans to borrowers, and instead used investors funds largely to pay earlier investors and to fund the Palladino familys lavish lifestyle., When the Commission first filed its action, it asked the court for certain preliminary relief, including a temporary restraining order and asset freeze.  On April 30, 2013, the court issued a temporary restraining order, which included the asset freeze, and set the matter for further hearing on May 3, 2013.  On May 3, 2013, the court issued a revised restraining order, which included the same asset freeze.  On May 15, 2013, the court ordered that Defendants deposit all funds in their possession into an escrow account.  The asset freeze and escrow order have remained in effect at all times since April 30, 2013 and May 15, 2013, respectively., Between September 2013 and March 2014, the Commission filed four motions for civil contempt against Palladino.  The Commissions first motion for contempt, filed on September 4, 2013, alleged that Palladino violated the asset freeze by transferring three vehicles that he owned (solely or jointly with his wife) into his wifes name and using the vehicles as collateral for new loans - effectively cashing out the equity in these vehicles.  The motion also alleged that Palladino violated the escrow order by failing to deposit the funds he received from this cashing-out process into the escrow account.  On November 15, 2013, the court held Palladino in contempt and ordered that he restore ownership of the vehicles that he had transferred into his wifes name.  Subsequently, Palladino reported to the court that he had repaid all the new loans and restored ownership of two of the vehicles (but had failed to restore ownership of one vehicle).  The Commission alleged that, in truth, the checks used to repay the new loans on the vehicles were all returned for insufficient funds.  The Commission also filed three other contempt motions against Palladino charging that  he obtained a loan for $6,750 from a Viking investor and failed to deposit this amount into the escrow account; he sold a truck owned by him for $9,500 and failed to deposit this amount into the escrow account; and he obtained new credit cards and ran up charges for cash advances, gold coins, luxury merchandise, and fine dining and failed to deposit the cash and other assets obtained into the escrow account - all in violation of the asset freeze and escrow orders.  On April 10, 2014, the United States Attorneys Office filed its criminal contempt charges against Palladino.  These charges arise from these same violations, as well as Palladinos refusal to comply with the civil contempt order entered by the court in November 2013.  On April 18, 2014, the court terminated the Commissions three outstanding motions for contempt against Palladino, in light of the criminal contempt charges filed against him., On July 15, 2013, the court held that Defendants conduct violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act.  On November 18, 2013, the court entered orders that enjoined Defendants from further violations of the antifraud provisions of the securities laws and ordered them to pay disgorgement of $9,701,738, plus prejudgment interest of $122,370.  On April 18, 2014, the court entered final judgment against Defendants, which included the injunctive relief, disgorgement and prejudgment interest described above, and ordered that the asset freeze and escrow orders would remain in full force and effect indefinitely., On January 14, 2014, Palladino pled guilty in Suffolk Superior Court to various state criminal charges based on the same conduct alleged by the Commission in its case.  Palladino is currently serving a 10-12 year prison sentence for his state court convictions., The Commission acknowledges the assistance of Suffolk County (Massachusetts) District Attorney Daniel F.

The criminal charges against Parigian arose out of the same fraudulent conduct alleged by the Commission in a civil securities fraud action filed against Parigian and others in July 2014., On July 9, 2014, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the District of Massachusetts indicted Parigian and another defendant, Eric McPhail, for conspiracy and securities fraud and, for Parigian only, lying to FBI agents.  The U.S. Attorney charged that McPhail had a history, pattern and practice of sharing confidences with a senior executive at American Superconductor.  Between 2009 and 2011, the senior executive provided McPhail with material, nonpublic information concerning the companys quarterly earnings and other business activities (the Inside Information) with the understanding that it would be kept confidential.  Instead, McPhail used email and other means to provide the Inside Information to his friends, including Parigian, with the intent that they profit by buying and selling American Superconductor stock and options.  Parigian used the Inside Information to profit on the purchase and sale of American Superconductor stock and options., On July 11, 2014, the Commission filed a civil injunctive against Eric McPhail and six of his golfing buddies, including Parigian, alleging that McPhail repeatedly provided them with material nonpublic information about American Superconductor.  According to the Commissions Complaint, McPhails source of the information was an American Superconductor executive who belonged to the same country club as McPhail and was a close friend.  The Complaint further alleged that, from July 2009 through April 2011, the executive told McPhail about American Superconductors expected earnings, contracts, and other major pending corporate developments, trusting that McPhail would keep the information confidential.  McPhail instead misappropriated the information and tipped his friends, who improperly traded on the information.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, four defendants settled the SECs charges by consenting to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, paying disgorgement and civil penalties.  The SECs case against Parigian, McPhail and another individual, Jamie Meadows, is ongoing., For further information, see <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr23040.htm>Litigation Release No. 23040</a> (July 11, 2014).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2015/lr23264.htm</i><br/>]"

At the Commissions request, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas has entered a temporary restraining order halting the offering, as well as orders appointing a receiver over, and freezing, the defendants assets., The Commissions complaint alleges that, since at least January 2014, defendants have raised approximately $4 million through the fraudulent offer and sale of securities in the Sethi-North Dakota Drilling Fund-LVIII Joint Venture (NDDF).  According to the complaint, defendants offering materials represented that 70% of investor funds would be used to acquire working interests in and drill and complete 20 oil and gas wells in the Bakken Shale formation in North Dakota.  But the Commission alleges that defendants spent less than 25% for these purposes.  Instead, defendants spent more than 75% of investor funds on undisclosed and unapproved expenditures such as diverting $1.6 million to Sameer Sethi, his family, and Sethi Petroleums parent company and over $1 million to sales employees.  Less than $1 million of the funds raised went to NDDFs actual oil and gas operations., The Commission also contends that defendants made numerous other misrepresentations and omissions to NDDF investors.  For instance, defendants falsely claimed to have partnered directly with large public oil and gas companies like ConocoPhillips and Continental Resources, Inc. to develop oil and gas properties, and Sethi Petroleums website featured corporate logos for other well-known companies like Exxon Mobil and Hess Corporation, falsely suggesting that defendants had relationships with these companies as well.  The Commission further alleges that defendants misled investors about the number of wells in which NDDF actually held interests; the operating status of those wells; and the returns investors could expect from those properties.  Defendants also failed adequately to disclose prior enforcement actions taken against them and their affiliates by state securities regulators, and Sameer Sethis prior criminal conviction and incarceration., The complaint alleges that both defendants violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that Sameer Sethi also violated Exchange Act Section 20(b) and is liable under Exchange Act Section 20(a) as a control person for Sethi Petroleums violations. The Commission seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against both defendants., The SECs investigation was conducted by Samantha S.

(Changsha Valve) in an effort to mask the subsidiarys prior investigation of violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and China Valvess decision to pay sales commissions to employees that potentially violated the FCPA. The complaint further alleged that, in 2011, China Valves materially overstated income and understated liabilities incurred by a wholly-owned subsidiary, Shanghai Pudong Hanwei Valve Co., Ltd (Hanwei Valve), when it mischaracterized certain value added tax payments in an attempt to hide the purchase of a valve that it intended to reverse engineer., The Commissions complaint alleged that China Valves, Fang, Wang, and Tang violated the antifraud provisions of the securities laws, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5.

Gottbetter orchestrated promotional campaigns that touted the prospects of microcap companies and enticed investors to buy their stock at inflated prices so he and his cohorts could sell shares they controlled and reap massive profits.  Gottbetter enlisted Mitchell G. Adam and K. David Stevenson to help him in the last of three schemes he conducted in a six-year period.  They repeatedly cautioned each other about the dangers of missteps that might draw law enforcement attention to the scheme, such as failing to keep secret the identities of Adam and Stevenson.  The three rehearsed stories they would tell if ever questioned by law enforcement.  During one meeting in New York City, Gottbetter complained about the difficulties of stock manipulation but conceded that robbing a bank was the only other way to make so much money so quickly. , Gottbetter agreed to pay $4.6 million to settle the SEC’s charges.  Stevenson also agreed to settle the SEC charges against him while a case against Adam will be litigated in federal court in Newark, N.J., In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey announced criminal charges against Gottbetter, Adam, and Stevenson., According to the SEC’s complaint, Gottbetter was involved in the manipulation of the stocks of Kentucky USA Energy Inc. (KYUS) and Dynastar Holdings Inc. (DYNA) before teaming up with Adam and Stevenson in July 2013 to utilize their offshore ties for a new and potentially more lucrative scheme.  Together they schemed to drive up the stock price for purported oil and gas exploration company HBP Energy Corp. (HBPE) through fraudulent trades generated by a trading algorithm.  They then planned to launch an extensive promotional campaign featuring multiple call centers, roadshows, and a listing on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.  After creating the false appearance of liquidity and investor interest, they planned to dump their shares of the stock on unsuspecting investors around the world.  While Stevenson and Adam managed to do some small coordinated trades, the scheme was thwarted before the planned manipulation and promotion could be launched when Stevenson was arrested by the FBI., The SEC’s complaint alleges that Gottbetter violated Sections 5(a), 5(c) and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and violated and aided and abetted violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.  The complaint alleges that Adam and Stevenson violated and aided and abetted violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5. , Gottbetter agreed to be barred from the penny stock industry in addition to paying $4.6 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest from ill-gotten gains in the Kentucky USA Energy manipulation scheme.  He consented to injunctions against future violations.  Stevenson also agreed to be barred from the penny stock industry and consented to an injunction against future violations.  The settlements are subject to court approval., The SEC’s investigation was conducted by Simona Suh of the Market Abuse Unit and Nancy A.

23273,2015,[<h3>Court Orders Massachusetts Investment Adviser to Pay Over $1 Million to Conclude Two SEC Fraud Cases</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that, on May 29, 2015, the Honorable George A.  OToole Jr. of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts entered final judgments against the one-time registered investment adviser Sage Advisory Group, LLC, and its principal, Benjamin Lee Grant (Lee Grant), both of Boston, MA, in two fraud cases filed by the SEC.  A federal court jury previously found Sage and Lee Grant liable for fraud in the first case, and Sage and Lee Grant recently admitted liability for fraud in the second case.  Among other relief, the final judgments impose permanent injunctions against future violations of certain antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and order Sage and Lee Grant to pay a total of $1,051,038., In the first case, filed on September 29, 2010, the Commission alleged that Lee Grant had fraudulently led his brokerage customers to transfer their assets to Sage, his new advisory firm.  Prior to October 2005, Lee Grant was a registered representative of broker-dealer Wedbush Morgan Securities and had customer accounts representing approximately $100 million in assets, virtually all of which were managed by California-based investment adviser First Wilshire Securities Management.  According to the complaint, Lee Grant resigned from Wedbush in September 2005 so that he could operate Sage, his own newly-minted investment advisory firm.  Lee Grant made false and misleading statements to his former brokerage customers.  Among other things, Lee Grant misled customers by telling them that the changes in their accounts were being done at the suggestion of First Wilshire and that First Wilshire was not willing to continue managing the customers assets if they stayed with Wedbush.  Lee Grant also told customers that the wrap fee program being offered by Sage offered potential savings, based on historical commission costs - without disclosing that a new arrangement with a discount broker would produce substantial savings to the benefit of Sage, not the customers, under the wrap fee.  To rush his customers to sign up as advisory clients with Sage, Lee Grant falsely suggested that they might suffer disruption in First Wilshires management of their assets unless they signed and returned the new advisory and custodial account documents as soon as possible., Following trial, on August 13, 2014, a federal district court jury found both Sage and Lee Grant liable for fraud under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, among other charges., In the second case, filed on September 1, 2011, the Commission alleged that Sage and Lee Grant separately violated the antifraud provisions of the Investment Advisers Act, as did Lee Grants father, Jack Grant.  The Commissions complaint alleged that Jack Grant violated a Commission bar from association with investment advisers by associating with Sage and by acting as an investment adviser himself.  The Commission bar had been based on a 1988 Commission enforcement action against Jack Grant alleging that he sold $5,500,000 of unregistered securities and misappropriated investors funds.  The Commission alleged in its September 2011 complaint that, notwithstanding his agreement to accept a Commission bar to settle the 1988 action, Jack Grant did not remove himself from the securities business and instead continued to provide investment advice to individuals and small businesses.  The Commissions complaint alleged that he retooled his service as the Law Offices of Jack Grant and used his son, Lee Grant, to help implement his investment advice.  The complaint further alleged that Jack Grant, Lee Grant, and Sage failed to inform their advisory clients that Jack Grant was barred from associating with investment advisers.  In May 2013, the court entered a final judgment against Jack Grant on a settled basis, ordering Jack Grant to pay a total of $201,392.27, among other relief., The final judgments entered against Sage and Lee Grant on May 29, 2015 conclude the cases and were entered with Sages and Lee Grants consent.  The final judgment in the first case acknowledges the jurys liability finding, imposes permanent injunctions against future violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2), 206(4), and 204A of the Investment Advisers Act and Rules 204A-1 and 206(4)-7 thereunder, orders Sage and Lee Grant to pay on a joint and several basis $500,000 in disgorgement and $51,038 in prejudgment interest, and orders Lee Grant to pay an additional $350,000 civil penalty.

Spangler and his advisory firm.,  In May 2012, the SEC charged Spangler and his firm with defrauding investment clients by secretly investing their money in two risky start-up companies that Spangler co-founded.   The SEC alleged that Spangler, a former chairman of the National Association of Personal Financial Advisors, funneled approximately $47.7 million of client money into these private ventures.  Spangler served as chairman and CEO of one of the companies, which is now bankrupt.  These risky investments were inconsistent with the investment strategies that Spangler promised his clients and contrary to their investment objectives.  According to the SECs complaint, Spangler concealed his diversion of client funds for years.  Spangler disclosed the misappropriation only after he placed his firm and the funds he managed into a state court receivership in 2011.,  The U.S. Attorneys Office for the Western District of Washington filed parallel criminal charges against Spangler, who was convicted on 32 counts of wire fraud, money laundering, and investment adviser fraud in November 2013.  In March 2014, Spangler was sentenced to 16 years in prison and ordered to pay nearly $20 million in restitution to his former investment clients.  The court subsequently entered a default judgment against Spangler in the SEC action and ordered him to pay more than $4 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil monetary penalties.  Spangler is appealing his criminal conviction and the SEC judgment., The assets of The Spangler Group are being liquidated by the court-appointed receiver, who has been distributing the proceeds to its creditors, including Spanglers investment clients.  On behalf of the firm, its receiver agreed to resolve the SEC claims.

23289,2015,[<h3>Jury in Criminal Case Convicts Individual in Insider Trading Case Involving Group of Amateur Golfers</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that, on June 16, 2015, a federal jury in Massachusetts convicted Eric McPhail of criminal charges of conspiracy and securities fraud for his role in an insider trading ring that traded on inside information about Massachusetts-based American Superconductor Corporation.  The criminal charges against McPhail arose out of the same fraudulent conduct for which the Commission instituted a securities fraud action against him and others during July 2014., The U.S. Attorneys Office for the District of Massachusetts indicted McPhail and another defendant, Douglas Parigian, in July 2014.  The indictment alleged that McPhail had a history, pattern and practice of sharing confidences with an individual who had material, nonpublic information concerning American Superconductors quarterly earnings and other business activities (the Inside Information).  This individual provided McPhail with the Inside Information with the understanding that it would be kept confidential.  Instead, McPhail used email and other means to provide the Inside information to his friends, including Parigian, with the intent that they profit by buying and selling American Superconductor stock and options.  Parigian, who used this information to profit on the purchase and sale of American Superconductor stock and options, pled guilty to criminal securities fraud and conspiracy charges on May 13, 2015., In July 2014, the Commission filed a civil injunctive against Eric McPhail and six of his golfing buddies, including Parigian, alleging that McPhail repeatedly provided non-public information about American Superconductor.  McPhails source was an American Superconductor executive who belonged to the same country club as McPhail and was a close friend.  According to the complaint, from July 2009 through April 2011, the executive told McPhail about American Superconducters expected earnings, contracts, and other major pending corporate developments, trusting that McPhail would keep the information confidential.  Instead, McPhail misappropriated the inside information and tipped his friends, who improperly traded on the information.  Four defendants settled the SECs charges, without admitting or denying the allegations, by consenting to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of the Exchange Act, paying disgorgement and civil penalties.  The SECs case against Parigian, McPhail and another individual, Jamie Meadows, is ongoing., For further information, see Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr23040.htm>23040</a> (July 11, 2014).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2015/lr23289.htm</i><br/>]"

Landry and Norstra Energy misled investors about the location of the companys property in order to make the wells appear more promising and twice disclosed an inaccurate date to begin drilling operations to make the potential for oil riches appear imminent., The SECs complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan alleges that promotional materials issued by Eric Dany falsely proclaimed that Norstra Energy could be sitting on top of as much as 8.5 billion barrels of oil! and said the planned wells had a 99 percent chance of profitability. After the exaggerated statements about its property and prospects caused Norstra Energys stock price to increase nearly 600 percent in a three-month period, the SEC suspended trading in June 2013., The SECs complaint charges Norstra Energy, Landry, and Dany with fraud and seeks final judgments ordering permanent injunctions, return of allegedly ill-gotten gains with interest, and financial penalties.

Many of Williamsons investors were public sector retirees such as teachers and law enforcement officers who sought safe investments for their retirement savings. Williamson assured investors there was no risk involved and they would receive annual returns of 8 to 12 percent.  But rather than invest their money as promised, he used the majority of fund assets to pay his personal expenses and make supposed returns to investors. Williamson created fictitious valuations that were sent to investors., According to the SECs complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, one retired Miami-Dade County school teacher and church pastor invested $125,000 in the fund. That same day, Williamson transferred himself $10,000 to pay his credit card bill and make a car payment to BMW among other personal expenditures. Williamson later paid $24,400 to other investors in the fund as purported distributions, and transferred himself another $24,000 to pay additional personal expenses., In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of Florida announced criminal charges against Williamson., Williamson agreed to settle the SECs charges. On June 2, 2015, the court entered a final judgment against Williamson permanently restraining and enjoining Williamson from violating Sections 206(1), (2), and (4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder, and further ordered that Williamson is liable for disgorgement of $748,050., The SECs investigation was conducted by Casey Cohen and Margaret Vizzi in the Miami office, and the case was supervised by Assistant Regional Director Jason R.

According to the SECs complaint, Interinvests owner and president Hans Peter Black has served on the board of directors of these companies, which have collectively paid an entity he controls approximately $1.7 million. The SEC alleges that Blacks involvement with these companies and his receipt of payments from them created a conflict of interest that he and Interinvest failed to disclose to their advisory clients., Black consented to the entry of the preliminary injunction against him, and the court determined to impose the same preliminary relief against Interinvest. The preliminary injunction entered against Interinvest and Black includes an order to freeze Interinvests and Blacks assets and to prohibit the firm and Black from continuing to exercise investment authority over client assets under management.

With the help of several promoters, they lured investors with such false promises as their money would be fully insured, DFRF has a line of credit with a Swiss private bank, and one-quarter of DFRFs profits are used for charitable work in Africa.  The scheme raised more than $15 million from at least   1,400 investors by recruiting new members in pyramid scheme fashion to keep the fraud afloat, and commissions were paid to earlier investors in Ponzi-like fashion for their recruitment efforts.  The SEC further alleges that Filho has withdrawn more than $6 million of investor funds to buy a fleet of luxury cars among other personal expenses., According to the SECs complaint filed June 30 and unsealed today in federal court in Boston, Filho is a Brazilian native who lives in Winter Garden, Fla., and he orchestrated the scheme with assistance from six promoters also charged in the case: Wanderley M. Dalman of Revere, Mass., Gaspar C. Jesus of Malden, Mass., Eduardo N. Da Silva of Orlando, Fla., Heriberto C. Perez Valdes of Miami, Jeffrey A. Feldman of Boca Raton, and Romildo Da Cunha of Brazil., The SEC alleges that Filho and others began selling memberships in DFRF last year through meetings with prospective investors primarily in Massachusetts hotel conference rooms, private homes, and businesses.  DFRF promoted the investment opportunity through online videos in which Filho falsely claimed that the company had registered with the SEC and its stock would be publicly traded.  As DFRFs marketing reach widened, membership sales dramatically increased from under $100,000 in June 2014 to more than $4 million in March 2015 alone., The SECs complaint alleges that all defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and registration provisions Section 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act., The SECs investigation was conducted by Caitlyn M.

Yang falsely projected outsized investment returns ranging from 20 to 30 percent annually.  She allegedly commingled investor funds to prevent the scheme from collapsing, and used money from new investors to make sham profit payments to earlier investors.  Yang also allegedly diverted $2.4 million in investor funds through her brothers company in Hong Kong purportedly for the purchase of an oil rig, but instead used it to purchase a 5,600-square-foot home in an exclusive gated community in Fremont, Calif.  In addition, Yang allegedly spent investor funds on pool and gardening services, personal taxes, and a family vacation to Hawaii., According to the SECs complaint filed in federal court in San Francisco, Luca International conducted seminars for investors at the companys offices and hotel conference rooms in California.  Besides targeting investors in the Chinese-American community through advertisements in Chinese-language television, radio, and newspaper outlets, Yang and Luca International allegedly zeroed in on Chinese citizens who sought permanent U.S. residence through the EB-5 program, which provides a way for foreign investors to obtain a green card by meeting certain U.S. investment requirements.  Yang is alleged to have raised approximately $8 million from EB-5 investors purportedly to finance, through a loan to another Luca entity, jobs and development costs for eight oil-and-gas drilling projects.  Yang allegedly told these investors that loan was fully secured, but the Luca entity the EB-5 investors funded was hopelessly in debt and contrary to the rosy representations Yang made to investors, had no realistic possibility of ever repaying the loan., Others charged in the SECs complaint include Luca Internationals former vice president of business development Lei (Lily) Lei, who allegedly sold securities to investors and helped Yang divert investor funds, and Yong (Michael) Chen, who allegedly raised investor funds for Yang through his company Entholpy EMC, which did business under the name Mastermind College Funding Group.

The SEC identified that middleman as Frank Tamayo <a href=/News/PressRelease/Detail/PressRelease/1370542993471>in a subsequent complaint filed in federal court in New Jersey</a>. The SEC alleged that after receiving the tips from the law firm clerk, Tamayo typically met the stockbroker near the clock at the information booth at Grand Central and chewed up or ate post-it notes or napkins after using them to show the stockbroker the ticker symbol of the company that would be acquired.  The stockbroker then traded for himself, Tamayo, and other customers., For his extensive cooperation in the SECs investigation, Tamayo will not face a monetary penalty from the SEC.  In the proposed final judgment, which is subject to court approval, Tamayo would be ordered to disgorge more than $1 million of his ill-gotten gains from the scheme, but that payment would be deemed satisfied by the entry of orders of forfeiture or restitution in the parallel criminal case, in which he has pled guilty.  Tamayo also would be permanently enjoined from future violations of Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder, as well as Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933. , Under the terms of the agreement, Tamayo must continue to cooperate as a witness in the SECs ongoing case against the law firm clerk Steven Metro of Katonah, N.Y. and the stockbroker, Vladimir Eydelman of Colts Neck, N.J.

The 34 defendants include six  firms alleged to have acted as unregistered broker-dealers catering to  customers who sought to conceal their stock ownership and manipulate the market  for microcap securities., Owners and employees at the six firms, several customers, stock promoters, and two microcap issuers  Warrior Girl Corp. and Natures Peak, formerly Everock, Inc. â also are among the defendants in the case filed in federal district court in Manhattan. The SEC charged the defendants with fraud, manipulative trading, touting, and with registration violations. Nine of the defendants were named in a criminal indictment charging them based on their roles in the alleged stock manipulation scheme., The SEC complaint alleges that Costa Rica-based Moneyline Brokers and its founder Harold Bailey B.J Gallison II unlawfully operated as a broker-dealer for U.S.-based customers who engaged in pump and dump schemes to artificially inflate a stocks price and then sell their own shares. According to the complaint, Moneyline and certain of its employees routinely accepted transfers of microcap stocks from the U.S. customers and had stock certificates reissued in Moneylines name to conceal the true owners of the shares., Carl H. Kruse Sr. and Carl H. Kruse Jr., both of Miami, allegedly conspired with Moneyline and others to manipulate trading in Warrior Girl, a former shell company that the Kruses controlled. Warrior Girls purported business changed from hydroelectric power (in 2008) to extracting oil from tar sands (in 2009) to online education (in 2010), and the Kruses allegedly engaged in multiple manipulations to profit from promotions to inflate the stocks price. As a result of the various campaigns the Kruses are alleged to have obtained illegal profits estimated to total $2.3 million., Another alleged scheme involved trading in Everock, Inc., a Canada-based mining company that relocated to Nevada and sold sandwich spreads after reorganizing itself with Natures Peak in 2008. A concerted campaign promoting the mining-turned condiment company allegedly included videos and Facebook postings and produced more than $2.5 million in profits for defendants Charles S. Moeller, of Sea Cliff, N.Y., Mark S. Dresner, of Dix Hills, N.Y. and Frank J. Zangara, of Locust Valley, N.Y., In addition to Moneyline, the complaint alleges that two Costa Rica-based firms, Sandias Azucaradas CR, S.A. and Vanilla Sky, S.A., and three Nevada-based firms, Bastille Advisors, Inc., Club Consultants, Inc., and Jurojin, Inc., operated as unregistered broker-dealers. Employees of the firms who were charged are: Roger G. Coleman Sr., of Las Vegas, Ann M. Hiskey, of Costa Rica, Robin M. Rushing and David K. Rushing, both of Spokane, Wash., and Michael J. Randles, of Costa Rica.<br/><br/>Promoters who were charged include: Dresner, Antonio J. Katz, of Red Bank, N.J., Moeller, Richard S.

Zirinsky are both former registered representatives at Ameriprise Financial Services, Inc., illegally traded in the stock of Philadelphia Consolidated Holding Corp. (PHLY) based on non-public information about the companys impending merger with Tokio Marine Holdings, Inc. The complaint alleged that McGee misappropriated the inside information from a PHLY senior executive who was confiding in him through their relationship at Alcoholics Anonymous about pressures he was confronting at work. McGee then purchased PHLY stock in advance of the merger announcement and tipped Michael W. Zirinsky, who also traded and tipped others.    , 	McGee consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, orders him to disgorge $292,128 in ill-gotten gains from the illegal insider trading, together with prejudgment interest in the amount of $70,576, for a total of $362,704. In April 2015, the court granted the SECs motion for summary judgment against McGee, holding him liable for insider trading in PHLY stock and tipping his co-defendant Michael W.

At the time, Sudfeld was a real estate partner at a law firm in Philadelphia that advised Harleysville on the merger.  Sudfeld was not involved in the merger and learned that the announcement of it was imminent from a conversation between an attorney working on the transaction and their shared legal assistant.  Sudfeld allegedly stole the inside information and purchased Harleysville stock in his and his wifes accounts.  Once the merger was announced, Sudfeld sold all the shares he had purchased, realizing approximately $79,000 of illegal profits., In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania today announced criminal charges against Sudfeld., The SECs complaint filed in federal court in Philadelphia names Sudfelds wife, Mary Jo Sudfeld, as a relief defendant for the purpose of recovering insider trading profits in her brokerage account through trades conducted by Sudfeld.

In 2013, the SEC charged 16 defendants, including Santos and Lin, with perpetrating a worldwide pyramid scheme., In settling the SECs charges against her, Santos admitted that CKB was a pyramid scheme and that she was one of its three primary founders.  Santos also admitted that she travelled to the United States and worked with other CKB founders and promoters to convince investors to join CKB by falsely telling them that CKB was a legitimate multi-level marketing company that sold online education courses for children when, in fact, Santos knew that CKB sold its products only to investors and had no significant retail sales., In settling the SECs charges against her, Kiki Lin admitted that CKB was an unlawful scheme and that she worked with CKBs founders and others to promote CKB to investors across the United States.  Kiki Lin also admitted that she made false and misleading statements to investors and potential investors in order to induce them to join CKB.  For instance, Kiki Lin admitted that she falsely told CKB investors and potential investors that they would receive profit reward points (Prpts) with a value in U.S. dollars that would increase exponentially over time when, in fact, she knew that Prpts could not be converted to actual money., Defendants Santos and Kiki Lin consented to the entry of  Judgments, which: (i) permanently enjoin each of them  from violating the unregistered offering provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), and the anti-fraud provisions of Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder.

On January 15, 2015, in an action that paralleled the Commissions securities fraud case against Enea, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Wisconsin filed a criminal information against Enea alleging that he raised $2.1 million from more than ten investors by representing that he would purchase credit card processing portfolios., The criminal information alleges that Enea represented to investors that the credit card processing portfolios entitled investors to periodic residual payments, which were based on the fees merchants paid to process credit card transactions and that the investments would earn annual returns ranging from 20 to 35 percent. Enea, however, never used the funds to purchase the credit card processing portfolios and, instead, used the funds to pay his own personal expenses and to repay other investors. As a result, the investors suffered net losses of more than $750,000. On March 4, 2015, Enea entered a guilty plea to one count of wire fraud and to one count of filing a false federal income tax return., The Commissions case against Enea is based on the same conduct as the criminal case. The SECs complaint, filed on October 13, 2013, alleged that Enea violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, by raising $2.1 million from 18 investors.

In reaching its decision, the Court rejected Petitioners claims that the Commissions Order was not supported by substantial evidence and that Koch could not be charged as a primary violator of the Advisers Act. Finally, while upholding all other remedies, including investment adviser, broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer, and transfer agent bars, the Court vacated the Commission Orders imposition of municipal advisor and rating agency bars, holding that the Commission impermissibly applied the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act retroactively because Kochs misconduct pre-dated that Act. , The Commissions investigation was conducted by Adam S.

The U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts charged Filho on June 30, 2015, with wire fraud in connection with an investment fraud he operated under the name DFRF Enterprises.  Filho was arrested in Florida after evading arrest for more than two weeks., The criminal charges against Filho relate to the same conduct charged in a civil enforcement action filed by the SEC on June 30, 2015, against Filho, DFRF Enterprises, and others. Those charges were filed under seal, in connection with the Commissions request for an immediate asset freeze. That asset freeze, which the federal court in Boston, Massachusetts, ordered on June 30, secured approximately two million dollars of funds and prevented the potential further dissipation of investor assets.  After the SEC staff implemented the asset freeze, at the SECs request the Court lifted the seal on July 2, 2015.  On July 13, 2015, the Court extended the asset freeze as to all defendants [Filho; two DFRF Enterprises companies based in Massachusetts and Florida; Wanderley M. Dalman of Revere, Massachusetts; Gaspar C. Jesus of Malden, Massachusetts; Eduardo N. Da Silva of Orlando, Florida; Heriberto C. Perez Valdes of Miami, Florida; Jeffrey A. Feldman of Boca Raton, Florida; and Romildo Da Cunha of Brazil].  A hearing on the SECs motion for preliminary injunction is scheduled for July 28, 2015 in the federal court in Boston., The SEC alleges that DFRF Enterprises, named for its founder Daniel Fernandes Rojo Filho, claimed to operate more than 50 gold mines in Brazil and Africa, but the companys revenues came solely from selling membership interests to investors and not from mining gold.  According to the SECs complaint, with the help of several promoters, DFRF lured investors with such false promises as their money would be fully insured, DFRF has a line of credit with a Swiss private bank, and one-quarter of DFRFs profits are used for charitable work in Africa.  The SEC alleges that the scheme raised more than $15 million from at least 1,400 investors by recruiting new members in pyramid scheme fashion to keep the fraud afloat, and commissions were paid to earlier investors in Ponzi-like fashion for their recruitment efforts.  The SEC further alleges that Filho has withdrawn more than $6 million of investor funds to buy a fleet of luxury cars, among other personal expenses., The SEC alleges that Filho and others began selling memberships in DFRF during 2014 through meetings with prospective investors primarily in Massachusetts hotel conference rooms, private homes, and businesses.  According to the SECs complaint, DFRF promoted the investment opportunity through online videos in which Filho falsely claimed that the company had registered with the SEC and its stock would be publicly traded.  As DFRFs marketing reach widened, membership sales dramatically increased from under $100,000 in June 2014 to more than $4 million in March 2015 alone., For further information, see Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2015/lr23296.htm>23296</a> (July 2, 2015).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2015/lr23310.htm</i><br/>]"

Zhao was also ordered to disgorge an additional $33,471.50 representing his additional ill-gotten gains, along with prejudgment interest thereon in the amount of $5,224.71, and to pay a penalty of $116,000,000. Zhu was also ordered to disgorge an additional $108,248 representing his additional ill-gotten gains, along with prejudgment interest thereon in the amount of $16,264.73, and to pay a penalty of $1,200,000. All told, the Court ordered over $250 million in disgorgement and civil penalties for the defendants securities law violations. In addition, the Court permanently prohibited both defendants from serving as an officer or director of any public issuer., On February 22, 2012, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York charging Zhao and Zhu with securities fraud for the undisclosed theft of the primary asset of Puda. According to the complaint, Zhao and Zhu perpetrated a massive fraud on Pudas public shareholders by effectively stealing and selling Pudas operating subsidiary. Before the defendants fraud, Puda held an indirect 90% ownership stake in Shanxi Puda Coal Group Co., Ltd (Shanxi Coal), a coal mining company located in the Shanxi Province of the Peoples Republic of China (PRC). In September 2009, just weeks before Puda announced that Shanxi Coal had received a highly lucrative mandate from the provincial government authorities to become a consolidator of smaller coal mining companies, Zhao, with Zhus knowledge and complicity, transferred Pudas 90% stake in Shanxi Coal to himself. In July 2010, Zhao transferred a 49% equity interest in Shanxi Coal to CITIC Trust Co. Ltd. (CITIC Trust), a Chinese private equity fund controlled by CITIC Group, which is reported to be the largest state-owned investment firm in the PRC. CITIC Trust placed its 49% stake in Shanxi Coal in a trust and then sold interests in the trust to Chinese investors. In addition, Zhao caused Shanxi Coal to pledge 51% of its assets to CITIC Trust as collateral for a loan of RMB 3.5 billion ($516 million) from the trust to Shanxi Coal. In exchange, CITIC Trust gave Zhao 1.212 billion preferred shares in the trust. None of these asset transfers were approved by Pudas board or its shareholders or disclosed in Pudas various SEC filings, which Zhao and Zhu signed knowing that those documents were materially false and misleading. Puda also conducted two public offerings in 2010 in the U.S. without disclosing that it no longer had any ownership stake in the coal company, Pudas sole source of revenue. Thus, at the same time that CITIC Trust was effectively selling interests in the coal company to Chinese investors, Zhao and Zhu were still telling U.S. investors that Puda owned a 90% stake in that company. All told, Puda raised $116 million in net offering proceeds from the two offerings. As a result of the defendants fraud, Puda became little more than a shell company, with no ongoing business operations., With the entry of the default judgments, the Commission received the full relief requested in the complaint. Both Zhao and Zhu were charged in the Commissions complaint with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b), 13(b)(5), and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, 13b2-2, 14a-3, and 14a-9a thereunder. Both men were also alleged to be liable pursuant to Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act as control persons of Puda for Pudas violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder, and that they were also liable pursuant to Section 20(e) of the Exchange Act for aiding and abetting those violations. Zhu was also charged with violating Exchange Act Rule 13a-14., The SECs litigation was conducted by Sheldon Pollock and George Stepaniuk, and was supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.

Previously, the Court had entered judgment ordering Kevin Keough (and his wife) to pay a total of over $350,000 in disgorgement of ill-gotten gains., Kevin Keough was a defendant in a lawsuit brought by the Commission against Inofin, its former executives, and its sales agents alleging they illegally raised at least $110 million from hundreds of individual investors through the sale of unregistered Inofin notes and that Inofin and its executives lied about the companys financial performance and how Inofin was using its investors money. The Commission alleged that Kevin Keough unlawfully earned commissions by promoting and selling Inofins unregistered securities and that he concealed his activities from his broker-dealer employers by directing Inofin pay his illegal commissions to his wife, Nancy, who was named as a relief defendant in the Commissions action for the purpose of recovering these funds from her., In February 2015, Keough agreed to the entry of a consent judgment in partial settlement of the claims against him. Entered by the Court on February 20, 2015, the consent judgment ordered Keough to disgorge $368,430 in illegal commissions, to pay an additional $44,500 in interest and permanently enjoined him from violating Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act). In a related action, the Commission issued an Order on March 3, 2015, barring Kevin Keough from certain parts of the securities industry, with the right to apply for reentry to the industry after three years., As part of the February 2015 consent judgment, the Commission and Kevin Keough agreed that the Court should decide whether to impose a civil penalty on him. After briefing and presentation of the evidence by both sides, the Court ruled on August 5, 2015 that Kevin Keough should pay a civil penalty in the amount of $50,000. As a result, on August 12, 2015, the Court supplemented its judgment to impose the additional $50,000 civil penalty upon Kevin Keough., The Commission previously obtained final judgments by consent against Inofins former executives Michael J. Cuomo of Plymouth, Massachusetts, Kevin Mann, Sr. of Marshfield, Massachusetts and Melissa George of Duxbury, Massachusetts and against another Inofin sales agent, David Affeldt of Potomac, Maryland. The judgments ordered Cuomo, George, Mann, and Affeldt to pay disgorgement and civil penalties and permanently enjoined them from violating the Exchange Act and the Securities Act.

The SEC alleges that Cañas coordinated with a close friend to purchase Potash call options in a Switzerland-based brokerage account, of which Cañas was the sole beneficial owner, on August 16, 2010-the day before Potash announced that it had rejected BHPs acquisition bid.  Potash stock rose more than 27% after that announcement, and Cañas sold the Potash call options three days after he purchased them for illicit net profits of $278,156.97, a gain of more than 1,400%. , The SEC <a href=http://www.sec.gov/News/PressRelease/Detail/PressRelease/1370539737461>previously charged</a> Cañas with committing insider trading before the same announcement by trading Contracts-for-Difference (CFDs).  After Cañas <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr23048.htm>settled the prior case</a>, the Commission staff continued to investigate other suspicious Potash trades in foreign accounts.  Commission staff obtained evidence a few weeks ago revealing that Cañas was the sole beneficial owner of the Switzerland-based account that purchased options before the announcement.  The SEC complaint alleges that Cañas coordinated with a friend to purchase Potash call options in that account before the public announcement of BHPs acquisition bid.  Cañas and his friend rushed to fund the account and place the trades days prior to the announcement.  The complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that Cañas violated Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3, and seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest and financial penalties., The SECs prior complaint alleged that Cañas traded CFDs equivalent to 30,000 shares and tipped his friend, Julio Marín Ugedo, in advance of the Potash announcement.  To settle that action, Cañas consented, without admitting or denying the allegations, to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder and ordering him to pay disgorgement of $960,806 and a civil penalty of $960,806.  Pursuant to the Consent that Cañas signed in that action, the settlement resolved only the claims related to the specific trades identified in that complaint., The SECs investigation has been conducted jointly by staff in the Enforcement Divisions Market Abuse Unit, the Chicago Regional Office, and the Denver Regional Office, including Kathryn A. Pyszka, Frank D. Goldman, and R. Kevin Barrett.  The case was supervised by Robert Cohen and Joseph Sansone, acting co-chiefs of the Market Abuse Unit, and Timothy Warren, Associate Director of the Chicago Regional Office.

Glover orchestrated the fraud by enticing family, friends, and fellow  church members to become his clients at Signator and invest in Colonial  Tidewater Realty Income Partners, which he co-managed. Most of Glover’s clients were financially  unsophisticated and relied on him for investment guidance. Some even described him as “another dad” or “part  of the family.” <br/><br/>          According to the  SEC’s complaint filed in federal court in Baltimore against Colonial Tidewater,  Glover, and Colonial Tidewater’s co-manager Sherman T.

Woodlock stated:, On  April 30, 2013, the Commission filed an emergency action against Palladino and  Viking and obtained from the court certain preliminary relief, including an order  freezing Palladino’s and Viking’s assets. Between September 2013 and March 2014, the Commission filed four motions  for civil contempt against Palladino based on his violating the asset freeze  while it was in effect. Thereafter, in April  2014, the U.S. Attorney filed an information charging Palladino with 25 counts  of criminal contempt arising from the same violations that formed the basis for  the Commission’s motions. On May 14,  2015, Palladino pled guilty to all 25 charges in the information.

Those charged include two Ukrainian men who allegedly hacked into newswire services to obtain the information and 30 other defendants in and outside the U.S. who allegedly traded on it, generating more than $100 million in illegal profits., The SECs complaint unsealed on August 11 was filed under seal on August 10 in U.S. District Court in Newark, N.J., and the court entered an asset freeze and other preliminary relief that day., The SEC charges, that over a five-year period, Ivan Turchynov and Oleksandr Ieremenko spearheaded the scheme, using advanced techniques to hack into two or more newswire services and steal hundreds of corporate earnings announcements before the newswires released them publicly.  The SEC further charges that Turchynov and Ieremenko created a secret web-based location to transmit the stolen data to traders in Russia, Ukraine, Malta, Cyprus, France, and three U.S. states, Georgia, New York, and Pennsylvania.  The traders are alleged to have used this nonpublic information in a short window of opportunity to place illicit trades in stocks, options, and other securities, sometimes purportedly funneling a portion of their illegal profits to the hackers., In parallel actions, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the District of New Jersey and the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York today announced criminal charges against several of the defendants in the SECs action, including Turchynov and Ieremenko, and traders in the U.S. and Ukraine - Arkadiy Dubovoy, Igor Dubovoy, Pavel Dubovoy, Vitaly Korchevsky, Vladislav Khalupsky, Aleksandr Garkusha, and Leonid Momotok., According to the SECs complaint, Turchynov and Ieremenko hid the intrusions by using proxy servers to mask their identities and by posing as newswire service employees and customers.  The two allegedly recruited traders with a video showcasing their ability to steal the earnings information before its public release.  The complaint charges that in return for the information, the traders sometimes paid the hackers a share of their profits, even going so far as to give the hackers access to their brokerage accounts to monitor the trading and ensure that they received the appropriate percentage of the profits.  The complaint charges that the traders sought to conceal their illicit activity by establishing multiple accounts in a variety of names, funneling money to the hackers as supposed payments for construction and building equipment, and trading in products such as contracts for difference (CFDs)., At times, the hackers and traders had a very narrow window of opportunity to extract and use the allegedly hacked information.  In one particularly dramatic instance, on May 1, 2013, the hackers and traders allegedly moved in the 36-minute period between a newswires receipt and release of an announcement that a company was revising its earnings and revenue projections downward.  According to the SECs complaint, 10 minutes after the company sent the still-confidential release to the newswire, traders began selling short its stock and selling CFDs, realizing $511,000 in profits when the companys stock price fell following the announcement., The SECs complaint charges each of the 32 defendants with violating federal antifraud laws and related SEC antifraud rules and seeks a final judgment ordering the defendants to pay penalties, return their allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and be subject to permanent injunctions from future violations of the antifraud laws.,  <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2015/lr23319.htm</i><br/>]"

He was further barred from participating in any offering of a penny stock. Thornes was barred based upon a final judgment of permanent injunction entered against him on July 21, 2015 in an action brought by the Commission against him and three relief defendants in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. Both the final judgment and the Commission order barring Thornes were entered pursuant to Thornes consent. Thornes neither admitted nor denied the Commissions allegations., The Commission alleged in the injunctive action that from December 2010 through January 2013, Thornes misappropriated approximately $4.4 million from two brokerage accounts: a trust account established for the benefit of a dementia patient in her eighties, for which Thornes was the trustee and broker; and a scholarship trust account established for the purpose of providing scholarships to local students, for which Thornes mother was trustee., According to the SECs complaint, Thornes stole money from the two accounts from November 2010 to April 2013 primarily to benefit two of his friends, Christopher Burnell of Highland, Calif., and Kyle Larick of Redlands, Calif. He also caused excess trustee fees to be paid to his mother from the scholarship trust account. The complaint named Burnell, Larick and Doreen Thornes as relief defendants, and sought disgorgement from them., In addition to permanently enjoining Thornes from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, the final judgment orders Thornes to pay disgorgement of $4,366,790, prejudgment interest of $278,540, and a penalty of $4,366,790., On July 20, 2015, the district court also entered final judgments against relief defendants Burnell and Doreen Thornes pursuant to their consents, which ordered them to disgorge $3,071,112.90 and $60,000 respectively. Burnell and Doreen Thornes are jointly and severally liable with Thornes for these amounts. Finally, on July 20, 2015, the court issued an order denying the Commissions motion for summary judgment and granting relief defendant Laricks motion for summary judgment, finding that Larick had a legitimate claim to the monies he received from the scholarship trust account because he was either a good faith investor or borrower of the funds., See also: <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr23058.htm>LR 23058</a> (August 4, 2014); Securities Exchange Act <a href=/litigation/admin/2015/34-75644.pdf>Rel.

The criminal charges against Parigian arose out of the same conduct that is the subject of a civil insider trading action filed by the Commission against Parigian and others in July 2014., The U.S. Attorneys Office for the District of Massachusetts indicted Parigian and another defendant, Eric McPhail, in a Superseding Information dated May 11, 2015. The Information charged that McPhail had a history, pattern and practice of sharing confidences with an individual who had material, nonpublic information concerning American Superconductors quarterly earnings and other business activities (the Inside Information). This individual provided McPhail with the Inside Information with the understanding that it would be kept confidential.  Instead, McPhail used email and other means to provide the Inside information to his friends, including Parigian, with the intent that they profit by buying and selling American Superconductor stock and options.  Parigian used this information to profit on the purchase and sale of American Superconductor stock and options., In July 2014, the Commission filed a civil injunctive against Eric McPhail and six of his golfing buddies, including Parigian, alleging that McPhail repeatedly provided non-public information about American Superconductor.  McPhails source was an American Superconductor executive who belonged to the same country club as McPhail and was a close friend.  According to the complaint, from July 2009 through April 2011, the executive told McPhail about American Superconducters expected earnings, contracts, and other major pending corporate developments, trusting that McPhail would keep the information confidential.  Instead, McPhail misappropriated the inside information and tipped his friends, who improperly traded on the information.  Four defendants settled the SECs charges, without admitting or denying the allegations, by consenting to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of the Exchange Act, paying disgorgement and civil penalties.  The SECs case against Parigian, McPhail and another individual, Jamie Meadows, is ongoing., For further information, see <a href=http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr23040.htm>Litigation Release  No. 23040</a> (July 11, 2014); <a href=http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2015/lr23264.htm>Litigation  Release No. 23264</a> (May 18, 2015); <a href=http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2015/lr23289.htm>Litigation  Release No. 23289</a> (June 17, 2015).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2015/lr23323.htm</i><br/>]"

The Commission also obtained an asset freeze against all relief defendants, including Ahmeds wife., The SEC filed its emergency action against Ahmed in May and alleged that he obtained approximately $65 million in ill-gotten gains. On May 7, 2015, the court imposed a temporary restraining order on Ahmed imposing an asset freeze on him, prohibiting the destruction of evidence, and permitting expedited discovery. On August 12, 2015, the Honorable Janet Bond Arterton of the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut issued an order granting the SECs motion for a preliminary injunction continuing the asset freeze up to approximately $118 million in order to preserve funds in the event that Ahmed is ordered to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The order will remain in effect until a final disposition of the case., The SEC alleges that Ahmed used a variety of fraudulent devices to perpetrate his scheme and generate illicit profits in connection with numerous securities transactions on which he advised Oak and the Oak funds. Among other things, Ahmed overstated the prices of investments in companies that he presented to Oak, including by altering deal documents, and pocketed the difference for himself. Ahmed also used fictitious invoices for purported expenses related to Oaks investment in various companies, which he caused Oak or the companies to pay and, again, pocketed the profits. Ahmed attempted to conceal his fraud by directing that Oak and the companies make payments to bank accounts that Ahmed claimed belonged to the counterparty to the deals, but which in fact Ahmed secretly owned and controlled. After directing his ill-gotten profits into these accounts, Ahmed subsequently transferred those funds into accounts held in his name and the names of family members and other related entities., The SEC alleges that Ahmed violated the federal antifraud laws and related SEC antifraud rules and seeks a final judgment ordering Ahmed to pay penalties, return allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and be subject to permanent injunctions from future violations of the antifraud laws. Numerous individuals and entities, including Ahmeds wife and entities that Ahmed allegedly controls, have been named as relief defendants for the purpose of preserving assets for any ultimate recovery., The SECs investigation was conducted by Jeffrey E. Oraker and Jay A. Scoggins of the Market Abuse Unit in the Denver Regional Office. The case has been supervised by Joseph G.

Prospective investors were told that they could buy common stock in publicly traded companies at substantial discounts, and that Gruber and Green could arrange for the future sale of such securities to institutional investors at a premium., The complaint further alleges that, in reality, Gruber and Green did not exist, the proposed investment strategy was a sham, and the statements made to investors were lies.  Investors not only failed to receive the profits that they were promised, but also lost their entire investments., The Commissions complaint alleges that investor funds were not used to purchase common stock as promised, but instead were deposited into six accounts opened by Dunoff at three different banks in Pennsylvania and Florida in the names of two fictitious companies.  Dunoff kept a portion of the proceeds for his own benefit, and transferred the remaining funds to bank accounts in the Philippines, Thailand, and Indonesia controlled by others involved in the scheme., The complaint charges Dunoff with violations of Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest and a penalty.

Cook, a resident of Indianapolis, Indiana. The Court found that Cook violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws by making false and misleading statements about Xytos, Inc. (Xytos), a company he controlled. The Court also found that Cook made unregistered sales of Xytos shares., In August 2013, the SEC filed this action against Cook, Xytos, and Asia Equities, Inc. (Asia Equities), which was another entity that Cook controlled. The SEC alleged that Cook committed securities fraud in connection with materially misleading statements during 2010-2013 regarding cancer treatments that Xytos, a purported biomedical company, supposedly was providing to patients., The SECs complaint alleged, among other things, that Cook created the impression on Xytos public website that Xytos medical staff, overseen by a chief medical officer, treated cancer patients at the Xytos Center for Advanced Medicine in Indianapolis. The complaint also alleged that Cook published financial statements on a popular investor website and listed revenues for Xytos in those financial statements. The complaint alleged that in fact, during 2010-2013, Xytos had no medical staff, no treatment facilities, no patients, and no revenues. The complaint also alleged Xytos shares traded publicly on the over-the-counter market. The complaint alleged that while making false and misleading representations about Xytos, Cook sold Xytos shares in unregistered open market transactions, and those Xytos stock sales provided Cooks primary source of income., After completion of discovery, the SEC moved for summary judgment against Cook. In granting the SECs motion for summary judgment, the Court found that Cook committed securities fraud through the Xytos website, press releases issued by Xytos, and a Xytos prospectus. The Court found that Cook made misrepresentations that included, among other things, that Xytos was a biomedical company that successfully treated patients suffering from cancer and other illnesses and that Xytos had obtained regulatory approval for its technology. The Court also found that Cook sold Xytos stock while making misrepresentations about the company and that Cook impermissibly sold Xytos stock on the open market without first filing a registration statement with the SEC for those stock sales. The Court found that Cook violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, and Securities Act Sections 5(a) and 5(c)., The Court imposed remedies on Cook that included permanent injunctions against future violations of the federal securities laws, a permanent bar against Cook serving as an officer or director of a public company or participating in an offering of a penny stock, and disgorgement plus prejudgment interest in the total amount of $642,828. The Court will determine the appropriate amount of a civil penalty against Cook at a later date., The Court also granted the SECs motion for entry of default judgments against Xytos and Asia Equities and permanently enjoined these entities from future violations of the federal securities laws., For further information, see <a href=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2013/lr22783.htm>Litigation Release No. 22783</a> (August 19, 2013).,  , <em>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2015/lr23328.htm</em><br/>]"

For each of the offerings, Schumacher and  Quantum diverted investor funds from the stated purpose of exploration and  development of oil and gas resources to instead cover undisclosed corporate  business overhead expenses and Schumacher’s compensation. Contrary to representations that  investor funds would be segregated in separate trust or escrow accounts, Schumacher  and his companies commingled funds in Quantum’s operating accounts, which was  then used to pay Schumacher’s lavish personal expenses including a  Porsche. The  defendants also concealed diversion of investor funds through phony “turnkey  drilling” contracts in which Quantum claimed to pay Quaneco to drill wells. Schumacher and his  companies have recently been soliciting funds for a new Utah-based oil-and-gas  investment program and planning to raise another $2 million., The SEC has warned investors about certain risks and  possible fraudulent activity involving private offerings of securities for oil-and-gas  ventures, and has issued an <a href=http://investor.gov/news-alerts/investor-alerts/investor-alert-private-oil-gas-offerings>investor  alert specifically about private oil-and-gas offerings</a> like those offered  by Schumacher and his companies., The SEC separately announced a settlement  with Quantum’s former co-principal and co-founder Paul Mysyk, who participated  in some of the offerings before he left the company in November 2012. Mysyk entered into a cooperation agreement with  the SEC to assist in the investigation of, and ongoing litigation against,  Schumacher, Quaneco, and Quantum., The complaint filed on Aug. 21, 2015, charges Schumacher,  Quantum and Quaneco with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the  Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of  1934 and Rule 10(b) thereunder.

Schenkier issued an Order (“Order”) requiring production of a second set of documents that Navistar International Corporation (“Navistar”) claimed to be privileged in response to investigative subpoenas issued by Commission staff.  The Commission filed an Application for an Order Compelling Compliance with Administrative Subpoenas against Navistar in December 2014 and filed an Amended Application in January 2015. , 	According to the Application, the Commission is investigating possible fraud relating to statements made by Navistar regarding its efforts to obtain a certificate of conformity from the U.S Environmental Protection Agency, certifying that Navistar’s engines complied with certain provisions of the Clean Air Act.  Pursuant to investigative subpoenas, Navistar was obligated to produce documents to the Commission. Navistar has produced many documents in response to the Commission’s subpoenas, but it also has redacted and withheld other documents on privilege grounds.  In the Application, the Commission requested that the Court overrule Navistar’s privilege claims over certain documents that the Commission alleged to involve lobbying and communications firms retained by Navistar, communications among only non-attorneys, and draft documents., 	In response to the Application, the Court initially reviewed a subset of 72 documents that Navistar has redacted and withheld on privilege grounds. In a June 30, 2015 Order (the “June 30 Order”), the Court overruled Navistar’s privilege assertions as to 46 documents in their entirety and overruled Navistar’s privilege assertions as to parts of 16 additional documents. The Court also ordered that in addition to the documents that the Court found not to be protected from production, Navistar must produce documents that Navistar in good faith determines not to be protected under the analysis employed by the Court’s in its rulings in the June 30 Order. In response to the June 30 Order, Navistar produced many – but not all – of the other documents from its privilege log that Navistar in good faith determined would not be protected by privilege based on the analysis employed by the Court. Subsequently, the Commission requested that the Court review a subset of 13 additional documents that Navistar had redacted on privilege grounds. In an August 31, 2015 Order (the “August 31 Order”), the Court overruled Navistar’s privilege assertions in their entirety as to five of these 13 additional documents and overruled Navistar’s privilege assertions in part as to three of these documents. In sum, in the June 30 and August 31 Orders, the Court overruled Navistar’s privilege assertions as to 51 documents in their entirety, overruled Navistar’s privilege assertions as to parts of 19 additional documents, and sustained Navistar’s privilege assertions in their entirety as to 15 documents.    , 	The Commission notes that it is continuing to conduct a fact-finding inquiry and has not concluded that anyone has broken the law., 	For further information, please see <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2015/lr23183.htm>Litigation Release Numbers LR-23183</a> (Jan. 29, 2015) and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2015/lr23297.htm>LR-23297</a> (July 6, 2015).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2015/lr23330.htm</i><br/>]"

Eric Aronson, Vincent Buonauro, and others told investors that there was a tremendous demand for the product - permeable paving stones - and that investors would be repaid from the profits generated by guaranteed product sales.  In reality, there was little demand for the product, and defendants used investors money to make interest and profit payments to earlier investors and to fund managements lavish lifestyles.  In addition, shortly after an affiliate of PermaPave Industries acquired a majority stake in Interlink-US-Network, Ltd., Eric Aronson, Fredric Aaron - who was the attorney for Eric Aronson and the entity defendants and also an officer and director for several of the entity defendants - and others issued a press release stating that a company that had never heard of Interlink intended to invest $6 million in Interlink., On August 24, 2015, the Court granted the Commissions motion for monetary relief.  Finding that the entity defendants were nothing more than a vehicle for fraud, the Court ruled that Aronson, Aaron, and Buonauro must disgorge all of the funds they received as part of the fraud and made them jointly and severally liable for all of the funds that went to unidentified persons through cash withdrawals.  The Court also imposed substantial civil penalties against Aronson for his lead role in the fraud and Aaron for his blatant abuse of his position and knowledge as a lawyer, and also imposed civil penalties against Buonauro., On September 1, 2015, the Court issued a final judgment ordering Aronson, Aaron, and Buonauro to pay the amounts set in its August 24 ruling.

Bliss, of Bountiful, Utah, operated an investment club that falsely promised returns in excess of 100 percent by day-trading Apple stock. In reality, Bliss lost more than $3 million day-trading and failed to use all of the investor funds for his stated purpose of day-trading.  The court imposed an asset freeze against Bliss at the SEC’s request., 	The SEC thereafter learned that Bliss concealed his ownership of a catamaran sailboat and secretly transferred possession to his brother-in-law, Kevin Fortney.  After the SEC moved for civil contempt against Bliss for violating the asset freeze, both Bliss and his brother-in-law, who was not charged in the SEC’s enforcement action, filed sworn declarations that the sailboat was owned by the brother-in-law and not by Bliss. In an order issued on August 14, the court found Bliss in contempt of the asset freeze order and referred the matter to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Utah for potential criminal charges. The U.S. Attorney’s Office presented the case to the grand jury. The resulting criminal charges against Bliss are based on the same violations of the asset freeze order that were the basis of the SEC’s civil contempt motion.,   The felony counts subject Bliss and Fortney to a potential prison sentence of as many as 15 years each and a monetary fine of up to $250,000 for each charge. , 	For more information see the following <a href=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2015/lr23196.htm>Litigation Release: 23196</a> (February 12, 2015).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2015/lr23332.htm</i><br/>]"

Waters of Norwood, Massachusetts, in an enforcement action filed by the Commission in May 2012. Janet Waters, a former registered representative of broker-dealer A.L. Waters Capital, LLC, is a relief defendant in that enforcement action. The action was filed by the Commission on an emergency basis to halt the fraudulent sales of fictitious investment-related partnerships by Janet Waters’ husband, defendant Arnett Waters, and the defendant entities he controlled: broker-dealer A.L. Waters Capital and investment adviser Moneta Management, LLC. Janet Waters consented to the entry of the final judgment against her, and the judgment holds her jointly and severally liable with Arnett Waters and his entities for $839,000 in disgorgement of ill-gotten gains. Under the judgment, this disgorgement order is deemed satisfied by a restitution order of over $9 million in a related criminal proceeding against Arnett Waters., 	In a related action, Janet Waters was barred from the securities industry in an Order issued by the Commission on September 2, 2015. That Order found that Janet Waters, who was her husband’s supervisor at the A.L. Waters Capital broker-dealer entity, failed reasonably to supervise Arnett Waters with a view to detecting or preventing his fraud., 	The Commission’s May 2012 civil enforcement action alleged that from at least 2009-2012, Arnett Waters and the entities he controlled engaged in a fraudulent scheme through which they raised at least $780,000 from at least 8 investors, including $500,000 from the Waters’ church, by promising to use investor funds to purchase a portfolio of securities. In fact, the funds were instead spent on the Waters’ personal and business expenses. Janet Waters was named as a relief defendant in this action based on her receipt of investor funds to which she had no legitimate claim. On May 3, 2012, the Court entered a preliminary injunction order freezing the assets of Arnett Waters and his entities, as well as those of Janet Waters. , 	The Commission’s civil action against Arnett Waters and his broker-dealer and investment adviser entities was previously resolved through the entry of final judgments by consent against them in December 2013. The Commission also previously barred Arnett Waters and A.L. Waters Capital from the securities industry in Orders issued in December 2012 and December 2013, respectively., 	In addition to the Commission’s actions against the various parties, the U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts brought criminal contempt charges against Arnett Waters in August 2012 and securities fraud and other criminal charges against Arnett Waters in October 2012.

To avoid detection and evade SEC reporting requirements as beneficial owners, they divided their shares among a vast network of foreign accounts and generated tens of millions of dollars in illegal profits as they sold the securities into artificially inflated markets.

And on July 24, 2015, the Honorable Ronnie Abrams of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against defendant Christopher Edwards.  In each of these cases, the defendants agreed to be enjoined from violating the antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws and to be barred from serving as officers or directors of public companies to settle the SECs charges.  Sutcliffe and Parker, who received bonuses as a consequence of their misconduct, were also required to disgorge this compensation., The SECs Complaint against Sutcliffe alleged that he manipulated CSCs financial results related to the companys multi-billion dollar contract with the United Kingdoms National Health Service (NHS).  Sutcliffe was CSCs finance director on the NHS contract at the time. The SEC alleged that after learning that CSC would lose money on the NHS contract, Sutcliffe added items to CSCs accounting models that artificially increased its profits but that had no basis in reality.  This fraudulently overstated CSCs earnings by approximately $200 million in the second quarter of its fiscal year 2010., The final judgment against Sutcliffe permanently enjoins him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) and 13b2-1 thereunder, and from aiding and abetting violations of Exchange Act Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.

In his settlement offer, Sutcliffe also consented to the issuance of an administrative order pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the Commissions Rules of Practice, suspending him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an accountant., In its Complaint against Parker, the SEC charged that he ignored basic accounting standards to increase CSCs profits.  Parker was CSC Australias Controller at the time.  The SEC alleged that Parker, along with CSCs former regional CFO, overstated the companys earnings by using cookie jar reserves and failing to record expenses as required.  This misconduct fraudulently overstated CSCs operating results by more than 5% in the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 and allowed the company to meet analysts earnings targets during that period. , The final judgment against Parker permanently enjoins him from violating Securities Act Section 17(a) and Exchange Act Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) and 13b2-1 thereunder, and from aiding and abetting violations of Exchange Act Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.

Edwards was a finance manager in CSCs Nordic region at the time.  The SECs Complaint charged that Edwards recorded and maintained large amounts of prepaid assets that CSC was instead required to record as expenses.  Edwardss actions resulted in CSC fraudulently overstating its consolidated operating income by 5% for the first quarter of fiscal year 2010, and in the company materially overstating the operating income of one of its reportable segments in each quarter of that fiscal year., The final judgment against Edwards permanently enjoins him from violating Securities Act Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) and Exchange Act Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) and 13b2-1 thereunder, and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.

23349,2015,[<h3>Court Orders Company to Pay More Than $6.5 Million in U.S. Stock Manipulation Scheme</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that on September 14, 2015, a federal court in New York entered a final judgment by default against 8000, Inc., a Virginia-based company, that ordered it to pay $6,525,000 in a civil penalty in a stock manipulation case filed by the Commission in 2012. The Commission alleged that the Company issued numerous false press releases to inflate the value of the company so that certain parties could benefit., In addition to 8000, Inc., the Commissions complaint, filed on September 27, 2012, also charged Jonathan Bryant, a consultant for the company as well as the companys former Chief Executive Officer, Thomas Kelly of Levittown, Pennsylvania, and the companys attorney, Carl N. Duncan of Bethesda, Maryland. The complaint alleged that the defendants participated in a scheme to manipulate the trading volume and price of 8000 Inc.s common stock by disseminating false information about the company and simultaneously selling or facilitating the sale of its securities which were not supposed to be for sale to the general public. According to the complaint, from November 2009 through October 2010, Bryant and Kelly disseminated financial reports and press releases falsely representing that 8000, Inc. had millions of dollars in capital financing and revenues when, in fact, the company had neither. As 8000, Inc.s stock price rose based on the false information they were disseminating, Bryant profited by selling 56.8 million restricted shares of 8000, Inc. into the market. Because the shares were restricted, they should not have been sold into the market at that time. The complaint alleged that Duncan provided false legal opinions removing the trading restrictions on the stock, and that Kelly profited from the scheme by buying and selling the companys securities in the secondary market. The complaint alleged that the defendants scheme increased the volume of trading in 8000, Inc. by 93% and the companys stock price from less than $0.01 per share to $0.42 per share between November 2009 and October 2010., In addition to ordering 8000, Inc. to pay $6.5 million, the final judgment entered by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York permanently enjoins 8000, Inc. from future violations of various antifraud and securities registration sections of the federal securities laws, including Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder., The judgment against 8000, Inc. concludes the Commissions case. Defendants Bryant, Kelly, and Duncan all previously settled the Commissions action. Bryant consented to the entry of a final judgment that was entered on April 7, 2015. The final judgment permanently enjoined Bryant from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The final judgment also ordered Bryant to disgorge the $2,969,525 in profits that he realized from selling 8000, Inc.s restricted securities and to pay $198,659.70 in pre-judgment interest. Additionally, the final judgment barred Bryant from acting as an officer or director of any issuer that has a class of securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act, and permanently barred him from participating in an offering of a penny stock., Kelly consented to the entry of a final judgment that was entered on June 6, 2013, which permanently enjoined Kelly from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. It also permanently barred Kelly from acting as an officer or director of any issuer that has a class of securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act, and permanently barred him from participating in an offering of a penny stock. On September 2, 2014, after a hearing, the court ordered Kelly to pay $415,569 in profits that he realized from trading in 8000 Inc.s securities in the secondary market and to pay $46,697 in pre-judgment interest., Duncan agreed to settle the Commissions action at the time it was filed. In December 2012, the court entered a final judgment against Duncan that permanently enjoined Duncan from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act, permanently enjoined him from participating in the preparation and issuance of certain opinion letters, bars him from participating in an offering of a penny stock, and ordered him to disgorge $15,570 in unlawful proceeds and to pay $524.98 in prejudgment interest and a $25,000 civil money penalty.

These press releases portrayed a company with considerable financial acumen and resources actively engaged in a wide variety of business ventures including: a ski resort, the manufacture of karaoke booths, the funding of an event center in Long Beach, California, and an agreement with a major higher education institution to provide financial consulting expertise and to help restructure and secure financing., On September 17, 2012, the Commission suspended trading in the securities of Mobile Star after the dissemination of the press releases.

According to the complaint, ANE was, in reality, primarily a scheme that Milligan used to fund his personal lifestyle, which included cash withdrawals, gambling, travel, and shopping.

The transactions were structured to improve URIs 2000 and 2001 financial results by allowing URI to recognize revenue prematurely and to inflate the profit generated from the sales.  The complaint further alleges that Apuzzo substantially assisted URI and Nolan in implementing the fraudulent scheme by, among other things, signing agreements with URI that he knew or was reckless in not knowing were designed to hide URIs continuing risks and financial obligations relating to the sale-leaseback transactions, and directing or approving the issuance of inflated invoices that he knew or was reckless in not knowing URI, through Nolan and others, would use to inflate URIs gain on the transactions.

McPhail was sentenced to 18 months in prison and two years of supervised release for his role in an insider trading ring that traded on inside information about Massachusetts-based American Superconductor Corporation.  McPhail had previously been found guilty by a jury of criminal charges of conspiracy and securities fraud for his conduct.  The criminal charges against McPhail arose out of the same conduct that is the subject of a civil insider trading action filed by the Commission against McPhail and others in July 2014., The U.S. Attorneys Office for the District of Massachusetts indicted McPhail and another defendant, Douglas Parigian, in a Superseding Information dated May 11, 2015.  The Information charged that McPhail had a history, pattern and practice of sharing confidences with an individual who had material, nonpublic information concerning American Superconductors quarterly earnings and other business activities (the Inside Information).  This individual provided McPhail with the Inside Information with the understanding that it would be kept confidential.  Instead, McPhail used email and other means to provide the Inside Information to his friends, including Parigian, with the intent that they profit by buying and selling American Superconductor stock and options.  Parigian used this information to profit on the purchase and sale of American Superconductor stock and options.  On June 16, 2015, a jury convicted McPhail of conspiracy and securities fraud.  In May 2015, Parigian pled guilty to criminal charges of conspiracy and securities fraud for his conduct and was later sentenced to eight months of home confinement followed by three years of supervised release., In July 2014, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action against Eric McPhail and six of his golfing buddies, including Parigian, alleging that McPhail repeatedly provided non-public information about American Superconductor.  McPhails source was an American Superconductor executive who belonged to the same country club as McPhail and was a close friend.  According to the complaint, from July 2009 through April 2011, the executive told McPhail about American Superconducters expected earnings, contracts, and other major pending corporate developments, trusting that McPhail would keep the information confidential.  Instead, McPhail misappropriated the inside information and tipped his friends, who improperly traded on the information.  Four defendants settled the SECs charges, without admitting or denying the allegations, by consenting to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of the Exchange Act, paying disgorgement and civil penalties.

Beard vastly inflated SMFs revenues through a fraudulent billing scheme., The SECs action, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, alleges that SMF overbilled certain mobile fueling customers, including the U.S. Postal Service, by charging for fuel that was not delivered and adding surcharges that the customers contracts did not permit. As a result, the SEC alleges that Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based SMF materially overstated its revenues, profit margins, shareholders equity and net income, and understated its liabilities in its annual reports for fiscal years 2010 and 2011, its quarterly reports in its fiscal year 2011 and the first half of fiscal year 2012, and other reports filed on Form 8-K over the same time period., According to the SECs complaint, the overbilling began in 2004 as a minor contributor to SMF Energys financial performance but later made the difference between the company being profitable and posting net losses.  The complaint alleges the four officers participated in the fraudulent scheme and that Gathright, Shore and Messenbaugh overstated SMFs revenues and net income in SMFs public filings.  According to the complaint, Gathright, of Pompano Beach, Florida; Shore, of Miami, and Messenbaugh, of Plantation, Florida, each reviewed the allegedly fraudulent annual and quarterly reports that Gathright and Shore signed and certified as accurate.  Messenbaugh signed the allegedly fraudulent annual reports and Gathright signed the reports filed on Form 8-K that allegedly contained material misrepresentations and omissions., The SECs complaint alleges violations and the aiding and abetting violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and violations or aiding and abetting violations of the books and records, internal controls, disclosure and reporting, and certification provisions in Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13, 13a-14, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder.

(“Astound”), a Delaware corporation, and GenAudio’s founder and chief executive officer, Taj Jerry Mahabub, a resident of Broomfield, Colorado, with the fraudulent and unregistered offer and sale of more than $6.8 million in GenAudio stock., 	According to the Commissions complaint, from approximately March 2010 through April 2012, GenAudio raised more than $4.5 million in two private placements of its common stock based in large part on representations that Apple, Inc.

The Commission’s complaint alleges that GenAudio and Mahabub told prospective investors that Apple’s senior management advocated acquiring GenAudio’s technology, and that a third party had valued GenAudio’s technology at more than $1 billion. However, the Commission alleges that in fact, GenAudio had only demonstrated its technology and had technical discussions with mid-level Apple personnel, none of whom had indicated that Apple was interested in a transaction with GenAudio. The Commission further alleges that during the scheme, Mahabub falsified documents and pocketed more than $2.3 million through his offer and sale of his personal stock in GenAudio., 	The Complaint alleges that, based on this conduct, GenAudio and Mahabub violated Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Gilliam of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California entered a final judgement against defendants Ranjan Mendonsa and Ammar Akbari.  Mendonsa and Akbari were two of four defendants charged with insider trading in Ross Stores securities based on nonpublic sales information leaked by one of the retailers employees., In its complaint, the SEC alleges that defendant Saleem Khan was routinely tipped by his friend, defendant Roshanlal Chaganlal, who was a director in the finance department at Ross headquarters in Dublin, California.  Khan allegedly used the confidential information to illegally trade ahead of the companys public release of sales results.  Khan also allegedly tipped his work colleagues, Mendonsa and Akbari, so they too could trade in Ross securities.  The complaint further alleges that between August 2009 and December 2012, the insider trading ring spearheaded by Khan amassed millions of dollars in illegal profits., Mendonsa and Akbari agreed to settle the charges against them without admitting or denying the SECs allegations, and they consented to the entry of final judgment.  The final judgment against Mendonsa imposes a permanent injunction against future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and orders Mendonsa to pay $614,375 in disgorgement, penalties, and prejudgment interest.

23375,2015,"[<h3>Court Orders Canadian Pump-And-Dump Operator, Massachusetts-Based Public Company, and Others Involved in Fictitious Buyout Offer to Pay Over $7 Million</h3>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission) announced today that on September 30, 2015, the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts issued an order setting final judgments in an enforcement action filed in December 2012 against defendants Jean-François Amyot, the orchestrator of a pump-and-dump scheme, and Spencer Pharmaceutical Inc. (Spencer), a publicly-traded company with addresses in both Boston, Massachusetts, and Canada. The Court also ordered the entry of final judgments against IAB Media Inc. (IAB Media) and Hilbroy Advisory Inc. (Hilbroy), two Canadian companies controlled by Amyot. Among other things, the final judgments will order the parties to variously pay a total of $ 7,084,764 in disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and sanctions., According to the Commissions complaint, filed on December 17, 2012, Amyot, Spencer, Hilbroy, and IAB Media were involved in a pump-and-dump scheme in 2010 and 2011 involving Spencers publicly-traded stock. The complaint alleges that the scheme was orchestrated by Amyot, a Canadian resident who controlled Spencer, Hilbroy, and IAB Media.  According to the complaint, Amyot worked with the three companies, as well as Spencers two officers and directors, to create and disseminate false and misleading press releases and to otherwise promote Spencers stock, including via websites and newsletters. The complaint alleges that, among the false and misleading press releases were a series of releases that claimed that Spencer had received an unsolicited buyout offer from a Mideast company for $245 million. In fact, the purported buyout offer was not real. According to the complaint, the promotional campaign significantly pumped up the price of Spencers stock - at one point causing the price to more than double in two days - and consequently enabled Amyot to dump tens of millions of shares into the market at artificially inflated prices for gross proceeds in excess of $5 million. The complaint further alleged that Spencer, Spencers CEO, and Amyot violated certain provisions of the federal securities laws by transferring millions of Spencer shares in an effort to evade registration requirements., The final judgments, which will be entered by default, will permanently enjoin Amyot, Spencer, Hilbroy, and IAB Media from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The final judgments against Amyot and Spencer will further enjoin them from violating Sections 5(a) and (c) of the Securities Act, and the final judgment against Amyot will also permanently bar Amyot from serving as a director or officer of a public company and from participating in a penny stock offering. The final judgments will also require Amyot, Hilbroy, and IAB Media to collectively pay $5,879,339 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest and $1,050,000 in penalties ($750,000 by Amyot and $150,000 each by Hilbroy and IAB Media). The final judgment against Spencer will require the company to pay a penalty of $150,000., The Court also imposed additional monetary sanctions of $5,425 against Amyot who, with no notice to the Court or the Commission, failed to appear at the trial, which had been scheduled to commence on Monday, November 17, 2014.  His failure to appear resulted in the Court immediately entering a default against him and the Court awarded sanctions in the amount of 15.5 hours of attorneys fees for the Commissions final pretrial preparations the day before trial. The Court previously defaulted Spencer, IAB Media, and Hilbroy after each failed to appear as parties in the case., The Court previously entered final judgments against Spencers two officers, Maximilien Arella and Ian Morrice, on September 25, 2014. Arella and Morrice each consented to the entry of the final judgments, which permanently enjoined them from future violations of certain antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, barred both for a period of five years from serving as a director or officer of a public company and from participating in a penny stock offering, and ordered them to each pay $50,000 penalties. , The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Quebec Autorité des Marchés Financiers in connection with this matter., The Commission suspended trading in Spencer securities on December 17, 2012 (Release <a href=/litigation/suspensions/2012/34-68447.pdf>34-68447</a>).

According to the SEC’s complaint, filed on September 30, 2015 in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, Commodore and Schlegel engaged in a scheme to defraud investors by misappropriating almost half of investor funds to pay exorbitant commissions to Calvo and his boiler room operation as well as for Schlegel’s own personal use, which included private jet charters and Las Vegas casino expenses., 	The complaint alleges Commodore and Schlegel compounded their fraud by falsely telling investors that the vast majority of their money—80% to 90%—would be used to fund oil and gas operations, and that Commodore was an experienced, Texas-based oil and gas company with a proven track record of profitability. The complaint further alleges that only about half of investor funds went toward oil and gas operations. In addition, the complaint alleges that Commodore had no real Texas presence, and neither Commodore nor Schlegel had any actual oil and gas experience, let alone a proven track record of profitability. Further, Commodore and Schlegel allegedly falsely represented to existing investors that Commodore was almost finished preparing checks to pay returns on their current investment in order to solicit investments for a new project. According the complaint, however, the current investment had not yet generated any revenue. M&amp;G and Calvo also lied about the exorbitant commissions they actually received., 	The Commission alleges that defendants violated Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 and the antifraud provisions of the securities laws in Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act. Finally, the complaint alleges that M&amp;G and Calvo violated Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act by acting as unregistered broker-dealers.

Previously, as alleged in the complaint, Lester was involved in the sale of unregistered securities for a group of investment funds known as Equity Edge, which was struggling to repay investors.  Among other things, the SECs complaint alleges that Rubicon had guaranteed Equity Edges performance, and that Lester devised a fraudulent and undisclosed scheme to use $2.8 million of CFI investor funds to satisfy Rubicons repayment obligations to the Equity Edge investors., In addition, the SEC alleges that the CFI and NuPower offerings violated several registration provisions of the federal securities laws.  As the complaint alleges, both the CFI and NuPower offerings were unregistered and not subject to any applicable exemption, CFI and NuPower acted as investment companies without registering with the SEC, and Rubicon and Lester effectuated transactions in securities without registering with the SEC as a broker or associating with a registered broker., The complaint alleges that, based on this conduct, Lester, Rubicon, and CFI violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; Rubicon and Lester violated Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder; Lester, Rubicon, CFI, and NuPower violated Sections 5(a) and (c) of the Securities Act; and CFI and NuPower violated, and Lester and Rubicon aided and abetted violations of, Section 7(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940.

The Court granted the Commission’s request for permanent injunctions against Premiere and Jerry Jankovic, held them jointly and severally liable for disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and ordered them to pay civil penalties., 	The SEC’s complaint alleges that soon after forming Premiere, a company purportedly pursuing energy-related projects on Native American land, Jerry Jankovic and his son, CEO John Jankovic, agreed to divert about half of the funds raised from investors in Premiere to cover the costs of an unrelated lawsuit pending against Jerry Jankovic and a business associate, Sandra Dyche. As a result of this agreement, the Jankovics and Dyche allegedly diverted $1 million out of a total of $1.95 million raised for Premiere. The SEC alleged that in addition to misleading Premiere investors about how their funds would be used, Premiere made misrepresentations to investors about its affiliates, board membership, its auditor, and about Jerry Jankovic’s “proven track record” of creating “successful” energy companies., 	Neither Premiere nor Jerry Jankovic answered the Commission’s complaint. On October 9, 2015, United States District Judge Katherine Polk Failla entered default judgments against them.

According to the SECs complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri, Williams took advantage of the trust the investor placed in him and repeatedly solicited and raised money based on representations that the funds would only be used for specific investments., The SECs complaint alleges that between February 2009 and May 2014, Williams raised more than $8.1 million from the investor, including at least $2.6 million for Energy Operations Trust (Energy Operations), which Williams established to offer revenues derived from gold and manganese mines located in Central America, and $5.5 million for American Hydraulic Power, LLC (AHP), which Williams founded to develop and commercialize an energy efficient technology licensed from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.  According to the complaint, Williams also raised smaller amounts from the investor to develop an island off of the coast of Panama and to secure control of a large foreign bank account to provide additional funding for AHP., The SEC alleges that Williams failed to inform the investor that he had misappropriated and diverted over $3.1 million, more than 38% of the total funds he had raised from the investor.  According to the complaint, among other things, Williams used these funds to pay numerous personal expenses including paying for his daughters wedding, credit card bills, restaurant and grocery bills, healthcare expenses, holiday gifts and entertainment expenses.

Metro allegedly passed the information to Eydelman through a mutual friend, Frank Tamayo, who <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2015/lr23302.htm>settled a separately filed SEC complaint</a>.

The SEC alleged that following this exchange Eydelman returned to his office and typically gathered research about the target company, which he then emailed to Tamayo to create a false paper trail with a justification for the trading.  Eydelman then allegedly traded for himself, Tamayo, and other customers., In the proposed final judgment, which is subject to court approval, Eydelman would be ordered to disgorge his ill-gotten gains of $1,236,657 but that payment would be deemed satisfied by the entry of orders of forfeiture or restitution in the parallel criminal case, in which he has pled guilty.

Instead, the complaint alleges that STC and the Browns used most of the proceeds to make Ponzi-like payments to existing preferred stock shareholders, to cover obligations and expenses of the Browns’ other affiliated entities, and for undisclosed speculative investments., 	The complaint also alleges that between 2008 and 2013, the Browns, acting through their related investment advisers, Rampart Capital Management, LLC (“RCM”) and Brown Investment Advisors, Inc. (“BIA”), raised approximately $7.9 million from over 100 investors in multiple states through the sale of notes issued by the Rampart Fund for the purported purpose of investing in mezzanine debt financing programs. However, the Browns allegedly concealed from investors the default by the Rampart Fund’s primary underlying investment, and the Rampart Fund’s use of investor proceeds to pay interest and redemptions due to other Rampart Fund investors and to make investments in the Browns’ affiliated entities., 	Furthermore, the complaint alleges that from approximately 2004 through 2015, the Browns used TCN to raise over $12 million from 70 investors in multiple states in various estate planning products, including charitable gift annuities. But due to losses on various speculative investments, by 2008 Kevin Brown allegedly began operating TCN as a Ponzi-like scheme by using funds from new investors to meet TCN’s older annuity and other obligations.

At the Commissions request, the U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada has entered a temporary restraining order halting the offering, as well as an order freezing the defendants assets and the assets of relief defendants Alanah Energy, LLC and Pyckl LLC., The Commissions complaint alleges that, since at least 2014, defendants have engaged in a deceptive scheme on crowdfunding websites and the companys website to solicit investors to purchase overriding royalty interests in undeveloped oil and gas wells.  According to the complaint, Ascenergy has raised approximately $5 million from approximately 90 investors.  Ascenergy has already spent at least $1.2 million of the offering proceeds, but only a few thousand dollars appear to have been used for oil and gas-related expenses.  Instead, the complaint alleges that a significant part of the $1.2 million has been spent on payments to Mr. Gabaldon or companies he controls, or for expenses unrelated to the oil and gas business.  Further, immediately after the Commission subpoenaed Mr. Gabaldon, Ascenergy allegedly transferred $3.8 million — virtually all of the remaining offering proceeds — to Pyckl LLC, a San Jose, California company that has no apparent connection to the oil and gas business., The Commission contends that Ascenergy has also made multiple, material misrepresentations about the company and the nature of the offering.  Ascenergy allegedly falsely holds itself out as a credible energy company, and it presents the investment as a novel and extremely low-risk opportunity that will essentially guarantee investors out-sized returns.  The Commissions complaint alleges that, in reality, Ascenergy is, at best, offering a high-risk investment in undeveloped and unproven conventional oil and gas wells., The complaint alleges that defendants violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

To date, the Court-appointed Receiver has distributed approximately $2.3 million to approximately 2,000 victims of life settlement offerings purportedly bonded by PCI. After payment of fees and expenses, any remainder will be paid over to the United States Marshall for payment towards PCI’s asset forfeiture obligation in the parallel criminal case. , 	The SEC’s case was initiated on January 19, 2011, when the SEC charged PCI, Vargas, and PCI’s purported outside auditor Jorge L. Castillo (Castillo) with conducting a massive life settlement bonding fraud. According to the complaint, PCI provided financial guarantee bonds on life insurance policies, which intermediaries then packaged and sold as bonded life settlement investments across the U.S. and abroad. From at least 2004 through March 2010, PCI issued approximately 197 bonds with a face value of more than $670 million. The SEC alleged that PCI, Vargas, and Castillo misrepresented PCI’s ability to satisfy its obligations under its bonds. They made material misrepresentations about the assets that backed PCI’s bonds, PCI’s credit rating, the availability of reinsurance to cover claims on PCI’s bonds, and whether PCI’s financial statements had been audited.

The SEC alleges that Zhichen Zhou used funds provided by his cousin, Yannan Liu, to trade illegally, resulting in profits of approximately $300,000.  The SEC further alleges that Liu, who was formerly employed by a private equity firm that was a bidder in both the MedAssets and Chindex International acquisitions, provided the non-public information about the acquisitions to Zhou.  The announcement of the MedAssets acquisition, which occurred last week on November 2, 2015, caused the stock to rise more than 30%.  Similarly, Chindex Internationals stock rose more than 13% on February 17, 2014, the date of the announcement., According to the SECs complaint, Zhou, a resident of Beijing, China, used a newly opened brokerage account to purchase almost 40,000 shares of MedAssets at a cost of nearly $900,000.  Liu, a resident of Hong Kong, provided the bulk of the funds used to purchase the stock.  The nearly $900,000 in purchases of MedAssets represented more than four times Zhous stated net worth., The SEC also alleges that Zhou illegally profited from trades in Chindex International based on information provided by Liu.  In that instance, Zhou purchased more than 3000 shares leading up to the acquisition announcement and reaped profits of approximately $7,500., The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York granted the SECs request for an asset freeze against monies held in Zhous United States brokerage accounts, and issued an order to show cause why an injunction and other miscellaneous relief should not issue.

Collins (“Collins”), a resident of Wichita Falls, TX, orchestrated a scheme targeting elderly investors through his unincorporated retirement planning business, Collins Insurance Companies a/k/a BMC Retirement Planning dating back to at least 2010.  Collins lured at least 36 investors, most of whom are older than 65 years of age, to invest more than $4.6 million by offering high-yield, unsecured notes.   Collins assured investors that he would use their funds to grow his business, and in turn pay significant returns to investors from new business generation and revenue growth. , 	The SEC’s complaint alleges that Collins’s promises were false and that he rarely used investor funds to expand his business, spending less than 2% of investors’ funds for this purpose.  Instead, he used investor funds on a number of personal expenditures, including mortgage and luxury car payments, and to make principal and interest payments to earlier investors.  Collins kept the scheme alive for several years by relying on a stream of new and repeat investors, as well as two “personal loans” from a friend to avoid missing monthly payments to investors. , 	Collins has agreed to settle the SEC’s action against him by consenting to an injunction against violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and agreeing pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $573,234.16, and a $160,000 civil penalty.  The settlement is subject to court approval by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas., 	The SEC’s investigation was conducted by Scott Mascianica and Melvin Warren in the Fort Worth Regional Office, and supervised by Assistant Regional Director Eric Werner.  The SEC’s litigation will be led by Janie Frank., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2015/comp23404.pdf>SEC Complaint</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2015/lr23404.htm</i><br/>]"

Miller (Miller) and two private investment vehicles that he controlled, 5 Star Commercial, LLC (5 Star Commercial) and 5 Star Capital Fund, LLC (5 Star Capital), alleging that he made material misrepresentations to investors and perpetrated a fraudulent scheme in raising investor funds for the 5 Star entities., On November 6, 2015, the court issued a temporary restraining order (TRO) freezing the assets of Miller and the 5 Star entities, and prohibiting each of the defendants from soliciting, accepting or depositing any monies from actual or prospective investors while the TRO is in effect., According to the SECs complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Indiana, starting in 2008, Miller recruited investors for a number of private investment entities that he created.  Miller recruited investors for 5 Star Commercial, 5 Star Capital and his other real estate entities from a network of predominantly novice investors, including members of the local Amish community.  From July 29, 2014 to the present, he raised at least $3.9 million from more than 70 investors for his 5 Star Commercial and 5 Star Capital entities., The Complaint further alleges that in raising those funds, Miller repeatedly lied to prospective investors.  He falsely told investors that he would receive no compensation for managing the fund when, in reality, he paid himself at least $365,435 out of 5 Star Commercials accounts and also took more than $645,000 from 5 Star Commercials bank account to pay a personal debt he owed to a former business partner.  Second, Miller and 5 Star Commercial informed investors that their money would be invested exclusively in real estate when, in reality, he invested and/or transferred over $391,000 of 5 Star Commercials funds into highly speculative, fledgling companies that purportedly made and marketed green products.   In addition, he told defrauded prospective investors in 5 Star Capital that 5 Star Capital owned patents on many of the green products in which he would invest their funds; assured investors that he would manage risks on behalf of 5 Star Capital; and orally represented to at least one 5 Star Capital investor that his money would be invested in real estate.  None of these representations were true.  In reality, 5 Star Capital owned no green product patents, Miller performed virtually no due diligence into the purported green companies before handing them the lions share of 5 Star Capitals assets, and the overwhelming majority of 5 Star Capitals assets were not invested in real estate., The SEC brought this enforcement action against Miller and 5 Star entities to ensure that no further securities law violations are committed, to secure assets from potential dissipation and to safeguard investors from further harm.  The SEC is seeking disgorgement of funds in the possession of Miller or the 5 Star entities as a result of the securities fraud so if possible any remaining funds can be returned to victims of the scheme., The SECs complaint charges that Miller and the 5 Star entities violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint seeks final relief in the form of a permanent injunction against Miller and the 5 Star entities, disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty against each defendant. , The SECs investigation was conducted by Jaclyn J.

Cooper and His Companies to Pay More Than $7.3 Million</h3>],"[	The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey awarded summary judgment and entered a final judgment in favor of the SEC against defendants Brett A. Cooper, Global Funding Systems LLC, Dream Holdings, LLC, Fortitude Investing, LLC, Peninsula Waterfront Development, LP, and REOP Group Inc. The Court found that Cooper conned investors out of more than $2 million through various frauds, including advance fee schemes guaranteeing astronomical returns to investors in purported prime bank transactions and overseas debt instruments. The final judgment requires Cooper and his companies to pay more than $7.3 million as the outcome of a civil enforcement action originally filed in September, 2013. , 	In its pleadings and other court papers, the SEC alleged that the defendants, from at least November 2008 through about April 2012, perpetrated three fraudulent schemes and engaged in various fraudulent and deceitful acts, practices and courses of business in furtherance of those schemes. , 	The Court found that Cooper, through his companies, lured investors into fictitious “Prime Bank” or “High-Yield” investment contracts with the promise of extraordinary returns on their investments in a matter of weeks, with little to no risk. The purported investments involved the purchase of bank instruments, including “standby letters of credit” (“SBLCs”) and “bank guarantees”, from major international banks. The instruments were to be “monetized” or “traded” on a “platform” generating astronomical profits from complex and secretive transactions. None of the investors received any returns on the money they invested with Cooper or his companies, and none of it was used to acquire any bank instruments or SBLCs. The Court found that Cooper spent investors’ money on hotels, cars, and other personal items., 	The Court also found that Cooper participated in a ”finders fee” scheme, where Cooper, through his company REOP Group Inc., entered into an agreement whereby Cooper and REOP would receive a fee for finding a bank or brokerage firm to accept a purported Brazilian bond for listing and eventual sale. In furtherance of his fraud, Cooper or others acting at his direction forged emails and letters purportedly from a brokerage firm, making it appear that the bond had been accepted for sale, thus entitling defendants to a fee. , 	On November 5, 2015, the District Court granted the SECs motion for summary judgment on liability against Cooper and entered default judgment against the other defendants. In its opinion, the Court found that Cooper perpetrated three schemes alleged against him and that he knew the fictional investments he touted to investors did not exist. Among other deceptive conduct, “Cooper faked his identity, posing as an escrow agent, a registered representative at a broker-dealer, and signing documents using others’ names…. Cooper also created a fake escrow company, complete with a website and email accounts, and two fictitious attorneys to run the nonexistent firm. He then used that fake firm to lure investors into wiring millions into the bank accounts that he controlled.” The Court found that “Cooper violated the law repeatedly over a period of at least four years, using investor funds for his personal use. He had no gainful employment during this period and there is no evidence that the other Defendants had any business operations or earned any legitimate income. Cooper does not admit the wrongful nature of his conduct” and “[w]hen confronted by an investor regarding past frauds, he outright lied. The Court also noted that “Cooper has recently held himself out as a ‘millionaire’ investor, including on international news networks”. , 	The final judgment holds the defendants jointly and severally liable for disgorgement of proceeds defrauded from investors in a total amount of $2,146,160 and for prejudgment interest in the amount of $301,479. The judgment imposes civil money penalties of $2,447,639 against Cooper, $308,667 against Global Funding Systems LLC, $1,264,272 against Dream Holdings, LLC, $320,468 against Fortitude Investing, LLC, $500,216 against Peninsula Waterfront Development, LP, and $54,016 against REOP Group Inc. The judgment also provides injunctive relief by permanently enjoining Cooper from acting as an unregistered broker or dealer in violation of Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, enjoining all defendants from further violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5, and specifically enjoining all defendants from offering or selling similar prime bank instruments in the future., 	The SEC’s litigation was led by Stephen Kaiser and Melanie MacLean, with assistance from Supervisory Trial Counsel, Fred L.

The first computer or collection of computers to solve an equation is awarded new units of that virtual currency., The SEC alleges that Homero Joshua Garza perpetrated the fraud through his Connecticut-based companies GAW Miners and ZenMiner by purporting to offer shares of a digital Bitcoin mining operation.  In reality, GAW Miners and ZenMiner did not own enough computing power for the mining it promised to conduct, so most investors paid for a share of computing power that never existed.

The complaint further alleges that CN Capital touts the safety of the promissory notes, describing them to investors as 100% asset backed and backed by hard assets dollar for dollar.  In reality, according to the complaint, CN Capital has generated substantial losses each year since at least 2011 and is insolvent.  The Commission contends that contrary to representations made to investors portraying the notes as a secure investment capable of generating reliable investment returns, CN Capital basically operates as an ongoing Ponzi scheme through which the promised investment returns are paid using new investor money.  The complaint alleges that neither CN Capitals multi-million dollar per year operating losses nor its massive insolvency has ever been disclosed to investors., The complaint also alleges that CN Acceptance sells unregistered fractional interests in life settlement contracts (LS Interests) to investors and that CN Acceptance promises to pay the policy premiums using a portion of the purchase price.  But in practice, according to the complaint, Torchia disregards corporate formalities and commingles CN Acceptances funds with those of CN Capital, such that the LS Interests are now threatened by CN Capitals Insolvency.  The complaint further alleges that Torchia has transferred millions of dollars to entities he controls to support his and his familys other businesses and to pay his personal expenses.  According to the complaint, CN Capital and CN Acceptance, on average, have raised in excess of $2 million per month through the sale of notes and LS Interests in the first six months of 2015., The complaint alleges that the defendants violated and/or aided and abetted or caused violations of the antifraud provisions of the securities laws in Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.  The complaint also alleges that Torchia, CN Capital and CN Acceptance violated the registration provisions of the securities laws in Section 5 of the Securities Act., On November 20, 2015, the Court approved an Order by which the defendants agreed, among other things, not to offer or sell any additional promissory notes or to advertise investment opportunities via general solicitations. The Order also restricts the defendants ability to transfer assets and funds and to sell fractional interests in life settlements.

Gilmond for her participation in the fraudulent unregistered offer and sale of securities through Rex Venture Group LLC d/b/a ZeekRewards.com, an internet-based combined Ponzi and pyramid scheme.  According to the Complaint, from approximately January 2011 until August 2012, when the ZeekRewards website was shut down, Rex Venture Group raised more than $850 million from approximately one million internet customers nationwide and overseas through the website., The Complaint alleges that Gilmond solicited investors through the Internet and other means to participate in the ZeekRewards program, a self-described affiliate advertising division for the companion website, Zeekler.com, through which the company operated penny auctions.  The ZeekRewards program offered customers several ways to earn money, two of which - the Retail Profit Pool and the Matrix - involved purchasing securities in the form of investment contracts.  These securities offerings were not registered with the SEC as required under the federal securities laws., According to the Complaint, Gilmond and others lured investors to ZeekRewards by promising investors a share of the companys daily net profits in the form of daily profit share awards.  The companys purported calculations consistently resulted in daily award averaging approximately 1.5 percent per day, fraudulently conveying the false impression that the company was extremely profitable.  In fact, the daily award percentage was fabricated and investor payouts bore no relation to the companys net profits.  Approximately 98% of ZeekRewards total revenues and the net profits paid to investors were comprised of funds received from new investors in classic Ponzi scheme fashion.  When the company was shut down in August 2012, it was teetering on collapse., The Complaint further alleges that Gilmond was one of the most successful and prolific promoters of ZeekRewards.  From at least September 2011 until ZeekRewards was shut down in August 2012, Gilmond worked closely with the company founders and served as a senior field liaison to promote the scheme, persuading scores of unsophisticated retail investors to buy ZeekRewards securities upon the promise of profit sharing.  Gilmond also helped conceal from investors and regulators the true nature of the ZeekRewards scheme.  She policed affiliate advertisements and communications to ensure they did not use investment-related terms that otherwise may have triggered regulatory scrutiny.  Gilmond reaped more than $1.7 million in transaction-based commissions and bogus profit-sharing for her recruiting efforts., The Commission alleged that Gilmond offered and sold securities in violation of the registration provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act, acted as an unregistered broker-dealer in violation of Section 15 of the Exchange Act, and violated the antifraud provisions of the Section 17 of the Securities Act.  The Complaint requests a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties., The SECs investigation is continuing., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2015/comp23421.pdf>SEC Complaint</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2015/lr23421.htm</i><br/>]"

The jury found Fraiman guilty on one count of conspiracy and one count of mail fraud for his role in a boiler room scheme involving the sale of securities. The Commission previously charged Fraiman for the same conduct in a civil action. The scheme raised more than $4 million primarily from January 2008 through late August 2009 through the use of false promises and pressurized sales tactics with regard to the sale of securities in a group of related entities, most with the name “Envit,” that were owned and controlled by Edward M. Laborio, including a non-existent hedge fund.  Fraiman will be sentenced on March 10, 2016 by the Honorable F. Dennis Saylor, IV., 	On August 10, 2012, the Commission charged Laborio, Fraiman, Matthew K. Lazar, and the Envit entities in federal court for their roles in the Envit boiler room scheme.

Sullivan of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York issued a final judgment, on consent of defendant Timothy Quintanilla, which permanently enjoined him from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and ordered him to pay a $100,000 civil penalty.  Quintanilla was the former outside auditor of Electronic Game Card Inc. (EGMI).  This final judgment fully resolves the enforcement action before Judge Sullivan, in which final judgments were previously entered against three other defendants, former CEO Kevin Donovan, Lee Cole (Donovan’s predecessor as CEO), and Linden Boyne (EGMI’s former CFO), who the Commission charged with violations of the securities laws’ antifraud provisions and other violations. , 	The Complaint, filed in November 2012, alleged that Quintanilla, as the engagement partner for EGMI, violated the securities laws by authorizing the issuance of unqualified opinions for the years 2006 through 2008 by the accounting firm Mendoza Berger &amp; Co. LLP (“Mendoza Berger”).  The Complaint alleged that in Mendoza Berger’s audit reports, Quintanilla knowingly misrepresented that it had conducted audits of EGMI’s financial statements “in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)” (“PCAOB”) and that those statements “present[ed] fairly, in all material respects, the financial position” of EGMI.  In the course of its audit work, Quintanilla and the audit team he supervised failed to properly investigate a series of red flags, any number of which, if appropriately pursued, would have quickly uncovered large-scale fraud in EGMI’s financial statements.  Other evidence indicated that Mendoza Berger simply failed to audit significant portions of EGMI’s balance sheet.  To conceal those failures, Mendoza Berger employees, under Quintanilla’s supervision, created and backdated documents for the EGMI audit file shortly before an inspection by the PCAOB in September and October 2009., 	Without admitting or denying the allegations of the Complaint, Quintanilla consented to the final judgment which: (a) permanently enjoins him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b), 10A(a)(1),  and 10A(b)(1) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and (b) orders him to pay a $100,000 civil penalty., 	For further information see <a href=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22529.htm>Litigation Release 22529</a> (November 9, 2012), 23099 (September 30, 2014).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2015/lr23431.htm</i><br/>]"
