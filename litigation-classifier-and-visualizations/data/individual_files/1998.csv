M.T.L. INTERNATIONAL FINANCE, INC.,\r     EQUITY ACTION PARTNERS, INC., JOHN K. ROBINSON, LEON HOWARD, AND HARRY\r     WALKER, 96 Civ. 7412 (U.S.D.C., S.D.N.Y.) (RWS)\r\r          A federal grand jury in St. Louis has charged Leon J. Howard, Jr., and\r     John K. Robinson with twenty-seven counts of conspiracy, wire fraud,\r     interstate transportation of stolen money, and money laundering in\r     connection with a scheme to defraud investors through the purported sale of\r     Guaranteed Insurance Contracts to be issued by major European insurance\r     companies ( GICs ).  A third participant in the scheme, Harry Walker, pled\r     guilty in March 1997 to one count of money laundering. The case is being\r     prosecuted by the United States Attorney s Office for the Eastern District\r     of Missouri.\r\r          According to the indictment, in 1993 and 1994, Howard, 50, and\r     Robinson, 31, told numerous persons that a company with which they were\r     affiliated, M.T.L. International Finance, Inc., had obtained the right to\r     sell the GICs in the United States.  A GIC is a contract by which an\r     insurance company obtains money by pledging its accounts receivable for\r     future premium receipts.  The defendants allegedly represented that GICs\r     could be purchased from the European insurance companies and resold at a\r     profit on a continuous basis.  The indictment charges that Howard and\r     Robinson obtained $550,000 from five individual investors, which instead of\r     investing they misappropriated for their own use.\r\r          The indictment, which was returned under seal on November 26, 1997,\r     was unsealed after Robinson was arrested in California on December 17,\r     1997, released on a $25,000 bond, and ordered to appear in St. Louis on\r     January 5, 1998.  Howard, a St. Louis resident, was arrested on December 2,\r     1997, and released on a $10,000 bond.  Howard s trial is currently\r     scheduled for February 2, 1998, in the U.S. District Court in St. Louis. \r     The defendants face up to five years  imprisonment for each count of\r     conspiracy and wire fraud, and up to ten years for each count of interstate\r     transportation of stolen money and money laundering.  Walker has not yet\r     been sentenced on his guilty plea.\r\r          Howard, Robinson, and Walker are also defendants in a civil securities\r     fraud action brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission based on the\r     same scheme.  The Commission s action was filed in the U.S. District Court\r     in Manhattan in September 1996.  At the same time, the Commission s\r     Division of Enforcement brought public administrative proceedings against\r     Sidney H. Stires, a New York stockbroker, and his firm, Stires & Co., Inc.,\r\r\r\r\r                                        - 2 -\r\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c\r\r\r\r\r\r\r     alleging that they engaged in securities fraud in connection with the GIC\r     scheme.

Hirsch, Danny B. Kaminsky, Lewis A. Kooden, Daniel H.\r     Klugman and Michael D. Kooden in an insider trading case brought by the\r     Securities and Exchange Commission.

(GTI). \r     Specifically, the Commission alleged that Susan Hirsch, a former senior\r     account representative of Ruder-Finn, Inc., a New York-based public\r     relations firm, obtained non-public information about Sandoz\s confidential\r     bid for GTI during the course of her employment at Ruder-Finn in advance of\r     the Sandoz/GTI tender offer announcement, and improperly passed that\r     information to her brother Gregory Hirsch, a certified public accountant in\r     Savannah, Georgia.  The complaint alleged that Gregory Hirsch tipped and\r     purchased GTI common stock and call options jointly with a friend in\r     Savannah, Danny Kaminsky, in advance of the announcement for profits of\r     $251,190.  The complaint further alleged that on Friday, July 7, 1995, the\r     last trading day before the tender offer announcement, Kaminsky purchased\r     45 GTI call option contracts through a brokerage account of one of his\r     friends, at a time when Kaminsky knew that Sandoz was going to announce its\r     tender offer for GTI at $21 per share on the following Monday.\r\r          The complaint also alleged that Gregory Hirsch and Danny Kaminsky\r     tipped Lewis Kooden, Daniel Klugman and Michael Kooden, who purchased GTI\r     common stock and call options for illegal profits of $43,795, $28,107 and\r     $14,666, respectively.  In addition, the complaint alleged that Michael\r     Kooden caused others to trade in GTI securities.\r\r          Under the terms of the final judgment, Susan Hirsch was not ordered to\r     pay any disgorgement, civil penalties or prejudgment interest based upon\r     her demonstrated inability to pay.  Greg Hirsch was ordered to pay $93,837,\r     which represented a portion of his alleged trading profits; based upon his\r     demonstrated inability to pay, disgorgement of the remainder of his trading\r     profits and prejudgment interest were waived, and he was not ordered to pay\r     civil penalties.  Danny Kaminsky was ordered to pay $125,645 in\r     disgorgement, which represented the trading profits he allegedly received\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c\r\r\r\r\r\r\r     with Greg Hirsch, $169,440 in civil penalties and $25,244 in prejudgment\r     interest.

Specifically, the Complaint alleged that Mobile Services valued\r     certain franchise rights as exceeding $4 million, when, in truth, these\r     franchise rights were worthless; the allegedly overvalued assets\r     represented over 80 percent of Mobile Services\ assets.  The Complaint\r     alleged that the defendants knew that the franchisor was defunct, with the\r     result that the franchise rights were materially impaired when the filings\r     were made.  The Complaint also alleged that Cobban and Robinson made false\r     and misleading statements and omissions to Mobile Services\ independent\r     auditor in connection with his audit of the company\s 1993 financial\r     statements.  The Complaint further alleged that Mobile Services failed to\r     make and keep books and records which accurately and fairly reflected its\r     financial and accounting transactions.\r\r     "

Case No. 98-     001-CIV-ORL-22-C.          The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that it filed     a complaint today in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of     Florida in Orlando against Steven Samblis and his corporation New Stock,     Inc. (NSI).  According to the SEC\s Complaint, Defendant Samblis is a     resident of the Orlando, Florida area and self-professed stock picker.  The     SEC alleges that Samblis, together with co-defendant NSI, is passing     himself off as an independent and impartial stock picker when, in fact, he     is nothing more than a paid pitch man for the companies he hypes.          In its Complaint, the SEC alleges that in October 1997 Samblis     published a magazine, New Stock, in which he enthusiastically recommended     the securities of certain publicly-traded companies without disclosing that     he had been paid at least $20,000 to make these recommendations.  The SEC     also alleges that Samblis was paid to issue thousands of E-mails over the     Internet regarding these same securities.  The SEC learned of Samblis\     activities when detected by the Enforcement Division\s Internet     Surveillance program.          The SEC is seeking an expedited hearing and preliminary injunction     against Samblis and NSI for violating Section 17(b) of the Securities Act     of 1933.  Section 17(b) makes it illegal for any person to distribute any     publication recommending a security while being paid to do so without fully     disclosing that he has been or will be paid for recommending the stock and     the amount he has been or will be paid.  In addition to a preliminary     injunction, the SEC seeks a permanent injunction against Samblis and NSI,     disgorgement of ill-gotten profits, and civil money penalties.

The Court also\r     ordered the defendants to pay, jointly and severally, a $50,000 civil\r     penalty.

RAUSCHER PIERCE REFSNES, INC. and\r     JAMES R.

Feltham, in the United States District Court for the\r     District of Arizona.  The Commission\s complaint alleges that Rauscher and\r     Feltham defrauded their financial advisory client, the State of Arizona\r     Department of Administration (DOA  or the State), in connection with\r     DOA\s issuance of $129,640,000 of Series 1992B Refunding Certificates of\r     Participation (the 1992B COPs).  As part of the 1992B COPs offering, the\r     defendants allegedly sold certain United States Treasury securities (the\r     escrow securities) to the State at above-market prices.  According to the\r     complaint, inflating the escrow securities\ prices reduced the yields on\r     those securities and enabled Rauscher to make illegal profits at the\r     expense of the federal government while purporting to comply with the\r     federal tax laws governing the 1992B COPs offering, a practice commonly\r     referred to as yield burning.  Rauscher allegedly took an undisclosed\r     $707,037 profit on its sales to DOA.  The complaint further alleges that\r     Rauscher and Feltham failed to inform their client of this profit or that\r     any of the sales prices of the escrow securities had been inflated. \r     Instead, Rauscher and Feltham issued a materially false tax certification\r     (the Certification) in connection with the sale of the escrow securities \r     which falsely stated that Rauscher\s sale prices for the escrow securities\r     equalled their fair market value, that Rauscher\s sale of the securities\r     was an arm\s length transaction, and that Rauscher had priced the escrow\r     securities without regard to the yield of those securities.\r\r          The Commission\s complaint further charges that the State\s ability to\r     successfully market the 1992B COPs depended on the securities\ tax-exempt\r     status under federal law, and that the defendants\ alleged overcharges in\r     violation of applicable tax laws and regulations jeopardized the tax-exempt\r     status of the 1992B COPs.\r\r          According to the complaint, Rauscher and Feltham charged DOA a\r     fraudulent and excessive undisclosed markup on the escrow securities, in\r     that the prices charged DOA for such securities were not reasonably related\r     to prevailing market prices, and Rauscher\s $707,037 profit from the sale\r     of such securities was unreasonable in light of the circumstances\r     surrounding the sale.\r\r          Finally, the complaint alleges that in their capacities as financial\r     adviser and investment adviser to DOA, Rauscher and Feltham owed DOA\r     fiduciary duties to provide DOA with complete information and unbiased\r     advice and assistance in all aspects of the 1992B COPs offering.  The\r     defendants allegedly violated these duties by failing to disclose the\r     conflict of interest inherent in their selling DOA the escrow securities as\r     principal from Rauscher\s own account and taking the secret $707,037 profit\r\x0c\r\r\r\r\r\r\r     while at the same time purporting to give DOA independent investment\r     advice.\r\r          The complaint requests the Court to enjoin Rauscher from violating the\r     antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933,\r     Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5\r     thereunder, and Sections 206(1), (2), (3) of the Investment Advisers Act of\r     1940; to enjoin Feltham from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act\r     of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule\r     10b-5 thereunder; and to enjoin Feltham from aiding and abetting violations\r     of Sections 206(1), (2), and (3) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. \r     The complaint further requests the Court to order Rauscher and Feltham to\r     disgorge the profits from their illegal conduct and to impose civil\r     monetary penalties against them.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 2======\r\x0c"

The default\r     judgments also ordered disgorgement in the amount of $1,338,709.79 together\r     with prejudgment interest of $37,524.95, jointly and severally, against APC\r     and Rockett.\r\r     Approximately $280,600 of the $1,355,000 raised from investors was frozen\r     pursuant to an Order Freezing Assets obtained by the Commission on May 23,\r     1997.  The frozen funds were awarded to the Commission as disgorgement, and\r     will be disbursed to investors proportionately, resulting in a return to\r     investors of approximately 20 cents per dollar invested.  The disbursement\r     will take place on or before March 5, 1998.\r\r     The Commission charged in its Complaint, initially filed as a temporary\r     restraining order on May 20, 1997, that APC, located in Lake Forest,\r     California, and its owner Rockett fraudulently offered and/or sold units in\r     APC, in the form of $5,000 corporate notes, to at least one hundred\r     individuals since December 1996.  APC\s\r     stated business was to provide prepaid cellular telephone service to\r     credit-challenged individuals.  According to APC, in return for their\r     investment, APC promised investors a guaranteed 16 3/4% annual return, plus\r     1% of half of APC\s profits, and that the investor\s original contribution\r     would be returned at the end of one year.  Further, APC promised that\r     investors\ monies would be used to fund APC\s business operations. \r     Instead, however, Rockett misused and misappropriated at least $600,000 of\r     the approximately $1,355,000 raised from investors.  Of the monies the\r     Commission was able to trace, the Commission found that Rockett paid\r     himself cash payments of over $420,000, and made substantial payments to\r     APC s sales agents.  Additionally, no significant monies were spent to fund\r     APC s business.  Rockett also failed to inform investors that he had a long\r     history of securities law violations, including being twice convicted for\r     selling fraudulent investments and being the subject of numerous state\r     orders for violating state securities laws. \r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c"

SHELDON KRAFT, Civil Action No. 98-\r     CV-00095 (GK)(D.D.C.)\r\r     UNITED STATES v. SHELDON KRAFT, Cr. 98-18-A (E.D. VA.)\r\r          The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) today filed a\r     Complaint against Sheldon Kraft ( Kraft ), 46, a New York City stock\r     broker, in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. \r     This case is another in a line of significant Commission enforcement\r     actions and/or criminal prosecutions arising from this wide-ranging\r     investigation of microcap fraud involving Systems of Excellence, Inc.\r     ( SOE ) and other issuers.  The Complaint alleges that Kraft acted as the\r     principal facilitator for Charles O. Huttoe ( Huttoe ), formerly the\r     Chairman and CEO of SOE, in manipulating the market for the securities of\r     that company.  Simultaneously with the filing of the Complaint, Kraft\r     consented, without admitting or denying the Commission s allegations, to an\r     order enjoining him from violations of the securities registration and\r     antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, and requiring him to\r     disgorge his illegal gains of $3,193,337 from the manipulation of SOE\r     securities, together with prejudgment interest.  In satisfaction of the\r     disgorgement judgment, Kraft will disgorge all of his assets except his\r     residence and household items.  The disgorged assets include $1,107,000 in\r     cash, plus certain real estate and claims that he has against his former\r     employer. Any remainder of the disgorgement amount will be waived in light\r     of Kraft s demonstrated inability to pay based on his sworn representations\r     in his statement of financial condition.  Kraft also agreed to a Commission\r     order barring him from the securities industry and from participating in an\r     offering of penny stock.  The Commission s Complaint alleges the following: \r\r\r          Kraft met Huttoe in early 1995, and thereafter guided Huttoe\r     throughout the manipulation of SOE. When SOE s original software business\r     collapsed, Kraft found a high-tech video teleconferencing business to put\r     into the SOE shell so as to make it attractive to investors.  Thereafter,\r     Kraft introduced Huttoe to his  total world  -- Kraft s network of brokers,\r     market makers, and stock touters -- who Huttoe then bribed with SOE stock\r     to manipulate the price of SOE.  As a result of Kraft s introductions,\r     Huttoe entered into such arrangements with five stock promoters who were to\r     push sales of SOE stock to retail brokerage customers, three stock touters\r     who would disseminate recommendations to purchase SOE via mass media and\r     other means, and two traders at market making broker-dealer firms who\r     agreed to support the price of SOE.  As a result of these and other\r     manipulative activities, SOE s stock price rose from pennies to $4 9/16 per\r     share in just a few months.  In addition, Kraft directed Huttoe in\r     establishing nominee accounts through which Kraft secretly sold more than\r     6.3 million shares of SOE stock for Huttoe into the inflated market, on\r     which Huttoe realized proceeds of approximately $9.62 million of his more\r     than $12.5 million of illegal profits derived from the SOE manipulation. \r\r          For his part in the SOE fraud, Kraft demanded compensation in the form\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c\r\r\r\r\r     of direct cash payments from Huttoe and free trading shares of SOE stock\r     that he had Huttoe issue in the names of his nominees. Kraft also obtained\r     kickbacks from the persons he introduced to Huttoe in the form of cash or a\r     portion of the SOE stock Huttoe supplied them in exchange for carrying out\r     their roles in the manipulation.  Kraft then sold his free SOE stock  --  a\r     total of approximately 1.66 million shares -- into the inflated market\r     through nominee accounts in the United States and Canada.  In addition, in\r     exchange for directing the illegal sales of SOE stock in Huttoe s nominee\r     accounts, Kraft received his ordinary commissions, and a percentage of the\r     proceeds from the sale of stock through Huttoe s nominee accounts.  In\r     total, Kraft made illegal profits of $3,193,337 from his role in the SOE\r     scheme. \r      \r          The Commission\s Complaint alleges that as a result of that conduct\r     Kraft violated Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and\r     Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5\r     thereunder.  The court order to which Kraft consented enjoins him from\r     future violations of those provisions.  Kraft also consented to the entry\r     of a Commission order pursuant to Sections 15(b) and 19(h) of the Exchange\r     Act barring him from association with any broker, dealer, municipal\r     securities dealer, investment adviser or investment company, or\r     participation in any offering of penny stock, based on the entry of the\r     above injunction.\r\r          Also today in the United States District Court for the Eastern\r     District of Virginia, Kraft pleaded guilty to a two-count criminal\r     information charging him with one count of conspiracy to commit securities\r     fraud and money laundering and one count of failure to file tax returns. \r     Kraft\s plea was in connection with, among other things, the fraud\r     involving SOE.\r\r     Background\r\r          The Commission Prosecutions\r\r          The cases against Kraft are the latest in a series of actions that the\r     Commission and criminal authorities have filed against a number of\r     individuals and entities related to the manipulation of the securities of\r     SOE and two other microcap companies.  On November 7, 1996, the Commission\r     filed a Complaint and obtained emergency relief against Huttoe and twelve\r     other defendants, including SGA Goldstar Research, Inc., which disseminated\r     a tout sheet over the internet, and its principals, Theodore R. Melcher,\r     Jr. and Shannon B. Terry.  See SEC v. Huttoe, Et Al., 96-CV-02543\r     (GK)(D.D.C.).  Kraft was responsible for introducing Huttoe to SGA\r     Goldstar.  The Complaint alleged a massive ongoing market manipulation\r     orchestrated by Huttoe in which he executed an unregistered distribution of\r     tens of millions of SOE shares.  The Complaint further alleged that Huttoe\r     artificially inflated the price for those shares by issuing materially\r     false press releases about nonexistent multimillion dollar sales of SOE\r     products, filing false periodic reports with the Commission, and bribing\r     with SOE stock persons to tout SOE stock, including Melcher and Terry.  As\r     a final part of the scheme, Huttoe, Melcher, and Terry then took advantage\r     of the inflated market by dumping shares on unwitting investors.  On\r     January 29, 1997, the Commission amended the Complaint to allege that in\r     addition to touting SOE stock, SGA Goldstar, Melcher, and Terry engaged in\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 2======\r\x0c\r\r\r\r\r     a systematic practice of publishing promotional coverage for other issuers\r     in exchange for compensation.  On November 25, 1997, Huttoe settled the\r     Commission s action by consenting to an order permanently enjoining him\r     from violations of certain provisions of the federal securities laws,\r     barring him from acting as an officer or director of a public company, and\r     requiring him to disgorge over $12.5 million, the amount he derived from\r     the SOE manipulation, provided that except for surrendering certain assets,\r     payment of the full disgorgement amount was waived in light of his\r     demonstrated inability to pay.  Huttoe also consented to a Commission order\r     barring him from the securities industry.  The actions against SGA\r     Goldstar, Melcher, and Terry are pending.\r\r          In a separate action filed on December 22, 1997, the Commission sued\r     Barclay Davis, a Las Vegas, Nevada based penny stock promoter that Kraft\r     introduced to Huttoe.  See SEC v. Davis, Et Al., 97-CV-03056 (GK)(D.D.C.). \r     The Complaint against Davis alleges that Davis entered the ongoing scheme\r     to manipulate the market for SOE, and that Huttoe gave Davis unregistered\r     shares of SOE stock to facilitate the use of a registered broker-dealer to\r     push SOE stock on the public.  The Complaint against Davis further alleges\r     that he engineered the falsification by SOE of Commission filings, and that\r     he arranged for his  team,  which included CPA Merle S. Finkel, to\r     accomplish this. The Complaint against Davis also alleges that he used two\r     other microcap companies that he controlled, Bio-Tech Industries, Inc.\r     ( Bio-Tech ) (formerly Twenty First Century Health, Inc.) and Combined\r     Companies International Corp. ( CCIC ), as vehicles for market\r     manipulations.  The action against Davis is pending.  In another action,\r     the Commission sued CPA Finkel, the former auditor of SOE, Bio-Tech, and\r     CCIC alleging that on at least 13 occasions, Finkel issued materially false\r     or inaccurate audit reports on the financial statements of these companies. \r     See SEC v. Finkel, 97-CV-00505 (EGS)(D.D.C.).  Finkel settled that action\r     by consenting to a permanent injunction against future violations of\r     certain provisions of the federal securities laws, and also consented to a\r     Commission order denying him the privilege of appearing or practicing\r     before the Commission as an accountant.\r\r          The Criminal Prosecutions\r\r          In terms of criminal actions, Kraft is the fifth individual to plead\r     guilty to felony charges stemming from these matters.  On January 31, 1997,\r     Huttoe, who presently is incarcerated, was sentenced to a federal prison\r     term of 46 months, followed by two years supervised release, and a $10,000\r     fine, pursuant to a criminal information charging him with one count of\r     securities fraud and one count of money laundering.  On March 12, 1997,\r     Finkel pleaded guilty to a criminal information charging him with one count\r     of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and bank fraud, and is awaiting\r     sentencing.  On September 12, 1997, Melcher, who presently is incarcerated,\r     was sentenced to a prison term of 12 months, followed by two years\r     supervised release, and a $20,000 fine, pursuant to a criminal information\r     charging him with conspiracy to commit securities fraud.  On December 22,\r     1997, Davis, who is awaiting sentencing, pleaded guilty to one count of\r     conspiracy to commit securities fraud and bank fraud, and one count of\r     money laundering.\r     *   *   *\r\r          The Commission previously has issued a number of releases concerning\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 3======\r\x0c\r\r\r\r\r     these and other related matters.

The order permanently enjoins and restrains Eskind from violating\r     Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the\r     Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 206\r     of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Eskind was ordered to pay\r     disgorgement in the amount of $542,532, representing the ill-gotten gains\r     received by Eskind, and prejudgment interest thereon. Civil penalties will\r     be set by the Court at a later date, upon motion by the Commission. \r\r     Eskind consented to the relief without admitting or denying the allegations\r     set forth in a complaint, filed by the Commission on June 20, 1997.  In its\r     complaint, the Commission alleged that, between November 1994 and May 1996,\r     Eskind was secretary and treasurer of Tower Asset Management (Tower), the\r     general partner and investment adviser of Asset Management Fund, L.P.\r     (Asset Management), a limited partnership formed for the purpose of\r     investing in securities.  In or before April 1996, Eskind misappropriated\r     or converted approximately $246,000 of Asset Management\s assets, and\r     concealed his actions by falsifying the partnership\s books.  When the\r     thefts were discovered, Eskind was terminated by Tower.  \r\r     After his dismissal from Tower, Eskind solicited investments from the\r     public using Asset Management\s offering documents.  Between December 1996\r     and May 1997, Eskind induced or attempted to induce at least three\r     investors to invest in what was falsely purported to be Asset Management. \r     Eskind persuaded two of the investors to invest, respectively, $500,000 and\r     $150,000 in his scheme.  Eskind did not disclose to the investors that he\r     had been terminated by Tower nor did he disclose that Asset Management had\r     been dissolved.\r\r\r            \r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c"

ROBERT C. WILSON, ET AL., Civil\r     Action No. 95-WM-3174 (D.Colorado)\r\r     UNITED STATES V. ROBERT C. WILSON, Nos. 97-189-CR-T-99 (E) (M.D. Florida)\r     and CR97-178 (C.D. Ca.)\r\r          The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on January 12,\r     1998 Stephen V. Wilson, United States District Judge (C.D.Ca.), sentenced\r     Robert C. Wilson (Wilson) to a federal prison term of 57 months on his\r     guilty plea to charges in Florida and 46 months on his plea to charges in\r     California.  \r\r          The criminal information filed in the U. S. District Court for the\r     Middle District of Florida  in May 1997 charged that Wilson defrauded the\r     United States Employer Consumer Self-Insurance Fund of Florida (USEC).\r     Wilson told USEC that the insurance company could increase its return on\r     investments by purchasing U.S. Treasury securities, with some additional\r     capital being contributed by Debenture Guaranty Corp.(Debenture), an\r     entity controlled by Wilson and Gary C. Long.  USEC liquidated $3.4 million\r     in investment assets and transferred the money to Debenture.  Wilson then\r     had a stockbroker confirm to USEC that $7.011 million in treasury\r     securities were held in its account.   The insurance company was not told,\r     however, that the securities were purchased on margin and that the\r     company\s account actually had a value of less than $600,000.  Next, Wilson \r     falsely represented to the company that Debenture had erroneously\r     contributed $2.3 million in excess funds to the company\s account for the\r     purchase of the treasury securities, and obtained USEC\s authorization to\r     wire transfer this money into Debenture\s account.  Unbeknownst to USEC,\r     the $2.3 million actually was the balance of USEC\s own money remaining\r     after the securities had been bought on margin.  Wilson later converted\r     these funds obtained from the insurance company to his own use.\r\r             Wilson was charged in the criminal information filed in the U. S.\r     District Court for the Central District of California in February 1997 with\r     running an advance fee swindle. Wilson told victims in that scheme that\r     their loan fee payments were secured by government securities.  In fact,\r     Wilson did not obtain loans for his victims, but instead used their fees\r     for his personal expenses.\r\r          Wilson and others were named as defendants in a parallel civil\r     injunctive action brought by the Commission on December 20, 1995. The\r     Commission\s complaint alleges that a number of investors were defrauded by\r     Wilson, Gary F. Long, Samuel L. Boyd, and Debenture Guaranty Corp. in a\r     scheme in which investors were solicited to invest in U.S. Treasury\r     securities, which purportedly would be traded using a proprietary method\r     that would produce unusually high yields.  According to the complaint,\r     investors\ funds were not, in fact, being invested in any high yield\r     investment program but were being misappropriated after a small portion of\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c\r\r\r\r\r\r\r     the funds was used to purchase securities on margin.  The Commission\s\r     complaint further alleges that these misappropriated investor funds were\r     paid for the benefit of various participants in the scheme including\r     Wilson, Long, and Boyd.  The Commission obtained a temporary restraining\r     order, a preliminary injunction and an asset freeze against Wilson, Long,\r     Debenture Guaranty, Euro Scotia Funding (USA, Inc.) and Euro Scotia Group,\r     Ltd. in January  1996.

Uniglobe Trading Company, Inc., et.\r     al., 97 Civ. 08659 (USDC SDNY)\r\r          The Commission today announced that the U.S. District Court for the\r     Southern District of New York, White Plains Division, issued a preliminary\r     injunction and entered defaults in a pending action involving the offer to\r     sell forged and fictitious treasury bonds purportedly issued by the\r     government of Japan.  Judge Charles Brieant issued the preliminary\r     injunction today against five defendants named in the action on December\r     12, 1997 in the Commission s first amended complaint: Northeast Investment\r     Institution, Inc. (Northeast), a Fayetteville, North Carolina entity, and\r     four representatives of Northeast including Thomas Patrick McGlon\r     (president and a director), Daniel Watlington (secretary-treasurer and a\r     director), William Muwwakkil (vice-president and a director) and Tyrone P.\r     Jones, III (a special consultant).  The Court also entered default as to\r     Northeast, Watlington, Muwwakkil and Jones as a result of their failure to\r     plead or defend. Watlington, Muwwakkil and Jones live in Fayetteville,\r     North Carolina, and McGlon resides in Calhoun, Georgia.  \r\r          The Commission alleges that, since at least October of 1997, the\r     Northeast defendants have been engaging in an apparent scheme to defraud\r     U.S. investors through the offer of fraudulent Japanese treasury bonds. \r     The Commission asserts that Northeast and its representatives have offered\r     for sale as many as 24 treasury bonds purportedly issued by the Japanese\r     government totaling 12 billion yen (approximately [U.S.] $120 million). \r     The fraudulent bonds were seized by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in\r     October 1997, but the Northeast defendants allegedly continued to offer the\r     bonds on the theory that 12 replacement bonds were issued representing the\r     same supposed 12 billion yen debt obligation of Japan.  The Commission\r     introduced evidence from the Japanese government, the U.S. Secret Service,\r     two securities firms and a bank in support of its contention that the\r     purported bonds and other documents relating to a chain of custody for the\r     bonds are fraudulent.  The Commission s complaint charges the Northeast\r     defendants with violating the antifraud provisions, Section 17(a) of the\r     Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act\r     of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.   \r\r          To prevent Northeast, McGlon, Watlington, Muwwakkil, and Jones from\r     continuing to offer and potentially sell these and other fictitious\r     securities, the Commission requested, and the Court granted, a preliminary\r     injunction, an order freezing the bonds, and an order that the Northeast\r     defendants tender the instruments to the registry of the Court.  Further,\r     the Judge\s order requires an accounting from the Northeast defendants of\r     all assets, including financial instruments or government bonds, held by\r     the Northeast defendants or offered by them for sale or other transfer from\r     September 1, 1997 to the date of the accounting.  The Commission also seeks\r     civil penalties against the Northeast defendants. \r\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c\r\r\r\r\r\r\r          The Commission previously obtained similar injunctive relief in this\r     action against the five original defendants.  The Commission alleges in its\r     complaint that three of those defendants offered the fictitious Japanese\r     treasury bonds, and that all of the original defendants offered for sale at\r     least two, and possibly as many as sixteen, fraudulent certificates of\r     deposit of Banco de la Nacion Argentina with stated principal amounts of\r     [U.S.] $100 million each.

Daniel E. Schneider, et al.,  et.\r     al., Civil Action No. 98-CV-0014-D (USDC Wyo.)\r\r          The Commission announced today that it obtained an emergency\r     restraining order prohibiting the illegal sale of bonds, purportedly backed\r     by gold, issued in the 19th century by the now defunct Chicago, Saginaw and\r     Canada Railroad Co. (Saginaw).  These bonds, according to the complaint,\r     are worthless as investments, having value only as historical memorabilia. \r     The order also prohibited the fraudulent sale of interests in a prime bank-\r     type trading program.  Judge William F. Downes entered his temporary\r     restraining order on January 20, 1998, against Daniel E. Schneider\r     (Schneider), a resident of Worland, Wyoming, and related entities Global\r     American Prosperity Foundation (GAPF) and Financial Sovereign Acquisition\r     Trust (FAST).  The Order also granted a freeze of assets held by Schneider,\r     GAPF and FAST, an accounting and repatriation of assets.  The Commission\s\r     complaint alleged that during 1997, Schneider, GAPF and FAST raised a total\r     of at least $2 million from six, and possibly more than 30, investors\r     nationwide through the sale of Saginaw bonds and through a bank debenture\r     trading program in which the Saginaw bonds or other assets purportedly\r     could be used to generate substantial returns.\r\r          Schneider, GAPF and FAST represented that the Saginaw bonds, which\r     were offered at $40,000 each, were backed by gold bullion and worth up to\r     $100 million each and that investors would receive at least a 30 percent\r     return on their investment.  In offering interests in the  trading program,\r     Schneider, GAPF and FAST represented that top world bank debentures\r     existed and traded in a legitimate market, investors would receive returns\r     of at least 15 percent per month, and investor funds would be invested in a\r     trading program.  Schneider, GAPF and FAST misrepresented, among other\r     things, the value of the Saginaw bonds, which in fact have only nominal\r     value as historical memorabilia.  Schneider, GAPF and FAST also\r     misrepresented the existence of prime bank-type securities, rates of return\r     investors were to receive, and the use of investor proceeds.  Schneider\r     diverted more than $196,000 of investor funds to purchase real estate or\r     for other personal uses.  The Commission alleged that through their false\r     and misleading statements, Schneider, GAPF and FAST violated the antifraud\r     provisions, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b)\r     of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  \r\r          In the temporary restraining order, Judge Downes also ordered two\r     named relief defendants, California resident Norman Fadel (Fadel) and Utah\r     resident Ken Karlson (Karlson) to freeze assets derived from the fraud of\r     Schneider, GAPF and FAST.  Fadel and Karlson received approximately $96,000\r     and $354,000, respectively, from Schneider, GAPF and FAST.

The Commission sought emergency\r     relief in the form of a temporary restraining order, asset freeze,\r     preliminary and permanent injunctions, and other relief.  Grijalva, Bravo\s\r     nephew, was named as a defendant solely for the purpose of relief.  \r\r          The Commission\s Complaint alleged that the defendants were engaged in\r     an ongoing fraudulent offer and sale of unregistered securities in the form\r     of promissory notes issued by Insnet, the proceeds of which were\r     purportedly used to purchase bulk long distance telephone time from major\r     satellite suppliers and directly distribute prepaid telephone calling cards\r     to the public.  It is further alleged that, since October 1995 to the\r     present, the defendants have fraudulently raised at least $4.8 million from\r     the sale of such securities to at least 216 investors residing in\r     approximately 38 states.  Moreover, instead of using the funds to purchase\r     long distance telephone time and distribute telephone calling cards as\r     represented, the Complaint alleges that at least $2.8 million of investor\r     funds have been paid to the individual defendants or companies that they\r     control.  The Complaint also indicated that investors have received Ponzi\r     payments when investment funds from later investors were used to make\r     quarterly interest payments and to repay investors when their notes\r     matured. \r\r\r\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c"

Without admitting or denying any of\rthe allegations in the complaint, except as to jurisdiction,\rFromm consented to the entry of a final judgment enjoining him\rfrom violating sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities\rExchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Exchange Act rules 10b-\r5 and 14e-3, ordering him to disgorge $213,750, plus prejudgment\rinterest on $13,750 of that amount of $4,076.36, and ordering him\rto pay a civil penalty of $13,750.\r\r     According to the complaint, based upon 1) information that\rFromm learned during a May 1994 meeting with the President and\rExecutive Vice President of Dayco Products, Inc., a Mark IV\rsubsidiary and client of the advertising, public relations, and\rconsulting firm of which Fromm was President and Chief Executive\rOfficer (CEO), 2) information that Fromm learned during a\rSeptember 1994 conversation with Mark IV\s Chairman and CEO at\revents related to a funeral, and 3) the previously publicly\rdisclosed information of the resignation of Mark IV\s CEO from\rPurolator\s Board of Directors, Fromm formed the belief that Mark\rIV was likely to acquire Purolator.  Also according to the\rCommission\s complaint, Fromm subsequently purchased a total of\r2,000 shares of Purolator common stock and advised two\rindividuals, who traded when it was reasonably foreseeable that\rthey would do so, of his belief that Mark IV was likely to\racquire Purolator.  The Commission alleges in its complaint that,\rin so doing, Fromm misappropriated material, nonpublic\rinformation that he obtained during the May 1994 meeting and the\rSeptember 1994 conversation in breach of a fiduciary duty or\rsimilar relationship of trust and confidence that he owed to\rDayco and Mark IV.\r\r     Following the public announcement of the Mark IV/Purolator\rtransaction, Fromm sold the 2,000 shares that he had purchased\rand realized a profit of $13,750.  Accounts of the two\rindividuals sold the shares that they had purchased and realized\rprofits of $608,750 and $687.50 respectively.\r\r     The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the National\rAssociation of Securities Dealers, Inc. in this matter.\r"

The\r     Complaint further alleged that the stock promoters issued promotional\r     brochures concerning various public companies without disclosing that they\r     were being paid by the companies to issue the brochures.

J.W. Korth & Co. and James Wilder\r     Korth., Case No. 97-0280-Civ-Ungaro-Benages (USDC/SD FL)\r\r          The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that on\r     January 22, 1998, the Honorable Ursula Ungaro-Benages, United States\r     District Judge for the Southern District of Florida, granted the SEC\s\r     motion and entered summary judgment against J.W. Korth & Co., a Miami,\r     Florida broker-dealer, and its president James Wilder Korth.  The judge\r     ruled that Korth and his firm violated the securities laws by repeatedly\r     refusing to give the SEC the serial numbers for defaulted pre-World War II\r     German Bonds they were selling.  The SEC had alleged that Korth was hiding\r     the information from it and that, without the numbers, the SEC could not\r     determine whether sales of the bonds violated the federal securities laws.\r\r          Earlier in the case, the SEC had sought and obtained a temporary\r     restraining order (TRO) ordering Korth to give the SEC the numbers. \r     Korth refused to do so, and was quoted in a Miami Herald article as saying\r     that he was going to stand firm and not produce any numbers.  Korth\r     finally turned over the numbers after a February 1997 hearing during which\r     the judge granted the SEC\s request for a preliminary injunction and\r     ordered him to do so or face a contempt citation.\r\r          In entering final judgment against Korth and his firm, the judge noted\r     that they had failed to comply with the TRO, openly and publicly defied\r     it, and only turned over the numbers after the Court indicated its view\r     that those actions were contumacious and that civil and criminal contempt\r     citations were imminent.  Based on their violation of the law and this\r     conduct, the judge permanently enjoined Korth and the firm from future\r     violations of the relevant provision, Section 17 of the Securities Exchange\r     Act of 1934, and imposed first-tier penalties of $55,000 and $5,500 on the\r     firm and Korth respectively.\r\r          The case appears to be the first time a broker-dealer has been\r     penalized for failing to comply with the SEC\s statutory examination\r     powers.  In her opinion, the judge recognized the SEC\s vital role in\r     regulating the securities markets, and ruled that the SEC right to examine\r     a registered broker-dealer is central to the execution of [its] congress-\r     ionally-mandated regulatory duties.  As such, the judge ruled that the\r     SEC\s examination powers are subject only to reasonable time, place and\r     manner restrictions.\r\x0c"

January 29, 1998)\r\r\r          The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it filed a\r     civil injunctive action in federal court in Manhattan charging five former\r     officers of a now bankrupt insurance brokerage firm with engaging in a\r     financial fraud for more than two years.  As a result of the defendants\\r     conduct, the insurance brokerage falsely reported to the public that it had\r     been profitable in 1993 and 1994, when it had actually sustained losses in\r     those years.  The Commission\s complaint also alleges that one of the\r     defendants engaged in illegal insider trading. \r\r     Named in the Commission\s complaint were:\r\r          Donald Ferrarini (Ferrarini), age 69, who was chief executive\r     officer, president and chairman of the board of directors of Underwriters\r     Financial Group, Inc. (UFG) during the time of the events relating to the\r     financial fraud alleged in the complaint.\r\r          Bruno Rumignani (Rumignani), age 55, who was UFG\s executive vice\r     president and a director during the time of the events relating to the\r     financial fraud alleged in the complaint.\r\r          Howard Miller (Miller), age 66, who was UFG\s senior vice president\r     and a director during the time of the events relating to the financial\r     fraud alleged in the complaint.  Miller was previously an officer of BRI\r     Holding Corp. (BRI), a private company that merged with Chippewa\r     Resources Corp. (Chippewa) in 1992 to form UFG.\r\r          Mark Bailine (Bailine), age 47, who was UFG\s vice president of\r     finance and administration during the time of the events relating to the\r     financial fraud alleged in the complaint.  \r\r          Frank Palumbo (Palumbo), age 51, who was UFG\s controller during the\r     time of the events relating to the financial fraud alleged in the\r     complaint.  \r\r     The Commission\s complaint alleges that between 1993 and 1995, Ferrarini,\r     Rumignani, Miller, Bailine and Palumbo engaged in a \r\r                                        - 2 -\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c\r\r\r\r\r\r\r     fraudulent scheme whereby UFG fraudulently obtained money from companies\r     with which UFG did business and, by making fictitious and other improper\r     entries on UFG\s books and records, improperly included those fraudulently\r     obtained funds as legitimate income.  The complaint alleges that defendants\r     employed two fraudulent practices to obtain cash and misrepresent UFG\s\r     financial performance to the public: (i) a premium finance fraud, whereby\r     UFG recorded as income money that UFG had fraudulently obtained from\r     companies that finance insurance premiums and recorded proceeds of the\r     fraud as income; and (ii) an accounts payable fraud, whereby UFG\r     improperly deleted certain outstanding accounts payable and improperly\r     recorded corresponding amounts as income.  According to the complaint, as\r     part of the premium finance fraud, UFG sought and obtained financing for\r     insurance premiums on behalf of customers who did not need or request such\r     financing, and the proceeds of the financing were instead used to pay UFG\s\r     operating expenses and for other purposes.  The defendants also made\r     material misstatements to UFG\s auditors.  \r\r     As a result of this conduct, the annual and quarterly reports that UFG\r     filed with the Commission and disseminated to the public for 1993 and 1994,\r     and the quarters ended March 31, 1994, June 30, 1994 and September 30,\r     1994, falsely portray UFG as profitable when, in fact, it had incurred\r     substantial losses.  Although UFG reported a loss for the quarter ended\r     March 31, 1995, UFG materially understated that loss due to the defendants\\r     conduct.  \r\r     The complaint also alleges that Miller unlawfully purchased securities of\r     Chippewa while he possessed material nonpublic information about the merger\r     between Chippewa and BRI.  Specifically, the complaint alleges that in\r     August 1992, Miller, an officer of BRI, purchased 11,000 shares of Chippewa\r     common stock when Miller knew of that pending merger.\r\r     As a result of the foregoing, the complaint alleges that Ferrarini,\r     Rumignani and Miller violated antifraud and corporate reporting,\r     recordkeeping and other provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934\r     (Exchange Act), and that Bailine and Palumbo violated antifraud and other\r     provisions of the Exchange Act. \r\r     In the complaint, the Commission seeks:  permanent injunctions and civil\r     penalties against all defendants; disgorgement from Miller of his illegal\r     trading profits and prejudgment interest thereon; and officer and director\r     bars against Ferrarini, Rumignani and Miller.\r\r     In February 1996, Bailine pled guilty to two felony counts, including\r     conspiracy to commit securities fraud, in connection with the conduct\r     alleged in the complaint.

(Sakura), a subsidiary of Sakura Bank that is\r     engaged in the business of selling derivatives.  The Complaint alleges that\r     the defendants committed fraud in connection with the sale of municipal\r     securities.  The Complaint alleges that in two municipal bond transactions\r     underwritten by Stifel, Pannone engaged in bid-rigging to ensure Sakura\s\r     selection as the provider of the forward purchase agreements (forwards)\r     to the issuers.  The Complaint also alleges that in those same securities\r     transactions, Pannone and Sakura made materially misleading statements\r     and/or affirmative misrepresentations to the issuers with respect to\r     undisclosed payments that Sakura made to Stifel.  The Complaint alleges\r     that these undisclosed payments jeopardized the tax-exempt status of the\r     bonds.\r\r          The Complaint alleges that in a 1992 transaction for the Oklahoma\r     Turnpike Authority, despite bond counsel\s requirement that three\r     competitive bids be obtained for the forward, Pannone rigged the bidding to\r     ensure Sakura\s selection as the forward provider.  The Complaint also\r     alleges that Pannone subsequently negotiated with Steven Strauss, Sakura s\r     then managing director in charge of municipal securities transactions, a\r     $6.593 million undisclosed brokerage fee to be paid by Sakura to Stifel,\r     and that Pannone falsely described to the Turnpike Authority the bidding\r     and negotiation process of the forward.  The Complaint further alleges that\r     the forward purchase agreement stated that Sakura did not intend to take\r     any actions which would jeopardize the tax-exempt status of the bonds.  The\r     Complaint alleges that at the time Sakura executed the forward it was\r     planning to pay a $6.593 million brokerage fee to Stifel, and that Sakura\r     knew or was reckless in not knowing that such a brokerage fee would\r     jeopardize the tax-exempt status of the bonds.  \r\r          The Complaint also alleges that in a 1992 transaction for the Sisters\r     of St. Mary\s Health Care Obligated Group, despite bond counsel\s\r     requirement that three competitive bids be obtained for the forward,\r     Pannone rigged the bidding to ensure Sakura\s selection as the forward\r     provider.  The Complaint further alleges that at the request of bond\r     counsel, Pannone and Strauss provided certificates stating that Sakura\r     would not make any payments, other than certain payments to the issuer, in\r     connection with the forward.  The Complaint alleges that Sakura made a\r     $100,000 payment to Stifel and that Pannone concealed the payment by\r     booking it to a different transaction. \r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c\r\r\r\r\r\r\r          The Complaint alleges that by their conduct, Pannone and Sakura\r     violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the\r     Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder,\r     and that Pannone also violated Section 15B(c)(1) of the Exchange Act and\r     Rule G-17 of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board.

(MTC), a British Columbia importer of consumer\r     electronics (now known as Grandetel Technologies, Inc.) which traded on\r     NASDAQ, and his brother Sit Wa Leung (Sit Wa), 62, MTC\s former corporate\r     secretary and a member of its board of directors.  The Complaint alleges\r     that between 1990 and 1993, the defendants engaged in a false disclosure\r     and accounting fraud scheme that culminated in a pump and dump stock\r     manipulation, and that they unjustly enriched themselves by more than $16\r     million by selling MTC stock, including approximately 1.5 million shares\r     they had stolen.  The Commission is seeking permanent injunctions against\r     both defendants; disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains; civil penalties\r     and officer and director bars against them.  \r\r          In a related matter the Commission issued a Cease-And-Desist Order\r     (Order) against Ronald W.

Without admitting or denying the\r     Commission\s findings, Driol consented to the issuance of the Order which\r     finds, among other things, that while he was employed at the Hongkong Bank\r     of Canada in Vancouver and managing MTC\s accounts, he assisted the\r     defendants\ scheme by placing Hongkong Bank of Canada\s signature guarantee\r     on stolen stock certificates, and thereafter approving transactions in\r     which proceeds were transferred through nominee bank accounts at that bank. \r       \r\r          Specifically, the Complaint against Miko and Sit Wa alleges the\r     following:\r\r          Between 1990 and 1993, MTC claimed that it had developed a new\r     telecommunications business in the People\s Republic of China (PRC)\r     including agreements that made it the exclusive supplier of fax machines to\r     the PRC, and joint venture projects to provide telecommunications services\r     in various cities in the PRC.  For each of its fiscal years 1991 through\r     1993, MTC falsely claimed that it had received millions of dollars in\r     revenues from the fax machine sales, accounting for from 31 to 46 percent\r     of its total revenues.  In fact, MTC sold no fax machines in the PRC, and\r     Miko deceived MTC\s independent accountants by providing them with false\r     documentation to support the fictitious sales.  In 1991, at Miko\s\r     direction, MTC similarly began misrepresenting that it had concluded joint\r     venture agreements that would make it the exclusive supplier of cellular\r     telephone service to Shanghai and other major cities in the PRC.  After\r     disseminating this false information Miko and Sit Wa started selling MTC\r     stock through nominee accounts they controlled.  \r\x0c\r\r\r\r\r\r\r          Between February and August 1992, Miko induced MTC\s board to issue\r     below market options on 1.52 million shares of MTC ostensibly to be used as\r     incentives for existing and prospective MTC employees.  In fact, none of\r     the intended recipients received the options.  Instead, the defendants\r     stole them; fraudulently exercised them; fraudulently endorsed the\r     certificates; and deposited the shares in nominee brokerage accounts they\r     controlled.\r\r          Between September and December 1992, Miko flooded the market with\r     additional false information, including the misrepresentation that as a\r     result of several new joint venture agreements MTC had the exclusive right\r     to provide cellular phone and/or paging services to approximately 300\r     million people, or 25% of the population of China.  As a result, MTC\s\r     stock price increased from $5 1/8 to $30.  The defendants simultaneously\r     sold the shares they had stolen at these artifically inflated prices,\r     realizing illegal profits of $12.1 million on those shares.  Their sales of\r     other MTC shares between May 1991 and September 1992 had unjustly enriched\r     them by in excess of another $4 million.  The defendants laundered the\r     proceeds of their illegal securities transactions through a series of bank\r     accounts world-wide, most of which were nominee accounts they controlled.\r\r          The Commission is seeking the entry of a final judgment (1)\r     permanently enjoining both defendants from violations of Section 17(a) of\r     the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of\r     1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and also permanently enjoining Miko from\r     violations of Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 13b2-1 and\r     13b2-2 thereunder; (2) ordering the defendants to disgorge their illegal\r     trading profits and losses illegally avoided, plus prejudgment interest;\r     (3) ordering them to pay civil penalties; and (4) permanently prohibiting\r     them from acting as officers or directors of any issuer that has a class of\r     securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act, or that\r     is required to file reports pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act.\r\r          In the Cease-And-Desist Order, the Commission found that Driol played\r     an indispensable role in facilitating the sale of the options stock stolen\r     by Miko and Sit Wa by placing Hongkong Bank of Canada\s signature guarantee\r     on the stolen MTC share certificates issued in the names of existing and\r     prospective MTC employees.  He did so in spite of the facts that none of\r     the nominal owners of the certificates were present when Driol guaranteed\r     their signatures, that he had not met or even heard of them before being\r     presented with the certificates, and that most, if not all, of the\r     certificates had not been signed when he placed the guarantees on them. \r     Because the certificates ultimately bore a signature authorizing their\r     transfer that purported to be that of the named owner and bore Hongkong\r     Bank of Canada\s signature guarantee, Miko and Sit Wa were able to sell the\r     shares through nominee brokerage accounts.  Thereafter Driol played a\r     central role in the transfer of the proceeds of the sale of that stolen\r     stock from the nominee brokerage accounts to other nominee bank accounts at\r     the Hongkong Bank of Canada, and the retransmission to still other nominee\r     bank accounts in Hong Kong.  Specifically, he wrote or approved the\r     transfer instructions for every wire transfer from these bank accounts\r     during the period September through December 1992, and approved several of\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 2======\r\x0c\r\r\r\r\r\r\r     the deposits to these accounts from the nominee brokerage accounts.  Driol\r     knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that Miko controlled the nominee bank\r     accounts.  \r\r          The Commission found that as a result of that conduct Driol caused\r     violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the\r     Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and ordered Driol to cease and\r     desist from further violations of these antifraud provisions.

Donald Ferrarini, et al., a civil injunctive action filed\r     yesterday in federal court in Manhattan.\r\r     In its complaint, the Commission alleges that Bailine and the other\r     defendants engaged in a fraudulent scheme whereby they falsely portrayed\r     the financial condition of Underwriters Financial Group, Inc. (UFG), a\r     now bankrupt insurance brokerage firm, for the years ended December 31,\r     1993 and December 31, 1994 and the quarters ended March 31, 1994, June 30,\r     1994, September 31, 1994 and March 31, 1995.

At the time of the events alleged in the complaint,\r     Bailine was UFG\s vice president of finance and administration.\r\r     Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Bailine\r     consented to the issuance of a final judgment permanently enjoining him\r     from committing future violations of Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the\r     Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2.

JAMES PATRICK KITTLER \r     (Civ. No. 98-551DSD/JMM) January 30, 1998\r\r     The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it filed, and\r     simultaneously settled, a civil suit in federal court in the District of\r     Minnesota against J. Patrick Kittler, trustee and chief executive officer\r     of National Trade Trust, a Minneapolis, Minnesota company.  The complaint\r     alleges that under Kittlers direction the company disseminated misleading\r     offering materials that misrepresented the safety and liquidity of the\r     companys promissory notes.  These offering materials included fraudulent\r     financial statements that materially overstated the companys earnings,\r     assets and net worth.  The complaint further alleges that these financial\r     statements, prepared at Kittler s direction, (i) artificially inflated\r     assets by $2 million, by recording an asset which held no value for the\r     company; (ii) failed to record reserves for uncollectible loans; and (iii)\r     recorded advances to clients at inflated values, instead of the actual\r     amount advanced to each client.  Between February 1990 and March 1994, the\r     company raised approximately $8 million from over 300 investors from the\r     sale of its notes.  National Trade Trust has defaulted on the notes and\r     currently owes approximately $6.5 million to over 200 investors.  The\r     company has ceased operations and is liquidating its remaining assets.\r\r     The complaint alleges that by preparing the fraudulent financial\r     statements, Kittler violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933,\r     Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5\r     thereunder.  Kittler has consented, without admitting or denying the\r     Commission s allegations, to the entry of an order of permanent injunction\r     and the payment of a $25,000 civil penalty. \r\r     The Commission also instituted, and simultaneously settled, administrative\r     proceedings against the companys independent auditor, Paul Mount.  Mount\r     consented to the entry of an order barring him from appearing or practicing\r     before the Commission as an accountant for four years.  Mount, through his\r     accounting firm, Mount & Borresen, Ltd., of Bloomington, Minnesota, audited\r     the companys financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31,\r     1990, 1991 and 1992.  These financial statements, together with audit\r     reports prepared by Mount, were included in the company s offering\r     statements filed with the Commission under Regulation A of the Securities\r     Act of 1933.\r\r     The administrative order, which Mount consented to without admitting or\r     denying, finds that Mount engaged in improper professional conduct by\r     failing to obtain sufficient competent evidential matter to support his\r     opinions, by failing to exercise due professional care, and by lacking the\r     proper degree of professional skepticism.  \r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c"

First Zurich National U.S.A., LLC and\r     Compunomics 139, Inc. Civil Action No. 98-CV-29D  (USDC Wy.) \r\r          On February 2, 1998, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the\r     Commission) filed an emergency action seeking to halt an affinity fraud\r     being promoted over the internet and targeting African Americans.  On\r     February 3, 1998, the Commission obtained a temporary restraining order,\r     including an asset freeze, from the United States District Court for the\r     District of Wyoming against First Zurich National U.S.A., LLC (First\r     Zurich), a Wyoming limited liability company (LLC) and Compunomics 139,\r     Inc. (Compunomics), a Belizean corporation based in southern California\r     and the corporate parent of First Zurich.  The Commission has received\r     substantial assistance in this case from the California Department of\r     Corporations, the Wyoming State Securities Division and the Cheyenne,\r     Wyoming office of the United States Postal Inspection Service.\r\r          Compunomics has been offering and selling First Zurich stock since at\r     least April 1997, which Compunomics claims has been operating as a global\r     internet bank since November 1997.  The Commission alleges that First\r     Zurich and Compunomics have failed to disclose to prospective and current\r     investors that First Zurich cannot legally operate as a bank.  The Office\r     of the Comptroller of the Currency has not granted a national bank charter\r     to First Zurich nor has the Wyoming State Banking Board authorized First\r     Zurich to conduct banking operations.  Moreover, First Zurich, as a Wyoming\r     LLC, is not permitted under Wyoming corporate law to conduct banking\r     operations.\r\r          The Commission further alleges that Compunomics has been offering and\r     selling First Zurich stock to its current shareholders and has made a sales\r     presentation to a national church conference attended by approximately\r     30,000 individuals.  Compunomics is promoting First Zurich on the internet,\r     as well as through written materials and promotional meetings.  The\r     Commission alleges that the defendants are seeking to raise $60 million\r     from 5,000 investors over a ten-year period and are currently receiving a\r     minimum of between $50,000 and $75,000 per month from at least 500 and\r     possibly as many as 750 investors nationwide.  Investors have signed option\r     agreements obligating them to purchase a fixed amount of First Zurich\s\r     stock for $1.25 per share by making an initial $98 payment and then monthly\r     minimum payments of $99 for ten years, representing a total investment of\r     $11,978 per investor. \r\r          The Commission\s complaint charges that the defendants \r     have violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws --\r     Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the\r     Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. \r\r          Investors are again advised to read the SEC\s Cyberspace Alert\r     before purchasing any investment promoted on the internet.

D\Acquisto, Doubleday Trust, and D\Acquisto Financial\r     Group, Inc.  The Court found that an injunction should issue against\r     Goodman, barring him from future violations of the securities laws.  In\r     reaching its decision, the Court found that Goodman principally\r     participated in the fraud when he prepared and issued prospectuses that\r     promoted the fraudulent schemes in clear violation of the law.  The\r     fraudulent schemes involved the sale of $7,000,000 worth of inherently\r     fraudulent prime bank securities. \r\r          Goodman, along with D\Acquisto, sold the fraudulent securities through\r     Doubleday and D\Acquisto Financial Group from November 1993 through June\r     1994.  Goodman represented to investors that the prime bank securities\r     were entirely legal and the crown jewel of Doubleday\s investment\r     program.  Goodman made these representations without investigating whether\r     such securities actually existed.  The Court found that these\r     misrepresentations violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and\r     Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5\r     thereunder.\r\r          In earlier rulings, the Court found that D\Acquisto, Doubleday and\r     D\Acquisto Financial Group misrepresented to one investor that its $200,000\r     investment would be worth $1,833,565.64 in a week\s time; represented to\r     another investor that it would receive returns of 2% to 7.5% per week; and\r     represented to a third investor that it would receive returns of at least\r     80% per month.

Bennett (Bennett) and New Era conducted a\r     fraudulent scheme in which hundreds of not-for-profit organizations,\r     charities, and individuals were promised that funds they invested in New\r     Era\s notes and investment contracts would be doubled in six months by\r     guaranteed monies that Bennett and New Era had secured from several very\r     wealthy anonymous benefactors.   The Complaint further alleged that\r     Bennett\s and New Era\s anonymous benefactors did not exist and that\r     Bennett and New Era made numerous other material misrepresentations and\r     omissions in the course of offering and selling their securities.  The\r     Complaint alleged that Bennett and New Era victimized hundreds of investors\r     throughout the nation, and wrongfully solicited more than $100 million\r     dollars in 1995 alone.  \r\r     The Court\s Final Judgment permanently enjoins Bennett from further\r     violating the registration and antifraud provisions of the securities laws. \r     The Final Judgment also orders Bennett to disgorge profits earned as a\r     result of the conduct alleged in the Complaint, plus interest, in the total\r     amount of $3,424,015, but waives payment based on Bennett\s demonstrated\r     inability to pay.\r     Bennett is currently serving a twelve year sentence in the federal\r     correctional institution in Fort Dix, New Jersey, pursuant to criminal\r     charges based, in large part, upon the same facts alleged in the\r     Commission\s Complaint.\r\r     The Commission also filed a notice voluntarily withdrawing its claims\r     against defendant New Era.  Since May 1995, New Era has been subject to\r     liquidation proceedings in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the\r     Eastern District of Pennsylvania.  In June 1996, with the Commission\s and\r     the Court\s approval, Bennett transferred nearly all of his assets to the\r     Bankruptcy Estate so that those funds could be distributed to defrauded\r     investors.

Doty of the U.S.\r     District Court for the District of Minnesota on January 20, 1998.  After\r     arguments of counsel, the Court issued a preliminary injunction against\r     Nicholas A. Zahareas (Zahareas), Tuschner & Company, Inc. (Tuschner & Co.)\r     and John M. Tuschner (Tuschner).  The preliminary injunction was based on\r     Zahareas association with Tuschner & Co., a Minneapolis broker-dealer, in\r     violation of a July 27, 1993 Commission order barring Zahareas from\r     associating with any registered broker, dealer, investment company,\r     investment adviser or municipal securities dealer.  Zahareas is also the\r     subject of an Order of Permanent Injunction, issued by consent against him\r     on July 16, 1992, prohibiting him from violating the antifraud provisions\r     of the federal securities laws. \r\r          In entering the preliminary injunction, the Court found that Zahareas\r     violated the Commissions bar order and wrongfully associated with a\r     registered broker-dealer, Tuschner & Co., by acting as a Tuschner & Co.\r     registered representative in all but name.  Zahareas acted as Tuschner &\r     Co.s registered representative by:  referring at least 200 customers\r     residing in Greece to Tuschner & Co.; directing trading in their accounts\r     at Tuschner & Co.; placing orders for over $9 million worth of securities\r     with Tuschner & Co.s trader; determining the amount of commissions charged\r     on the transactions; and receiving up to 75% of those commissions through\r     payments to Relief Defendant Euroamerican Securities S.A., a Greek\r     brokerage firm controlled by Zahareas.  In addition, the Court found that\r     Tuschner & Co. wrongfully allowed Zahareas to associate with it and that\r     Tuschner, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Tuschner & Co., knew\r     of Zahareas bar from the securities industry and aided and abetted\r     Zahareas wrongful association with Tuschner & Co.\r\r          The preliminary injunction entered against Zahareas, Tuschner & Co.\r     and Tuschner restrained and enjoined them from, directly or indirectly,\r     violating and/or aiding and abetting violations of Sections 15(b)(6)(B)(i)\r     and 15(b)(6)(B)(ii) of the Exchange Act.  Action remains pending as to the\r     Commissions prayer for the entry of a permanent injunction, disgorgement\r     and civil penalties.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c"

First Zurich National U.S. A, LLC, et\r     al., Civil Action No. 98-CV-29D  (USDC Wy.) \r\r          The Commission today filed an amended complaint and obtained emergency\r     relief in a pending action involving an affinity fraud largely targeting\r     African Americans.  The Commission alleges that the defendants are offering\r     and selling stock in Compunics 139, Inc. (Compunomics) and First Zurich\r     National USA, LLC (First Zurich) and making false claims to investors\r     about the potential value of Compunomics\ stock, as well as failing to\r     disclose that First Zurich cannot legally operate as a bank.  Judge William\r     F. Downes issued a temporary restraining order and other relief against\r     Paul D. Catchings (Catchings), who is the president and chief executive\r     officer of Compunomics, and who was added as a defendant in the amended\r     complaint.  This civil action was originally filed by the Commission on\r     February 2, 1998 in the United States District Court for the District of\r     Wyoming [See, Litigation Release No. 15634, February 3, 1998].  \r\r          The amended complaint alleges that in soliciting persons to purchase\r     Compunomics\ stock, Catchings and Compunomics are falsely representing to\r     investors (some of whom have purchased Compunomics\ stock for as low as\r     $0.32 per share) that they will reap enormous profits when the stock begins\r     publicly trading in the near future at $10.00 per share.  The complaint\r     also alleges that they are falsely representing to investors that\r     Compunomics will soon be profitably operating a bank.    \r\r          The amended complaint alleges that in soliciting persons to acquire\r     stock in First Zurich, a Wyoming limited liability company and Compunomics\r     subsidiary (which Compunomics claims to be a global internet bank),\r     Catchings and the two companies are failing to disclose to investors that\r     First Zurich cannot legally operate as a bank.  The Office of the\r     Comptroller of the Currency has not granted a national bank charter to\r     First Zurich nor has the Wyoming State Banking Board authorized First\r     Zurich to conduct banking operations.  Moreover, First Zurich, as a Wyoming\r     limited liability company, is not permitted under Wyoming corporate law to\r     conduct banking operations.  \r\r          The amended complaint further alleges that Catchings, Compunomics and\r     First Zurich have, since approximately April 1995 to the present, sold\r     between $4 million and $5 million of Compunomics and First Zurich stock. \r     Between 1,000 and 2,000 persons have purchased Compunomics\ stock and at\r     least 400 persons have purchased First Zurich stock.  Sales and promotional\r     activities have been largely directed towards African Americans.  Public\r     sales meetings were held on a regular basis at Los Angeles area restaurants\r     from approximately April 1995 to April 1997 where the false claims were\r     made.  In July 1997, Compunomics\ former vice chairman and chief operating\r     officer addressed approximately 30,000 persons attending the Full Gospel\r     Baptist Fellowship conference in New Orleans.  Written materials approved\r     and authorized by Catchings repeating the false claims were disseminated\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c\r\r\r\r\r\r\r     during the convention.  Also, sales materials containing false and\r     misleading information concerning Compunomics have been and, continue to be\r     posted on the internet.  \r          The amended complaint charges that the defendants have violated the\r     antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws -- Section 17(a) of the\r     Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of\r     1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. \r          The Commission has received substantial assistance in this case from\r     the California Department of Corporations, the Wyoming State Securities\r     Division and the Cheyenne, Wyoming office of the United States Postal\r     Inspection Service.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 2======\r\x0c"

Hevell and his\r     companies American Internet Partners, Inc., American Internet Partners San\r     Jose, ConnecTel Communications, Inc., and Jim D. James to stop an on-going\r     securities fraud.  The SEC obtained a Temporary Restraining Order and froze\r     the assets of the Defendants, who live in Orange County.  Hevell and his\r     other companies are already defendants in another SEC fraud case, SEC v.\r     MicroWest Industries, Inc., CV 97-9150 CAS, filed last September.  The SEC\r     filed both Complaints in federal district court in Los Angeles.\r\r          The Complaint alleges that from July 1997 until the SEC obtained the\r     Temporary Restraining Order, the Defendants raised over $1.06 million from\r     the sale of unregistered securities to at least 56 investors.  The\r     investors are unsophisticated and live throughout the country. \r     Furthermore, nearly 20 percent of the funds invested were retirement funds. \r     The Defendants told investors that their money would be used to purchase an\r     Internet service provider. The Complaint alleges that Defendants spent only\r     $300,000 on Internet service equipment but did not buy an Internet service\r     provider. The Complaint further alleges that Defendants misused most of the\r     investor funds.  Defendants told investors that their money would not be\r     used to pay sales commissions.  However, over half of the investor funds\r     ($558,000) were paid to independent sales agents for commissions.  In\r     addition, Defendants paid at least $76,000 to Hevell, the undisclosed\r     promoter of this alleged investment scheme.  Furthermore, Defendants\r     transferred $46,000 to a company in which Hevell has an interest. \r     Defendants also used at least $4,300 for Hevell s personal expenses,\r     including his cellphone and go-cart racing hobby.  Finally, the remaining\r     investor funds, approximately $76,000, were spent on operating expenses,\r     including rent and employee salaries and bonuses.\r\r          The Complaint seeks a preliminary injunction, permanent injunction and\r     disgorgement against AIP, AIP San Jose, Hevell, and James for violating\r     Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the\r     Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and against\r     ConnecTel for violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section\r     10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5.

Jim Farha  (Farha), a resident of\r     Wichita, Kansas, for violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the federal\r     securities laws, namely Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and\r     Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5\r     thereunder, arising out of his insider trading in the common stock of\r     Physician Corporation of America, a Florida-based health care provider\r     which was recently acquired.  Simultaneously with the filing of the SEC\s\r     lawsuit, Farha, with neither admitting nor denying the SEC\s allegations,\r     consented to a permanent injunction and agreed to pay a total of\r     $419,318.00 in disgorgement, pre-judgment interest and a civil penalty.  On\r     January 29, 1998, the Court entered a final judgment against Farha.\r\r          According to the SEC\s complaint, on March 22, 1995 Farha\r     misappropriated from a PCA insider material, non-public information\r     concerning an unfavorable quarterly earnings announcement for PCA scheduled\r     to be publicly released the next day.  The SEC alleges that Farha, with\r     knowledge of PCA\s unfavorable earnings announcement, sold certain of his\r     PCA stock holdings that same day.  On March 23, 1995, PCA issued its\r     announcement and PCA stock fell approximately 20% on heavy volume.  The SEC\r     contends that Farha avoided losses of over $186,000 through his sale of PCA\r     stock.  The SEC\s lawsuit further alleges that Farha began repurchasing PCA\r     stock on March 23, 1995 and the days thereafter at prices lower than that\r     at which he had previously sold.\r\x0c"

Younts  Consent and the Court s Final Judgment\r     required him to make twelve quarterly payments of $50,000 over three years.\r\r\r          On January 31, 1997, Younts defaulted on his first  quarterly payment.\r     On March 4, 1997, the Commission filed an application for an Order to Show\r     Cause why Younts should not be held in civil contempt for failure to pay\r     Court ordered  disgorgement and civil penalties.

The Commission filed an amended\r     complaint adding Catchings as an individual defendant on February 10, 1998.\r\r          The preliminary injunction was based on the Commission\s February 10,\r     1998, amended complaint, which alleges that in soliciting persons to\r     purchase Compunomics\ stock, Catchings and Compunomics are falsely\r     representing to investors (some of whom have purchased Compunomics\ stock\r     for as low as $0.32 per share) that they will reap enormous profits when\r     the stock begins publicly trading in the near future at $10.00 per share. \r     The complaint also alleges that they are falsely representing to investors\r     that Compunomics will soon be profitably operating a bank.    \r\r          The amended complaint alleges that in soliciting persons to acquire\r     stock in First Zurich, a Wyoming limited liability company and Compunomics\r     subsidiary (which Compunomics claims to be a global internet bank),\r     Catchings and the two companies are failing to disclose to investors that\r     First Zurich cannot legally operate as a bank.  The Office of the\r     Comptroller of the Currency has not granted a national bank charter to\r     First Zurich nor has the Wyoming State Banking Board authorized First\r     Zurich to conduct banking operations.  Moreover, First Zurich, as a Wyoming\r     limited liability company, is not permitted under Wyoming corporate law to\r     conduct banking operations.  \r\r          The amended complaint further alleges that Catchings, Compunomics and\r     First Zurich have, since approximately April 1995 to the present, sold\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c\r\r\r\r\r\r\r     between $4 million and $5 million of Compunomics and First Zurich stock. \r     Between 1,000 and 2,000 persons have purchased Compunomics\ stock and at\r     least 400 persons have purchased First Zurich stock.  Sales and promotional\r     activities have been largely directed towards African Americans.  Public\r     sales meetings were held on a regular basis at Los Angeles area restaurants\r     from approximately April 1995 to April 1997 where the false claims were\r     made.  In July 1997, Compunomics\ former vice chairman and chief operating\r     officer addressed approximately 30,000 persons attending the Full Gospel\r     Baptist Fellowship conference in New Orleans.  Written materials approved\r     and authorized by Catchings repeating the false claims were disseminated\r     during the convention.  Also, sales materials containing false and\r     misleading information concerning Compunomics have been, and continue to\r     be, posted on the internet.  \r\r          The amended complaint charges that the defendants have violated the\r     antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws -- Section 17(a) of the\r     Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of\r     1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. \r\r          The Commission has received substantial assistance in this case from\r     the California Department of Corporations, the Wyoming State Securities\r     Division and the Cheyenne, Wyoming office of the United States Postal\r     Inspection Service.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 2======\r\x0c"

VICTOR TEICHER, ROSS S. FRANKEL,\r     VICTOR TEICHER & CO. AND CARMEL PARTNERS, LP., 91 Civ. 1634(MP)\r       \r\r          On December 11, 1997, Victor Teicher and two entities, Victor Teicher\r     & Co. and Carmel Partners, LP, (the Teicher Defendants) were ordered, by\r     consent, to pay $982,594.14 in disgorgement, pre-judgment interest and\r     penalties.  The Teicher Defendants agreed to entry of the order, which also\r     enjoins them from future violations of Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the\r     Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder.\r\r          In the Commission\s lawsuit, filed in March 1991, Victor Teicher was\r     alleged to have purchased seven different stocks in 1986, while in\r     possession of non-public information (Allegheny International, Inc.,\r     American Brands, Inc., American Can, Inc., Avondale Mills, Inc.,\r     Westchester Financial Services, Co. and Warnaco, Inc., Revco, D.S. Inc.). \r     According to the complaint, the inside information was misappropriated from\r     three sources: a law firm (Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison), an\r     investment banking firm (Drexel Burnham & Lambert Inc.), and a broker-\r     dealer (Marcus Schloss & Co.).  Teicher, an investment manager, was alleged\r     to have obtained the non-public information from members of the so-called\r     Yuppie Five group of insider traders.  The Teicher Defendants agreed to\r     disgorge $265,400.44, representing the profits from the trading in the\r     seven securities.  The Teicher Defendants also agreed to pay pre-judgment\r     interest on the disgorgement amount of $498,713.57, and a civil penalty of\r     $218,480.13 pursuant to the Insider Trading Sanctions Act of 1984.  The\r     payments are due by December 22, 1997.  Teicher was previously tried and\r     convicted on criminal charges arising from the same trades.

15649,1998,,"b                        UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION     LITIGATION RELEASE NO. 15649 / February 20, 1998     SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION v. Daniel E. Schneider, et al.,  et.     al., Civil Action No. 98-CV-0014-D (USDC Wyo.)          The Commission announced today that the U.S. District Court for the     District of Wyoming, issued a preliminary injunction in a pending action     involving the illegal sale of bonds, purportedly backed by gold, issued in     the 19th century by the now defunct Chicago, Saginaw and Canada Railroad     Co. (Saginaw).  The order continues the Court s temporary restraining order     entered on January 20, 1998.  The order also prohibits the fraudulent sale     of interests in a prime bank-type trading program.  Following an     evidentiary hearing on January 29, 1998, Judge William F. Downes entered     the preliminary injunction on Friday, February 13, 1998, against Daniel E.     Schneider (Schneider), a resident of Worland, Wyoming, and related entities     Global American Prosperity Foundation (GAPF) and Financial Acquisition     Sovereign Trust (FAST).  The order also freezes assets held by Schneider,     GAPF and FAST.          In a written opinion, the Court concluded that the bonds are worthless     as investments, having value only as historical memorabilia, and that the     prime bank trading scheme touted by Schneider is fictitious.  The Court     concluded that the Commission established a prima case that, Schneider,     GAPF and FAST, through their false and misleading statements, violated the     antifraud provisions, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and     Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5     thereunder.  The Commissions complaint alleged that during 1997,     Schneider, GAPF and FAST raised a total of at least $2 million from six,     and possibly more than 30, investors nationwide through the sale of Saginaw     bonds and through a bank debenture trading program in which the Saginaw     bonds or other assets purportedly could be used to generate substantial     returns.          In the preliminary injunction, Judge Downes continued the terms of the     previously issued temporary restraining order as to all of the named relief     defendants, including California residents Norman Fadel (Fadel) and Gordon     A. Dunlop (Dunlop), Utah resident Ken Karlson (Karlson), and First     Consortium International, located in California.  The Commission s     Complaint alleged that Fadel and Karlson received approximately $96,000 and     $354,000, respectively, from Schneider, GAPF and FAST in connection with     Schneider s solicitation of the worthless railroad bonds, and that Dunlop     and First Consortium hold $1.2 million of investor funds Schneider     collected in connection with the fictitious bank trading program.                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\x0c"
15650,1998,,"b\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                   UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION\r\r     LITIGATION RELEASE NO. 15650 / February 23, 1998\r\r\r     SEC v. WEYMAN B. SINYARD, THOMAS G. POULAKIDAS, RANDY DEPOISTER, AND JARCO,\r     INC. (N.D. Ill., Civil Action File No. 94C-5856)\r\r     The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) announced that on\r     February 2, 1998, the Honorable John Grady of the United States District\r     Court for the Northern District of Illinois entered an Order of Permanent\r     Injunction (Order) Against Defendant Randy Depoister (Depoister).  The\r     Court granted the Commissions motion for summary judgment and permanently\r     enjoined Depoister from violating the securities registration and antifraud\r     provisions of the federal securities laws.\r\r     In the Order, the Court makes detailed findings against Depoister. \r     According to the findings, between October 1989 and June 1991, Depoister,\r     at times through his registered investment adviser, Financial Resources\r     Advisory, Inc. (FRA), offered an investment in Jarco, Inc. (Jarco) to\r     prospective investors.  As a result of Depoisters offers and resulting\r     sales of this Jarco investment, Depoister raised $461,750 from eighteen\r     investors.  To evidence the funds Depoister raised for Jarco, unsecured\r     promissory notes were issued to each investor.\r\r     The Court also makes findings that, in the offer and sale of the Jarco\r     investment to the public, Depoister knowingly misrepresented and omitted to\r     state numerous material facts pertaining to the investment.  Specifically,\r     Depoister promised investors that the investment was short-term, ranging\r     from one week to one year, and that they would receive returns ranging from\r     20% to 100% when he knew that he could not promise such short-term returns. \r     In fact, the Court makes findings that, despite Depoisters promises, the\r     investors have never received back their principal investment or any of\r     their promised returns.  The Court further makes findings that Depoister\r     assured investors that the Jarco investment was safe, guaranteed and\r     involved little or no risk when he knew that he could not promise such\r     safety.  Depoister also told some investors, prior to the time they\r     invested, that he had invested his own money in the Jarco investment when,\r     in fact, Depoister never invested his own money.  Further, Depoister\r     fraudulently converted investors funds for his own use, misappropriating\r     $90,200 of the monies he raised from investors for uses unrelated to the\r     Jarco investment and without disclosing such uses to investors.  Depoister\r     also misrepresented to some investors the true nature of the Jarco\r     investment.  Moreover, Depoister falsely and fraudulently assured certain\r     of his clients that delays in returning their monies were only temporary\r     and that the money would be forthcoming in days, even though Depoister knew\r     he could not promise such prompt return of investors money.\r\r     Finally, in the Order, the Court makes several conclusions of law. \r     Specifically, the Court concludes that:  (1) the Jarco investment\r     constituted a security; (2) in connection with his offer and sale of the\r     Jarco securities to investors, which included certain of his investment\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c\r\r\r\r\r\r\r     advisory clients, Depoister knowingly misrepresented and omitted to state\r     material facts pertaining to the investment and thereby violated Section\r     17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Section 10(b) of the\r     Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder and\r     aided and abetted violations of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the\r     Investment Advisers Act of 1940; \r     (3) Depoisters offer and sale of the unregistered Jarco securities\r     violated the securities registration requirements of Sections 5(a) and 5(c)\r     of the Securities Act; and (4) due to the reasonable likelihood that\r     Depoister will engage in future violations of the securities laws,\r     injunctive relief is appropriate against Depoister.\r\r     Previously, on January 7, 1998, the Court, pursuant to a Commission motion\r     for such relief, dismissed the Commission s claim for disgorgement and\r     civil penalties against Depoister and the Commission s entire action\r     against Depoister s registered investment adviser, FRA.\r\r     For further information, see Litigation Release Nos. 14259 (September 27,\r     1994), 14308 (October 28, 1994), 14512 (May 26, 1995), 14603 (August 15,\r     1995), 14863 (April 5, 1996), 14883 (April 17, 1996).\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 2======\r\x0c"

JOHN, Civil Action No. SACV 98-135 AHS (EEx) (C.D. Cal.)\r\r          On February 20, 1998, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed an\r     emergency lawsuit shutting down a Southern California boiler room which was\r     deceiving investors into believing that former U.S. Surgeon General C.\r     Everett Koop and NBC television journalist Tom Brokaw had endorsed one of\r     the defendants  companies.  The scheme, which has bilked investors out of\r     more than $5 million since January 1997, employed high pressure\r     telemarketing sales techniques and used Dr. Koop s likeness and quotations\r     on an Internet website to fraudulently sell securities.  \r\r          The individual defendants, David A. Colvin, 54, of Chatsworth,\r     California, Job Kjell Hovik, of Carlsbad, California, Lamar Ellis, of\r     Pomona, California and John Larson (a/k/a John St. John) of Los Angeles,\r     California, used a Canoga Park boiler room, Intellinet Publishing, Inc., to\r     sell securities in an obesity clinic company, Medical Advantage, Inc. and\r     an alcohol and drug detoxification company, Lamelli, Inc.  Another firm,\r     Wall Street Research Company, Inc., which purports to do investment\r     research, issued fraudulent  buy  recommendations for Medical Advantage. \r\r          In its lawsuit, the Commission alleges that the defendants falsely\r     claimed that Dr. Koop and Mr. Brokaw were affiliated with the Medical\r     Advantage obesity clinics and that Mr. Brokaw would be the company s\r     infomercial spokesperson.  The Commission further alleges that investors\r     were falsely promised the return of their principal investment, plus 12%\r     interest, in 120 to 180 days.  Instead, Colvin, who masterminded the\r     scheme, misappropriated investor funds, using most of the money for boiler\r     room expenses and for his other business ventures.  Among the other\r     misrepresentations alleged, the defendants falsely claimed that Medical\r     Advantage and Lamelli would become public companies in 120 to 180 days. \r     The defendants further claimed that Lamelli had built and leased 250\r     detoxification units and expected $37 million in revenues in the first\r     quarter of 1998.  In fact, Medical Advantage and Lamelli are not public\r     companies.  Further, Lamelli does not have any completed detoxification\r     units or lease agreements and has yet to generate any revenue.  In\r     addition, Colvin concealed his ownership of Wall Street Research and\r     deceived investors into believing that its buy recommendations for Medical\r     Advantage were the result of independent and impartial investment research.\r\r\r          In the lawsuit, which was filed in the United States District Court\r     for the Central District of California, the Commission obtained an order\r     freezing the assets of the defendants, appointing a receiver to preserve\r\r                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\r\x0c\r\r\r\r\r\r\r     investor assets and temporarily enjoining the defendants from future\r     violations of Section 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933\r     and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule\r     10b-5 thereunder.

The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a federal civil     enforcement action alleging illegal profit sharing arrangements between a     registered broker-dealer and eight brokers on the floor of the New York     Stock Exchange.  As a result of the unlawful arrangements, the defendants     made over $11.1 million in illegal profits since the arrangements began in     October 1993.            Named as defendants in the Commission s Complaint filed in federal     court in Manhattan are the following:     The Oakford Corporation ( Oakford ), a broker-dealer registered with the        Commission since 1991, and located in New York, New York;     William S.

Bock, age 45, of Garden City, New York, Oakford s Chief Financial        Officer.          The Complaint alleges that Killeen and Bock entered into unlawful     profit sharing arrangements with the following defendants, all of whom are     members of the NYSE (collectively the  Floor Brokers ):     .  Thomas J. Cavallino, age 41, of Shrewsbury, New Jersey, an independent        floor broker on the NYSE doing business as Oakwood Securities, Inc.,        since 1991;     .  Edward J.

Also named as defendants are the registered broker-dealers and NYSE member     firms Edward J. Mueger, Inc., of Port Washington, New York, R.M. Carucci     Corp., of Staten Island, New York, Touchdown Securities, Inc., of New York,     New York, MFS Securities Corp., of New York, New York, Oakwood Securities     Corp., of White Plains, New York, and D Alessio Securities, Inc., of New     York, New York.          The Commission s Complaint alleges as follows:          Pursuant to the profit sharing arrangements, Bock and Killeen opened     accounts at Oakford and falsely identified the accounts as Oakford     proprietary trading accounts.  These Oakford accounts were, in fact,     controlled by the defendant Floor Brokers.  During the day, as they learned     of potentially advantageous trading opportunities from their unique     positions on the floor of the NYSE, the defendant Floor Brokers initiated     transactions in the Oakford accounts.  The Floor Brokers and Bock and     Killeen generally split the profits and losses in the Oakford accounts     70/30 - 70% to the Floor Brokers and 30% to Oakford.  Between October 1993     and December 1996, this scheme netted illegal profits totaling at least     $11.1 million, with the Floor Brokers receiving approximately $8.8 million     and Oakford receiving approximately $2.3 million.            In order to conceal their scheme, the defendants deliberately     falsified various books and records, including order tickets, so as to     conceal from regulators the true nature of these transactions.  During the     trading day Oakford time stamped numerous blank order tickets.  After the     Floor Brokers executed an order in their Oakford accounts, they     communicated to Bock, Killeen or an Oakford clerk the details of the trade.      At that time, Bock, Killeen or an Oakford clerk selected a previously time     stamped Oakford order ticket which reflected a time prior to the time the     Floor Broker had executed the order.  Bock, Killeen, or an Oakford clerk     then filled in the details of the trade on the Oakford order ticket.  By     creating false order tickets in this manner, the defendants made it appear     that the Floor Brokers  trades had resulted from orders that the Floor     Brokers had received from Oakford.           The federal securities laws and a variety of NYSE rules prohibit floor     brokers from trading for their own account while they are on the floor of     the exchange.  From their unique position on the floor of the NYSE, floor     brokers are immediately aware of changes in securities prices, large buy     and sell orders for securities, and a host of other information not     immediately ascertainable to other participants and investors in the     markets.  The proscriptions against trading by floor brokers are intended     to prevent floor brokers from taking unfair advantage of their unique     position.            The Commission s Complaint charged the defendants with violating, or     aiding and abetting violations of, Sections 11(a) and 17(a) of the     Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 11a-1, 17a-3 and 17a-5 thereunder                              ======END OF PAGE 2======\x0c     and NYSE Rules 90(a), 95(a) and 111(a).

The Commission\s action is a result of an investigation with the     United States Attorney\s Office for the Southern District of New York, the     Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation Division, the Federal     Bureau of Investigation and the NYSE.                              ======END OF PAGE 3======\x0c"

Financial Management, Ltd. (R.T.& A.).  The     Commission seeks the issuance of a temporary restraining order, a freeze of     assets, an accounting and other emergency relief.  The Commission also     seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions, disgorgement, prejudgment     interest and civil penalties.  The Complaint also names Jean M.     Tommassello, Tommassello s wife, as a relief defendant solely for the     purpose of disgorgement because as a joint accountholder with Tommassello     she received funds resulting from the unlawful activity described below.      The Complaint alleges that Tommassello and R.T.& A. violated the antifraud     provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section     10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.          The Complaint alleges that from at least November 1995 through the     present, Tommassello, a registered principal who operates a branch office     of First Colonial Securities Group, Inc., a registered broker-dealer, in     Hazleton, Pennsylvania, has been perpetrating a fraudulent scheme through     R.T.& A., a private corporation which he controls.  Tommassello has engaged     in a scheme to misappropriate money from investors by fraudulently     soliciting individuals to purchase mutual funds or variable annuities.      Rather than purchasing the securities as promised, Tommassello has     deposited at least $1 million of investor funds directly into bank accounts     controlled by him, and has used these funds to pay for various personal and     business expenses.            The Complaint further alleges that Tommassello and R.T.& A have     concealed the scheme and lulled defrauded investors by making false     assurances, creating fictitious account statements, and making false and     misleading statements to investors and to staff members of the Pennsylvania     Securities Commission and the Commission.  In order to further conceal his     scheme, Tommassello has made payments to investors which he has represented     to be distributions from their investments when, in fact, those funds have     come from other investors.  In some cases, in order to placate investors     who have demanded proof of their investments, Tommassello has used new     investor funds to belatedly purchase the mutual fund or variable annuity on     behalf of the investor making the inquiry.                                         - 2 -          The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Pennsylvania                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\x0c     Securities Commission in this matter.                              ======END OF PAGE 2======\x0c"
15656,1998,,"b                       U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission     Litigation Release No. 15656 / March 3, 1998     Securities and Exchange Commission v. Hurst Capital Corporation, et al.,     Case No. 98-8090-CIV-HURLEY (USDC/SD FL)           The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that on     February 27, 1998, the Honorable Daniel T.K. Hurley, United States District     Judge for the Southern District of Florida continued the emergency Orders     he had entered on February 18, 1998 against Hurst Capital Corp. (HCC), a     West Palm Beach company that sells interests in accounts receivable.      Specifically, Judge Hurley preliminarily enjoined defendants HCC, James F.     Hurst and E. William Clifton from violating the securities laws, froze     their assets and those of four corporations they control, and authorized     the previously appointed Receiver for HCC, Kenneth A. Welt, to continue to     marshal assets.  All defendants either consented or did not object to the     entry of these orders.  At the hearing before Judge Hurley, the SEC     announced that it had frozen approximately $16.5 million in funds.          In its Complaint and application to the Court for a temporary     restraining order, asset freeze and appointment of a receiver, all of which     the Court granted on February 18, 1998 and extended on February 27, 1998,     the SEC alleged that HCC had raised $49 million from 1300 investors across     the nation to buy accounts receivable but that it had only purchased     approximately $625,000 worth of receivables.          According to the SEC\s complaint, HCC, Hurst and Clifton have been     offering investors across the nation worthless interests in non-existent     accounts receivable.  HCC\s own records establish, the SEC alleges, that is     has raised $49 million from investors but purchased only $625,000 worth of     receivables.  According to the SEC\s complaint, millions of dollars have     been misappropriated by Defendants or transferred to corporations they     control.  For example, the SEC alleges that Defendant Hurst diverted at     least $10 million in investor funds to his personal account and spent this     money on a luxury home, on personal investments, and on cars and boats.          The Complaint charges violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of     the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder of     the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  In addition to a permanent     injunction, the SEC is also seeking disgorgement of ill-gotten profits and     money penalties.                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\x0c"
15657,1998,,"b          U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission     Litigation Release No. 15657 / March 3, 1998     Accounting and Auditing Enforcement       Release No. 1013  / March 3, 1998     SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION v. ROBERT B. PELTZ, Civil Action No. 98-     CV 00542(JGP) (D.D.C.); and SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION v.SOL     GREENBAUM AND DAVID COHEN, Civil Action No. 98-CV 00543(JGP) (D.D.C.); IN     THE MATTER OF J.M. LEVY AND CO., Administrative Proceeding File No. 3-9295     The SEC today filed complaints in federal court against Robert B. Peltz,     Sol Greenbaum, and David Cohen alleging securities law violations arising     out of a fraudulent scheme to overstate the revenues and earnings of the     Peltz Food Division of Chipwich, Inc.  Without admitting or denying the     SEC s allegations, the defendants have consented to the entry of final     judgments against them.     The complaint in no. 98-CV00542 alleges the following:  In February 1989,     Robert Peltz merged his privately-owned Peltz Food Company, a distributor     of frozen foods, into Chipwich, a public company, and became CEO and     chairman of Chipwich.  At year-end in 1989, 1990, and 1991, with Peltz s     knowledge and approval, the Peltz Food Division (PFD) of Chipwich     overstated its inventory, causing Chipwich to materially overstate its     inventory and net income.  In addition, during the relevant period, Peltz     misappropriated corporate funds to pay personal expenses and took     unrecorded cash from PFD s daily cash receipts.  By engaging in such     conduct, Peltz violated Exchange Act sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) and Rules     10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2.     The complaint in no. 98-CV00543 names as defendants Sol Greenbaum and David     Cohen, the CPAs who prepared PFD s financial statements and acted as its     financial management.  The complaint alleges that Greenbaum and Cohen knew     or were reckless in not knowing of the inventory inflation and     misappropriation of cash at PFD, and that they knew or were reckless in not     knowing that the financial statements they prepared for PFD were materially     false and misleading and would be relied upon by Chipwich in preparing     financial statements for dissemination in its Forms 10-K and 10-Q.     All three defendants consented to the entry of judgment against them     without admitting or denying the SEC s allegations.  The judgment against     Peltz permanently bars him from serving as an officer or director of any     reporting company and enjoins him from further violations of Exchange Act     sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2; it waives     payment of disgorgement based on Peltz s demonstrated inability to pay and     penalties are not imposed.  The judgment against Greenbaum and Cohen     enjoins them from further violations of Exchange Act Sections 10(b), 13(a),     13(b)(2) and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13 and 13b2-1.     In conjunction with the filing of no. 98-CV00543, the Commission has     dismissed Administrative Proceeding No. 3-9295.                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\x0c                                    ======END OF PAGE 2======\x0c"

KUSLIMA SHOGEN, STANISLAW MIKULSKI,     AND ALLEN SIEGEL, Civil Action No. 1:98CV00545(GK), USDC, DDC, (filed March     3, 1998)          On March 3, the Commission filed a complaint in the United States     District Court for the District of Columbia against Kuslima Shogen     (Shogen), Stanislaw Mikulski (Mikulski), and Allen Siegel (Siegel).  The     Commission alleged that with respect to their beneficial ownership of the     equity securities of Alfacell Corporation (Alfacell): (1) Shogen violated     Sections 13(d), 13(g) and 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934     (Exchange Act), and Rules 13d-1, 13d-2, 16a-2, 16a-3 and former Rule 16a-1     thereunder, by failing to file a Schedule 13D and 13G, and thirty-six     amendments thereto, and by not timely filing a Form 3, sixty-seven Forms 4     and three Forms 5 in transactions worth more than $25.5 million, (2)     Mikulski violated Sections 13(d) and 16(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rules     13d-1, 13d-2, 16a-2, 16a-3 and former Rule 16a-1 thereunder, by failing to     file a Schedule 13D and fifteen amendments thereto, and by not timely     filing a Form 3, twenty-six Forms 4 and three Forms 5 in transactions worth     more than $6.9 million, and (3) Siegel violated Section 16(a) of the     Exchange Act, and Rules 16a-2, 16a-3 and former Rule 16a-1 thereunder, by     not timely filing a Form 3, forty-two Forms 4 and four Forms 5 in     transactions worth more than $5.6 million. The Commission requested the     court to impose civil penalties of (1) $20,000 against Shogen, and (2)     $10,000 each against Mikulski and Siegel, pursuant to Section 21(d)(3) of     the Exchange Act.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the     complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment     imposing those penalties.          In a related matter, the Commission issued an administrative Order     pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, finding that Shogen, Mikulski,     and Siegel, violated the provisions of the Exchange Act as set forth above.      Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions Order, the     respondents consented to the entry of the Order requiring them to cease and     desist from committing or causing any violations or future violations of     those currently effective Exchange Act provisions.                               ======END OF PAGE 1======\x0c"

15660,1998,,"b          SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION     Washington, D. C.     Litigation Release No. 15660 / March 5, 1998     SEC v. THE BETTER LIFE CLUB OF AMERICA, INC., and ROBERT N. TAYLOR,     Defendants, and WILKINS MCNAIR, JR., CPA, AS TRUSTEE, and ELIZABETH LAWSON,     Relief Defendants, United States District Court for the District of     Columbia, Civ. No. 95-1679 (TFH)     On February 27, 1998, Judge Thomas F. Hogan of the United States District     Court for the District of Columbia issued a decision granting the     Commission s motion for summary judgment on all of its claims against the     defendants, Robert N. Taylor and the Better Life Club of America, Inc., and     the relief defendants, Wilkins McNair, Jr., CPA, as Trustee, and Elizabeth     Lawson.     Judge Hogan held that Taylor and his Washington, D.C.-based Better Life     Club engaged in securities fraud and the unlawful sale of unregistered     securities by perpetrating a massive Ponzi scheme called the Better Life     Club  Advertising Pool,  in which numerous middle- and working-class     investors across the country lost more than $25.8 million.  The court     entered a permanent injunction against Taylor and the Better Life Club and     ordered them to pay approximately $25.8 million in disgorgement and     restitution, plus prejudgment interest,  to the court-appointed Receiver,     Michael J. Missal, for distribution to the defrauded investors.  The assets     to be disgorged include approximately $2.5 million of Better Life Club     funds frozen at the outset of the case and a house in Fort Washington,     Maryland, and at least three automobiles that Taylor purchased with Better     Life Club investor funds.     In his 34-page decision, Judge Hogan found that Taylor raised more than     $45 million from investors in the  Advertising Pool  between January 1,     1993, and August 31, 1995, promising to double each investor s money in     either 60 or 90 days.  Through the Better Life Club s so-called  wealth     building  seminars, publications, fliers, letters, and other promotional     efforts, the investors were told that their funds would be used to      advertise Better Life Club 900-lines and to promote other profit-making     business activities.   The court found, however, that almost all of the     funds that were coming into Better Life Club accounts were made up of new     investments, not of profits from Club activities.  None of the Club s      profit making  ventures ever managed to turn a profit.  Judge Hogan noted     that even the defendants admitted that the vaunted  900-number  services     failed to generate any income.  When the SEC filed the action and obtained     a freeze of the defendants  assets on September 1, 1995, the Club had     investor obligations in excess of $51.6 million coming due in the next     ninety days, yet had only $2.7 million in the bank.  It was thus apparent,     Judge Hogan concluded, that Taylor s  grand pyramid scheme  was  teetering     on the verge of collapse when [the Commission] stepped in to end the     masquerade.                               ======END OF PAGE 1======\x0c     The court also found that Taylor had received substantial sums of money     from at least 27 Better Life Club bank accounts during his two and a half     years at the Club s helm.  According to a report filed by Mr. Missal,     Taylor received in excess of $800,000, and perhaps as much as $1.2 million;     Judge Hogan noted that the net amount of Taylor s withdrawals may in fact     have been even higher.  Besides withdrawing cash, Taylor used investor     funds to finance the purchase of a house in Fort Washington, Maryland,     build a 40-foot swimming pool, buy at least three automobiles, and create     trusts holding $120,000 for his two sons.     In granting summary judgment, Judge Hogan found that the Commission had     submitted evidence establishing that there is no genuine dispute concerning     any fact material to its claims.  The court held that Taylor and the Club     violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Commission     Rule 10b-5, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, which prohibit     material misrepresentations in connection with the offer or sale of     securities.  Holding that investments in the  Advertising Pool  constitute     investment contracts, a type of security, Judge Hogan found that the     defendants  never revealed to potential investors that the Advertising Pool     was nothing more than a pyramid scheme; thus, the entire solicitation     process was itself a broad misrepresentation on the grandest scale.   In     addition, because the defendants never registered the  Advertising Pool      with the Commission, the court also found that the defendants had engaged     in the sale of unregistered securities in violation of Section 5 of the     Securities Act of 1933.     Judge Hogan also granted summary judgment on the Commission s claims     against Taylor s accountant, Wilkins McNair, Jr., and Taylor s former     living companion, Elizabeth Lawson, ordering them to disgorge fraudulently     obtained investor funds and other assets that Taylor gratuitously gave to     them.  In particular, McNair was ordered to pay $120,000, plus prejudgment     interest, that Taylor gave to him as trustee for Taylor s two sons.  Judge     Hogan found that McNair took the money in exchange for worthless shares of     stock in a failing mortgage company founded and owned by McNair himself.      Lawson was ordered to turn over her interest in the Fort Washington house     that she owns jointly with Taylor (less the amounts of mortgage payments     she has made); a $50,000  loan  and $8,000  consulting fee  that Taylor     paid to a business owned by Lawson; a 1992 Jaguar XJ6 (less a credit for     her contribution to the purchase price); and a $7,500 cashier s check.      Taylor gave the  loan,   consulting fee,  and Jaguar to Lawson shortly     after he learned that he was under investigation by the Commission in the     summer of 1995.     At the conclusion of his opinion, Judge Hogan observed:      The net effect of defendants  fraud is that hundreds of middle-class,     small-scale investors are left holding losses that exceed $25 million.      Defendants are liable to pay that full amount in restitution to the     defrauded investors, and the relief defendants must disgorge the money and     gifts that they received.  Even with such disgorgement and liability,     however, it is uncertain that the investors will ever recoup the full     amount of their economic losses, much less regain the trust and peace of     mind that defendants have so callously stolen from them.      Taylor, age 48, is currently serving a 41-month sentence in a federal                              ======END OF PAGE 2======\x0c     correctional institution in Petersburg, Virginia.  See SEC Litig.

DIRECT PARTICIPATION SERVICES, INC.     D/B/A GOVERNMENT FINANCIAL, JEFFREY A. LOBEL, WILLIAM ROSSI, UNITED AVALON     GROUP, LTD., AND FRANK M. NAFT, Civil Action No. 96-6594 LGB (Mcx)  (C.D.     Cal.)          The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) announced that     on February 25, 1998 a Judgment of Permanent Injunction and Other Relief     was entered against defendants United Avalon Group, Ltd. ( UAG ), a     California corporation, and its sole owner, officer and director, Frank M.     Naft (Naft), which enjoined them from future violations of the antifraud     provisions of the Exchange Act and ordered them to disgorge $310,307.40.       The Complaint alleges that UAG served as trustee for Direct Participation     Services, Inc., d/b/a Government Financial ( GF ). GF allegedly offered and     sold nine-month promissory notes (Notes ), raising approximately $26     million from approximately 750 investors between, July 1, 1993 and May 15,     1995.  The Complaint alleges, among other things, that GF misrepresented     the use of the proceeds from the securities offering, the safety of the     investment, and the duties of UAG, which was to serve as an independent     trustee.           Specifically, the Complaint alleges that GF s offering materials     represented that proceeds from the sale of Notes would be deposited into a     segregated internal trust account held by the trustee.  The offering     materials, further, provided that the trustee would assume principal     responsibility for administering the investment, including holding all loan     portfolio documents, receiving assignments of all assets purchased by GF,     receiving all payments from obligors, and enforcing the Noteholders      security interest in the accounts receivable which GF was to purchase.  The     Complaint alleges that UAG and Naft knowingly failed to discharge these     duties. Instead, the Complaint alleges that the trustee operated as a mere     disbursing agent.  In addition, the Complaint alleges that Naft and his     affiliates received approximately $3.0 million in unsecured, undocumented     loans from GF.  As a result of GF s failure to operate GF in the manner     represented, the Note program evolved into a ponzi-like scheme since,     according to the Complaint, investors were repaid using funds of subsequent     investors. UAG and Naft were enjoined from future violations of Section 10b     of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [15 U.S.C. \x15 78j(b)] and Rule 10b-5     thereunder [17 C.F.R. \x15 240.10b-5]. UAG and Naft were additionally enjoined     from knowingly providing substantial assistance to another person in     violation of the provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or of     any rule or regulation issued thereunder.                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\x0c"

LITIGATION RELEASE NO. 15662 / March 10, 1998     SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION v. QUALIFIED PENSIONS, INC., ET AL.,     Civil Action No. 95-1746 (LFO)(D.D.C.)     UNITED STATES v. JERRY G. ALLISON, Cr. 98-71-PHX-RGS (D. Az.)          The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) today filed with     the United States District Court for the District of Columbia documents     that will resolve the remaining claims in its enforcement action against     Jerry G. Allison (Allison), the former president and 90 percent owner of     Qualified Pensions, Inc. ( QPI ). On September 13, 1995, the Commission     filed this case alleging that Allison and QPI defrauded investors by     misappropriating millions of dollars in retirement savings that were     entrusted to QPI by its clients to be maintained in Individual Retirement     Accounts and other retirement savings plans.  The complaint also alleged     that Allison and QPI executed securities transactions for their clients     without registering as brokers.  That same day, the Commission obtained a     temporary restraining order freezing assets and granting other emergency     relief, and on September 26, 1995 obtained an order placing QPI in     receivership.          Pursuant to the settlement, Allison will consent to the entry of an     order requiring him to disgorge $11,419,223, the amount of QPI customer     assets that were missing on the date the Commission filed this action.  As     of December 31, 1997, the Receiver has obtained approximately $2.3 million     from assets recovered from Allison and others to whom Allison transferred     monies misappropriated from QPI s customers.  The Receiver projects that by     the end of the receivership, currently expected to be December 31, 1998, he     will liquidate more than an additional $1.2 million of such recovered     assets.  Moreover, the Receiver also has obtained approximately $2.3     million for the benefit of QPI customers by, among other things, pursuing     claims against other parties.  Under the settlement, payment of additional     disgorgement by Allison will be waived in light of Allison s demonstrated     inability to pay based on his sworn representations in his statement of     financial condition.          Previously, on June 17, 1997, on motion of the Commission, the Court     entered a Permanent Injunction against Allison, by default, enjoining him     from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b),     15(a), and 15(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act),     and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, which are the antifraud and broker-dealer     registration provisions of the federal securities laws.  As an additional     part of today s settlement, Allison consented to the entry of a Commission     Order barring him from association with any broker, dealer, municipal     securities dealer, investment adviser or investment company.          Also today before the United States District Court for the District of                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\x0c     Arizona, Allison pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud.

SUNBELT DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION,     WENDELL ROGERS, DONALD HAMMOND, AND WILLIE DAVIS (Civil Action No. 1: 97-     CV-1387, W.D. La.)     The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that, on February 24,     1998, the Honorable F.A. Little, United States District Judge for the     Western District of Louisiana, Alexandria Division, entered a default     judgment against defendant Willie Davis ( Davis ) for failing to respond to     a complaint filed by the Commission seeking a permanent injunction,     disgorgement and civil penalties.       An order of permanent injunction was entered against Davis enjoining him     from further violations of Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of     1933 and Sections 15(a) and 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934     and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Davis was also ordered to pay disgorgement in     the amount of $236,500, and prejudgment interest thereon, representing the     ill-gotten gains he received from the scheme. Disgorgement is to be paid     within 30 days of the date of the Court s order.  Davis was also ordered to     pay a civil penalty, which will be determined at a later date, upon motion     by the Commission.     The Commissions complaint, dated July 15, 1997, alleged that violations of     the antifraud provisions of the securities laws by Davis and his co-     defendants occurred between mid-1993 and mid-1994. During that time, Davis,     who is or was a minister, misrepresented or omitted material facts when he     sold securities to members of his church. Davis actively promoted defendant     Sunbelt Development Corporation ( Sunbelt ) to his congregation, while     encouraging them to borrow money to invest in Sunbelt. Davis and the other     defendants promised exorbitant returns on investments along with the return     of the investors principal when, in fact, Sunbelt was actually operating a     Ponzi scheme.  More than $3.5 million worth of unregistered securities were     issued to over 200 individuals in at least 16 states during the scheme.                                      ======END OF PAGE 1======\x0c"

Action No. C 98-937     MMC (N.D. Cal)          The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that on March     10, 1998 it sued a San Francisco investment advisory firm, its owner, and a     portfolio manager for misappropriating more than $109,000 in client-owned     soft dollar credits and for trading securities for the clients without     their informed consent.  The Commission sued Sweeney Capital Management     Inc. (SCM), an investment advisory firm with offices formerly in San     Francisco; Timothy Charles Sweeney, 44, a San Rafael resident; and Susan     Mary Gorski, 41, a Larkspur resident, in United States District Court in     San Francisco.  Sweeney is the sole owner and president of SCM, a     California corporation registered with the Commission as an investment     adviser from March 1993 until July 1997.  Gorski is SCM\s vice-president     and a portfolio manager.           The complaint alleges that SCM, Sweeney, and Gorski from April 1994     through May 1995 defrauded SCM\s advisory clients out of more than $109,000     by purchasing and selling securities for the clients without disclosing     that SCM was using soft dollar credits for its own benefit.  Soft dollar     credits, also referred to as soft dollars, are rebates from a brokerage     firm generated when an investment adviser places securities trades for its     clients through the brokerage firm.  Here, for example, SCM received a     $1.00 soft dollar credit for every 1.75 of brokerage commissions generated     by SCM\s trades for its clients.  Soft dollars are assets of the adviser\s     clients.  Without informing their clients, Defendants arranged to have the     brokerage firms use the soft dollar credits to pay for a variety of     Defendants\ business and personal expenses, including client gifts,     telephone bills, marketing expenses, accounting and legal bills, postage     and shipping, furniture, art work, business licenses, rent, parking, office     supplies, and taxes.          The defrauded clients included both individuals and a hedge fund whose     assets SCM managed.  During its fiscal year ended December 31, 1994, SCM     paid approximately 70% of its operating expenses with soft dollars     misappropriated from its advisory clients and the hedge fund.  Without     these soft dollar payments, SCM would have been insolvent during this     period.            In addition to SCM\s fraudulent misappropriation of soft dollars, the     complaint alleges that SCM, Sweeney, and Gorski engaged in other fraudulent     soft dollar practices.  At various times between April 1994 and May 1995,     SCM, Sweeney, and Gorski submitted false invoices to soft dollar brokers     for consulting work that was never provided to SCM in order to pay for,     among other things, Gorski\s salary, SCM\s rent, and personal loans made to     Sweeney.  SCM, Sweeney, and Gorski also submitted multiple invoices for the     same goods and services in order to be reimbursed twice for the same     expense.                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\x0c          Finally, the Commission\s complaint alleges that SCM and Sweeney filed     false forms with the Commission, distributed misleading marketing materials     to the public, made false claims to investors about the competitiveness of     SCM\s advisory fees, misused client assets in its custody, and     misappropriated an elderly client\s funds.            In its complaint, the Commission seeks the following:  (i) permanent     injunctions against future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities     Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule     10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 204, 206(1), 206(2), 206(4) and 207 of the     Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rules 204-1, 204-3, 206(4)-1, 206(4)-2     and 206(4)-4 thereunder; (ii) disgorgement of illegal profits; and (iii)     civil penalties against SCM, Sweeney and Gorski.                              ======END OF PAGE 2======\x0c"

DOBBINS and FIDELITY     SECURED DEPOSIT CORPORATION, Civ. Action No. 98-229 (USDA C.D. Ca./Southern     Division at Santa Ana)          The Commission announced today that it obtained a second federal court     order prohibiting the fraudulent sale of bonds, purportedly backed by gold,     issued in the 19th century by now defunct railroads.  The emergency     restraining order, issued March 9, 1998, by Judge Gary L. Taylor, prohibits     Gerald A. Dobbins ( Dobbins ) and Fidelity Secured Deposit Corp. ( FSDC )     both of Orange County, California, from preparing and disseminating     fraudulent authentication and valuation documents relating to bonds     including those issued by the Chicago, Saginaw and Canada Railroad Co.     (Saginaw) in 1873 and by the East Alabama & Cincinnati Railroad ( EA&C ) in     1870.  According to the complaint, these bonds are worthless as     investments, having value only as historical memorabilia, but have been     offered and sold to investors at prices up to $40,000 each.  Judge Taylor s     order also included a freeze of assets and an accounting against Dobbins     and FSDC.           The Commissions complaint alleged that since at least October 1995,     Dobbins, through FSDC, has prepared documents purporting to authenticate     and value Saginaw and EA&C bonds stating, among other things, that the     bonds were worth between $100 and $400 million, Dobbins was the  Master     Curator for the State and the Historical Document Society,  and the bonds     were valid or guaranteed by the State of Alabama.  The complaint further     alleged that in fact, the bonds were virtually worthless, Dobbins is not     the master curator for any state, the Historical Document Society does not     exist, and the issuers of the bonds had gone into receivership and several     foreclosure sales had been held. The Commission alleged that through their     false and misleading statements, Dobbins and FSDC violated the antifraud     provisions, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b)     of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.            This is the second civil injunctive action filed by the Commission s     Central Regional Office in connection with the fraudulent offer and sale of     Saginaw bonds.  In the first action, the U.S. District Court for the     District of Wyoming entered a preliminary injunction on February 13, 1998     including an asset freeze against defendant Daniel E. Schneider     ( Schneider ) and related entities.  The Commission s complaint alleged,     among other things, that Schneider offered and sold Saginaw bonds to     investors at $40,000 per bond through various misrepresentations, including     that the bonds were worth $100 million.

( LCI ), Medco Containment     Services, Inc. ( Medco ) and Synetic, Inc. ( Synetic ).  The Complaint     alleges that the group of friends, family members and associates obtained     illegal profits totaling more than $200,000 over a fourteen-month period.      The Complaint also alleges that certain of the defendants devised a scheme     to mislead the Commission and cover up their illegal trading after the     Commission s investigation had begun.          Licht, age 44, is an attorney, residing in Bel Air, California.  He is     a director of Synetic and, at all relevant times was also a director of     Medco. Weston, age 40, resides in Pacific Palisades, California.  He is     Licht s friend and brother-in-law. At all relevant times he was the     president of LCI.

Schilling, age 57, residing in Los Altos Hills, California, is Licht s     father-in-law.          According to the Complaint, on three occasions between March 1993 and     May 1994, Licht and Weston exchanged and dispensed tips of material, non-     public information relating to the companies for which they worked in     breach of their fiduciary duties to those companies and their shareholders.      The Complaint alleges that during the period of the offending trades, Licht     was a director of Medco and Synetic, and Weston was president of LCI.      According to the Complaint, Licht, on one occasion, and various of his co-     defendants, on three separate occasions, traded while in possession of     material, non-public information.  The Complaint further alleges that some                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\x0c     of the defendants, in turn, tipped other defendants in the  friends and     family  circle.          Specifically, the Complaint alleges:          Licht and Weston engaged in insider trading in March 1993 when Weston          tipped Licht concerning LCI s imminent earnings announcement and the          upcoming initiation of favorable analyst coverage of LCI. Licht then          purchased LCI stock and tipped his friend Korda, who also traded.  The          illegal profits from this LCI trading totaled $23,431.           Licht, Barisoff, Weston, Korda, A. Licht, Sandelson, L. Weston and          Melnik engaged in insider trading in July 1993, when Licht, directly          and indirectly, tipped this group of friends and family concerning          highly confidential merger talks then in progress between Medco and          Merck & Co.  ( Merck ). The illegal profit derived from the group s          Medco stock and options purchases, all of which took place within the          four trading days prior to the Medco-Merck merger announcement,          totaled $122,623.          Licht, Schilling, A. Licht, Weston, Korda, and Sandelson engaged in          insider trading in May 1994 in connection with highly confidential          discussions between Synetic and Merck leading to a buyback of the          Synetic stock held by Merck. Licht directly and indirectly tipped          Schilling, Weston and Korda, each of whom bought Synetic stock, and          Weston, in turn, directly and indirectly tipped three other persons,          who also bought Synetic stock. The total illegal profits derived from          the Synetic trading by all the Defendants and Weston s tippees totaled          $69,408. Licht, Weston, Korda and Sandelson took part in devising a          cover-up scheme featuring the use of a false  detective work  story to          explain the illegal insider trading in Synetic.          The Commission seeks permanent injunctions against the Defendants     prohibiting further violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and     Rule 10b-5.  The Commission also seeks disgorgement of illegal trading     profits including prejudgment interest, and civil monetary penalties for     the fraudulent conduct under the Insider Trading and Securities Fraud     Enforcement Act.  The Commission also seeks a Court order permanently     barring Defendant Roger Licht from serving as an officer or director of a     public company pursuant to Section 21(d)(2) of the Exchange Act.          Simultaneously with the filing of the Commission s Complaint, Weston,     L. Weston, Melnik and Schilling consented to the entry of final judgments     against them without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint.      Each consented to be enjoined from violating Section 10(b) of the     Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Additionally, Weston     agreed to disgorge all of his own trading profits together with prejudgment     interest thereon, for a total of $40,234.  Melnik agreed to disgorge his     trading profits together with prejudgment interest and civil money     penalties for a total of $20,240.  Schilling agreed to disgorge his trading     profits together with prejudgment interest and civil money penalties for a     total of $15,082.  With respect to both Westons, disgorgement of their     tippees  profits was waived and no civil penalty was imposed because of     their demonstrated inability to pay based on their sworn representations in     their statement of financial condition.                              ======END OF PAGE 2======\x0c                              ======END OF PAGE 3======\x0c"

SIMS, Civil Action No. 97-6546 DDP (RZx)  (C.D. Cal)     On March 2, 1998, the District Court for the Central District of California     entered final judgments of permanent injunction and other relief against     Philip L. Thomas and David V. Sims prohibiting future violations of the     antifraud provisions of Section 17 (a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and     Section 10 (b) of the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5     thereunder.  Thomas and Sims consented, without admitting or denying the     allegations in the complaint filed by the Securities and Exchange     Commission, to the permanent injunctions enjoining them from future     violations of the federal securities laws.  The Commission waived payment     of disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and did not assess civil     penalties, based upon Thomas s and Sims s demonstrated inability to pay.      Litigation is still pending against Rob Nite, the sole remaining defendant,     who is currently incarcerated in federal prison on charges unrelated to the     Commission s action.     On September 3, 1997, the Commission filed the complaint in federal     district court in Los Angeles against Nite, Thomas and Sims alleging that     they conducted a multi-million dollar fraudulent investment scheme     involving the fictional trading of securities purportedly issued by major     international banks.  The Commission s complaint alleged that from July     1994 through October 1994, the defendants,  Nite, age 47, Thomas, age 43     and Sims, age 47, offered and sold to the public interests in a phony     program to trade these purported securities, amassing approximately $3.7     million.  For their investment, the victims were promised astronomical     returns on relatively small investments.  Specifically, the complaint     alleges that the defendants guaranteed the victims that for an initial     investment of either $50,000 or $150,000, they would receive returns of $1     million per week for 40 weeks, or $40 million.  Contrary to their promises,     the defendants did not invest the victims  funds, but instead     misappropriated the funds for their own personal benefit, including     donations to religious organizations, purchases of luxury automobiles and     gifts to family members.                               ======END OF PAGE 1======\x0c"

KS RESOURCES, et al., Civil Action     No. 95-8608 WDK (AJWx)(C.D. Cal.).          The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on March 5,     1998, the Honorable William D. Keller, United States District Judge for the     Central District of California, entered a judgment requiring Lazar     Frederick & Company to pay $7,935,990.32 in disgorgement.  The Court also     ordered Betty Ann Rubin, Lazars President, to pay $346,410.92 in     disgorgement.  Previously Rubin and Lazar, without admitting or denying the     Commissions allegations, had consented to a permanent injunction from     future sales of fraudulent and unregistered securities.           The Commissions complaint, filed December 19, 1995, alleged that     Lazar, Rubin, and other defendants fraudulently offered securities in the     form of 29 oil and gas limited partnerships from May 1993 to December 19,     1995.  The complaint alleged that Rubin, Lazar, and other defendants were     participants in a Ponzi-like scheme that paid investor returns with other     investors money.  The complaint further alleged that Lazar sales agents     misrepresented that the partnerships had paid investors between 10% to 12%     annually from partnership oil and gas revenue.  This Ponzi-like scheme     raised approximately $34,934,000 from investors, many of whom are elderly.      The complaint further alleged that Rubin, Lazar, and other defendants     violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and     Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5     thereunder.

LEVY, OPTIMUM FUND, AGIRA TRADING, CUSTOMER SAFETY,     S.L., CAMBIARES, S.L., CONSTRUCCIONES SOLARIEGAS, S.L., THOMAS A. HANTGES,     COSIMO TACOPINO ET AL.  98 Civil Action No. 1818  (S.D.N.Y.)     The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it has filed an     emergency lawsuit in federal district court to halt the unregistered and     fraudulent sale and manipulation of the stock of Electro-Optical Systems     Corporation ( EOSC )  by Thomas Cavanagh, U.S. Milestone, George Chachas,     William N. Levy and the other defendants.   On the Commission s application     the Court has ordered the defendants to immediately cease their fraudulent     activities.  In addition, the Court has frozen the defendants  assets     pending further litigation.   The Commission also announced that it has     temporarily suspended trading in the securities of EOSC for a ten day     period because of questions regarding the accuracy of statements, and     material omissions, concerning the company.     The Commission told the Court that the defendants had been conducting a     fraudulent scheme to create a controlled market for the stock of EOSC in     order to artificially inflate the price of the stock which they sold to     unsuspecting investors, including numerous small investors purchasing over     the Internet.  The complaint alleges that defendants and relief defendants     have thus far made at least $5 million on sales of EOSC stock, and the     fraud continues.     According to the complaint, the defendants illegally sold unregistered,     restricted shares of EOSC, purchased small quantities of EOSC stock at far     above the market price in order to inflate that price, and issued a     material false statement about EOSC s only potential product, a fingerprint     device.  As a result of defendants  actions, the complaint alleges, the     price of EOSC stock rose more than 1000% in one day (from about $.25 or     $.50 to over $5.00 per share), a price which defendants have maintained for     several months through control of the supply of the stock and issuance of     false and misleading information about the company and its potential     product.     The Commission suspended over-the-counter trading of the securities of EOSC     from 1:30 p.m. EST, March 13, 1998 until 11:59 p.m. EST, on March 26, 1998.      The Commission suspended trading because of questions regarding the     accuracy of statements, and material omissions, concerning, among other     things (1) the viability of EOSC s product, a fingerprint device, (2)     customer interest in purchasing EOSC s product, and (3) the trading and     true value of the common stock of EOSC.     Based on allegations in its complaint, the Court entered a temporary     restraining order prohibiting the defendants from violating Section 10(b)     of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\x0c     Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.

Capital Acquisitions, Inc., The     Somerset Group, Inc., Wayne Notwell and Clealon Mann Civil Action No.     2:97CV-0977S (USDC UT.)           On March 12, 1998, Judge David Sam, Chief United States Judge for the     District of Utah, signed an order appointing a Special Agent for Capital     Acquisitions, Inc. (Capital).  The Special Agent, Robert G. Wing of the     Salt Lake City law firm of Prince, Yeates and Geldzahler, is charged with     performing a full accounting of the assets of the company which the     Securities and Exchange Commission sued for operating a Ponzi scheme that     raised nearly $24 million in violation of the federal securities laws.           The Commission filed the action against Capital and three others on     December 19, 1997, and the court granted the Commission\s motions for entry     of a temporary restraining order, an order freezing the assets of the all     defendants, and later a preliminary injunction.  Named as defendants, in     addition to Capital and its president Wayne Notwell, are The Somerset     Group, Inc. (Somerset) and its president Clealon Mann (Mann).              Capital began raising funds from investors in 1996 in order to conduct     oil and gas drilling operations in Kansas and California.  Capital has     raised nearly $24 million from at least 600 investors in several states     through sales of three-year notes offering an annual guaranteed return of     20%.  Investors were solicited through a network of sales agents directed     by Mann and Somerset.            The Commission alleges in its complaint that the defendants conducted     a Ponzi scheme in which the source of interest payments to current     investors was new investor funds received from the ongoing sale of     Capital\s notes.  While Capital claimed to be operating more than 225 oil     wells in Kansas and California, it failed to disclose that the income from     the wells is insufficient to pay investors their returns.  Instead, the     defendants paid interest wholly from new investor proceeds, as Capital has     not generated sufficient cash flow from its operations to pay interest.          The Commission also alleges that the offering materials used in the     sales of Capital\s notes failed to disclose material information.  For     example, the materials failed to disclose that sales agents were receiving     excessive commissions, totaling approximately 46% of each dollar invested     in the notes.  In addition, the offering materials failed to disclose that     Capital withheld 20% of the proceeds for payment to New England     International Surety, Inc., a Panamanian company which is the purported     guarantor on the notes.  Further, the materials failed to disclose that     Capital, the issuer of the notes, had no control over the funds being     raised by sales agents.  Instead, all investor funds were pooled in a     single account controlled by Mann from which he disbursed monthly interest     payments to investors, commission payments to sales agents and expenses     associated with Capital\s business operations.  Finally, the materials fail                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\x0c     to disclose that Capital, Mann and Somerset were ordered to cease and     desist the solicitation of investors for oil and gas investments in the     state of Kansas and other states.          The March 12, 1998 order signed by Judge Sam also authorizes the     Special Agent to attend Capital\s board meetings, have full access to     Capital\s books and records, and to evaluate Capital\s oil and gas holdings     and supervise the expenditure of funds by Capital and other related     companies.                           ======END OF PAGE 2======                              ======END OF PAGE 2======\x0c"

Illinois No. 96 C 6353)          The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) announced that on     March 4, 1998, the United States District Court for the Northern District     of Illinois entered a Final Judgment and Order of Permanent Injunction     Against James D. Rocco (Rocco), enjoining him from future violations of the     registration and antifraud provisions of the securities laws contained in     Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b), 15(a)     and 15(c)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and     15c1-2 thereunder.  The Order also requires Rocco to pay disgorgement in     the amount of $77,683, but provides, however, that payment of the     disgorgement is waived based on Rocco s demonstrated inability to pay.      Rocco consented to the entry of the Order without admitting or denying the     allegations contained in the Commission s Complaint.          The Complaint alleged that between 1983 and August 1992, Rocco and     others offered and sold approximately $26.6 million of unregistered     securities, in three types of purported investments:  1) high yielding     certificates of deposits (CD s); 2) interests in a real estate investment     fund; and 3) interest in a stock investment fund.  According to the     Complaint, purchasers of the CD s were told that they were investing in     nine month or thirty-six month jumbo CD s in which other investors also had     interests and that the CD s were insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance     Corporation.  The complaint further alleged that investors in the real     estate investment fund were told they were investing in prime residential     income producing properties, and that investors in the stock investment     fund were told they were investing in blue chip stocks.  Rocco and others     failed to disclose to investors, among other things, that investor funds     would be used for personal and business expenses unrelated to the purported     investments.          The Commission also entered an Order Instituting Public Administrative     Proceedings, Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions against Rocco     on March 13, 1998.  Rocco consented to the issuance of the Order without     admitting or denying the Commission s findings.  The Order bars Rocco from     association with any broker, dealer, investment company, investment adviser     or municipal securities dealer.                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\x0c"

The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on          March 16, 1998, a temporary restraining order was entered by the          United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia          against International Heritage Incorporated, a Nevada corporation          (Heritage Incorporated), formerly known as Kara International          Inc.

Savage (Savage), a founder and director          of IHI and a director of Heritage Incorporated;  and Larry W.          Smith (Smith), a founder and director of IHI and a director of          Heritage Incorporated. In addition, the Court appointed a          receiver for IHI.               The Commission\s complaint, filed on March 16, alleges          violations of the anti-fraud and registration provisions of the          federal securities laws.  The complaint also alleges that          Heritage Incorporated violated the reporting provisions by filing          a misleading Form 8-K with the Commission.  The Commission is          seeking permanent injunctions for violations of Sections 5(a),          5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the          Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, disgorgement of ill-          gotten gains with prejudgment interest and  civil penalties          against each defendant.               The Commission\s complaint alleges that, beginning in April          1995, IHI through Van Etten, Savage, Smith and others, has been          soliciting individuals throughout the United States to invest in          a pyramid scheme.  IHI raised more than $150 million from over          155,000 investors.  The complaint alleges that  interests in the          program, which are described by IHI as business centers, are          securities.  In addition to selling interests in the pyramid          scheme, between July 17, 1997 and November 1, 1997, the          defendants sold $5 million in notes convertible into shares of          IHI common stock.  The defendants knowingly misrepresented IHI\s          financial condition to investors and concealed the fact that IHI          was operating a pyramid scheme.               Finally, on March 6, 1998, IHI consummated a reverse merger          with Heritage Incorporated (formerly Kara), a publicly traded          shell company.  The complaint alleges that Heritage Incorporated          then filed a Form 8-K with the Commission which was misleading          and concealed the fact that IHI was operating a pyramid scheme.          On March 13, 1998, the Commission suspended trading in Heritage          Inc. stock               A hearing on the Commission\s motion for preliminary          injunction is scheduled for March 24, 1998."

September 10, 1996).          The Commission and the United States Attorney\s Office for the     District of Connecticut announced that, on March 12, Edmund M. Autuori     (Autuori), a CPA and former partner of Arthur Andersen & Co., was     convicted by a federal jury on 16 fraud-related counts arising from his     work for Colonial Realty Company (Colonial), a former real estate     syndicator.  The jury found that Autuori knowingly assisted Colonial\s     principals in marketing investments, including the offering of 1200 limited     partnership units in the Colonial Constitution Limited Partnership     (CCLP).  While engaged in these marketing efforts, Autuori knew that the     investments offered by Colonial could not realize the promised returns.      Autuori will be sentenced on May 28.  Each of the counts carries a maximum     penalty of five years and a $250,000 fine.          On March 9, 1995, the Commission filed a complaint against Autuori,     Jonathan N. Googel, Benjamin J. Sisti, William Candelori, Kevin P. Sisti,     Peter J. Curley and Kenneth A. Zak (the Defendants), alleging violations     of several antifraud and securities registration provisions of the federal     securities laws in connection with Colonial\s offering of CCLP units.      During the offering period, CCLP interests totaling more than $30 million     were purchased by over 700 investors residing in 28 states and the District     of Columbia.  Autuori is the sole remaining defendant in the Commission\s     civil action, which was stayed pending resolution of the criminal trial.          Colonial, located in West Hartford, Connecticut, was a syndicator of     real estate limited partnerships.  According to the complaint, Colonial     salespeople, with the knowledge, approval and/or participation of the     Defendants, solicited investors with numerous false and misleading     statements, and utilized high-pressure sales tactics, to encourage them to     invest.  The Defendants knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that     Colonial\s offering materials contained material misstatements and     omissions regarding the revenues, operations, financial reserves, rental     income, and cash flow of Constitution Plaza, the asset underlying CCLP.      Although the CCLP offering purportedly was a private placement to     accredited investors, Colonial sold limited partnership units to far more     than the 35 nonaccredited investors permitted by Commission regulations.          The complaint also alleged that, with the knowledge, approval and/or     participation of various Defendants:  Colonial concealed its financial     problems from investors as the CCLP offering progressed; Googel, B. Sisti     and Candelori signed false certifications in connection with the sale of     investor notes to financial institutions; and Colonial failed to disclose     that distributions to investors in its partnerships were funded frequently     by loans from other Colonial partnerships.  According to the Complaint,     Autuori participated in sales seminars and other meetings with prospective     investors, assuring them that Constitution Plaza would generate the     revenues projected in CCLP\s offering memorandum, and assisted in the     preparation of materially misleading sales literature.  In September 1990,\x0c     shortly after the CCLP offering was suspended, Colonial was forced into     bankruptcy and CCLP limited partners subsequently lost their entire     investment.

(KMW)           The Commission filed a Complaint today in the United States District     Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that, between January     1996 and December 1997, a radio talk show host promoted stocks of various     public companies on his radio show without disclosing that he was being     paid by the companies to do so, in violation of Section 17(b) of the     Securities Act of 1933.

15675,1998,,"b              United  States Securities and Exchange Commission         Litigation Release No. 15675  / March 19, 1998         SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION v. CITY SERVICES CORP.,         et al., 98 Civ. 1867 (RPP), U.S.D.C., S.D.N.Y.         NEW YORK -- The Securities and Exchange Commission         (Commission) announced that, on March 16, 1998, the United         States District Court for the Southern District of New York         issued a temporary restraining order against City Services         Corp. (City Services) and Joseph Burgio (Burgio).  The         order freezes the defendants assets, temporarily restrains         the defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of         the securities laws, and temporarily restrains Burgio from         violating antifraud provisions applicable to broker-dealers         and from violating the broker-dealer registration         provisions.  The Order arises from a Complaint filed on         March 16, 1998, in which the Commission alleges that City         Services and Burgio fraudulently offered and sold City         Services stock and that Burgio also was acting as an         unregistered broker-dealer.              The defendants are described in the Complaint as         follows:              JOSEPH BURGIO, age 29, is a resident of Brooklyn, New              York.  He has held himself out to be the president,              corporate secretary, and chairman of City Services\              board of directors. .  Between January and March 1,              1998, Burgio was associated as a registered              representative with Three Arrows Capital Corp. (Three              Arrows), a registered broker-dealer that employed              Burgio in an office located in New York, New York.              Burgio was not separately registered with the              Commission.              CITY SERVICES CORP. is a Delaware corporation.              According to a private placement memorandum for the              City Services stock offering it purports to have              offices at 29 John Street, New York City.  That              location is a mail drop only.  Since its inception in              May 1997, City Services has not generated any revenue              or engaged in any operations.  City Services stock is              not publicly traded.              The Complaint alleges as follows:              Since early January 1998, City Services and Burgio have              fraudulently offered and sold City Services stock and              have raised at least $350,000 from at least 33              investors nationwide.              City Services, Burgio and others working with them made              telephonic cold calls, and offered and sold the City              Services stock to investors by means of a variety of              false and misleading representations, including false              claims that: (a) City Services would hold an initial              public offering in the near future that would enable              investors to more than double their money; (b) City              Services was in the check cashing business; and (c) the              funds raised in the offering would be held in escrow              until the offering closed.  While soliciting investors,              Burgio held himself out to be a registered              representative of Three Arrows.  Burgio failed to              disclose to at least some of the investors that he was              also an officer of City Services.              Burgio continued to solicit investors to purchase City              Services after his association with Three Arrows              terminated.  During the period he was associated with              Three Arrows, he solicited investors without the              authorization of Three Arrows.              In its Complaint, the Commission seeks from both              defendants an accounting and disgorgement of their              unjust enrichment plus prejudgment interest, as well as              civil penalties from Burgio.  The Commission also seeks              preliminary and permanent injunctive relief against (1)              both defendants from violating the antifraud provisions              of the securities laws, Sections 17(a) of the              Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the              Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and              Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and (2) against Burgio from              violating the broker-dealer antifraud provisions,              Section 15(c)(1) of the Exchange Act and Rules 15c1-2              and 15c1-5 thereunder, and from violating the broker-              dealer registration provisions, Section 15(a)(1) of the              Exchange Act.              The litigation is pending."

Wyatt and David L.     Holewinski, Civil Action No. 96-5399 TJH (Mcx) (C.D. Cal.)          The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on March 12,     1998, the Honorable Terry J. Hatter, Jr., United States District Judge for     the Central District of California, entered a Final Consent Judgment of     Permanent Injunction, Disgorgement, and Civil Penalty against David L.     Holewinski of Yardley, PA for insider trading in the securities of Chantal     Pharmaceutical Corporation, a Los Angeles based company.  According to the     Commissions Complaint, filed on August 5, 1996, Holewinski sold all of his     and his wifes Chantal stock prior to a public announcement by Chantal, on     February 25, 1993, that The Upjohn Company had terminated a licensing     agreement with Chantal because tests showed that Chantals Cyoctol compound     was not an effective anti-acne drug.  The Complaint further alleged that     Chantals joint venture with Upjohn was its sole source of income at the     time.            The Complaint also alleged that between mid-January 1993 and February     25, 1993, Roger D. Wyatt of Houston, while acting as a consultant to     Chantal, became aware of confidential information concerning Upjohns     testing of Cyoctol and conveyed this information to Holewinski, an     individual with whom Wyatt maintained a close, personal and business     relationship.  Holewinski, in turn, directed his broker to sell all of his     and his wifes Chantal shares immediately following a telephone     conversation with Wyatt on February 25, 1993.  Holewinskis trades occurred     just before the public announcement by Chantal.           Holewinski, without admitting or denying the allegations in the     Complaint, consented to a Judgment that permanently enjoined him from     future violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities     laws (specifically, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section     10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated     thereunder), and ordered him to disgorge losses avoided in the amount of     $28,162, plus prejudgment interest in the amount of $4,921.41.  The Consent     Judgement also ordered Holewinski to pay a civil penalty in the amount of     $28,162.  On November 24, 1997, a judgment in the amount of $209,205.21 was     entered against Wyatt as a result of his own insider trading in Chantal     stock and his role in tipping Holewinski.

SIMMONS, Civil Action No.     98-0869 (GK)(D.D.C.)     UNITED STATES v. RAYMOND SIMMONS, CR-S-98-100 (D.Nev.)          The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) today filed a     Complaint against Raymond F. Simmons (Simmons), a\\k\\a David Simmons, in     the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.  The     Complaint alleges that Simmons participated in a fraudulent scheme to     falsify the financial statements of Combined Companies International Corp.     ( CCIC ), formerly a publicly traded microcap company located in Las Vegas,     Nevada.  The Complaint seeks orders permanently enjoining Simmons from     violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b)     and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and     13b2-1 thereunder, requiring him to file an accounting of compensation     received from his illegal activities, requiring Simmons to disgorge his     illegal gains together with prejudgment interest, and requiring him to pay     a civil penalty.          Specifically, according to the Complaint:          Simmons provided a fraudulent  asset enhancement  service for CCIC             between 1993 and 1996.  As part of this service, Simmons prepared a             series of false documents claiming that he was an agent of an             offshore financial institution that maintained custody of millions             of dollars of cash for CCIC.          Simmons furnished those false documents to CCIC, and that the             fictitious cash asset was included in the company s financial             statements.  According to the Complaint, CCIC s materially false             financial statements, including the fictitious asset, were filed             with the SEC as part of a Form 10A registration, three annual             reports on Form 10-K, and seven quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.          In order to further the illusion that the bogus assets were genuine,             Simmons confirmed the existence of the fictitious asset by posing             as an offshore banker in conversations with CCIC s accountant.          For his role in this fraudulent scheme, Simmons received cash and CCIC             securities.          On March 18, 1998, Simmons was indicted in the District of Nevada on     one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, two counts of wire     fraud, one count of money laundering, and one count of making false                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\x0c     statements.  Simmons  indictment was in connection with the same misconduct     as alleged by the Commission.          The Commission previously has taken action with respect to Combined     Companies International Corp.  On May 19, 1997, the Commission issued an     Order suspending trading in CCIC securities for ten days.  See Securities     Exchange Act Rel. No. 38653 (May 19, 1997).  On August 13, 1997, the     Commission revoked the registration of CCIC pursuant to Section 12(j) of     the Exchange Act.  See Securities Exchange Act Rel. No. 38931 (August 13,     1997), and Securities Exchange Act Rel. No. 38691 (May 29, 1997).  The     Commission also has brought enforcement actions against other persons with     respect to their illegal conduct concerning CCIC.  See SEC v. Barclay     Davis, et al., Lit. Rel. No. 15600 (December 22, 1997), and SEC v. Merle     Finkel, Lit. Rel. No. 15286 (March 12, 1997).          The Commission is cooperating with separate investigations in this     matter carried on by the United States Attorney\s Offices for the District     of Nevada and the Eastern District of Virginia, and the Criminal     Investigation Division of the Internal Revenue Service.

March 19, 1998).          The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced the filing of a     civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Eastern     District of Pennsylvania against Benjamin Goldfield and Joseph Valentine,     alleging that they engaged in insider trading in the common stock of     Escalade, Inc.  The Commission s Complaint alleges that, on August 6 and 9,     1996, the defendants purchased Escalade common stock after     misapppropriating information from a business client concerning a planned     self-tender offer by Escalade.  In addition, the Complaint alleges that     Goldfield encouraged the purchase of Escalade common stock by his parents,     who are not named as defendants.  In all, Goldfield, Valentine and     Goldfield s parents purchased 3,000 shares of Escalade common stock prior     to the public announcement of the tender offer.  When the share price of     Escalade common stock rose by 38% on the trading day following the     announcement of the tender offer, August 13, 1996, Goldfield, Valentine and     Goldfield s parents earned actual and imputed profits of $9,000.          Simultaneous with the filing of the Complaint on March 19, 1998,     Goldfield and Valentine each consented, without admitting or denying the     allegations in the Complaint, to the entry of a Final Judgment permanently     enjoining each of them from future violations of  Section 10(b) of the     Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering that Goldfield pay a     one-time civil penalty of $6,500 and that Valentine pay a one-time civil     penalty of $2,500.  Both defendants had disgorged the profits from their     illicit trades prior to the filing of the Commission s action.          The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Office of the     Comptroller of the Currency in this matter.                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\x0c"

JAMIE CHARLES SPANGLER and ROBERT     ALBERT MERRIFIELD, 95 CIV 814-A (W.D.N.Y.)          The Securities Exchange Commission (Commission) announced that, on     March 17, 1998, Judge Richard J. Arcara, of the U.S. District Court for the     Western District of New York, entered a Final Judgment of Permanent     Injunctive and Other Relief By Consent Against Defendant Jamie Charles     Spangler (Final Judgment).  The Final Judgment, to which Defendant Jamie     Charles Spangler (Spangler) consented without admitting or denying the     allegations of the Complaint, permanently enjoins Spangler from committing     future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and     Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5     thereunder.  The Judgment did not impose civil penalties based on     Spangler\s demonstrated inability to pay.           The Commission\s Complaint, filed on September 20, 1995, alleged that,     between February 1991 and June 1992, Spangler and Robert Albert Merrifield     (Merrifield) fraudulently solicited nearly $500,000 from twenty-four     unsophisticated investors, almost all of whom were elderly retirees     residing in the Buffalo, New York area (injunctive action).  The     Complaint alleged that, in connection with the offer and sale of securities     of First Legal and Financial Services, Ltd. and Fedelta gli Immobili la     Compagniad\ Inc., Spangler made material misrepresentations and omitted to     state material facts about the use to which investor funds would be put,     the risks of investment, the diversion of funds for personal use, the     return on investment, the persons who owned and controlled the companies,     and the companies\ financial condition.          On November 12, 1993, Spangler pled guilty to criminal charges that he     violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.  The charges arose     out of the same conduct that underlay the Commission\s Complaint in the     civil injunctive action.  On January 27, 1994, Spangler was sentenced to 22     months in prison, three years probation and ordered to pay restitution of     $227,686 to eleven of the investors he defrauded.  USA v. Jamie Spangler,     93-CR-195-A.

In        addition, the Commission filed a civil action seeking permanent        injunctions and civil penalties in the United States District Court        for the District of Columbia against the following three former        senior officers of Sensormatic:  Ronald G. Assaf, formerly        Sensormatic\s President and Chief Executive Officer and currently the        Chairman of its Board of Directors; Michael E. Pardue, formerly        Sensormatic\s Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer and        Executive Vice President and a member of its Board of Directors; and        Lawrence J. Simmons, Sensormatic\s former Vice President of Finance.        Finally, the Commission instituted and simultaneously settled        administrative proceedings against Joy Lynn Schneider Green,        Sensormatic\s former Controller of U.S. Operations, and Thomas H.        Pike, Sensormatic\s former Director of Management Information        Systems.              SENSORMATIC SETTLES CHARGES OF SECURITIES LAW VIOLATIONS                  IN CONNECTION WITH SCHEME TO MANIPULATE EARNINGS             In the first of three separate administrative Orders issued        today, the Commission found that Sensormatic violated the antifraud,        reporting, internal controls, and books and records provisions of the        federal securities laws in connection with its manipulation of its        quarterly revenue and earnings in order to reach its earnings goals        and thereby meet analysts\ quarterly earnings projections.        Simultaneous with the institution of the administrative proceedings,        and without admitting or denying the findings contained in the        Commission\s Order, Sensormatic consented to the issuance of a cease-        and-desist order.             The Commission Order finds, among other things, that from at        least the start of its 1994 fiscal year through July 10, 1995,        Sensormatic manipulated its quarterly revenue and earnings in order        to reach its budgeted earnings goals and thereby meet analysts\        quarterly earnings projections.  During the relevant period,        Sensormatic consistently met, within one cent, the analysts\        forecasts of quarterly earnings per share, even for the third        quarters which were Sensormatic\s seasonally weaker quarter.             Sensormatic carried out this fraudulent scheme by improperly        recognizing revenue through several different practices. The conduct,        which occurred over a number of years and involved employees        throughout the organization, primarily involved recognizing and        recording revenue in one quarter from product shipped in the next        quarter.  At the end of each quarter Sensormatic turned back its        computer clock that recorded and dated shipments so that out-of-        period shipments, and consequently revenue, would be recorded in the        prior quarter.  According to the Order, revenue also was recognized        through the following improper practices:  recognizing revenue in one        quarter, when products were shipped to warehouses leased by        Sensormatic, instead of in the next quarter, when the products were        shipped to the customers; slow shipments, whereby revenue was        recognized on shipments which were made during the last days of a        quarter but which were not scheduled to arrive at the customers\        location until well into the next quarter; and recognizing revenue on        goods at the time that they were shipped to customers even though the        customers\ contracts with Sensormatic contained an FOB destination        provision.  The amount of out-of-period revenue that Sensormatic        recognized in quarters ranged from $4.6 million to $30.2 million.             The Order also finds that, as a result of the fraudulent scheme,        Sensormatic filed materially false and misleading periodic reports as        well as registration statements for the sale of securities that        incorporated these periodic reports by reference.  The reports were        false and misleading because they misstated Sensormatic\s quarterly        results of operations, including revenue and net income.  They also        falsely stated that the company recognized revenue upon shipment,        when, in fact, it intentionally and prematurely recognized revenue        for shipments made in the succeeding period or periods, and did not        comply with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) or the        company\s stated revenue recognition policy.  In addition,        Sensormatic issued a press release that overstated its preliminary        estimates of earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 1995 by        over 40%, and for the year by over 18%.  During the relevant period,        Sensormatic\s misstatements of its quarterly net income ranged from        an understatement of about $1.9 million (9.1%) in the second quarter        of fiscal year 1994 to an overstatement of about $5.2 million (40.5%)        in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 1995.             The Order ultimately finds that, based on the foregoing,        Sensormatic violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933        (Securities Act), Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and        13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act),        and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13.  In light of        these findings, the Commission orders Sensormatic to cease and desist        from committing or causing any violation, and future violation, of        these provisions.                 COMPLAINT FILED AGAINST FORMER SENSORMATIC OFFICERS             The Commission\s Complaint filed in District Court alleges that        from at least July 1, 1993, through mid-1995, Pardue and Simmons        participated in a fraudulent scheme to manipulate Sensormatic\s        quarterly revenue and earnings by improperly recognizing revenue        through several different practices.  The Complaint also alleges that        Assaf knew that in every quarter Sensormatic recognized revenue        improperly on goods shipped after the end of the quarter, but he did        not take any steps to stop the improper accounting practices.  The        Complaint alleges that, under Pardue\s and Simmons\ supervision,        Sensormatic employees backdated computer-generated documents        reflecting shipments to make it appear that the shipping had occurred        in the prior quarter.  According to the Complaint, revenue also was        recognized improperly on warehouse shipments, slow shipments and on a        contract containing an FOB destination provision.  It is alleged that        Pardue and Simmons carried out the improper recognition of revenue        for the purpose of manipulating Sensormatic\s earnings to meet its        budgeted earnings goals and thereby meet analysts\ quarterly earnings        projections.  According to the Complaint, during the same period,        Assaf understood that by recognizing revenue improperly, the company        would meet its earning goals and thereby meet analysts\ quarterly        earning projections.             The Complaint further alleges that, as a result of Pardue\s and        Simmons\ conduct, Sensormatic filed with the Commission and        disseminated to the public materially false and misleading reports,        including registration statements and periodic reports, that        misstated quarterly financial results and falsely stated that the        company recognized revenue upon shipment.  According to the        Complaint, Assaf signed annual reports and permitted quarterly        reports  to be filed with the Commission, and he knew or was        generally aware that these reports were false and misleading because,        among other things, they misstated Sensormatic\s quarterly earnings        by including improperly recognized revenue.  As a result, according        to the Complaint, investors could not rely on the quarterly financial        information reported by the company.             The Complaint also alleges that to conceal the improper        recognition of revenue from Sensormatic\s independent auditors and        shareholders, defendants Simmons and Pardue caused Sensormatic\s        accounting records to be falsified, made false statements to the        independent auditors, and intentionally circumvented  the company\s        internal accounting controls.  According to the Complaint, by        allowing the company\s improper recognition of revenue, Assaf also        caused Sensormatic\s accounting records to be falsified.             The Commission alleges that by engaging in such conduct, Pardue        and Simmons each violated provisions of the federal securities laws        that prohibit fraud, falsifying accounting records, and making        misrepresentations to auditors; and Assaf aided and abetted        Sensormatic\s reporting violations and caused the falsification of        accounting records.  Specifically, Pardue and Simmons each violated        Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of        the Exchange Act, and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2,        and Assaf aided and abetted violations of Section 13(a) of the        Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 and        violated Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1.                     Simultaneous with the filing of the Commission\s Complaint,        Assaf, Pardue and Simmons, without admitting or denying the        allegations of the Complaint, each consented to the entry of Final        Judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the relevant        provisions of the federal securities   laws and ordering Assaf,        Pardue and Simmons to pay civil money penalties of $50,000, $40,000        and $50,000, respectively.  As part of his settlement, Simmons also        agreed to settle administrative proceedings pursuant to Rule 102(e)        of the Commission\s Rules of Practice, to be instituted after entry        of the injunction, which will deny him the privilege of appearing or        practicing before the Commission as an accountant, with the right to        apply to resume appearing or practicing after five years.                                  OTHER PROCEEDINGS             The Commission also instituted and simultaneously settled        proceedings pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act and Rule        102(e) of the Commission\s Rules of Practice against Joy Lynn        Schneider Green (Schneider), Sensormatic\s Controller of U.S.        Operations during the relevant period of time.  Without admitting or        denying the findings contained in the Order, Schneider consented to        the issuance of the Order which finds, among other things, that she        was aware that shipping documents had been backdated and that revenue        was improperly and prematurely recorded based on the documents.  The        Order also finds that Schneider knew that Sensormatic prepared its        financial statements using the improperly recorded revenue and that        she knew or should have known that, due to the improper recognition        of revenue, the financial statements were not in conformity with GAAP        and misstated Sensormatic\s earnings.  The Order further finds that        Schneider permitted this conduct to continue and failed to report it        to the Audit Committee of Sensormatic\s Board of Directors or the        independent auditors.  In addition, Schneider knew that documents had        been withheld from the independent auditors during the fiscal year        1994 audit, but did not report this to auditors.  Finally, during the        fiscal year 1995 audit, Schneider hid in her desk a document        containing information requested by the auditors and discussed it        with her superior, but did not reveal its contents to auditors.             Based on the foregoing, the Commission Order finds that        Schneider:  willfully violated Exchange Act Rules 13b2-1 and 13b2-2;        caused Sensormatic\s violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act        and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder; caused and willfully        aided and abetted Sensormatic\s violations of Section 13(b)(2)(A) and        13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act; and engaged in improper professional        conduct.  In view of the foregoing, the Commission is ordering        Schneider to cease and desist from committing or causing any        violation, and any future violation, of the above listed provisions        of the federal securities laws and denies her the privilege of        appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant, with        the right to apply for reinstatement after three years.             In the final administrative proceedings instituted today, the        Commission issued a cease-and-desist order, by consent, against        Thomas H. Pike, Sensormatic\s former Director of Management        Information Systems, pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act        based upon his conduct that allegedly violated Exchange Act Rule        13b2-1 and caused Sensormatic\s violations of Sections 13(a),        13(b)(2(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-        1 and 13a-13 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the findings        contained therein, Pike consented to the issuance of the Order that        finds, among other things, that Pike caused the falsification of        accounting records and Sensormatic\s reporting violations by        supervising employees who reset the computer clock in order to        falsify dates on shipping records and prematurely recognize revenue."
15681,1998,,"b                          SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION                                   Washington, D.C.          Litigation Release No. 15681 / March 25, 1998          SEC  v.  Brennan,  Adv.  Pro.  No. 97-3612 (KCF), In re Robert E.          Brennan, Case No. 95-35502(KCF) (U.S. Bankr. Ct. D.N.J.)          The Securities and Exchange Commission  announced  today  that on          March  24, 1998, The Honorable Kathryn C. Ferguson, United States          Bankruptcy  Judge  for  the  District  of New Jersey, granted its          motion for summary judgment against Robert  E.  Brennan  and held          that  the  Commissions  $75  million  securities  fraud judgment          cannot  be  discharged in Brennans bankruptcy.  The Court  ruled          that, as the  principal of First Jersey Securities, Inc., Brennan          owed a fiduciary  duty  to  First  Jerseys  customers,  which he          willfully  violated  by  presiding  over  a  fraudulent scheme to          extract  massive  overcharges  from them.  Therefore,  the  Court          agreed with the Commission that  its  judgment  was excepted from          discharge  in bankruptcy under the exception for debts  resulting          from a defalcation  by  a fiduciary.  Because of this ruling, the          Court deemed it unnecessary  to rule on the other ground asserted          by the Commission to except its  judgment  from discharge -- that          the judgment is a debt for money obtained by fraud, but indicated          that  she  would  rule  on  this  issue  if Brennan  successfully          appealed her ruling on the fiduciary defalcation claim.          The  Court  also  denied  Brennans  cross-motion   for   summary          judgment, which had contended that the Commission lacked standing          even  to  bring  an  action to except its judgment from discharge          because the Commission was not the party to whom the disgorgement          was to be paid.  The Court  rejected this argument as contrary to          the language of the Bankruptcy  Code  as  well  as  to the public          policy  goals  served  by Commission actions for disgorgement  to          enforce the federal securities laws and protect public investors.          Brennan filed bankruptcy in August 1995, in response to the entry          of judgment against him  by  the United States District Court for          the Southern District of New York,  which  found  him  liable for          orchestrating   a   massive  and  continuing  fraud  against  the          customers of First Jersey  Securities,  and  held him jointly and          severally liable with First Jersey for disgorgement of $75 million.          In December 1996, the Second Circuit Court of  Appeals upheld the          disgorgement  judgment,  and in October 1997, the  Supreme  Court          denied Brennans petition  for  certiorari.   In  June  1997, the          Bankruptcy Court, on the Commissions motion, ousted Brennan from          his status as debtor-in-possession and ordered the appointment of          a  Chapter  11  trustee,  finding  such  action to be in the best          interests  of  the  creditors  of his estate.    The  Trustee  is          charged with liquidating claims  and assets, managing the various          Brennan   interests,   and  investigating   possibly   fraudulent          transfers.

15682,1998,,"b   LITIGATION RELEASE NO. 15682 / March 25, 1998   SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION v. DONALD C. FURGUSON, RENEE   FERGUSON, DAVID L. FRIED, ALBERT l. FRIED, AND MATTHEW C. PERRY, Civil   Action No. 96-1099-DRD (D. N.J.)   The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) announced that,   on March 10, 1998, Final Orders of Permanent Injunction (Final   Judgments) were entered against Albert L. Fried (A. Fried)of   Allenhurst, New Jersey, and Matthew C. Ferry (Ferry) of Hopewell,   New Jersey, by United States District Judge Dickinson R. Debevoise,   District of New Jersey, for insider trading in violation of the   federal securities laws. The Final Judgments permanently enjoin A.   Fried and Ferry from violating the antifraud sections of the federal   securities laws, and ordered A. Fried to disgorge trading profits of   $21,250, plus prejudgment interest of $10,870.76, and to pay a penalty   of $21,250, for a total of $53,370.76, and Ferry to disgorge trading   profits of $1,225, plus prejudgment interest of $626.67, and to pay a   penalty of $1,225, for a total of $3,076.67. A. Fried and Ferry   consented to entry of the Final Judgments without admitting or denying   any of the substantive charges against them.   In its complaint, which was filed on March 12, 1996, the Commission   charged that A. Fried\s son, David L. Fried (D. Fried), A. Fried and   Ferry purchased securities of American Biltrite Inc. (ABL) after   receiving, from D. Fried\s stepfather and mother, material, non-public   information that ABL intended to enter into a joint venture agreement   with Congoleum Corporation (Congoleum). The complaint alleged that,   on November 30, 1992, in connection with his responsibilities as vice-   president of engineering of the Amtico division of ABL, Donald   Ferguson learned that ABL planned to publicly announce the intended   joint venture. D. Fried, A. Fried and Ferry purchased a total of 6,550   shares of ABL stock on December 1 and 2, 1992. ABL made a public   announcement of the intended joint venture on December 3, 1992, which   caused the price of ABL\s stock to increase four points, or   approximately 25%.   Final Judgments of Permanent Injunction were entered on March 13, 1996   against D. Fried\s step-father and mother, Donald and Renee Ferguson,   enjoining them from committing further violations of Section 10(b) of   the Exbhange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and imposing a penalty of   $5,829 against each of them. A Final Judgment of Permanent Injunction   was entered on Augyst 14, 1997 against D. Fried enjoining him from   committing further violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and   Rule 10b-5 thereunder and ordering him to disgorge trading profits of   $5,829, plus prejudgment interest of $2,479.79, and to pay a penalty   of $5,829. for further information, SEE Lit.

JOHN, Civil Action No.          SACV 98-135 AHS (EEx) (C.D. Cal.)          On March 16, 1998, the Honorable Alicemarie H. Stotler, United          States District Judge for the Central District of California,          issued an order of preliminary injunction against defendants          David A. Colvin, Job Kjell Hovik; Intellinet Publishing, Inc.;          Intellinet Holding Group, Inc.; Medical Advantage, Inc.; Lamelli,          Inc. a/k/a Lamelli Medical Technology, Inc.; and Wall Street          Research Company, Inc.  The Court also ordered appointment of a          permanent receiver over the entity Defendants and continued a          previous order freezing these Defendants assets and prohibiting          the destruction of documents. Also, on March 16, 1998, the Court          entered a Final Judgment Of Permanent Injunction And Other Relief          Against Defendant Lamar Ellis.  The judgment, which Defendant          Ellis consented to, without admitting or denying the Commissions          allegations, permanently enjoins him from future violations of          Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of          the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.          On March 2, 1998, the Court had issued an order of preliminary          injunction against Defendant John Larson a/k/a John St. John.          The preliminary injunction orders enjoin the Defendants from          future violations of the registration, antifraud and broker-          dealer registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a)          of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of          Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.          The Commissions Complaint, filed on February 19, 1998, alleges          that the Defendants raised over $5 million since January 1997,          defrauding investors, by among other things, falsely representing          that former U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop and NBC          television journalist Tom Brokaw were affiliated with Defendant          Medical Advantage, Inc., a company which purportedly operated          obesity clinics but which was, in fact, insolvent and which the          Defendants falsely claimed was the subject of an imminent public          stock offering.  The Commission further alleges that investors          were falsely promised the return of their principal investment,          plus 12% interest, in 120 to 180 days.  Instead, Defendants          Colvin and Hovik misappropriated investor funds, using most of          the money for boiler room expenses and for other business          ventures.  Among the other misrepresentations alleged, the          Defendants falsely claimed that Defendants Intellinet and Lamelli          would also be the subject of an imminent public stock offering.

15684,1998,,"b                  UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION          Litigation Release No. 15684 / March 26, 1998          SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION v. CHRISTIAN SCHINDLER, a/k/a          RUDOLPH GERNER a/k/a RUDY GERNER, INTER CAPITAL BROKERAGE,          INC., INTERCAP FOREX BROKERAGE, INC., and INTER-CAPITAL BROKERAGE          U.S.A. INC. 98 Civ.1460 (MP) (S.D.N.Y.)          The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) announced          that it has obtained a preliminary injunction and other relief          against an Austrian national and three of his companies, which          perpetrated, from the United States, a multi-million dollar          affinity fraud targeted primarily at German-speaking Europeans.          The order, issued by the United States District Court for the          Southern District of New York, among other things (1)          preliminarily enjoins the defendants from committing securities          fraud, in violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of          1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934          and Rule 10b-5; (2) continues the previously-ordered freeze of          the defendants\ assets; (3) appoints a permanent receiver over          the defendants; and (4) directs the defendants to repatriate          assets transferred overseas.          The Commission\s Complaint in the action names the following          defendants:          Christian Schindler, a/k/a Rudolph Gerner a/k/a Rudy Gerner          (Schindler), who is 35 years of age, and is last known to have          resided in Miami Beach, Florida.          Inter Capital Brokerage, Inc. (ICB), which falsely holds itself          out as a large brokerage firm with offices throughout the United          States, including New York, New York and Miami, Florida.          Intercap Forex Brokerage, Inc. (ICF),  which is incorporated          under the laws of the Turks and Caicos Islands, British West          Indies, with offices located in Miami, Florida.          Inter-Capital Brokerage U.S.A. Inc. (ICB-USA), which is          incorporated under the laws of Delaware and has offices in Miami,          Florida.          According to the Complaint:Schindler, who is using Gerner as an alias, was convicted in Germany, inor about 1995, of felony criminal fraud in the offer, purchase and sale ofsecurities and commodities to investors, and is permanently enjoined fromviolating the antifraud and other provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act.Since at least October 1996, Schindler, and ICB, ICF, and ICB-USA (theIntercap Companies), three Schindler-controlled entities that are engagedin the solicitation, pooling and investment of customers\ funds in thesecurities, commodities and foreign exchange markets, have fraudulentlyobtained at least $5.8 million from at least forty European investors.Schindler and the Intercap Companies, through false and misleadingrepresentations, induce investors to give them money to make variousinvestments, in or through the Intercap Companies, in, among other things,United States Treasury bonds, which the defendants refer to as T-Bonds,publicly traded stock which defendants refer to as S&P stocks, and stockin one or more of the Intercap Companies.  Schindler and the IntercapCompanies have been misusing the investors\ money by, among other things,transferring investor funds overseas and diverting at least hundreds ofthousands of dollars to the benefit of Schindler and the IntercapCompanies.Among the false and misleading statements that Schindler and the IntercapCompanies made to investors are misrepresentations or omissions about (1)Schindler\s identity, and his criminal and disciplinary history; (2) thereturns investors would obtain on their investments; (3) the safety andliquidity of the investments offered; (4) the types of investmentsdefendants would make with investors\ money; and (5) purported troublesinvolving the SEC.          The court issued the preliminary injunction after holding an          evidentiary hearing on March 23, 1998.  The court heard testimony          about representations that Schindler and others made from the          United States concerning the investments they were offering and          selling.  Although counsel for the Intercap Companies attended          the hearing and opposed the Commission\s application, Schindler          was absent and has failed to appear in the litigation to date.          The court found that there was a likelihood that the Commission          would succeed in proving violations of the antifraud provisions          of the federal securities laws at any ultimate trial on the          merits.          On February 26, 1998, the day the Commission commenced this          action, the court issued an order temporarily restraining          defendants from further violating the antifraud provisions of the          federal securities laws, temporarily freezing defendants\ assets,          and granting other emergency relief pending the determination of          the Commission\s preliminary injunction application.  On March 5,          1998, the court granted the Commission\s application for the          appointment of Andrew E. Tomback to serve as a temporary receiver          over the defendants. Pursuant to the preliminary injunction          order, Mr. Tomback will continue as permanent receiver.  The          Commission\s suit remains pending."

Cal.)          The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) announced          that on March 10, 1998, the Honorable George H. King, United          States District Court Judge for the Central District of          California, entered a Judgment against defendants Charles R.          Rietz (Rietz) of Gilbert, Arizona, Robert R. Parrish          (Parrish) of Gilmer, Texas, Robert J. Struth (Struth) of          Southern California, and R. Stephen Edgel (Edgel) of          Carmichael, California permanently enjoining these four          defendants from selling unregistered securities and selling          securities by fraudulent means.  Also, Parrish, Struth and Edgel          were permanently enjoined from operating as unregistered broker-          dealers.          In addition, the Judgment includes an order that Rietz pay          disgorgement of $212,077; that Parrish pay disgorgement of          $188,311; that Struth pay disgorgement of $149,885; and that          Edgel pay disgorgement of $44,823.  Each defendant was ordered to          pay a civil penalty in the same amount.          The Commission alleged in its Complaint filed in October of 1996          that the defendants were operating a Ponzi scheme involving          investment contracts for the sale and leaseback of automated          teller machines (ATMs).  The defendants offered the ATM          investment program over the Internet to the public and raised          over $3.49 million from at least 132 investors nationwide.  This          was the Commission\s first lawsuit involving ATMs and one of the          largest lawsuits involving Internet investment fraud.          The Complaint alleged that the defendants violated Sections 5(a)          and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the Securities Act),          the registration provisions, and Section 17(a) of the Securities          Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the          Exchange Act), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, the antifraud          provisions.  The Complaint also charged Parrish, Struth and Edgel          with violations of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act, the broker-          dealer registration provision."

The Infinity Group          Company, Geoffrey P. Benson and Geoffrey J. O\Connor, et. al.          United States District Court for the Eastern District of          Pennsylvania, Civil Action No. 97-CV-5458)          On March 16, 1998, the Honorable Stewart Dalzell entered Orders          against Geoffrey P. Benson (Benson), Susan L. Benson (S.          Benson) and Lindsey K. Springer (Lindsey Springer) d/b/a          Bondage Breaker Ministries holding them in contempt of certain          provisions of the Court\s Order for Final Injunction,          Disgorgement and Other Relief (Final Judgment) entered on          February 6, 1998.  Benson, S. Benson and Springer were named as          defendant and relief defendants, respectively, in a civil          injunctive action instituted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange          Commission (Commission) in August 1997.  The Commission          initially sought, and was granted, emergency relief, including a          temporary restraining order and a freeze of assets.          Following a four day trial in February 1998, Judge Dalzell found          that Benson, an entity known as The Infinity Group Company          (TIGC) and Geoffrey O\Connor had violated Sections 5(a), 5(c)          and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the          Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5, thereunder, by fraudulently raising          at least $24.5 million from public investors through a Ponzi          scheme wherein they promoted non-existent Prime Bank          instruments and other dubious investments.  The defendants          falsely claimed that these investments would generate for          investors rates of return ranging from 138 to 181 percent.          Pursuant to the terms of the Final Judgment, the defendants were          permanently enjoined and ordered, jointly and severally, to pay          disgorgement of over $24.5 million.  S. Benson and Springer were          also ordered to pay $1,425,900 and $1,265,000 in disgorgement,          respectively, as the recipients of some of the investor proceeds.          Judge Dalzell also continued the appointment of Robert F.          Sanville as trustee for TIGC and empowered him to take custody of          all remaining assets of TIGC and distribute them to the defrauded          TIGC investors.          Following a hearing on March 16, 1998, Judge Dalzell found that          the Bensons had disobeyed provisions of the Final Judgment by          failing to transfer certain property to the trustee, including a          large parcel of land in Chardon, Ohio, and certain specified          vehicles.  He held them in contempt, and ordered them, among          other things, to vacate the real estate no later than May 1,          1998.  Judge Dalzell also held Springer in contempt and ordered          the United States Marshal for the Eastern District of          Pennsylvania to arrest him and hold him in custody until such          time as he complied with the terms of the Final Judgment.          TIGC, Benson and O\Connor engaged in their fraudulent scheme          during the period from September 1996 through August 1997.  They          raised approximately 26 million from 10,000 investors nationwide          and internationally.  Of the funds raised, only $11.8 million, or          48 percent, was ever used to purchase any type of investment, and          all of these investments were valued as worthless.  The remaining          funds were misappropriated and used to pay other investors or          personal expenses of the defendants and relief defendants.  As a          result of the Commission\s action, over $7 million was frozen,          and a substantial portion was repatriated from off-shore bank          accounts.  Three other entities controlled by Benson, S. Benson          and O\Connor were also named as relief defendants in the          Commission action.\x1a"

CITY SERVICES CORP.,         et al., 98 Civ. 1867 (RPP), U.S.D.C., S.D.N.Y.         NEW YORK -- The Securities and Exchange Commission         (Commission) announced that on March 27, 1998, the United         States District Court for the Southern District of New York         issued a preliminary injunction on consent (Order) against         City Services Corp. (City Services) and Joseph Burgio         (Burgio).   The  Order freezes the defendants\ assets,         preliminarily enjoins the defendants from violating the         antifraud provisions of the securities laws, and         preliminarily enjoins  Burgio from violating antifraud         provisions applicable to broker-dealers and from violating         the broker-dealer registration provisions.  The Order arises         from a Complaint filed on March 16, 1998, in which the         Commission alleges that City Services and Burgio         fraudulently offered and sold City Services stock and that         Burgio also was acting as an unregistered broker-dealer.         The defendants consented to the Order.  The Court issued a         temporary restraining order against the defendants on March         16, 1998.                  The Complaint alleges as follows:              Since early January 1998, City Services and Burgio have              fraudulently offered and sold City Services stock and              have raised at least $350,000 from at least 33              investors nationwide.              City Services, Burgio and others working with them made              telephonic cold calls, and offered and sold the City              Services stock to investors by means of a variety of              false and misleading representations, including false              claims that: (a) City Services would hold an initial              public offering in the near future that would enable              investors to more than double their money; (b) City              Services was in the check cashing business; and (c) the              funds raised in the offering would be held in escrow              until the offering closed.  While soliciting investors,              Burgio held himself out to be a registered              representative of Three Arrows.  Burgio failed to              disclose to at least some of the investors that he was              also an officer of City Services.              Burgio continued to solicit investors to purchase City              Services after his association with Three Arrows              terminated.  During the period he was associated with              Three Arrows, he solicited investors without the              authorization of Three Arrows.              In its Complaint, the Commission seeks from both              defendants an accounting and disgorgement of their              unjust enrichment plus prejudgment interest, as well as              civil penalties from Burgio.  The Commission also seeks              permanent injunctive relief against (1) both defendants              from violating the antifraud provisions of the              securities laws, Sections 17(a) of the Securities Act              of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange              Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder;              and (2) against Burgio from violating the broker-dealer              antifraud provisions, Section 15(c)(1) of the Exchange              Act and Rules 15c1-2 and 15c1-5 thereunder, and from              violating the broker-dealer registration provisions,              Section 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act.              The litigation is pending.\x1a"

NICHI CAPITAL, LTD.,          OLAWANDE A. AGUNLOYE, WISE CHOICE DISCOUNT BROKERAGE, INC., RALPH          ANTEBY, AND BRIAN WALFISH, AND STRATEGIC RISK MANAGEMENT AS          RELIEF DEFENDANT, 98 Civ. 2218 (CJH) (S.D.N.Y)          The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) announced          today that it filed a complaint in federal court in Manhattan          charging a start-up software company, its president, and a          brokerage firm and its employees, with obtaining at least          $200,000 by engaging in an ongoing securities fraud.  Since          October 1997, the defendants have been inducing investments in          the securities of Nichi Capital, Ltd. (Nichi) by misrepresenting          to investors that they were selling Nichi stock in an initial          public offering (IPO).  The court granted the Commission\s          request for emergency relief, including a temporary restraining          order, an asset freeze, and an accounting.          Named in the complaint are:               Nichi Capital, Ltd., a New York corporation.               Wise Choice Discount Brokerage, Inc. (Wise Choice), a New               York corporation, and a broker-dealer registered with the               Commission.               Olawande A. Agunloye (Agunloye), president of Nichi and a               principal of Wise Choice. Agunloye resides in New York.               Ralph Anteby, a resident of Brooklyn, New York, and a broker               at Wise Choice.               Brian Walfish, a resident of Brooklyn, New York, and a               broker at Wise Choice.          Also named in the Complaint as a relief defendant is Strategic          Risk Management, a Delaware corporation and a broker-dealer          registered with the Commission.          Specifically, according to the Complaint, the defendants          misrepresented to investors that the IPO was going to take place          shortly, that their shares would rise greatly in value after the          company went public, that their money would be placed in an          escrow account until the IPO took place, and that the money          raised would be used for certain defined purposes.  Those          statements were false and misleading because, while Nichi had          filed a registration statement for an initial public offering of          its stock, the IPO was not expected to take place in the near          future.  Moreover, no escrow account for the IPO funds was ever          established, and the investors\ money was transferred by          Agunloye, at least in part, to relief defendant Strategic in          connection with his attempt to acquire an equity interest in that          company.          The Commission seeks a final judgment permanently enjoining the          defendants from further violations of Sections 5(a) and 17(a) of          the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities          Exchange Act of 1934, and Rules 10b-5 and 10b-9 promulgated          thereunder; and ordering them to account for and disgorge their          ill-gotten gains and prejudgment interest, and to pay civil          penalties.  The Commission also seeks an order requiring          Strategic to account for and disgorge an amount equal to the          funds it improperly obtained from the defendants.          A hearing on the Commission\s application for a preliminary          injunction and other relief is scheduled for Wednesday, April 8,          1998.\x1a"

Banner  Fund International, Civil Action No. 94-342             (EGS) ( D.D.C.)             The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that             on March 26, 1998, The Honorable Emmet Sullivan, United             States District Judge for the District of Columbia, granted             the Commission\s motion for summary judgment against             defendants Lloyd R.Winburn, Swiss Trade & Commerce Trust             Ltd., and Eddie R. Blackwell.  The Court enjoined the             defendants from violating Sections 5 and 17(a) of the             Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule             10b-5,  and Section 7(d) of the Investment Company Act.             Finding that defendants had knowingly and intentionally             misrepresented the purpose of the investment they had             promoted and the use to which investors\ funds would be put,             the Court ordered defendants to disgorge, jointly and             severally, $6.5 million they had raised through their false             and misleading statements, and to pay $2.69 million in             prejudgment interest.  The Court previously had entered a             default judgment against defendant Banner Fund International             on the same claims.             From late 1992 through 1994, defendants Winburn and             Blackwell, both United States citizens operating first out             of Aruba and later from Belize, offered and sold investments             in the Banner Fund International Offshore Arbitrage             Leveraging Program, which they advertised as an opportunity             for the little guy to take advantage of phenomenal             opportunities in the financial markets.  Through the vehicle             of Banner Fund, under the management of Swiss Trade, Winburn             and Blackwell claimed that investors\ funds would be             leveraged into large profits with little or no room for             loss.  In fact, after raising at least $6.5 million from             mailings targeted primarily at unsophisticated investors             with small amounts of capital to invest, defendants failed             to engage in any leverage or arbitrage activity, but instead             spent the money on real estate and a shrimp farm in Belize,             and on various trusts in the United States engaged in             lending money to defendants\ relatives and friends.             In addition to rendering judgment for the Commission, the             Court denied Blackwell\s motion for summary judgment, which             was based primarily on the contention that, because             defendants were located in Belize, the Court lacked subject             matter jurisdiction over the action. To the contrary, the             Court found, defendants\ perpetration of a fraud against             United States investors through the use of the United States             mails indisputably established subject matter jurisdiction             under the federal securities laws.

The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that on          March 25, 1998, the Honorable Vaughn R. Walker, United States          District Judge for the Northern District of California, entered          settled judgments concluding the Securities and Exchange          Commission\s lawsuit against three former officers of California          Micro Devices Corporation (Cal Micro), a high-technology          company headquartered in Milpitas, California.  The Commission\s          complaint alleges financial reporting fraud by all three          defendants and illegal insider trading by Rao and Penumarty.          Each defendant settled the Commission\s lawsuit against him          without admitting or denying the allegations contained in the          Commission\s complaint.          Surendra Gupta, Cal Micro\s former president, consented to pay a          civil penalty of $72,250.00; to be barred from serving as an          officer or director of a public company; and to be enjoined from          future violations of applicable federal securities laws.          Bhasker Rao, Cal Micro\s former manager of its Tempe plant          operations, consented to pay disgorgement of $70,203.75          (representing his losses avoided as a result of sales of Cal          Micro stock) plus prejudgment interest of $20,025; to pay a civil          penalty for insider trading of $70,203.75; to pay an additional          civil penalty of $10,000; to be barred as an officer or director          of a public company for five years; and to be enjoined from          future violations of applicable federal securities laws.          Ramana Penumarty, Cal Micro\s former manager of its Milpitas          plant operations, consented to pay disgorgement of $58,385.43          (representing his losses avoided as a result of sales of Cal          Micro stock) plus prejudgment interest of $17,310; to pay a civil          penalty for insider trading of $58,385.43; to pay an additional          civil penalty of $10,000; to be barred as an officer or director          of a public company for five years; and to be enjoined from          future violations of applicable federal securities laws.          The Commission\s complaint, filed September 26, 1996, alleges          that during Cal Micro\s fiscal year ended June 30, 1994 the          defendants artificially inflated Cal Micro\s publicly reported          revenue by directing employees to falsify documents in order to          create the appearance that certain goods had been shipped to          customers when, in fact, the goods had not been shipped or, in          most cases, manufactured.          The complaint further alleges that as a result of the defendants\          fraudulent conduct, Cal Micro\s financial statements for the          fiscal year ended June 30, 1994, were materially false and          misleading.          The complaint finally alleges that Rao and Penumarty engaged in          illegal insider trading by selling Cal Micro stock in 1994 while          in possession of material non-public information, including, but          not limited to, the knowledge that they had falsified the          Company\s books and records, circumvented its internal accounting          controls, artificially inflated its reported revenues, and          received internal reports which quantified the amount of false          revenue booked on unshipped products.          Pursuant to the settlement, Gupta consented to be enjoined from          future violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A),          13(b)(2)(B) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities and Exchange Act of          1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13,          13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder.  Rao consented to be enjoined from          violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933          (Securities Act), Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A),          13(b)(2)(B), 13(b)(5), and 16(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules          10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, 13b2-1, and 16a-3 thereunder.          Penumarty consented to be enjoined from violations of Section          17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A),          13(b)(2)(B), and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5,          12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, and 13b2-1 thereunder.

(S.D.N.Y.)(filed April 1, 1998)             The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced the             filing of an insider trading case against Arjun Sekhri, a             former investment banking associate at Salomon Smith Barney,             Inc. in New York City, and five other individuals to whom             Sekhri supplied confidential information, including his             father-in-law.  The complaint alleges that, from September             1997 through January 1998, Sekhri, Amolak Sehgal, Pratima             Rajan, Fuad Dow, Gordon W. Cochrane and Martin L. Thifault             engaged in a highly profitable insider trading scheme by             collectively purchasing call options and/or common stock             shortly before six major corporate announcements.  The             defendants reaped total profits of at least $1.8 million             from their illegal securities transactions.             Also today, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern             District of New York unsealed complaints charging Sekhri,             Sehgal, Dow, and Thifault with insider trading and             conspiracy to commit insider trading.  It also announced the             arrests of Sehgal, Dow, and Thifault on those charges.             The SECs complaint alleges that Sekhri, the source of the             inside information, was an investment banking associate at             Salomon at the time of the trading.  Salomon provided             investment banking services in each of the relevant             corporate transactions and Sekhri worked specifically on at             least one of those transactions.  Sekhri tipped Dow,             Sekhris former college roommate.  Dow then tipped Cochrane             and Thifault, all three of whom collectively purchased             common stock and/or call options on the stock of MCI             Communications Corp., Brooks Fiber Properties, Inc., Carson             Pirie Scott & Co., Inc., Central and South West Corp., and             Southern New England Telecommunications Corp. in advance of             six different public announcements of significant mergers             involving these companies.  Sekhri also tipped Sehgal, his             father-in-law, in advance of at least four of these             announcements, and Rajan, his friend, in advance of at least             three of these announcements.             The SEC filed its complaint in the United States District             Court for the Southern District of New York.  The complaint             alleges that the defendants violated the anti-fraud             provisions of the federal securities laws (specifically,             Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of             1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder), and seeks, among             other things, permanent injunctions, disgorgement, interest             and penalties. The complaint also seeks disgorgement from             relief defendants Mahendar and Sharda Sekhri, Arjun Sekhris             parents, of assets transferred to them by Dow and Sehgal.             Earlier today, the Honorable Robert P. Patterson, United             States District Judge, granted emergency relief requested by             the SEC, in the form of a temporary restraining order and an             asset freeze.             The SEC acknowledges the valuable assistance of the Chicago             Board Options Exchange and the New York, Pacific, and             Philadelphia Stock Exchanges in this matter.

The Securities  and Exchange Commission (Commission) today          announced that on March  30,  1998,  the  United  States District          Court for the Southern District of New York entered a judgment by          default against defendant Eva-Health, USA, Inc. (Eva-Health), a          company  that  purportedly  was  in  the business of researching,          developing, manufacturing, and licensing biomedical devices.               In a complaint filed on December  17,  1997,  the Commission          alleged  that,  from January 1992 through April 1994,  Eva-Health          sold  approximately   $5.5  million  of  unregistered  Eva-Health          warrants (Warrants) to  investors.  The Commission alleged that          Eva-Health  and its former Chief  Executive  Officer,  Calman  H.          Rifkin (Rifkin),  violated Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the          Securities Act of 1933  (Securities  Act)  and Section 10(b) of          the  Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange  Act)  and  Rule          10b-5 thereunder, when they made fraudulent misrepresentations to          investors   concerning,  inter  alia,  Rifkin\s  educational  and          professional credentials and the existence of patents purportedly          held by Eva-Health for eleven biomedical devices.

The defendants were enjoined from violating Section          15(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 15b1-3 promulgated thereunder,          Section  17(a), Section 15(c) and Section 10(b) of the Securities          Act  and  Rule  10b-5  thereunder.   The  Commission\s  complaint          alleged that  Mark  Eames, Garth Potts, and Robert Eames violated          the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws by making          misrepresentations to two investors resulting in the loss of more          than $700,000 to those  investors.  The false statements included          the dissemination of a false  financial  statement which was used          to  guarantee  a  return  on an investment.  The  complaint  also          alleged that Mark Eames misappropriated  investor funds that were          to  be used to establish a Hong Kong broker-dealer,  and  instead          used the funds for his personal benefit.          The complaint,  filed  May 24, 1994, alleged extensive violations          of the Commission\s registration,  recordkeeping, and net capital          rules by San Marino Securities, Inc.  (San  Marino),  Mark Eames,          Robert Eames, and Garth Potts.  The complaint contended that Mark          Eames  and  Garth Potts were control persons of San Marino  and          caused San Marino  to  violate  the  Exchange Act rules governing          recordkeeping and net capital.  San Marino itself was permanently          enjoined by consent on November 17, 1994."

Down (Down).  The defendants,  who  consented  to  the          orders without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations,          were enjoined from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the          Securities  Act  of  1933,  and  Section  10(b) of the Securities          Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated  thereunder. The          court  waived  disgorgement  and  determined not to impose  civil          penalties based on the demonstrated  inability  of the defendants          to pay.          The Commissions complaint alleged that IDC and Down  operated  a          multilevel  marketing  pyramid  scheme  by  offering  and selling          independent  consultant  memberships  in  IDC  in an unregistered          distribution.  The complaint also alleged that IDC  and Down made          fraudulent  misrepresentations,  and  omitted  to  state material          facts, to potential and current investors regarding  the purchase          of a membership in IDC.  The alleged misrepresentations  involved          the  potential  profit to be expected from an IDC membership  and          the omission to disclose  the  risk of market saturation inherent          in IDCs pyramid scheme.          At the time the complaint was filed  the  Commission alleged that          IDC was signing up approximately 100 new members each day and          had  raised  more  than $1 million from the sale  of  independent          consultant memberships."

The Commission\s  Complaint  alleges  the         following:         *  Wu  worked  for  Milliman & Robertson (Milliman), an actuarial         firm that was a consultant to             Transport;         *  On September 10, 1996,  after  negotiations  with  Conseco  were         underway,  Transport  engaged    Milliman  to  perform  services in         connection with the acquisition;         *  On  September 13, 1996, in the course of his duties at Milliman,         Wu was informed in confidence            of details of the proposed Conseco-Transport transaction;         * Wu thereafter  tipped  Xian  and Sang about the Conseco-Transport         transaction;         * From September 18 to September  23,  1996,  Xian  used all of her         available cash to purchase a            total of 700 shares of Transport common stock;         *  On September 20, 1996, Sang purchased 500 shares of  Transport\s         common stock;         * After  the  public  announcement on September 26, 1996,  Xian and         Sang each sold their    Transport  shares, and as a result of their         insider trading, made $14,389 and $10,046.50   respectively.         Simultaneously with the filing of the  Commission\s  Complaint, Wu,         Xian, and Sang, without admitting or denying the allegations in the         Complaint,  consented  to the entry of orders enjoining  them  from         violating Section 10(b)  of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and         Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and  requiring  them  to pay civil penalties         pursuant  to  the  Insider  Trading  Sanctions  Act   of   1984  of         $24,435.50,  $14,389,  and  $10,046.50  respectively.

The   defendants  were          enjoined from violating Section 17A(d) of the Securities Exchange          Act  of  1934, and Rules 17Ad-2, 17Ad-6, and 17Ad-10  promulgated          thereunder.

Brink (Brink).  Without admitting or denying the allegations          in the Commission\s Complaint, Brink  consented to the entry of a          permanent injunction enjoining him from  future violations of the          securities  registration  and  anti-fraud  provisions   found  in          Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933,  and          Section  10(b)  of  the  Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule          10b-5 thereunder. Brink agreed  to  disgorgement in the amount of          $459,550.66 together with prejudgment  interest  in the amount of          $137,813.00.  Brink\s disgorgement amount was waived based on his          demonstrated financial inability to pay.          The  Commission\s  Complaint  alleged that the defendants  raised          approximately $3.6 million from  investors  in  39 states for the          purpose of purchasing oil field equipment and pipe.   Enserco was          to  resell  the equipment and return a portion of the profits  to          investors.  The  Complaint alleged that investors were guaranteed          returns  of  up to 25%  per  annum,  with  complete  security  of          principal, and were told that there were no risks associated with          the investment.   In  fact,  according  to  the  Complaint, Brink          operated an undisclosed Ponzi scheme whereby monies contributed          by  new  investors  were  paid  as purported profits to  previous          investors.    Further,   the   Complaint   alleges   that   Brink          misappropriated investors\ funds,  and  Leo  and  Bravo  received          undisclosed  commissions  for  their  efforts  in selling Enserco          securities."

INTERACTIVE PRODUCTS AND          SERVICES, INC., AND MATTHEW P. BOWIN, United States District          Court for the Northern District of California, Civil Action No.          C-98-20313.          The Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission)          announced that it filed a complaint today in the United States          District Court for the Northern District of California alleging a          phony public offering of stock conducted over the Internet.  The          suit names as defendants Interactive Products and Services, Inc.          (IPS), a purported high-tech start-up company based in Santa          Cruz County, California, and Matthew P. Bowin (Bowin), the          company\s chairman, president, and chief executive officer.          The stock offering, one of the first conducted entirely over the          Internet, raised approximately $190,000 from about 150 investors          nationwide between November 1996 and July 1997.          In the offering materials, Bowin and IPS represented that all          offering proceeds would be held in escrow, and would be returned          to investors if a minimum investment level of $500,000 were not          reached by the close of the offering.  Instead, the Commission          alleges, Bowin simply pocketed the offering proceeds and          converted the money to personal use (buying items from groceries          to clothing to stereo equipment).  The Commission further charges          that, despite the failure of the offering to raise the $500,000          minimum, Bowin refused to return the money to investors; to the          contrary, Bowin misrepresented to certain investors that the          offering was successful and that they would be receiving stock          certificates shortly.          In addition, the Commission alleges that Bowin and IPS made other          misrepresentations and omissions in connection with the offering,          including the following:  (1) failed to disclose that IPS was          insolvent due to numerous outstanding judgments; (2) touted the          qualifications of three advisors retained by the company who,          in fact, had no affiliation with IPS; (3) made optimistic          statements about a pending patent application while failing to          disclose that the application had been repeatedly rejected; and          (4) misrepresented that an offering statement relating to the          securities had been qualified by the Commission.          The Commission\s complaint charges that Bowin and IPS have          violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities          laws - Sections 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section          10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and          10b-9 thereunder.

Shell in connection with          an offering of approximately 2.5 million shares of IMT common          stock to the public during 1992 and 1993.  Without admitting or          denying the allegations of the Commissions Complaint, Shell has          consented to the entry of a final judgment which will (i)          permanently restrain and enjoin Shell from future violation of          the registration provisions of the federal securities laws          (Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933); and (ii)          order Shell to pay a penalty of $35,000.               The Commissions Complaint alleged that from approximately          April 1992 through at least June 1993, Shell and others raised          approximately $5 million from the sale of IMT stock to          approximately 300 investors.  No registration statement was in          effect with respect to these shares of IMT stock.  Shell was          previously enjoined from violating the antifraud and registration          provisions, based upon a prior offering of IMT securities.  See          SEC v.

The Commission and the United States Attorney for the             District of Massachusetts announced that on April 8, 1998,             Leonard A. Fiessel,  Robert L. Shull,  and Terry L. Shull,             all of  British Columbia, Canada, and Patrick A. Collins, of             Massachusetts,  were indicted by a federal grand jury for             participating in a scheme to artificially increase the stock             price of Fairmont Resources, Inc. (Fairmont), a Canadian             oil and gas company . The 45-count indictment charges the             defendants with securities fraud, conspiracy to commit             securities fraud and wire fraud.  Previously, the Commission             obtained permanent injunctions and orders to pay             disgorgement against Leonard Fiessel, Robert Shull, Patrick             Collins and six others for their participation in the             scheme.             The indictment alleges that after Leonard Fiessel and Robert             Shull purchased a controlling interest in Fairmont, the             defendants caused the price of Fairmont stock  to increase             from $.30 to $3.10 per share between January and June 1993             by  (1) paying kickbacks totaling $540,000 to stockbrokers             in the United States for inducing their customers to             purchase approximately 1,225,000 shares of Fairmont stock;             (2) creating the false appearance of an active market in             Fairmont stock by buying and selling large quantities of the             stock, including through wash  sales and cross trades,             and (3) controlling the timing of transactions in Fairmont             stock to ensure that the stock price would continue to rise.             The indictment also alleges that as a result of their             manipulative activity, Leonard Fiessel, Robert Shull and             Terry Shull sold large blocks of Fairmont stock at a             substantial profit.  The indictment  also alleges that             Collins, a self-employed promoter of penny stocks, received             cash and shares of Fairmont in order to promote the sale of             Fairmont stock to U.S. investors, and that he used some of             that money to pay a U.S. stockbroker for selling shares of             Fairmont to his clients.             In a complaint filed on August 31, 1994, the Commission             alleged that Leonard Fiessel, Colleen Fiessel, Robert Shull,             Patrick Collins, and five U.S. stockbrokers -- Mark Hamel,             Robert Raffa, William Cho, Jeffrey Fernandez and Michael             Murphy -- violated the antifraud and registration provisions             of the federal securities laws.  Final judgments have been             entered against all of the defendants in that action, and             they have been ordered to disgorge over $2 million.

The  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  (Commission)  today          announced that on March 26, 1998, Judge Alan A. McDonald, Eastern          District of Washington entered Final Judgements  of  Disgorgement          and Civil Penalties against Marvin G. Pursinger (Pursinger), of          Salem,  Oregon,  and  Machlene  E. Soderquist (Soderquist),  of          Portland.  Previously, the Court  had  entered final judgments by          default  permanently  enjoining  Pursinger  and  Soderquist  from          violating the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933          (Securities  Act)  and  the Securities  Exchange  Act  of  1934          (Exchange Act).          The Commission\s Complaint  in  this  matter  alleged  that  from          approximately  May  1992  through  about March 1993 Pursinger and          Soderquist,  along  with  other  defendants,   made   false   and          misleading  statements  and  omissions to investors in connection          with the offer and sale of promissory  notes  of  an Oregon based          start-up company, Brendon Marshall, Inc. (BMI).  In particular,          the  Complaint  alleged  that  Pursinger  and  Soderquist  misled          investors as to the financial condition of the company,  the  use          of  the  funds being raised, the operating history of BMI and the          experience  and  qualifications  of  its promoters to conduct the          proposed  business,  among  other  things.   The  Complaint  also          alleged that the defendants failed to  disclose  that  they  were          using investor monies for their own personal benefit.          The previously-issued Permanent Injunctions against Pursinger and          Soderquist  prohibit  them  from  violating  Section 17(a) of the          Securities  Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange  Act  and  Rule          10b-5 thereunder.   The Final Judgments of Disgorgement and Civil          Penalties require Pursinger and Soderquist each to repay $586,000          in monies raised from  the  sale  of  BMI  securities,  but waive          repayment  and  do  not  impose  civil  penalties  based  on  the          defendants\ demonstrated financial inability to pay.

Touch Tone          purportedly was going to establish and operate a 900-number          dating service.  The Commission\s complaint alleged that the          defendants raised approximately $3.9 million from investors          nationwide from the sale of the Touch Tone securities from August          1994 through January 1995.  The complaint alleged that neither          the Touch Tone securities nor any of the sales offices selling          the securities were registered with the Commission.  The          complaint further alleged that Lopuszynski, Courtney, Shoucair,          Engelhardt, and their salespeople made material          misrepresentations to potential investors about the use of the          Touch Tone offering proceeds and other aspects of this          investment.

The complaint alleges that:  The defendants              claimed that they operated investment programs that              successfully bought and traded financial instruments issued by              the world\s largest banks, described variously as medium-term              bank notes, stand-by letters of credit, and prime bank              guarantees.  The trading was to result in spectacular profits              for investors\xc4returns of ten to fifty times their initial              investments in two months to two years\xc4at no risk.  The              investment programs were scams, the instruments themselves              bogus.  Instead of using the money as promised, the defendants              misappropriated the investors\ funds for their own benefit,              transferring portions of the money to at least one individual              and three entities, who were named as relief defendants.              Named as defendants are: George Wallace Stewart, a 55 year old resident of Hollywood, Florida. \x07Patrick J. Madden, a 48 year old resident of Alberta, Canada. Allen B. Gottlieb, a 54 year old New York licensed attorney, who resides in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Kenneth R. Lagonia, who resides in Bohemia, New York. \x07Salim El Hage, whose last known residence was Paris, France. \x07H.D. Inc., a New Jersey corporation. \x07St. Barth Limited, a Bahamian company. \x07Eastland American Bank Limited, a Bahamian company. \x07Foreign Trade Bank, a Lebanese company. Mecis Insurance and Reinsurance Company, a Lebanese company.              Named as relief defendants are: Cornel Plebani, a New Jersey resident. Law Offices of Allen B. Gottlieb and Associates, P.C., a New York professional corporation. Americredit Commercial Corporation. \x07Finanzurich LTD, a Bahamian company.                                          - 2 -              The complaint charges that the defendants, through their              respective roles in the investment schemes, violated the              antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section              17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the              Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  As              to the defendants, the SEC seeks permanent prohibitory              injunctions, disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains plus              prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  As to the              relief defendants, the SEC seeks return of the investors\              funds that they received and prejudgment interest thereon."
15706,1998,,"b                          SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION          LITIGATION RELEASE NO.  15706 / April 14, 1998          SECURITIES  AND  EXCHANGE COMMISSION v. EDWARD J. PARADIS JR. AND          WALTER R. SNYDER,  JR.  (United  States  District  Court  for the          District of Massachusetts, Civ. Action No. 98-10638-NG).          The  Securities  and  Exchange Commission announced that on April          14, 1998, the Honorable  Nancy  Gertner,  U.S. District Judge for          the  District  of  Massachusetts,  unsealed  an  emergency  order          entered  on  April  13, 1998, temporarily restraining  EDWARD  J.          PARADIS,  JR., and WALTER  R.  SNYDER,  JR.,  from  continuing  a          fraudulent   investment   scheme  in  violation  of  the  federal          securities laws.  The order  also  freezes  the assets of Paradis          and   Snyder.   Paradis  resides  in  Sturbridge,  Massachusetts.          Snyder  is  a  lawyer  who  maintains an office in Sturbridge and          resides in Southbridge, Massachusetts.          The  Commission\s  complaint  alleges  that  Paradis  and  Snyder          obtained $175,000 from an investor,  promising  him  a  return of          over  300%  in  stock  and cash within thirty days.  They falsely          told the investor that his money would be safely held in Snyder\s          attorney  escrow  account   until  completion  of  a  financing          transaction that would produce  the  300%  profit.   Contrary  to          their promises to the investor, however, Paradis and Snyder began          removing  the  investor\s  funds  as soon as the funds arrived in          Snyder\s account, and have misappropriated  at  least $144,000 to          date, using it for purposes such as paying Paradis\  rent.   Some          of the investor funds were transferred to a Swiss bank account in          Paradis\  name.   The Complaint alleges that even after the money          was  misappropriated,  Paradis  assured  the  investor  that  the          completion of the transaction was imminent.          In its Complaint, the Commission further alleges that Paradis and          Snyder  falsely told the investor they had successfully completed          similar financing transactions on several prior occasions when,          in fact,  they had engaged in a series of at least six fraudulent          schemes   during    the   past   three   years,   obtaining   and          misappropriating over $1 million from investors.          In addition to temporarily  restraining  Paradis  and  Snyder and          freezing their assets, the Court\s order requires them to provide          an  accounting  of  their  assets,  orders  the  repatriation  of          investor  funds  abroad  and  grants other emergency relief.  The          Commission filed its Complaint  on  April  13  on an emergency ex          parte basis.          Both Paradis and Snyder are charged with violating  the antifraud          provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 17(a)  of  the          Securities  Act  of  1933  and  Section  10(b)  of the Securities          Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In its Complaint          the Commission also seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of          Paradis\  and  Snyder\s  ill-gotten  gains  and  civil   monetary          penalties."
15707,1998,,"b- 1  -                   UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION        Litigation Release No.  15707 / April 15, 1998        Securities and Exchange Commission v. Jerome M. Wenger, 98 Civ. 2674        (MM)(S.D.N.Y.)        The Commission filed a Complaint today in the United States District        Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that, between        June 1997 and September 1997 (the Relevant Period), a radio talk        show host promoted the stock of a company on his radio program without        disclosing that he was being paid by the company to do so.        Named in the Commission\s Complaint is:Jerome M. Wenger (Wenger), age 52, of Bethesda, Maryland.  Wenger hosts TheNext SuperStock radio program, which is broadcast on over ten radio stationsnationwide, including, New York, Chicago, Boca Raton, Boston, Phoenix, Seattleand Washington, D.C.  Wenger also publishes a newsletter and maintains anInternet Web Site, both of which also use the name The Next SuperStock.        The Complaint alleges that, during June 1997, Wenger made a proposal        to Transco Research Corporation (Transco), a Delaware corporation        that distributes pre-paid telephone cards and cellular telephones.        Specifically, Wenger allegedly offered to describe and promote sales        of Transco stock on broadcasts of The Next SuperStock radio program in        exchange for shares of Transco common stock.  According to the        Complaint, Transco agreed to pay Wenger consideration in exchange for        Wenger\s promotion of Transco stock.  Accordingly, Transco allegedly        paid Wenger consideration that included: (a) 44,000 shares of Transco        common stock, which Transco tendered to Wenger on June 12, 1997; (b)        15,000 shares of Transco stock, which Transco tendered to Wenger on        September 30, 1997; and (c) a check for $4,000, which Transco tendered        to Wenger on August 5, 1997.  The Complaint alleges that Wenger        realized approximately $71,000 from the sale of these 59,000 shares of        Transco stock.        Wenger allegedly featured Transco on The Next SuperStock and an        affiliated radio program approximately 40 times, during the Relevant        Period.  According to the Complaint, during certain of these        broadcasts, including, but not limited to, broadcasts on radio station        WEVD A.M. in New York City on June 25, 1997 and June 26, 1997, Wenger        interviewed a representative of Transco, described Transco\s business,        discussed Transco\s product lines, commended Transco\s  proposed        business plans, and provided listeners with a toll free number to call        for more information about Transco stock.  This toll free number        allegedly was the telephone number of an individual who held himself        out as Tom Richardson, a purported registered representative of Wise        Choice Discount Brokerage, Inc., a broker-dealer registered with the        Commission.        According to the Complaint, Wenger failed to disclose during The Next        SuperStock radio programs, including, but not limited to, the        broadcasts on radio station WEVD A.M. in New York City on June 25,        1997 and June 26, 1997: (a) that he entered into an agreement with        Transco to promote Transco\s stock on the radio program; (b) that he        received consideration from Transco to promote Transco\s stock; (c)        the amount of the consideration he received from Transco; (d) the        value of the consideration he received from Transco; (e) that the        consideration he received was Transco stock and cash; or (f) that he        expected to receive additional consideration from Transco.        By engaging in the foregoing conduct, the Commission alleges that        Wenger violated Section 17(b) of the Securities Act of 1933        (Securities Act), which makes it unlawful to receive consideration        from an issuer in exchange for publishing or circulating any notice,        circular, advertisement, newspaper, article, letter, investment        service, or communication which describes an issuer\s securities,        without disclosing the nature and amount of the consideration received        from the issuer.        In its Complaint, the Commission seeks a final judgment permanently        enjoining Wenger from violating Section 17(b) of the Securities Act,        and ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains, plus prejudgment        interest, and to pay civil penalties. The litigation is pending.        Wenger also is a defendant in SEC v. PanWorld Minerals International,        Inc. et al., Civil No. 2:97 CV 0425B (D. Utah), a pending action that        the Commission filed in June 1997 in the United States District Court        for the District of Utah.  In that action, the Commission alleges        that, among other things, Wenger fraudulently touted and solicited        investors to purchase stock of PanWorld Minerals International, Inc.        (PanWorld), a Nevada corporation, while failing to disclose the        receipt of PanWorld shares and the sales of those shares.        Additionally, in 1984, Wenger, without admitting or denying the        findings, consented to a Commission administrative order finding that        he violated the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act, the        Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and other provisions of the federal        securities laws by, among other things, failing to disclose securities        trading and conflicts of interest prior to making recommendations to        investors.

15709,1998,,"b             SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION             Washington, D.C.             Litigation Release No.   15709    / April  20, 1998             SEC  v.  Banner  Fund International, Civil Action No. 94-342             (EGS) ( D.D.C.)             The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that             on April 15, 1998, The Honorable Emmet Sullivan, United             States District Judge for the District of Columbia, granted             the Commission\s motion for default judgment against  relief             defendants Precision Trust, Automotive Concepts (Trust),             Academy Equities Trust, Hermes Leasing Trust and Fulfillment             Center Trust,  and ordered them to disgorge a total of             $760,500, plus  prejudgment interest of $329,822.74.  The             Court found that these sums represented proceeds from the             fraud perpetrated on thousands of United States investors by             defendants Banner Fund International, Swiss Trade & Commerce             Limited Trust, Lloyd Winburn and Eddy Blackwell,  which the             relief defendants held in constructive trust for the benefit             of the defrauded investors.             In two prior rulings, the Court had ordered Banner Fund,             Swiss Trade, Winburn and Blackwell to disgorge $6.5 million             they raised from investors, plus prejudgment interest.              From late 1992 through 1994, defendants Winburn and             Blackwell, both United States citizens operating first out             of Aruba and later from Belize, offered and sold investments             in the Banner Fund International Offshore Arbitrage             Leveraging Program, which they advertised as an opportunity             for the little guy to take advantage of phenomenal             opportunities in the financial markets.  Through the vehicle             of Banner Fund, under the management of Swiss Trade, Winburn             and Blackwell claimed that investors\ funds would be             leveraged into large profits with little or no room for             loss.  In fact, after raising at least $6.5 million from             mailings targeted primarily at unsophisticated investors             with small amounts of capital to invest, defendants failed             to engage in any leverage or arbitrage activity, but instead             spent the money on real estate and a shrimp farm in Belize,             and on  trusts in the United States engaged in lending money             to defendants\ relatives and friends.  The trusts were named             as relief defendants in an amended complaint filed September             12, 1997.

15710,1998,,"b                       U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION          Litigation Release No. 15710 / April 20, 1998          UNITED STATES OF AMERICA V. BENJAMIN BUSH, Criminal Action No. 98          CR 35 (C.D. Cal.)          On April 7, 1998, Benjamin Bush (Bush), an investment adviser          and president of his investment adviser managment firm, Ben Bush          Investment Management, Inc. (BBIM), pleaded guilty to one count          of money laundering.  Bush will be sentenced on June 29, 1998.          The Securities and Exchange Commission obtained Judgments of          Permanent Injunction and Other Relief against Bush and BBIM on          January 24, 1997 based on the same conduct.  The judgments          permanently enjoin Bush and BBIM from future violations of          Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the          Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and          Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940          (Advisers Act), antifraud provisions; Section 206(4) of the          Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-2 thereunder, custody and possession          violations; Section 204 of the Advisers Act and Rules 204-          1(b)(2), 204-2(a) and 204-2(b) thereunder, books and records          violations; and Section 207 of the Advisers Act, registration          filings violations.  The judgments further provide that Bush and          BBIM shall pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil          penalties in amounts subsequently to be determined by the Court.          Bush and BBIM consented to the entry of the judgments without          admitting or denying the Commission\s allegations.  In addition,          Bush agreed to be barred from the securities industry, and BBIM          consented to a revocation of its registration as an investment          adviser.          In its complaint, the Commission alleged that Bush, through BBIM,          managed approximately $10 million for wealthy and sophisticated          clients nationwide.  The Commission alleged, among other things,          that from January 1995 through the filing of the Commission\s          action on September 25, 1996, Bush:          (a) misappropriated at least $450,000 of his clients\ funds          accepting money from clients to purchase investments on their          behalf, but failing to purchase the investments; (b) commingled          client funds with his own funds in a single corporate bank          account which he used like a private checking account to pay his          own expenses, such as rent, alimony and car insurance, and to          purchase such personal items as hockey tickets and jewelry; (c)          sent his clients false account statements, fraudulently showing          that he had purchased investments on their behalf; (d) used          forged brokerage statements to solicit clients\ business; and (e)          induced several of his clients to purchase Brazilian bonds of          uncertain value issued in 1902 and 1915 which Bush kept in his          safety deposit box at his local bank.          On September 26, 1996, the Commission obtained a temporary          restraining order against Bush and BBIM which ordered them to          immediately cease their fraudulent activities, and an order          placing a freeze on Bush\s assets to protect investor funds.  On          October 4, 1996, the Court entered a preliminary injunction          against Bush and BBIM, which continued to bar them from their          fraudulent activities and continued the asset freeze.

15711,1998,,"b                   UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION             LITIGATION RELEASE NO.  15711 / April 20, 1998             SEC v. UNITED ENERGY PARTNERS, INC. ET AL.,             3-98CV0218-R (USDC/ND/TX Dallas Division)                  On January 30, 1998, the Securities and Exchange             Commission (Commission) obtained an ex parte temporary             restraining order, including an asset freeze, from the             Honorable Jorge A. Solis, United States District Court for             the Northern District of Texas, to halt an ongoing,             fraudulent offer and sale of securities.  Named as             defendants in the Commission\s Complaint, also filed on             January 30, 1998, are United Energy Partners, Inc. (United             Energy), Richard A. Quinn (Quinn) and Scott W. Tucker             (Tucker).  A hearing on the Commission\s motions for             preliminary injunction and for the appointment of a             temporary receiver are set for May 4, 1998.                  The Commission alleges that the defendants are engaged             in an ongoing fraudulent offer and sale of securities in the             form of undivided, working interests in oil and gas joint             ventures issued by United Energy.  The Complaint also             alleges that, from 1995 through the present, the defendants             raised approximately $7.5 million from approximately 285             investors located in at least 40 states, including the State             of Texas.  It is further alleged that, in connection with             the offer and sale of these securities, the defendants             knowingly made false statements of material fact to             investors, including: that investor funds would be used             solely for the drilling of specific oil and gas wells; that             United Energy and its employees had invested in the joint             ventures on the same terms as investors; and that             assignments reflecting the investors\ ownership interest in             the wells would be filed in the appropriate county within 30             days of achieving production.  The Complaint also alleges             that the defendants omitted to disclose material facts to             investors, including: that half the money raised from             investors would be transferred to United Energy\s operating             account to be spend at Quinn\s discretion; that commissions             of 10 - 15% of investment funds would be paid to             salespersons; that Quinn and Tucker had received overriding             royalty interests in certain wells at not cost; and that             preferential treatment had been offered to some investors in             certain joint ventures.                  The commission charges the defendants with violations             of  Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section             10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange             Act), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and charges defendant             Tucker with violations of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act.             The Commission also sought an accounting, disgorgement of             all ill-gotten gains, including prejudgment interest, civil             money penalties and the appointment of a receiver to             conserve the assets of United Energy."
15712,1998,,"b                  UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION          Litigation Release No. 15712 / April 20, 1998          SEC  v. Ted E. Mong, Liberty Bell Association, Inc., and McKenzie          Matthew, Inc., U.S.D.C. S.D. Ohio, No. C2-96-989, filed September          30, 1996.          The Commission  announced  that the Honorable James Graham of the          United States District Court  for  the  Southern District of Ohio          entered  an  Order of Permanent Injunction  and  Other  Equitable          Relief (Order)  By Default against Liberty Bell Association, Inc.          (Liberty Bell) and  McKenzie  Matthew, Inc. (McKenzie), for their          misrepresentations and omissions in connection with the offer and          sale   of  promissory  notes  to  approximately   45   individual          investors.   Liberty  Bell  and  McKenzie,  two Ohio corporations          based in Newark, Ohio, raised more than $1.6  million  by selling          promissory notes to investors from approximately March 1993 until          August 1995.          In  its  Complaint, the Commission alleged that Liberty Bell  and          McKenzie,  through Defendant Ted E. Mong (Mong), their President,          and  others,   misrepresented   the  risk  of  investing  in  the          promissory notes, the return investors  would receive and the use          of investor proceeds.  In particular, the Commission alleged that          individuals who purchased promissory notes  from Liberty Bell and          McKenzie  were  told  that  investor  funds would  be  loaned  to          successful companies, that investors could  earn  up  to  a  230%          return  on  their investment and that their funds were completely          secured by U.S.  Government bonds, government securities and real          estate equity.  Instead, the Commission alleged that Liberty Bell          and McKenzie directed  investor funds to two struggling companies          that  used  investor  funds  for  operating  capital,  while  the          promised collateral for  investor  funds  did not exist.  Most of          the investors who bought promissory notes from  Liberty  Bell and          McKenzie  lost  nearly their entire investment.  The Court deemed          the  Commissions   allegations  to  be  true.   Based  on  these          allegations, the Commission  charged  Defendants Liberty Bell and          McKenzie with violations of Section 17(a)  of  the Securities Act          and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.          The  Order  permanently  enjoins  Liberty Bell and McKenzie  from          further  fraudulent  conduct  in  violation   of   the  antifraud          provisions  of  the federal securities laws.  The Order  requires          Liberty Bell to disgorge  its  ill-gotten  gains of $1,251,600.36          and to pay $329,711.96 in prejudgment interest  on  that  amount.          The  Order  further  requires McKenzie to disgorge its ill-gotten          gains  of  $223,698.59  and  to  pay  $88,058.73  in  prejudgment          interest on that amount.   The Court also found in the Order that          civil  penalties  were  appropriate   against  Liberty  Bell  and          McKenzie but reserved determination of  the  amount  of  any such          penalties  for  a  future date.  The action against Mong is still          pending."
15713,1998,,"b                       U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION          Litigation Release No. 15713 / April 21, 1998          SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION v. KS RESOURCES, ET AL.          Civil Action No. 95-8608 WDK (AJWx) (C.D. Cal.)               The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission)          announced that on April 3, 1998, it completed a settlement with          Jamie B. Seigel.  As part of the settlement, Mrs. Seigel paid          $458,960.88 to the court appointed receiver for defendants KS          Resources, Weststar Exploration, Inc., and affiliated entities.          The Honorable William D. Keller, United States District Court          Judge for the Central District of California, dismissed the          Commission\s action against Mrs. Seigel at the request of the          parties.               The Commission alleged in a 1995 complaint that KS          Resources, Weststar Exploration, Lazar Frederick & Company, Mark          D. Seigel, Alexander L. Kahan, John K. Judd, Jr. and Betty A.          Rubin sold unregistered securities and defrauded investors in 29          oil and gas limited partnerships from May 1993 through December          1995.  These defendants raised approximately $34,934,000 from at          least 2,000 investors.  The Commission did not assert any          violation of the federal securities laws by Jamie B. Seigel, a          sister in law of Mark D. Seigel, but alleged that she received          proceeds of the fraud from defendants KS Resources and Weststar          Exploration."

Daley, and        David M. Connochie (M.D. Fla.) No. 96-1043-CIV-ORL-19A             The Commission announced today that a stockbroker, previously        charged with receiving kickbacks in exchange for selling certain        securities to his clients, has settled the charges against him. On        September 27, 1996, the Commission filed a Complaint in U.S. District        Court for the Middle District of Florida alleging that a group of        stock promoters engaged in an 18-month fraudulent scheme in which they        paid $477,580 in kickbacks to seven stockbrokers to induce them to        retail certain securities to their customers.  The Complaint further        alleges that the stockbrokers defrauded their customers by failing to        disclose to the customers that they were receiving these kickbacks.             The settling stock broker is Michael Cardascia, (Cardascia),        age 32, of Manhasset, New York. During the period Cardascia was        alleged to have received the illegal payments, he was employed by        Corporate Securities Group, Inc., a broker-dealer registered with the        Commission.             Cardascia consented, without admitting or denying the allegations        in the Complaint, to the issuance of a Final Judgment by Judge        Patricia C. Fawsett of the United States District Court for the Middle        District of Florida enjoining him from future violations of Section        17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the        Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 -- the antifraud        provisions of the federal securities laws.  The amount of any        disgorgement, prejudgment interest and  civil penalties to be paid by        Cardascia is yet to be determined.             The Commission\s litigation remains pending against three brokers        and one stock promoter.

15715,1998,,"b             UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION             Litigation Release No.  15715  / April 21, 1998             SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION V. THOMAS EDWARD             CAVANAGH, U.S. MILESTONE, ELECTRO-OPTICAL SYSTEMS CORP.,             GEORGE CHACHAS, THOMAS R. BROOKSBANK, WILLIAM N.

HANTGES, COSIMO TACOPINO, ET AL., 98 Civil Action No. 1818             (S.D.N.Y.)             On April 20, 1998, Judge Denise Cote of the United States             District Court for the Southern District of New York entered             a preliminary injunction prohibiting future violations of             Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and             Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by the             primary perpetrators of  a market manipulation scheme in the             stock of Electro-Optical Systems, Corp. (EOSC).  Judge             Cote also extended the asset freeze, initially ordered on             March 13, as to all proceeds from the defendants\ sales of             EOSC shares as well as to any shares of EOSC that remain in             their custody or control.  In a 122-page opinion, Judge Cote             noted that the case concerns a scheme through which the             defendants reaped millions of dollars in profits at the             expense of the American investor by creating active trading             in the United States securities market without making the             disclosures that were required for the benefit of the             investing public by the Securities Act of 1933.             On March 13, 1998, the Commission filed a complaint alleging             that the defendants defrauded primarily small, on-line             investors of at least $5 million over the course of the             scheme, the profits of which allegedly were distributed             among the 13 defendants and 19 relief defendants.  On the             same day, Judge Cote issued a temporary restraining order             which ordered the defendants to cease their fraudulent             activities and froze the assets of the defendants and the             accounts of the relief defendants that contained EOSC stock             or the proceeds from sales of the stock.  On March 13 the             Commission also suspended over-the-counter trading of the             securities of EOSC for a single ten-day period.             In her April 20 ruling, Judge Cote found that defendant             Cavanagh was the mastermind and a central figure in the             fraud who controlled various nominee accounts through which             the fraudulent trades were made.  Hence, the Commission made             a proper showing that defendants Cavanagh, Milestone,             Customer Safety, Cambiares, Construcciones, and Chachas             violated the antifraud and registration provisions, and that             they may be found liable at trial for disgorgement of             proceeds plus penalties for their violations.  The Court             entered preliminary injunctions against each of these             defendants, but based the preliminary injunction against             Chachas on his violation of the registration provisions             only.  While Chachas was found to have participated in the             fraud, the Court concluded on the evidence available at this             stage that the consequences of this litigation have             effectively deterred him from further fraud violations.             Judge Cote also found that Brooksbank, Hantges, Levy,             Optimum, and Agira violated Section 5 of the Securities Act             and entered a preliminary injunction against Levy based on             the Commission\s showing of a likelihood of repetition.  The             Court observed that, in particular, Cavanagh and Levy set             in motion a plan that had little to do with raising funds             for the company, but instead was designed to line their             pockets.  In addition, defendant Tacopino consented to a             preliminary injunction based on antifraud and registration             violations, and deposited over $350,000 into the registry of             the court pending resolution of the case.  The SEC had             earlier withdrawn its request for a preliminary injunction             against EOSC, while requiring the company regularly to             report on it s expenditures."

MICHAEL W. CROW, ET             AL., Civil Action No. 96-1661 S CM (S.D. Cal.)             On April 20, 1998, the Honorable Edward J. Schwartz, United             States District Judge for the Southern District of             California entered a judgment of permanent injunction and             other relief against Michael W. Crow (Crow).  The judgment             permanently enjoins Crow from violating the insider trading,             antifraud, reporting, recordkeeping, internal control, and             lying to an auditor provisions of the securities laws.  Crow             was the former president and board chairman of Wilshire             Technologies, Inc. (Wilshire), a public company located in             Carlsbad, California.  [SEC v. Michael W. Crow and Peter F.             Kuebler, Civil Action No. 96-1661 S CM, S.D. Cal.] (LR-             15144)             Crow consented to the entry of judgment permanently             enjoining him from future violations of Section 17(a) of the             Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b), 13(a),             13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act             of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-13, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2             thereunder; ordering him to pay disgorgement of $1,248,444             plus prejudgment interest of $225,773, with the judgment to             be satisfied by the resolution of a related securities class             action lawsuit; and barring him from serving as an officer             or director of a reporting company.  Crow consented to the             relief without admitting or denying the allegations set             forth in the Commission\s first amended complaint, filed on             November 1, 1996.  The Commission\s amended complaint             alleged that Crow violated the federal securities laws by             causing Wilshire to overstate its earnings, to issue             materially misleading press releases and to file materially             misleading periodic financial reports with the Commission.             The Commission alleged in its amended complaint that Crow             caused Wilshire to overstate its fiscal 1993 second and             third quarter financial statements by causing Wilshire to             recognize revenue on conditional sales of two new and             untested products.  One product, the TrimPatch, was designed             as an over-the-counter appetite suppressant administered             through the skin.  The other product, a pipe plug, was             designed to clean tubing in clean rooms in manufacturing             facilities.  The Commission further alleged that Crow caused             Wilshire to overstate its earnings by causing Wilshire to             improperly  recognize a gain on a related party asset sale             and an expense deduction on a disputed claim against a             vendor.  The Commission alleged that, in perpetrating this             scheme, Crow violated the antifraud provision of Section             10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange             Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, the reporting provisions of             Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-             13 thereunder, the recordkeeping provisions of Section             13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder,             the internal control provisions of Section 13(b)(2)(B) of             the Exchange Act and the lying to the auditors provision of             Rule 13b2-2 of the Exchange Act.  The Commission also             alleged that Crow avoided losses of approximately $1.2             million by trading Wilshire stock while in possession of             material non-public information about the accuracy of             Wilshire\s financial statements.             In a related administrative proceeding, the Commission             entered an order pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the Commission\s             Rules of Practice against Crow and accepted his offer of             settlement consenting to the entry of the order without             admitting or denying the findings therein.  The             administrative proceeding is based on the injunction and on             Crow\s willful violations of the securities laws and denies             him the privilege of appearing or practicing as an             accountant before the Commission."

The Securities and Exchange  Commission announced today that             on April 15, 1998, the United  States District Court for the             Middle District of Florida, Judge  G. Kendall Sharp, entered             a Final Judgment Of Permanent Injunction  And  Other  Relief             against  Defendant  Mark  T.  Fukuhara.   The Final Judgment             enjoins Fukuhara from future violations of  the  anti-fraud,             reporting,  and  record-keeping  provisions  of  the federal             securities laws, bars Fukuhara from serving as an officer or             director of any publicly-traded company for a period of five             years, and requires him to pay a civil penalty in the amount             of $ 40,000 over the course of one year.  Fukuhara consented             to  the  Final  Judgment  without  admitting or denying  the             Commissions allegations.             Fukuhara, a resident of Redding, California,  is  the former             president  and  CEO  of  Laser  Photonics, Inc., an Orlando,             Florida based manufacturer of medical and scientific lasers.             The Commissions Complaint alleged that Fukuhara and certain             other officers of Laser Photonics  engaged  in  a  scheme to             defraud the companys investors by materially inflating  its             publicly reported revenues and profits and by falsifying its             books and records.  More specifically, the Complaint alleged             that Fukuhara and certain other officers ordered the booking             of  fictitious sales, failed to reduce recorded revenues for             sales returns and billing errors, and prematurely recognized             future   revenues.    The  Complaint  further  alleged  that             Fukuhara participated in  hiding  the fraudulent scheme from             Laser Photonics independent auditors  by  forging, altering             and  concealing  corporate  records, and by procuring  false             sales  confirmations and other  misleading  statements  from             certain  customers of the company in order to circumvent the             auditors verification procedures.  While the scheme lasted,             Laser Photonics  filed  with  the Commission its 1992 annual             report on Form 10-K, two 1993 quarterly  reports on Form 10-             Q, and a stock sale registration statement  on Form S-1, all             of which were materially false and misleading.             The   Final  Judgment  permanently  enjoins  Fukuhara   from             violating  Section  17(a)  of  the  Securities  Act of 1933,             Sections  10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange  Act             of 1934, and  Commission  Rules  10b-5,  13b2-1  and  13b2-2             promulgated  thereunder, and further enjoins him from aiding             and abetting violations  of  Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and             13(b)(2)(B)  of the Securities  Exchange  Act  of  1934  and             Commission  Rules   12b-20,  13a-1  and  13a-13  promulgated             thereunder.

NEW ERA TECHNOLOGIES, INC.          AND BRENT A. JONES, Civil Action No. 98-3009 CAS (SHx) (C.D.          Cal.)          The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it          filed an enforcement action in federal court in Los Angeles          against New Era Technologies International, Inc., based in St.          Joseph, Missouri, and New Era\s former president, Brent A. Jones          of Ojai, California.  The Commission alleges fraud in the          purchase and sale of securities issued by New Era, a public          company.  The Commission asserts that, during Jones\ employment          as New Era\s president, he and New Era misrepresented to two          broker-dealer firms that the company\s financial statements were          audited.  This false information was then incorporated in papers          submitted to the National Association of Securities Dealers to          qualify the securities for quotation on the Over-The-Counter          Bulletin Board.  Some time later, Jones and New Era made false          statements to shareholders and others concerning the company\s          financial condition.          The Commission has asked the Court to permanently enjoin New Era          and Jones from future violations of the securities laws, and          additionally impose a civil penalty against Jones. New Era has          consented to the injunction without admitting or denying the          allegations in the complaint.  The Commission seeks this relief          for defendants\ violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities          Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Commission Rule 10b-5."

The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a             microcap market manipulation case involving the securities             of Alter Sales Co., Inc. (ASI), a Florida distributor of             automotive parts and accessories.  Named as defendants are             Marc A.

The Complaint seeks orders             permanently enjoining all the defendants from violations of             Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933;             permanently enjoining Osheroff, Gesser, Mitchell and Vittor             from violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of             1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of             1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and requiring the defendants             to disgorge their illegal profits, together with prejudgment             interest, and to pay civil penalties.  Finally the Complaint             seeks an order barring Osheroff from acting as an officer or             director of a public company.                  Specifically, the Complaint alleges:                  \x07From April 1993 through January 1994, Osheroff, acting                     in concert with some or all of the other defendants,                     engaged in a fraudulent scheme to distribute four                     million shares of ASI stock -- a 200% increase in                     the shares outstanding -- without registration.  The                     distribution purportedly was effected pursuant to                     the Commission\s Regulation S.  The shares were                     issued at discounts ranging from 40% to 85% from the                     market price on the day of issuance, and payment was                     not made until after the shares were resold in the                     United States.                  \x07The distribution included three million unregistered                     shares that were issued in the name of one Martin                     Clainey (Clainey), a fictitious foreign investor.                     Within days or weeks after they were issued, most of                     the shares were deposited into new U.S. brokerage                     accounts that Osheroff and Gesser arranged to open                     in Clainey\s name, and sold at prevailing market                     prices.  Another one million shares were issued to                                        - 2 -                  \x07  Bauman, S.A., a newly-formed Bahamian entity.   The                     majority of these shares likewise were soon resold                     in the United States at market  prices.  The resale                     of those shares yielded illegal profits of more than                     $6.5 million.                  \x07To increase the price of ASI stock while the                     distribution was underway, Osheroff and Gesser                     caused the company to issue a series of false press                     releases calculated to generate investor interest in                     the stock.  Those releases announced interest by                     foreign firms in acquiring the company or making a                     large investment in it.  The entities purportedly                     interested in making the acquisitions did not exist.                  \x07Vittor, who knew or was reckless in not knowing that                     Clainey was a fictitious person, was the broker for                     two of the accounts in Clainey\s name. He also was                     the broker on the Bauman account. He sold ASI shares                     through those accounts as part of a scheme to enrich                     his codefendants or others.                  \x07Maschler was the broker for an account in Clainey\s                     name at Datek Securities Corp.  He sold the shares                     deposited in that account without making an adequate                     inquiry to determine whether the sales were in                     violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act.                  \x07Mitchell deposited some of the Clainey shares into his                     personal   brokerage  account  and  sold  them.   To                     facilitate the  sales,  Mitchell falsely represented                     to his broker that he had  bought the ASI stock in a                     private transaction with another  investor, and that                     he had no affiliation with ASI.                  The Commission thanks the National Association of             Securities Dealers Regulation Inc. for the substantial             assistance it provided in connection with the investigation             leading to this action."

DIRECT PARTICIPATION          SERVICES, INC. dba GOVERNMENT FINANCIAL, JEFFREY A. LOBEL, WILLIAM          ROSSI, UNITED AVALON GROUP, LTD. and FRANK M. NAFT,          Civil Action No. 96-6594 LGB (Mcx) (C.D. Cal.)               The Commission announced that on April 14, 1998, the          Honorable Lourdes G. Baird, United States District Court Judge          for the Central District of California, signed a judgment which          permanently enjoined Jeffrey A. Lobel (Lobel) from future          violations of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of          1933 (the Securities Act), the registration provisions, and          Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the          Securities Exchange Act of 1934, (the Exchange Act), and Rule          10b-5 thereunder, the anti-fraud provisions.  The Complaint          alleged that from approximately July 1, 1993 to May 15, 1995,          Lobel and others fraudulently offered and sold nine-month          promissory notes (Notes) issued by Direct Participation          Services, Inc. d/b/a Government Financial (GF), raising about          $26 million from approximately 750 investors.               The Complaint alleged that approximately $3.4 million of          investor proceeds were used for undisclosed purposes, primarily          to promote and finance personal business interests of Lobel and          others.  The Complaint further alleged that Lobel and others          deceived investors into believing that GF would only purchase          accounts receivable which were owed by government agencies or          insured by an A+ rated insurance carrier.  In fact, according to          the Complaint, GF grossly overstated the extent of government          receivables purchased and failed to obtain the promised          insurance.               GF\s offering materials additionally provided that a trustee          would hold all loan portfolio documents, receive assignments of          all assets purchased by GF, receive all payments from GF\s          account debtors, and enforce the Noteholders\ security interest          in purchased accounts receivable.  However, the Complaint alleged          that the trustee failed to discharge these duties.  Instead, the          Complaint alleged that the trustee operated as a mere disbursing          agent, with Lobel\s knowledge.  As a result of the above-          described failure to operate GF in the manner represented, the          Note program evolved into a ponzi-like scheme since, according to          the Complaint, investors were repaid using funds of subsequent          investors.               In addition, the Complaint alleged that, at the time the Notes          were offered and sold, no registration statement covering the Notes          had been filed or was in effect.  Instead, the Notes were sold in          purported reliance upon the registration exemption set forth in          Section 3(a)(3) of the Securities Act.  That exemption was          unavailable, however, because the Notes were:  (1) not prime quality          negotiable commercial paper; (2) offered and sold to the general          public; and (3) not issued to facilitate well recognized types of          current operational business requirements.               In a related action, the Commission issued an Order on April          22, 1998, instituting administrative proceedings against Lobel.          Lobel simultaneously consented to the entry of the Order barring          him from association with any broker, dealer, municipal          securities dealer, investment adviser or investment company, with          the right to reapply, after a period of five years."

15736,1998,,"b                          SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION                                   Washington, D.C.     Litigation Release No.  15736  / May 12, 1998     Securities and Exchange Commission v. Brad E. Hollinger, Civil Action No.     98 CV 1187 (D.C.D.C.)     The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed an insider trading     action against Brad E. Hollinger, a former senior vice president of     Continental Medical Systems, Inc. (CMS).  The complaint alleges as follows:      In March 1995, through his position as an officer of CMS, Hollinger     obtained material, inside information concerning Horizon Healthcare     Corporation s imminent plans to acquire CMS.  While in possession of this     information, Hollinger directed and caused the purchase, on March 30, 1995,     of 5,000 shares of CMS common stock through a family member s brokerage     accounts.  The following day, CMS and Horizon publicly announced the     execution of a definitive merger agreement in which Horizon agreed to     acquire CMS.  By engaging in the above conduct, Hollinger violated Section     10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated     thereunder.            Simultaneously with the commencement of this enforcement action,     Hollinger consented, without admitting or denying the allegations in the     complaint, to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from     violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5.  In settlement,     Hollinger agreed to pay $49,719.76, representing disgorgement of the     trading profits of $21,625, prejudgment interest of $6,469.76, and a civil     penalty of $21,625.                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\x0c"
15737,1998,,"b     SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION     Washington, D.C.     Litigation Release No.  15737 / May 14, 1998     SEC v. THE BETTER LIFE CLUB OF AMERICA, INC., and ROBERT N. TAYLOR, United     States District Court for the District of Columbia, Civ. No. 95-1679 (TFH);     MICHAEL MISSAL, Receiver, v. JAMES E. WASHINGTON et al., United States     District Court for the District of Columbia, Civ. No. 97-982 (TFH).     The United States District Court for the District of Columbia has granted     summary judgment to Michael J. Missal, the court-appointed receiver for the     Better Life Club of America, Inc., in his lawsuit against James Washington,     Jacob Haynes, Dreams Unlimited, and Concepts Unlimited (the  Dreams     Defendants ).  Judge Thomas F. Hogan ordered the Dreams Defendants to pay     to the receiver all of the profits they made from investing in the Better     Life Club  Advertising Pool,  a Ponzi scheme in which thousands of     investors lost more than $26 million.  Judge Hogan found that these     defendants received at least $2.7 million.  All of the moneys recovered     will be added to the pool of funds that will be distributed to the victims     of the Better Life Club Ponzi scheme.  Not including the amounts to be     repaid by the Dreams Defendants and others who have been ordered to     disgorge investor funds, that pool currently contains approximately $2.4     million.     In his decision, which was issued on April 17, 1998, Judge Hogan found that     the Dreams Defendants, on behalf of themselves and their family and     friends, invested more than $5 million in the Better Life Club  Advertising     Pool  from February 1994 through August 1995.  Although the Better Life     Club promised to pay the Dreams Defendants a 100 percent return in 60 days,     they promised their own investors a 50 percent return in 75 days.  The     Court found that the Dreams Defendants received a total of at least     $7.7 million from the  Advertising Pool,  for a profit of at least $2.7     million.  Noting that the Dreams Defendants themselves had stated in court     filings that their profits were nearly $3.3 million, Judge Hogan ordered     further briefing to determine the precise amount that they will be required     to disgorge.     The legal basis of Judge Hogan s ruling was the District of Columbia     Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act, which prohibits transfers by a debtor with     the intent to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors.  The Court ruled that,     because a Ponzi scheme is, by definition, unable to repay all its     creditors, any transfer from the scheme to a creditor is necessarily made     with the intent to hinder the rights of other creditors.  Judge Hogan also     refused to give the Dreams Defendants a set-off for the amounts they paid     to their own investors.     The receiver filed his action against the Dreams Defendants on May 8, 1997.      See SEC Lit. Rel. No. 15362 (May 12, 1997).  The Commission filed its     underlying action against the Better Life Club and its founder, Robert N.     Taylor, on September 1, 1995.  Judge Hogan granted the Commission s motion                              ======END OF PAGE 1======     for summary judgment in that action on February 27, 1998.  See SEC Lit.     Rel. No. 15660 (March 5, 1998).  Robert Taylor pled guilty to criminal     contempt and wire fraud on July 22, 1996, and is currently serving a 41-     month prison term in a federal correctional institution in Petersburg,     Virginia.

15738,1998,,"b     U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION     Litigation Release No.   15738  / May 14, 1998     Accounting and Auditing Enforcement     Release No.  1035 / May 14, 1998     SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION v. PAUL R. SAFRONCHIK, JEROME A. ADAMO,     and DOUGLAS A. ROY, Civil Action No. SACV 98-416-LHM  (EEx) (C.D. Cal)     On May 13, 1998, the Securities and Exchange Commission sued three former     officers of an Orange County company in federal court in Santa Ana,     California, charging them with fraud and insider trading.  The company,     Home Theater Products International, Inc. ( HTPI ), which is now in     bankruptcy, was headquartered in Anaheim, California and had manufactured     and sold home theater systems under a license from Paramount Pictures, a     movie studio in Hollywood, California.  The Commission alleged that two of     the officers, Paul R. Safronchik, HTPI s chairman and chief executive     officer, and Douglas A. Roy, the company s controller, falsified HTPI s     books and records and inflated the company s sales and income.  The     Commission further alleged that Safronchik and Jerome A. Adamo, the     president and chief operating officer, caused HTPI to release to the public     phony financial statements.  Additionally, the Complaint alleged all three     officers committed insider trading by selling HTPI stock with knowledge     that the company s financial statements were false.     The Commission s lawsuit alleges that, from 1993 until October 1995,     Safronchik and Roy falsified sales in HTPI s books and records.      Additionally, in an effort to conceal the fraud from the company s auditor,     Safronchik rented postal boxes throughout the southwestern United States     and used them as mail drops to send and receive bogus audit confirmations     of the company s phony sales.  The Complaint also alleged that Safronchik     fraudulently signed the audit confirmations falsely confirming the phony     sales and returned them to the auditor.       The Commission s Complaint charged Safronchik with violations of  Sections     5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 ( Securities Act ),     Sections 10(b),  13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B) and 13(b)(5) of the     Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act ) and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20,     13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2, thereunder.  Adamo was charged     with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act,     Sections 10(b) and 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20,     13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13 and 13b2-2, thereunder.  Roy was charged with     violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b) and     13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2,     thereunder.  Simultaneously with the filing of the Complaint, Safronchik,      Adamo and Roy consented, without admitting or denying the allegations in      the Complaint, to final judgments of permanent injunction ordering them to pay     disgorgement but waiving payment of disgorgement based upon their demonstrated     inability to pay.  Safronchik and Adamo were also barred from serving as officers      or directors of any public company.  United States v. Paul R. Safronchik,      Jerome A. Adamo, and Douglas A.

On February 4, 1998, Adamo pleaded guilty      to insider trading and was sentenced to serve six months of home detention, two      years probation and to pay a $50,000 fine.  On September 15, 1997, Roy pleaded      guilty to conspiracy to commit securities fraud.

15739,1998,,"b     UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION     LITIGATION RELEASE NO. 15739 / May 14, 1998     SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION V.  PAUL J. MONTLE, LS CAPITAL     CORPORATION, PAUL V. CULOTTA, CAROL C. MARTINO, CMA NOEL, LTD., MARIO J.     IACOVIELLO, ILAN ARBEL, AND EUROPE AMERICAN CAPITAL CORPORATION,  98-CIV-     3446 (MP) (S.D.N.Y)     The Securities and Exchange Commission announced the filing of a complaint     on May 14, 1998 in the United States District Court for the Southern     District of New York, alleging fraud and other violations of the securities     laws concerning three public companies, Viral Testing Systems, Inc.     ( VTS ); LS Capital Corporation ( Lone Star ); and RMS Titanic, Inc.     ( Titanic ).  Named as defendants were:     Paul J. Montle, 50, a resident of Katy, Texas, who is Lone Star s CEO,     Chairman of the Board, and President, was at one time VTS  CEO and     President, and was a promoter for Titanic;     Paul V. Culotta, 49, a resident of Houston, Texas, who was at one time an     officer of each of Lone Star, VTS, and Titanic;     Carol Martino, 39, a resident of Palm Beach, Florida;      CMA Noel, a New York corporation owned and controlled by Martino;      Ilan Arbel, 45, a resident of New York, New York;     Europe American Capital Corp., a British Virgin Islands corporation     controlled by Arbel;     Mario Iacoviello, 41, a resident of Chicago, Illinois; and     Lone Star, a publicly traded company whose stock is traded on the over-the-     counter bulletin board.     The Commissions Complaint alleges as follows regarding the three     corporations:            VTS:   VTS, whose stock traded on the American Stock Exchange, was in the     business of selling an HIV test kit.  From December 1992 through at least     June 1993, Montle knowingly or recklessly made materially false and     misleading statements regarding VTS  past sales of the test kit and made     projections regarding VTS  future performance without any reasonable basis     for making those projections.     LONE STAR:  During the relevant time period, Lone Star was in the business     of developing casinos.  Its stock trades on the over-the-counter bulletin     board.  From February through June 1993, Montle and Culotta made a series     of misstatements and omissions in Lone Star s registration statement and in                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\x0c     VTS  and Lone Star s public filings regarding the ownership of Lone Star at     the time VTS spun off Lone Star by failing to disclose sales of stock     pursuant to Regulation S, including the sales in January 1993 of 1 million     shares to entities Arbel controlled, and falsely representing that Lone     Star was a wholly-owned subsidiary of VTS prior to the spin-off.  The     shares Arbel purchased in January 1993, coupled with shares he received at     the time of the spin-off meant that Arbel owned more than 10% of Lone     Star s outstanding stock in May 1993.  Arbel never made the required     filings with the Commission regarding his share ownership.  Lone Star first     disclosed that it had made sales pursuant to Regulation S in its Form 10-Q     filed on June 4, 1993, but falsely represented that all those sales     occurred after the spin-off.  Between May and December 1993, Arbel sold     approximately 1.4 million shares of Lone Star stock into the United States     market without that stock being registered or there being an exemption from     registration.     TITANIC:  Titanic s stock trades in the over-the-counter market.  During     the relevant time period, Titanic was engaged in conducting salvage     operations and exhibitions concerning the RMS Titanic.  Martino and Montle     engaged in a scheme to manipulate the price of Titanic stock from May     through July 1993.  They did so by, among other things, controlling the     initial supply of stock and agreeing to restrict the supply; protecting the     initial market maker from substantial loss; and by compensating brokers     with money or inexpensive stock to generate artificial demand for Titanic     stock.  One of those brokers, Iacoviello, failed to disclose to clients to     whom he recommended Titanic stock that he was being compensated for making     the recommendation.     For all of the Issuers, Martino, who previously had been barred from     associating with a broker-dealer, both personally and through her company     CMA Noel, acted as an unregistered broker-dealer.           As a result of the conduct described above (1) Montle, Culotta, Martino,     Iacoviello, and Lone Star violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of     1933 ( Securities Act ), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of     1934 ( Exchange Act ) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; (2) Montle and Culotta, as     controlling persons pursuant to Section 20 of the Exchange Act are liable     for VTS  violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2) of the Exchange Act and     Rules 13a-1, 13a-13 and 12b-20; (3) Montle and Culotta violated Section     13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1; (4) Arbel and Europe American     violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act and Sections 13(d)     and 16(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13d-1, 16a-2, and 16a-3 thereunder;     (5) Martino and CMA Noel violated Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act; and     (6) Martino violated Section 15(b)(6)(B)(i) of the Exchange Act and the     prior Commission bar order against her.           The Commission seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-     gotten gains, civil money penalties, an order barring Montle from positions     as an officer or director of public companies, and other relief.     Simultaneously with the filing of the Complaint, the Commission filed     judgments on consent against Arbel and Europe American.  Without admitting                              ======END OF PAGE 2======\x0c     or denying the allegations of the Complaint, Arbel and Europe American     consented to (1) permanent injunctions against violating Sections 5(a) and     5(c) of the Securities Act and Sections 13(d) and 16(a) of the Exchange Act     and Rules 13d-1, 16a-2, and 16a-3 thereunder; (2) a joint and several     disgorgement obligation of $218,118 plus prejudgment interest.  Arbel also     consented to pay a penalty of $100,000 pursuant to Sections 20(d) of the     Securities Act and 21(d)(3) of the Exchange Act.                               ======END OF PAGE 3======\x0c"

(Nichi), Wise Choice Discount Brokerage, Inc. (Wise     Choice), and Nichi\s President, Oluwande A. Agunloye (Agunloye), and two     registered representatives of Wise Choice, Ralph Anteby and Brian Walfish     (collectively the Defendants) from violating the antifraud provisions and     registration provisions of the federal securities laws; (2) continues the     previously ordered freeze of the assets of Agunloye, Wise Choice and Nichi;     and (3) requires each of the Defendants to provide an accounting.            In its Complaint, filed March 27, 1998, the Commission alleges that     since October 1997, the defendants have induced over $200,000 in     investments in Nichi securities by misrepresenting to investors that an IPO     of Nichi stock was about to take place, that their shares would rise     greatly in value after the company went public, and that their money would     be placed in an escrow account until the IPO took place.  The Commission     alleges that those statements were false and misleading because, while     Nichi had filed a registration statement for an initial public offering of     its stock, the IPO was not expected to take place in the near future; no     escrow account for the IPO funds was ever established; and the investors\     money was used by Agunloye, at least in part, in connection with his     acquisition of an equity interest in relief defendant Strategic Risk     Management, Inc.          The Commission seeks a final judgment permanently enjoining the     defendants from further violations of Sections 5(a) and 17(a) of the     Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of     1934, and Rules 10b-5 and 10b-9 promulgated thereunder; and ordering them     to disgorge their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and to pay     civil penalties.  The Commission also seeks an order requiring Strategic to     account for and disgorge an amount equal to the funds it improperly     obtained from the defendants.

LEMON (Defendants) and REBECCA W. ERDMAN AND LESLIE CHEKIN (Relief     Defendants) (United States District Court for the District of Southern     Florida, Civil Action No. 98-6500-Civ-Moore).     The Securities and Exchange Commission ( Commission ) announced today that     it filed a civil action in the United States District Court for the     District of Southern Florida against Phebe W. Erdman ( P. Erdman ) of     Greensboro, North Carolina, Hans L. Erdman ( H. Erdman ) of Blaine,     Minnesota, and David M. Lemon ( Lemon ) of Marietta, Georgia as defendants,     and Rebecca W. Erdman ( R. Erdman ) of Greensboro, North Carolina and     Leslie Chekin ( Chekin ) of Springfield, Virginia, as relief defendants,     for their participation in a fraudulent, unregistered offering of     securities.  The Commission s Complaint alleges that P. Erdman, H. Erdman,     R. Erdman, and Chekin received $240,000 by selling approximately 370,000     shares of stock in a worthless shell company, International Trade &     Commerce Corp. ( ITC ) to 40 investors, many of whom were residents of     Southern Florida.  Defendants P. Erdman, H. Erdman and Lemon solicited     investors by misrepresenting that ITC would acquire other businesses,     realize substantial revenues and finance acquisitions through a public     offering of stock.  The Complaint alleges that P. Erdman and H. Erdman     violated the registration provisions of the federal securities laws, and P.     Erdman, H. Erdman and Lemon violated the antifraud provisions.  The     Complaint also alleges that relief defendants R. Erdman and Chekin were     unjustly enriched by the proceeds of fraudulent, unregistered sales of ITC     stock and therefore should be required to return such proceeds to     investors.     The Complaint alleges that since approximately 1988, ITC was controlled by     Ellis E. Erdman, the former husband of P. Erdman and the father of H.     Erdman, R. Erdman and Chekin.  Between February and August 1993, the     defendants solicited investors to purchase ITC stock by misrepresenting     that ITC was acquiring 100 insurance agencies and planning to conduct a     public offering of its stock.  The defendants predicted $100 million is     sales and over $17 million in earnings in the coming year.  The defendants     failed to disclose that ITC was a shell company with no assets or     operations and did not have the financial resources to acquire other     businesses or conduct a public offering.           In its Complaint, the Commission asks the Court to enter permanent     injunctions against P. Erdman and H. Erdman, prohibiting them from future     violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933     and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5     thereunder, and against Lemon, prohibiting him from future violations of     Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and     Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Complaint requests that the Court impose civil     monetary penalties against the defendants.  The Complaint also seeks                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\x0c     disgorgement, plus prejudgment interest, from P. Erdman, H. Erdman, R.     Erdman and Chekin of the proceeds they received from selling their     worthless, unregistered ITC stock.     On April 24, 1998, the Commission instituted separate public administrative     proceedings against David T. Barr, the branch manager of the Ithaca, New     York Advest office through which the Erdmans sold their stock.  These     proceedings were instituted to determine whether Barr violated the     registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws by     selling the Erdmans  stock and distributing fraudulent promotional     material.

D ALESSIO, United States DistrictCourt for the Southern District of New York, 98 Civ. 1366 (JSR) (S.D.N.Y.)The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed an amended complaint inits federal civil enforcement action against five of the eight New YorkStock Exchange ( NYSE ) floor brokers originally charged on February 25,1998 with illegal trading on the floor of the NYSE.  The amended complaintadds charges of trading ahead of customer orders in violation of theantifraud provisions against Thomas J. Cavallino ( Cavallino ), Robert J.Carucci ( Carucci ), Christine A. Beyer ( Beyer ), Michael A. Frayler( Frayler ), John J. Savarese ( J. Savarese ), and their firms, R.M.Carucci, Inc., Touchdown Securities, Inc., MFS Securities Corp. and OakwoodSecurities Corp.  The amended complaint also adds charges that each ofthese five defendants, and Mark R. Savarese ( M. Savarese ), traded intotheir customers  orders in violation of a NYSE rule.The amended complaint charges that Cavallino, Carucci, Beyer, Frayler, J.Savarese, R.M. Carucci, Inc., Touchdown Securities, Inc., MFS SecuritiesCorp. and Oakwood Securities Corp., engaged in a pattern of initiating andexecuting transactions for their own accounts while holding unexecutedcustomer orders for the same securities, often receiving a better price forthemselves than they obtained for their customers.  The amended complaintalso charges that these defendants and M. Savarese, a floor broker who wascharged in the original complaint, filled customer orders by purchasingstock from, or selling stock to, their customers from their Oakfordaccounts in violation of a NYSE rule.As set forth in the amended complaint, floor brokers owe a duty to theircustomers to act in the customers  best interest.  A floor broker breachesthis duty when he executes his own trade before the customers trade.  Byexecuting his own trade first, the floor broker runs the risk that theprice obtained for the customers order may not be as favorable as it wouldhave been had the customers order been executed first.  Moreover, a largecustomer order to buy or sell a security will often result in an increaseor decrease, respectively, in the price of that security followingexecution of the order.  With this knowledge, a floor broker could receivea large customer order and, before executing the customer order, purchaseor sell shares of the same security for his own account, thereby benefitingfrom the price movement that follows execution of the customers order. This practice is commonly known as frontrunning.  Floor brokers are alsoprohibited from filling a customer order by purchasing securities from, orselling securities to, that customer from the floor brokers own account.                               ======END OF PAGE 1======\x0cSuch a practice would place the floor broker in the capacity of aprincipal, a position inconsistent with the duty owed by floor brokers asagents of their customers.  These practices are prohibited by the federalsecurities laws and a variety of NYSE rules.The Commission s original complaint alleged that William S. Killeen( Killeen ) and Thomas W. Bock ( Bock ), principals of the defendantOakford Corporation ( Oakford ), entered into unlawful profit sharingarrangements with the defendant floor brokers. Pursuant to thesearrangements, Bock and Killeen opened accounts at Oakford and falselyidentified the accounts as Oakford proprietary trading accounts.  TheseOakford accounts were, in fact, controlled by the floor brokers.  Duringthe day, as they learned of potentially advantageous trading opportunitiesfrom their unique positions on the floor of the NYSE, the floor brokersinitiated transactions in the Oakford accounts.  The floor brokers and Bockand Killeen generally split the profits and losses in the Oakford accounts70/30 - 70% to the floor brokers and 30% to Oakford. The federal securitieslaws and a variety of NYSE rules prohibit floor brokers from trading fortheir own account while they are on the floor of the exchange.  The amendedcomplaint does not add new charges against Killeen, Bock and Oakford,however, the original allegations remain pending and are incorporated inthe amended complaint.Between October 1993 and December 1996, the Floor Brokers netted illegalprofits totaling at least $11.1 million, with the floor brokers receivingapproximately $8.8 million and Oakford receiving approximately $2.3million.  In order to conceal their scheme, the defendants deliberatelyfalsified various books and records.The Commission s amended complaint adds charges that the five floor brokersnoted above, and their firms, violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Actof 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and NYSE Rule 92.  The complaint also charges these floorbrokers and Mark R. Savarese with violating NYSE Rule 91.  The complaintfurther charges the defendants with violating, or aiding and abettingviolations of, Sections 11(a) and 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of1934 and Rules 11a-1, 17a-3 and 17a-5 thereunder and NYSE Rules 90(a),95(a) and 111(a), as set forth in the amended complaint.

The Complaint filed on May 5, 1998 in the United     States District Court for the Middle District of Florida names the     infomercial creator, Richard Carlos Powelson, who lives in Kansas City,     Missouri, and two salesmen, Roger Frederick Kline, and Bryan Paul     Shortsleeve, who live in St. Petersburg, Florida with violating the federal     securities laws by making false statements while selling to elderly clients     investments in an infomercial created by Powelson to sell his real estate     training program that is titled How to Build a Fortune.  The scheme     raised $1,096,000 from fifteen investors, the majority of whom live in the     St. Petersburg, Florida area and the remainder live in Potage and Walled     Lake, Michigan and Winona, Minnesota.          The Complaint alleges that Powelson, Kline and Shortsleeve gave     investors sales materials that falsely represented investors would receive     150 percent return on their investment within six to nine months based on     sales of 300,000 of Powelson\s real estate training programs; however,     Powelson had no reasonable basis for these projected sales and earnings,     because he had never previously produced an infomercial.  He had only     appeared as a speaker in earlier infomercials.                 The Complaint also alleges that the sales materials failed to disclose     that Powelson filed personal bankruptcy in 1990 and had been barred from     participating in real estate transactions with the Department of Housing     and Urban Development.            Additionally, the Complaint alleges that the sales materials     represented that only five percent of the money raised would be spent on     marketing, when in fact, Kline and Shortsleeve received commissions of     twenty percent which were not disclosed to investors.

The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that on May,     18, 1998, the Honorable James Ware, United States District Judge, entered     Final Judgments against defendants Mary Ann Shank, Kenneth R. Roop, and     Donald M. Schwartz.  Each of the defendants consented to the entry of the     Final Judgments without admitting or denying the allegations contained in     the Commissions Complaint.  The entry of the Final Judgments ends the     Commission s case concerning insider trading in Affymax N.V. stock as to     all defendants.          The Final Judgment as to Shank (i) permanently restrains and enjoins     her from committing future violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the     federal securities laws and (ii) orders her to pay disgorgement in the     amount of $147,500, which represents the gains of another individual who     traded in Affymax N.V. stock, plus pre-judgment interest thereon in the     amount of $32,721, but waives payment of such amounts based upon Shanks     demonstrated inability to pay.  Neither Shank nor Roop themselves bought or     sold any Affymax securities.          The Final Judgment as to Roop (i) permanently restrains and enjoins     him from committing future violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the     federal securities laws and (ii) orders him to pay disgorgement in the     amount of $151,100, plus pre-judgment interest thereon in the amount of     $33,520, but waives payment of such amounts based upon Roops demonstrated     inability to pay.

The Commissions Complaint, which was filed on September 12, 1996,     alleged that Shank passed material, nonpublic information relating to a     proposed tender offer for Affymax stock, which she obtained while working     on the transaction as an executive assistant to the general counsel of an     Affymax subsidiary, to Roop, and to her mother.  According to the     Complaint, Roop tipped his brother-in-law, who was the subject of a     separate Commission action, and a friend and business associate, defendant     Donald Schwartz, who in turn allegedly passed information relating to the     tender offer to a close friend of his.  The Commission alleged that by     engaging in such conduct, the defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 14(e)     of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3     thereunder.                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\x0c          The Commissions investigation of trading in Affymax securities is     continuing.

On April     14, 1998, the Commission filed a complaint alleging as follows:  Stewart     along with four other individuals and five related entities fraudulently     obtained more than $1.7 million, from at least three individuals, by     offering and selling securities in the form of participations in investment     programs purportedly to trade  prime bank  instruments.  The investment     programs were scams, the instruments themselves bogus.  Instead of using     the money as promised, Stewart and the other defendants misappropriated the     investors  funds for their own benefit, transferring portions of the money     to at least one individual and three entities, who were named as relief     defendants.  By participating in this fraudulent investment scheme, Stewart     and the other defendants violated the antifraud provisions of the federal     securities laws.     Stewart consented, without admitting or denying the allegations in the     complaint, to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently prohibits     him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section     10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.      The final judgment waives disgorgement and civil money penalties were not     imposed against Stewart based on his demonstrated inability to pay.

SHILLING (United States     District Court for the District of New Hampshire, Civ. No. 98-CV329-B)          The Commission announced, on May 21, 1998, the filing of a Complaint     alleging that Terry S. Shilling ( Shilling ), a former Healthsource, Inc.     ( Healthsource ) executive and a resident of Marietta, Georgia, engaged in     unlawful insider trading in the common stock of Healthsource.  According to     the Complaint, on February 19, 1997, a Healthsource executive called     Shilling and informed him, in a confidential briefing, that Healthsource     was negotiating with both CIGNA Corporation ( CIGNA ) and another company     regarding a business combination.  The Complaint alleges that the     Healthsource executive also told Shilling that Healthsource was conducting     a mini-auction and that the matter could be decided by the end of the     following week.  The Complaint also alleges that the Healthsource executive     emphasized the confidential and privileged nature of the information.      According to the Complaint, on February 20, 1997, after his conversations     with the Healthsource executive, Shilling bought 1,900 shares of     Healthsource common stock for $15-1/8 per share. The Complaint further     alleges that Shilling did not preclear his February 20, 1997 trade as     required by Healthsource s procedures and that, had he done so, he would     not have received approval for this trade.  On February 28, 1997,     Healthsource and CIGNA announced an agreement to merge the two companies,     with a premium payable to Healthsource shareholders and with CIGNA as the     surviving entity.  The Complaint alleges that, by purchasing Healthsource     shares on February 20, in advance of the February 28, 1997 merger     announcement and for $5-3/4 per share less than the post-announcement     closing price, Shilling realized unlawful trading profits of $10,761.78.

The indictment also charges Weeks and Hesterman with making similar     false statements in PanWorld s 1992 annual report filed with the SEC about     Las Rosas and failing to disclose that the Europa Mill, which processed ore     from the mine, had been repossessed.  The indictment also charges Weeks and     Hesterman with making false statements in PanWorld s March 1993 quarterly     report with the SEC by including the Washington Gulch placer mine located     in Montana as an asset worth approximately $5.5 million, when in fact the     company did not own Washington Gulch.  Weeks and Hesterman also failed to     disclose Hesterman s 1984 criminal conviction for securities fraud.                                                   ======END OF PAGE 1======\x0c"

Carroll, Civil Action      No. 3:98-CV-1215-H (USDC ND TX).     The Commission announced that on May 22, 1998, it filed a complaint seeking     preliminary and permanent injunctions and an immediate asset freeze against     Edward Snyder, of San Diego, California and Robert E. Carroll, of Keswick,     Virginia, alleging the defendants had violated Section 17 (a) of the     Securities Act and Section 10 (b) of the Exchange Act and Rule l0b-5     thereunder.     The complaint alleges that from October 1997 to March 1998, Snyder and     Carroll sold securities in the form of investment contracts to investors,     telling those investors that Carroll would invest their money in a prime     bank investment program which would yield returns of from 17% to 100% per     month for periods of up to five years.  The complaint further alleges that     none of these funds obtained from investors were invested in such a     program.  It is alleged that, instead, investor funds were deposited in a     brokerage account maintained by Carroll and used to purchase shares in a     money market fund and to pay Carroll s personal expenses.     On May 22, 1998, the Honorable Barefoot Sanders, United States District     Judge for the Northern District of Texas, issued an order freezing the     assets of Snyder and Carroll.  Judge Sanders also scheduled a court date of     June 1, 1998, for a hearing on the Commissions motion for preliminary     injunction.                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\x0c"

WALTER CLARENCE BUSBY,     Civil Action No. 1: 97-CV-2653 (N.D. Ga.)          The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on May 1, 1998,     the Honorable Thomas W. Thrash, United States District Judge for the     Northern District of Georgia, entered an order of permanent injunction and     other relief against Walter Clarence Busby (Busby).  The order     permanently enjoins Busby from future violations of Section 17(a) of the     Securities Act of 1993 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of     1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Busby was ordered to pay disgorgement in     the amount of $15,000 representing the gains he received from sales of     interests in three prime bank schemes, along with prejudgment interest     thereon. Payment of the disgorgement and prejudgment interest was waived     based upon Busby s sworn financial statement which indicate an inability to     pay the ordered amounts.                 Busby consented to the relief without admitting or denying the     allegations set forth in a complaint, filed by the Commission on September     11, 1997.  In its complaint, the Commission alleged that Busby violated the     antifraud provisions of the securities laws by offering and selling     investment contracts in connection with three different prime bank schemes.      Using misrepresentations and omissions in each of the three schemes, Busby     raised money for purported trading programs in prime bank notes by     fraudulently representing to investors that the investments were risk-free     and that the ventures would pay returns ranging from 750% to 10,000%.  In     total, Busby raised nearly $1 million from more than 70 investors.  None of     the investors earned the exorbitant returns promised by Busby.                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\x0c"

The orders further require the defendants to provide an     accounting of all monies and other assets received from investors or from     the other defendants, and orders them to return to identified accounts in     the United States of America all monies and liquid assets in their names,     or under their control, outside the Court s jurisdiction. Previously, on     May 19, 1998, the Court appointed a receiver to take control of the     defendants  assets for the benefit of investors.           In its complaint, the Commission alleged that the defendants violated     Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the     Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, in the offer     and sale of promissory notes and investment contracts ostensibly secured by     secondary deed of trust liens.  The complaint further alleged that     investors were told their investments would earn phenomenal rates of return     ranging from 101 to 273%, depending on the amount invested, and that their     investment was  low risk.   The complaint also alleged that the defendants     engaged in a  Ponzi  scheme whereby monies coming in from new investors     were being used to pay purported high rates of return and/or return of     principal and interest to prior investors.                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\x0c"

The U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of California and the     Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on May 28, 1998, a     federal grand jury in San Diego charged John DAcquisto with 39 counts of     wire fraud and money laundering in connection with a scheme to defraud     investors.  The indictment alleges that DAcquisto raised approximately     $7,000,000 from investors through false, fraudulent and misleading     representations.  The indictment further alleges that DAcquisto     represented that his investment programs would pay investors returns of     five to seven and one-half percent per week and that certain investment     transaction reports sent to investors falsely claimed that the investments     had grown by millions of dollars.  DAcquisto allegedly used some of the     proceeds to purchase a $71,148.17 Porsche, three race horses costing     $530,000; and an escrow payment of $100,000.          In connection with these charges, DAcquisto faces up to five years     imprisonment and a $250,000 fine on each of the 26 counts of wire fraud,     and up to 20 years imprisonment and a $500,000 fine on each of the seven     counts of money laundering.  DAcquisto also faces up to 10 years     imprisonment and a $250,000 fine for each of the six counts of engaging in     monetary transactions in property derived from a specified unlawful     activity.           In September 1995, DAcquisto was enjoined in a civil fraud action     brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission and then subsequently     ordered to pay $7,421,471.27 in disgorgement for his participation in the     same fraudulent scheme.  In a subsequent administrative hearing, the     Commission issued an opinion finding that it was in the public interest to     revoke DAcquistos investment adviser registration and bar him from     further association with any investment adviser.

Strand, United States District Judge for the     District of Arizona, yesterday sentenced Jerry G. Allison ( Allison ), the     former president and 90 percent owner of Qualified Pensions, Inc. ( QPI ),     to a federal prison term of 57 months followed by 36 months of supervised     release, and ordered him to pay restitution of $6,592,706.  Allison was     sentenced pursuant to a criminal information charging him with one count of     wire fraud.  Allison pled guilty on March 10, 1998.          Allison s plea was in connection with the same misconduct as alleged     by the Commission in its emergency civil action filed September 13, 1995.      In that action, the Commission alleged that Allison and QPI defrauded     investors by misappropriating millions of dollars in retirement savings     that were entrusted to QPI by its clients to be maintained in Individual     Retirement Accounts and other retirement savings plans.  In addition to the     conduct charged in the criminal case, the civil complaint also alleged that     Allison and QPI executed securities transactions for their clients without     registering as brokers.  The Commission s action against Allison has been     fully resolved, with the Commission obtaining a permanent injunction, among     other relief, against Allison.  Allison also consented to the entry of a     Commission Order barring him from the securities industry.

The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that a complaint for     injunctive and other relief was filed by the Commission on May 19, 1998, in     the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida     against defendants Titan Petroleum Corp.

Montozzi ( Montozzi ) and Philip Leitner ( Leitner ).  The     complaint seeks to permanently enjoin the defendants from further     violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b)     of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The     Commission also seeks an order requiring accountings by the defendants and     the disgorgement of all ill-gotten gains or unjust enrichment with     prejudgment interest and an order freezing the assets of the defendants.          The Commission s complaint alleges that from April 2, 1997 through     September 24, 1997, Titan and its principals, Montozzi and Leitner,     fraudulently raised at least $654,770 by selling undivided, fractional     working interests in three separate oil and gas well drilling programs to     sixty -five investors.  The complaint alleges, among other things, that the     Titan offering documents  represented that the amount of each investment     was to cover all costs for drilling and completing the particular well in     which it was invested, that Titan failed to disclose to investors that the     amount of money raised in each case was far in excess of the costs it knew     it would incur to drill and complete the well for which the funds were     raised, that investor funds were commingled and used to pay a wide variety     of expenses not provided for in the offering documents, including, large     undisclosed payments to related parties, that two of the wells were drilled     in locations different than those described in the offering documents, and     that the offering documents and telephone script contained false or     misleading statements concerning the success, experience and history of the     company.          The complaint also alleges that subsequent to the Commission s     investigation, the business of Titan was wound down and that Magnum     Petroleum and Magnum Oil were incorporated with Montozzi as a director and     president of both Magnum corporations.  Using offering documents virtually     identical to those used by Titan, Magnum and Montozzi have been offering     and selling undivided, fractional interests in at least one oil and gas     well drilling program.  The complaint alleges, among other things, that     Magnum does not hold the necessary sublease to drill in the location cited     in its offering documents, that Magnum does not disclose that it is                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\x0c     successor to Titan and that Montozzi is president of all three     corporations, that all three of Titan s recent drilling programs failed,     and that Montozzi has a history of cease-and-desist orders entered against     him by state authorities.          On May 20, 1998, the Honorable James Lawrence King, United States     District Judge for the Southern District of Florida, issued a temporary     restraining order against the defendants, restraining them, among other     things, from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and     Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5     thereunder.

The     complaint seeks to permanently enjoin Kotecha from further violations of     Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and to permanently enjoin both     Kotecha and Isaacson from further violations of Section 10(b) of the     Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The Commissions complaint alleges that, during April and May of 1995,     while employed in Home Depots accounting department, Kotecha and Isaacson     learned that the companys financial performance during the first quarter     of its 1995 fiscal year would be disappointing.  Using the information they     received in the course of their work, the defendants opened and closed     positions in call and put options on Home Depots stock shortly before the     companys  public announcement about its disappointing  first quarter     earnings on May 16, 1995.  In addition, Isaacson tipped his father and     brother, who also used the information to open and close positions in put     options on Home Depots stock during the same time period.

Klion, individually and     d/b/a Cen-Tex Alchemy Guild, and Elizabeth Alaniz of  Copperas Cove, Texas.      According to the Commissions complaint, Klion and his fiancee, Alaniz,     raised approximately $2.7 million from at least 1,400 investors in several     states through the offer and sale of  interests in a fraudulent  Pure     Contract Trust  investment program. Klion and Alaniz represented to     investors that their money was pooled and then used to make a variety of     foreign or offshore investments that Klion and Alaniz claimed were not     subject to the jurisdiction of any  Agent or Agency  of the U. S.     Government. The complaint alleges that Klion and Alaniz told investors that     these  secret  investments would generate gross returns of 400% or more,     that virtually all of the investments were guaranteed by  Top 100  banks,     and that the remainder were backed by either unidentified wealthy     individuals or the governments of foreign countries. The complaint further     states that the trading programs do not exist and that, in fact, the     defendants used funds obtained from current investors to pay purported     profits in the form of monthly dividends to prior investors, in an obvious      Ponzi  scheme, and for their own personal expenses, including a $30,000     engagement ring that Klion purchased for Alaniz.           The temporary restraining order entered on June 3, 1998, by Judge     Smith, enjoins Klion and Alaniz from violating the federal securities. and     includes orders freezing the assets of the defendants, requiring the     defendants to surrender their passports and repatriate any funds held at     any bank or financial institution not subject to the jurisdiction of the     Court, and the appointment of a receiver.

The Commission alleges that -- in     connection with two fraudulent schemes to divert securities and funds     totaling approximately $11 million from customer accounts, unclaimed     dividends, stale and outstanding customer and vendor checks, and other     sources at Gruntal -- McCloskey and Meizoso violated antifraud and     corporate recordkeeping provisions of the federal securities laws, and     aided and abetted violations of the broker-dealer recordkeeping provisions     of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying any of the     allegations in the complaint, except as to jurisdiction, McCloskey and     Meizoso each consented to the entry of a final judgment, which the judge     today signed, (1) permanently enjoining him from (a) violating Section     17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the     Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Exchange Act Rules     10b-5 and 13b2-1, and (b) aiding and abetting violations of Section 17(a)     of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 17a-3 and 17a-4; (2) ordering     him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains and losses avoided, plus prejudgment     interest thereon, but waiving such disgorgement, and not imposing a civil     penalty, based on demonstrated inability to pay; and (3) in the case of     Meizoso, barring him from acting as an officer or director of any public     corporation.          The Commission\s complaint alleges that, in the first fraudulent     scheme, beginning in 1984 and continuing until late 1994, McCloskey,     Meizoso, and certain other members of Gruntal senior management opened     securities accounts at Gruntal under fictitious customer names,     intentionally diverted approximately $5 million of customer and other     third-party assets to those accounts, and then transferred the assets to     Gruntal\s profit and loss accounts or used them to make off-books payments     of Gruntal expenses.  In the second scheme, beginning in 1987 and     continuing until late 1994, McCloskey, Meizoso, and one other Gruntal     senior manager (now deceased) embezzled approximately $6 million in     diverted assets.  McCloskey and Meizoso also falsified Gruntal books and     records in order to conceal the diversions.  The Commission further alleges     that McCloskey and Meizoso sold common stock of Gruntal Financial Corp.,     the parent corporation of Gruntal, while in possession of material                              ======END OF PAGE 1======     nonpublic information about the first fraudulent scheme.          As part of the settlements, McCloskey and Meizoso each agreed to     settle a proposed administrative proceeding pursuant to Section 15(b)(6) of     the Exchange Act, to be based on the entry of the injunction, that will bar     him from the securities industry.  The Commission today issued  separate     orders as to  McCloskey and Meizoso instituting the proposed administrative     proceedings, accepting the offers of settlement, and barring McCloskey and     Meizoso from association with any broker, dealer, investment adviser,     investment company, or municipal securities dealer.

FLANNERY     Civil Action No. 98-S-1233 (U.S. Dist.Ct. Colo.)          The Commission today filed an insider trading case against Heidi A.     Flannery, an investor relations consultant residing in Portland, Oregon.      The Commission alleged that, between July and September 1996, Flannery     engaged in illegal insider trading in the securities of three publicly     traded corporations:            \xf9Fischer Imaging Corporation, based in Denver, Colorado,           \xf9TriQuint Semiconductor, Inc., based in Oregon, and           \xf9Southern Pacific Funding Corporation, also based in Oregon.           The complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the     District of Colorado, alleges that Flannery while privately assisting     Fischer Imaging and TriQuint Semiconductor in the preparation of releases     announcing lower than anticipated earnings for the third quarter of 1996,     Flannery sold stock in the two companies.  Flannery avoided losses in the     two stocks totaling $17,731.  The Commission also alleges that in July 1996     Flannery profited by $1,125 from purchasing stock in Southern Pacific     Funding while preparing a release announcing increased income for the     second quarter of 1996.          Without admitting or denying the substantive allegations in the     complaint, Flannery consented to the entry of a judgment permanently     enjoining her from violating antifraud provisions of the federal securities     laws, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the     Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; ordering her to     disgorge profits and losses avoided in the amount of $18,856, together with     prejudgment interest of $3,389, and ordering her to pay a civil penalty of     $18,856.                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\x0c"

Brent Gale, Lucy Gale, Hal Skinner,     and Margarita Skinner, 98 CV 137 (D. Wy.)     The Commission today filed an insider trading action against Brent Gale, a     resident of Cheyenne, Wyoming and a vice president of an EchoStar     Communications Corp. (EchoStar) subsidiary, EchoStar Satellite Corporation.      The complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the District     of Wyoming, alleges that on February 21 and February 24, 1997, Gale     purchased a total of 1250 shares of EchoStar stock at an average price of     $15.77 after learning of a confidential alliance between News Corporation     and EchoStar by virtue of his position.  The complaint alleges that after     the public announcement of the alliance, Gale sold the 1250 shares for     $22.00 per share for illegal profits of $7,782.50.  The complaint also     alleges that Gale informed his wife, Lucy Gale, of the alliance and that     she in turn tipped her sister and brother-in-law, Margarita and Hal     Skinner, who borrowed funds to purchase EchoStar stock and realized     unlawful profits of $5,550.00.     Brent and Lucy Gale and Hal and Margarita Skinner have agreed to consent, without admitting or denying the substantive         allegations in the complaint, to the entry of an order enjoining each of them from future violations of Section 10(b) of the         Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Brent Gale agreed to disgorge $7,782.50, plus prejudgment         interest, and to pay a civil monetary penalty of $7,782.50.  Lucy Gale agreed to pay a civil monetary penalty of $5,550.00.          With respect to Hal and Margarita Skinner, disgorgement was waived and imposition of civil penalties was not sought in light         of their inability to pay.                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\x0c"

SHULL, TERRY L.     SHULL and PATRICK A. COLLINS, Cr. No. 98-10112-MLW (D. MA)           The Commission and the United States Attorney for the District of     Massachusetts announced that on June 3, 1998, Patrick A. Collins, a Boston     area stock promoter, pleaded guilty to one count of securities fraud and     one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud for participating in a     scheme to manipulate the market for Fairmont Resources, Inc. ( Fairmont ),     a Canadian oil and gas company.  Collins, together with the majority     shareholders of Fairmont, Robert Shull, Terry Shull and Leonard Fiessel,     all of British Columbia, Canada, was indicted on April 8, 1998 in a 45-     count indictment which charged the defendants with securities fraud,     conspiracy to commit securities fraud and wire fraud.  Previously, the     Commission had obtained permanent injunctions and orders to pay     disgorgement against Patrick Collins, Leonard Fiessel, Robert Shull, and     five others for their participation in the scheme.      The indictment alleged that after Leonard Fiessel and Robert Shull     purchased a controlling interest in Fairmont, the defendants caused the     price of the stock to increase from $.30 (Canadian) to $3.10 (Canadian) per     share between January and June 1993 by (1) paying kickbacks totaling     $540,000 to stockbrokers in the U.S. for inducing their customers to     purchase more than one million shares of Fairmont stock, (2) creating the     false appearance of an active market in Fairmont stock by buying and     selling large quantities of the stock, including  wash sales  and  cross     trades,  and (3) controlling the timing and pricing of certain transactions     in Fairmont shares to ensure that the stock price would continue to rise.      The indictment also alleged that as a result of their manipulative     activity, Leonard Fiessel, Robert Shull and Terry Shull sold large blocks     of Fairmont stock at a substantial profit.  It further alleged that Collins     received $132,000 in cash and stock in order to promote the sale of     Fairmont to U.S. investors, and that he used some of that money to pay a     Boston area stockbroker for selling Fairmont stock to his clients.     In a complaint filed on August 31, 1994, the Commission alleged that     Patrick Collins, Leonard Fiessel, Colleen Fiessel, Robert Shull and five     U.S. stockbrokers -- Mark Hamel, Robert Raffa, William Cho, Jeffrey     Fernandez, and Michael Murphy -- violated the antifraud and registration     provisions of the federal securities laws.  Final judgments have been     entered against all of the defendants in that action, and they have been     ordered to disgorge over $2 million.

TODT, et. al., 98 Civ. 3980     (JGK) (SDNY) (June 5, 1998)          The Commission today filed a complaint and requested emergency     injunctive relief in an action involving the offer and attempt to sell     forged and fictitious securities.  The complaint, filed in the U.S District     Court for the Southern District of New York, seeks an injunction and other     relief against Daniel T. Todt ( Todt ), Rebecca L. Todt (Rebecca Todt ),     Bay State Trust, Inge Marilyn Perry ( Perry ), H. Wayne Leggett     ( Leggett ), Shmmuel Emmanuel Abijah Quijano (a/k/a HRH Shmmuel Abijah,     a/k/a Sergio Arcineagas) ( Abijah ), Neal Harris ( Harris ), ABE     Investments Group, Inc. ( ABE ) and Jorge Bryson ( Bryson ). The Commission     alleged in its complaint that since at least March 1997, the defendants     have been engaging in a scheme to obtain money through the offer of     fraudulent securities in violation of the antifraud provisions of the     federal securities laws.          The Commission alleged in its complaint that the defendants have been     engaged in continuing offers and attempts to sell at least one fraudulent     bank certificate being represented as issued by the Bank of Tokyo-     Mitsubishi, Ltd. ( Mitsubishi Certificate ).  In fact, the complaint     alleges that the Mitsubishi Certificate is a sham document.  Defendants     Todt, Rebecca Todt, Bay State Trust, Perry, Leggett, Abijah, Harris, ABE     and Bryson are all alleged to be part of a fraudulent scheme to use the     Mitsubishi Certificate to obtain millions of dollars in payments for     themselves, while invoking both  humanitarian  goals and the names of      official  entities, ranging from the Federal Reserve Bank to the United     Nations Security Council, in an effort to make their scheme appear     legitimate.  The purported issuing bank for the Mitsubishi Certificate, as     well as the FBI and the Federal Reserve, among others, have confirmed that     the certificate is a worthless, sham document.  The defendants,     nonetheless, are persisting in their efforts to negotiate the Mitsubishi     Certificate.  Further, the Commission alleged that some of the defendants     possess at least one additional bogus bank certificate which they intend to     sell.          To prevent the defendants from continuing to offer these and other     securities and potentially selling them to investors, the Commission also     requested that the District Court issue a temporary restraining order     against Todt, Rebecca Todt, Bay State Trust, Perry, Abijah, Harris, ABE and     Bryson and an order that the defendants tender the original fraudulent     securities to the Registry of the Court.  In addition to the emergency     relief requested today, the Commission seeks civil injunctions and monetary     penalties against the defendants for violations of Section 17(a) of the     Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\x0c     1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.                              ======END OF PAGE 2======\x0c"
15772,1998,,"b          UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION     Litigation Release No.  15772 / June 9, 1998     SEC V. TED  MONG, S.D. Ohio, C2-96-989, filed September 30, 1996     The Commission announced the entry of an Order of Permanent Injunction and     other Equitable Relief (Order) against Ted E. Mong (Mong).  Mong consented     to the entry of the Order without admitting or denying the allegations of     the Complaint.     In its Complaint, the Commission alleged that Mong, through Liberty Bell Association, Inc.      (Liberty Bell) and McKenzie Matthew, Inc. (McKenzie) raised more than $1.6 million by      selling promissory notes to investors from approximately March 1993 until August 1995.      Mong, the Commission alleged, misrepresented the risk of investing in the promissory notes      sold by Liberty Bell and McKenzie, the return investors would receive and the use of      investor proceeds.  In particular, the Commission alleged that individuals who purchased      promissory notes from Liberty Bell and McKenzie were told that investor funds would be      loaned to successful companies, that investors could earn up to a 230% return on their      investment and that their funds were completely secured by U.S. Government bonds,      government securities and real estate equity.  Instead, the Commission alleged that      Liberty Bell and McKenzie directed investor funds to two struggling companies that used      investor funds for operating capital, while the promised collateral for investor funds did      not exist.  Most of the investors who bought promissory notes from Liberty Bell and      McKenzie lost nearly their entire investment.  The Commission also alleged that Mong sold      these promissory notes to investors without being registered as a broker-dealer in      violation of the registration provisions of the federal securities laws.      On June 1, the Honorable James Graham of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District      of Ohio entered the Order enjoining Mong from future violations of 17(a) of the Securities      Act of 1933, Sections 10(b), 15(a) and 15(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and      Rules 10b-5 and 15c1-2 promulgated thereunder.  The Order also finds disgorgement in the      amount of $186,672.71, plus prejudgment interest, however, payment is waived based on       Mongs demonstrated inability to pay.        Mong currently is serving a 15 to 35 year sentence imposed on him by a Common Pleas Court      in Licking County, Ohio after a jury found Mong guilty of 78 counts of criminal law      violations relating to his raising funds from investors through corporations under his      control, including Liberty Bell and McKenzie.                                      ======END OF PAGE 1======\x0c"

The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that it recently     entered into settlements with Eric Muenster and Mark Muenster, two of the     defendants in its insider trading case arising from the 1988 tender offer     by Grand Metropolitan PLC for The Pillsbury Company.  The Commission s     complaint, filed on September 16, 1992, alleged that both Muenster brothers     violated Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,     and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 promulgated thereunder, by purchasing Pillsbury     call options before the tender offer was publicly announced and while     possessing material nonpublic information about it.  Without admitting or     denying the Commission s allegations, Eric Muenster consented to entry of a     final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating these provisions     of the federal securities laws and orders him to disgorge $42,678.02 in     profits plus prejudgment interest in the amount of $53,889.14.  Also     without admitting or denying the Commission s allegations, Mark Muenster     consented to entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from     violating the same provisions and orders him to disgorge $43,389.39 in     profits plus prejudment interest in the amount of $54,279.03.  Based on     their demonstrated inability to pay, the disgorgement obligations of both     Muensters were waived and no civil monetary penalties were imposed.          The litigation is proceeding against the remaining defendants.          In a related matter, the Commission on June 8, 1998 issued an     administrative order barring Mark Muenster, who was formerly a broker in     New York City, from association with any broker, dealer, investment     company, investment adviser, or municipal securities dealer.  The     Commission s order, to which Mark Muenster consented, was based on entry of     the court s injunction against him.                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\x0c"

Kirk (Kirk), of La Jolla, California, and Pamela J. Vega (Vega),     of Las Vegas, Nevada (collectively, the Defendants).  The Commission     alleges fraud in connection with the purchase or sale of securities issued     by Global, a public company.  The Commission alleges that, from at least     November 1995 through December 1996, Global and certain officers and     directors misrepresented to the public that Global had the right to harvest     certain timber located in the Philippines.  By this misrepresentation,     Global grossly overstated its financial condition.  Further, Global s     accountant and a Global officer made misrepresentations that Global s     accountant was a certified public accountant who performed an audit of     Global s timber rights in accordance with Generally Accepted Auditing     Standards.  The Defendants incorporated these false statements in documents     submitted to market makers, the National Association of Securities Dealers,     and the Commission.  The Commission wishes to acknowledge the assistance of     the Philippine Department of Environment and Natural Resources in this     matter.     The Commission has asked the Court to permanently enjoin the Defendants     from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of     1934 and Commission Rule 10b-5, and impose a civil penalty against Sand,     Garcia, Stevens, Kirk and Vega.  Garcia consented, without admitting or     denying the allegations in the complaint, to the entry of a judgment of     permanent injunction enjoining him from future violations of Section 10(b)     of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and imposing a civil penalty     of $25,000.     The Commission previously obtained a temporary trading suspension of     Global s stock, pursuant to Section 12(k) of the Exchange Act, based on     questions regarding the accuracy of publicly disseminated information     concerning Global s financial condition.

The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on June 8, 1998,     the Honorable Terry J.

Wyatt of Houston to serve     a 15 month sentence and to pay a $20,000 fine for committing perjury in an     insider trading investigation and civil suit brought by the Commission.       Wyatt had previously pled guilty to one count of perjury in response to an     information filed by the United States Attorney for the Central District of     California.          On November 24, 1997, the Commission obtained a Final Judgment against     Wyatt enjoining him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of     the federal securities laws and ordering him to pay disgorgement in the     amount of $50,125.00, representing the amount of losses he and his tippee     avoided from insider trading plus prejudgment interest in the amount of     $8,705.21 and civil penalties in the amount of $209,205.21.          In August 1996, the Commission filed a Complaint against Wyatt,     alleging insider trading in connection with his February 1993 sale of     Chantal Pharmaceutical Corporation stock.  The Complaint alleged that the     sale took place prior to a public announcement by Chantal, on February 25,     1993, that The Upjohn Company had terminated a licensing agreement with     Chantal because tests showed that Chantals Cyoctol compound was not an     effective anti-acne drug.  The Complaint further alleged that Chantals     joint venture with Upjohn was its sole source of income at the time.            The Complaint also alleged that between mid-January 1993 and February     25, 1993, Wyatt, while acting as a consultant to Chantal, became aware of     confidential information concerning Upjohns testing of Cyoctol and sold     10,000 Chantal shares through a brokerage account in the Cayman Islands.      Additionally, the Complaint alleged that Wyatt conveyed this information to     David L. Holewinski, an individual with whom Wyatt maintained a close,     personal and business relationship.  Holewinski, in turn, directed his     broker to sell all of his and his wifes Chantal shares immediately     following a telephone conversation with Wyatt on February 25, 1993.      Holewinskis trades occurred just before the public announcement by     Chantal.

According to the Information, filed by     the United States Attorney for the District of Massachusetts on October 23,     1997, Gersh, between January 1990 and July 1995, misappropriated over $4     million in investor moneys that had been entrusted to two corporations     under his control, Boston Municipal Securities, Inc. (BMS) and Devonshire     Escrow and Transfer Corp. (Devonshire).  Gersh faced a maximum sentence     of ten years in prison for each count of the Information.          The Information involved essentially the same underlying facts that     were the subject of a November 25, 1995 Commission complaint filed against     Gersh, BMS and Devonshire.  The Information charged that, in 1990 and 1991,     Gersh, acting through BMS and Devonshire, marketed and sold over $14     million of five-year Certificates of Participation (COPs) to investors.      Under the terms of the COPs, investor money was to be invested in pools of     equipment leases entered into by state and local governments. According to     the Information, although a large share of the investors\ money was     initially invested in state and municipal lease obligations, many of the     states and municipalities paid off their leases within one or two years.      Those payments returned millions of dollars to BMS and Devonshire.      According to the Information, Gersh was required either to return the money     to investors or to reinvest it in safe, highly-liquid securities.  Instead,     Gersh used approximately $4 million of the COPs money to finance various     business ventures in his own name, including a medical billing company, a     Judaica book store, several kitchen supply stores, and a model airplane and     ship distributorship.  According to the Information, Gersh covered up his     diversion of the COPs funds by using some of the money to make semiannual     interest payments to investors, leading them to believe that their     principal investment was safe and sound.          On March 20, 1997, the Honorable Reginald C. Lindsay of the U.S.     District Court for the District of Massachusetts enjoined Gersh, BMS and                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\x0c     Devonshire, in the Commission s action, from further violations of certain     antifraud provisions of the securities laws.  Gersh, BMS and Devonshire     consented to the injunctive orders without admitting or denying the     complaint\s allegations.  Gersh was also ordered to disgorge $7,451,935,     plus prejudgment interest thereon, provided, however, that payment of     $5,949,185 of such amount, plus the prejudgment interest, was waived based     on his demonstrated inability to pay.  The Commission also barred Gersh     from association with any broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer,     investment adviser or investment company.

INTERNET BROADCAST GROUP et. al., Civil Action No. 96-2226 (SSH)     (D.D.C.)     The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) announced today that     on May 29, 1998, The Honorable Stanley S. Harris, United States District     Judge for the District of Columbia, granted the Commission s application     for default judgment against relief defendants Greg E. Parker and     Interactive Communications Network, Ltd.(ICN), and ordered them jointly and     severally to disgorge $172,250, plus prejudgment interest of $66,089.  The     Court found that these sums represented the amount of Internet Broadcast     Group (IBG) investor funds received by relief defendants as a result of the     the unlawful conduct of IBG and the other defendants.     The Commission s complaint, which was filed on September 26, 1996, alleges     that IBG and the other defendants violated the federal securities laws in     connection with the offer and sale to the public of securities designated     as  partnership units  in IBG a purported general partnership formed to,     among other things, develop a wireless cable system in Muskegon, Michigan.      IBG was to acquire the licenses and certain hardware to operate the system     from Parker and ICN.  Toward that end, IBG paid $172,250 of investor funds,     which was transferred to Parker and ICN.  However, IBG investors received     no rights in the Muskegon licenses or in the equipment installed in     exchange for these payments, nor any refund.  The Muskegon system was never     developed.  The complaint alleged that the relief defendants, Parker and     ICN, held these investor funds in a constructive trust for the benefit of     investors.

15779,1998,,"b     UNITED STATES SECURITIES EXCHANGE COMMISSION     LITIGATION RELEASE NO.  15779 / June 11, 1998     SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  v. CRAIG RYAN SPRADLING,     98 Civ. 4117 (MBM) (S.D.N.Y.)     The Commission announced today that it filed a civil complaint charging a 25 year old     associate of a prominent law firm with insider trading.  Specifically, the Complaint      alleges that the associate defrauded his employer and one of its clients by buying      options to purchase common stock of a company that was the target of a planned tender      offer by that client.      Named in the Commission s Complaint is:     CRAIG RYAN SPRADLING, an attorney currently associated with the law firm Cleary,      Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton (Cleary ) in its London office.  At the time of the      transactions and events alleged in the Complaint, CRAIG RYAN SPRADLING worked in      Clearys New York Office.      The Complaint alleges that CRAIG RYAN SPRADLING made illegal profits of approximately      $49,000 by purchasing Loctite Corp. ( Loctite ) call options on October 24, 1996.      According to the Complaint, Henkel KGaA ( Henkel ) announced on Monday, October 28, 1996,      that it intended to acquire the outstanding shares of Loctite at $56 per share      ( Announcement ).  Prior to the announcement of that tender offer, Clearly allegedly      acted as counsel to Henkel.       CRAIG RYAN SPRADLING allegedly purchased, on October 24, 1996, 65 December Loctite $50      call options for approximately $6,000 through a securities brokerage account he maintained     with Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. ( Schwab ), a registered broker-dealer.  According to      the Complaint, CRAIG RYAN SPRADLING submitted to Schwab on October 23, 1996, the      application necessary to trade options through his brokerage account at Schwab. Following      the Announcement on October 28, 1996, CRAIG RYAN SPRADLING allegedly sold all of his      Loctite call options for more than $55,000.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        The Complaint further alleges that when CRAIG RYAN SPRADLING purchased Loctite call       options in October 1996, he knew that Henkel, a client of Cleary, was planning a       tender offer for all outstanding common stock of Loctite.  In the weeks prior to the       announcement, CRAIG RYAN SPRADLING, while an associate at Cleary, allegedly worked on      various projects relating to Henkels planned tender offer for Loctite, including the       preparation of tender offer documents.                                                    ======END OF PAGE 1======\x0c       The Commission seeks a final judgment: (1) permanently enjoining CRAIG RYAN SPRADLING        from violating the general antifraud and tender offer antifraud provisions of the        Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act  ) (Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the       Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3); (2) ordering CRAIG RYAN SPRADLING to disgorge        his illegal trading profits plus prejudgment interest; and (3) imposing a civil penalty        against CRAIG RYAN SPRADLING of up to three times the amount of his illegal trading        profits.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) announced that,     on June 10, 1998, after a ten-week criminal trial conducted by the United     States Attorney\s Office for the Southern District of New York, Jeffrey     Szur, Elaine Szur, Vadim Kaplun, Cary Weinstein, and David M. Gold were     convicted on charges of: (a) conspiracy to commit securities fraud, wire     fraud, and commercial bribery; (b) wire fraud; (c) commercial bribery; (d)     creating false books and records for a registered broker-dealer; and (e)     money laundering.  The evidence at trial showed that the defendants engaged     in a scheme to fraudulently sell approximately $6 million worth of publicly     traded common stock that had been issued by Securitek International Corp.     (formerly known as U.S. Asset Corp.) to unsuspecting retail customers of     J.S. Securities, Inc., a registered broker-dealer.  Jeffrey Szur was the     President of J.S. Securities.  Elaine Szur, Jeffrey Szur\s mother, served     as the compliance officer of J.S. Securities.  Kaplun, Weinstein, and Gold     operated branch offices of J.S. Securities.            As shown at trial, the fraudulent scheme concerned undisclosed     payments by Bertram Slutsky, the former President of Securitek and a     substantial owner of Securitek stock, to Jeffrey Szur, Kaplun, Weinstein,     and Gold in exchange for sales of Slutsky\s Securitek stock to the retail     customers of J.S. Securities.  Slutsky made payments of as much as 50% of     the sales price of his Securitek stock to the persons running the Securitek     sales operation at J.S. Securities.  As President of J.S. Securities,     Jeffrey Szur entered into the agreement with Slutsky to sell Slutsky\s     Securitek stock to the retail customers of J.S. Securities.  Kaplun     operated a branch office of J.S. Securities at 63 Wall Street, where Kaplun     directed a massive cold-calling and high pressure sales operation to sell     Slutsky\s Securitek stock.  Weinstein and Gold operated a branch office of     J.S. Securities in Westbury, New York, where they also directed a cold-     calling operation to sell Securitek stock.  Elaine Szur helped keep the     books concerning the fraudulent scheme and, together with Jeffrey Szur,     forged various documents that J.S. Securities was required to maintain in     accordance with Commission regulations.          Jeffrey Szur, Elaine Szur, Kaplun, Weinstein, and Gold were each     convicted of a single count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, penny     stock fraud, wire fraud, and commercial bribery.  Jeffrey Szur was also     convicted of three counts of wire fraud, one count of commercial bribery in     violation of the Travel Act, three counts of maintaining false books and                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\x0c     records, and two counts of money laundering; he faces a maximum sentence of     95 years imprisonment.  Elaine Szur was also convicted of two counts of     wire fraud, three counts of maintaining false books and records, and two     counts of money laundering; she faces a maximum sentence of 85 years     imprisonment.  Kaplun was also convicted of two counts of wire fraud, three     counts of commercial bribery in violation of the Travel Act, and two counts     of money laundering; he faces a maximum sentence of 70 years imprisonment.      Weinstein and Gold were also convicted of one count each of commercial     bribery in violation of the Travel Act and two counts each of money     laundering; they each face a maximum sentence of 50 years imprisonment.      Sentencing before the Honorable John G. Koeltl of the United States     District Court for the Southern District of New York is scheduled for     September 18, 1998.          In August 1997, Slutsky pleaded guilty to: (a) conspiracy to commit     securities fraud, wire fraud, and commercial bribery; and (b) securities     fraud.  In February 1998, Ronald Gray, the operator of another branch     office of J.S. Securities that was involved in the fraudulent scheme to     sell Securitek stock, pleaded guilty to conspiracy and wire fraud.  In     March 1998, Joseph Epstein, who helped Kaplun operate the 63 Wall Street     branch of J.S. Securities, pleaded guilty to perjury and conspiracy charges     in connection with the Securitek fraud.            In December 1997, the Commission filed a civil complaint against     Jeffrey Szur, Slutsky, Kaplun, Epstein, Weinstein, Gold, Gray, Elaine Szur,     Alex Levin, Diane Lakin, George Elian, and J.S. Securities concerning the     Securitek fraud and related matters.  The Commission\s action, which     alleges violations of the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of     1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and other provisions of the     securities laws, remains pending.  (See Litigation Release No. 15595 for a     further description of the allegations contained in the Commission\s civil     complaint.)          The Commission expresses its appreciation for the outstanding effort     of the United States Attorney\s Office for the Southern District of New     York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter.                                ======END OF PAGE 2======\x0c"

The Commission announced that on June 8, 1998, the United States     District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a default     judgment against Robert L. Gray ( Gray ), an unregistered investment     adviser and a convicted felon whom the Commission charged with defrauding     his advisory clients and a registered broker-dealer.  The court permanently     enjoined Gray from violating the antifraud provisions of the Securities     Exchange Act of 1934 and various registration, books and records, and other     provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  The court also ordered     Gray to disgorge $121,654, representing his ill-gotten gains, plus $48,071     in prejudgment interest.          The Complaint, filed on August 1, 1997, alleges that, from January     1993 through June 1996, Gray misappropriated a total of $121,654 from     advisory clients who had given Gray money to purchase securities on their     behalf.  The Complaint also alleges that Gray engaged in  free-riding  at     the expense of a registered broker-dealer, Robb, Peck, McCooey Clearing     Corporation, by failing to pay for over $1 million in securities that Gray     bought through that brokerage firm ostensibly for his clients.  The     Complaint further alleges that Gray violated provisions of the Investment     Advisers Act of 1940 by (a) failing to maintain required investment     advisory records; (b) failing to furnish clients with required written     disclosure statements; (c) entering into advisory contracts that unlawfully     provided for performance-based compensation and did not prohibit assignment     of the contracts without client consent; (d) violating rules governing     treatment of client funds in an advisers custody; and (e) concealing his     disciplinary and criminal history from his clients.          According to the Complaint, by engaging in the foregoing conduct, Gray     violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-     5 thereunder, and Sections 203(a), 204, 205(a)(1) and (2), and 206(1), (2)     and (4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and Rules 204-2, 204-3,     206(4)-2 and 206(4)-4 thereunder.          Gray was barred from the securities industry by the National     Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. in 1977 and was convicted in 1989     and 1993 of crimes related to prior acts of misappropriating funds.                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\x0c"

15784,1998,,"b     UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION     LITIGATION RELEASE NO.  15784 / JUNE 17, 1998     ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING ENFORCEMENT      RELEASE NO.  1045 / JUNE 17, 1998     SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION v. GUY MARCEL DE VREESE,      Civil Action No. 98-4866RJK (MANs) (C.D. Cal.).     The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a complaint today in the     United States District Court for the Central District of California seeking     a judgment of permanent injunction and other relief against defendant Guy     Marcel De Vreese (De Vreese), 42, of Ghent, Belgium.  The complaint     charges De Vreese with violating the antifraud, reporting, recordkeeping,     internal controls, and lying to an accountant provisions of the federal     securities laws [Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the     Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5,      12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder].  De Vreese consented     to the entry of the injunction without admitting or denying the     Commission\s allegations.  De Vreese was not ordered to pay civil     penalties, based on his demonstrated financial inability to pay.     In its complaint, the Commission alleged that De Vreese was the chief     executive officer and chairman of the board of directors of Styles on     Video, Inc. (Styles), formerly located in Newbury Park, California.  De     Vreese served in these roles during the period that Styles\ common stock     traded on the American Stock Exchange, from March 29, 1993 through December     27, 1994.  Styles, now bankrupt, developed and marketed computer imaging     systems, such as the Styles on Video System which allows the operator to     produce a videotape showing what a salon customer would look like wearing     different hairstyles.  Under De Vreese\s direction, Styles falsely reported     to the public increasing profitability on growing revenue for its fiscal     year ended December 31, 1993 and first three quarters of 1994.  Styles had     actually sustained losses in those periods.       The Commission alleged that under De Vreese\s direction, Styles materially     overstated revenue and understated losses in press releases and in its 1993     Form 10-KSB and three 1994 Forms      10-QSB filed with the Commission.  Specifically, under De Vreese\s     direction, Styles:     for 1993, overstated revenue by 38% and understated losses by 294% when it     recorded, in the last three days of the fiscal year, two transactions     totaling $2.0 million concerning license agreements not consummated for     software not yet developed;     \xf9for the first quarter of 1994, overstated revenue by 31% and understated     losses by 38% when it recorded, on the last day of the quarter, a $500,000     license agreement not consummated for product not yet merchantable;     \xf9for the second quarter of 1994, overstated revenue by 137% and understated     losses by 306% when it recorded, on the last day of the quarter, a $2.1                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\x0c     million license agreement not consummated; and     \xf9for the third quarter of 1994, overstated revenue by 166% and understated     losses by 273% when it recorded the purported $2.5 million sale of a     segment of its business.     Further, the Complaint alleges that De Vreese caused Styles to:     falsely state in its second quarter 1994 Form 10-QSB that it had received     $1.4 million of cash when it had not, which lent false credibility to the     company\s reported, overstated revenue; and     materially overstate in its third quarter 1994 Form 10-QSB its September     30, 1994 cash balance by the purported $1.4 million cash collection.       The Commission further alleged that De Vreese handled substantive     communications with third parties to the subject unconsummated     transactions.  De Vreese participated in the preparation of Styles\ 1993     Form 10-KSB and 1994 Forms 10-QSB filed with the Commission and the     company\s press releases.  De Vreese gave final approval for Styles\     release of such financial information.  In late 1993, De Vreese supervised     Styles\ accounting activities.  With respect to the second and third     quarters 1994 revenue overstatements and loss understatements, De Vreese     directed Styles\ internal accountants to record the underlying     unconsummated transactions.         The Complaint also alleges that, in March 1996 and under new management,     Styles amended its 1993 Form 10-KSB and its three 1994 Forms 10-QSB,     restating its financial statements, materially reducing its reported     revenue and reflecting losses for each period.                              ======END OF PAGE 2======\x0c"

MY DANG, Civil Action No.  98-4865 DT     (JGx) (C.D. Cal.)     The Securities and Exchange Commission ( Commission ) filed a Complaint on     June 17, 1998, in federal district court in Los Angeles, California,     against My Dang ( Dang ), a former investment banking associate at     Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, Inc. ( DLJ ).  The Commission s Complaint     alleges that between April and June 1995, Dang traded in the securities of     two DLJ clients, Capital Gaming International, Inc. ( Capital Gaming ) and     Super Rite Corporation ( Super Rite ), while in possession of material     nonpublic information obtained during the course of his employment.  The     Complaint alleges that Dang sold short a total of 32,400 shares of Capital     Gaming common stock in April and May 1995, prior to three adverse     announcements concerning operations at the company s New Orleans riverboat     facility.  Dang also purchased 13,000 shares of Super Rite common stock in     June 1995, after learning that DLJ had been retained by Super Rite in     connection with an impending acquisition by Richfood Holdings, Inc.     ( Richfood ).  In each instance, Dang liquidated his securities position     shortly after the news was publicly disclosed. The Complaint alleged that     Dang realized profits of $59,765.27 as a result of his illegal trades.     Concurrent with the filing of the Complaint, Dang settled the civil action     without admitting or denying the allegations alleged in the Complaint.      Under the terms of the settlement, Dang agreed to the imposition of a     permanent injunction forbidding future violations of the antifraud     provisions of the federal securities laws.  Dang additionally agreed to     disgorge $59,765.27 in profits resulting from his insider trading, and pay     prejudgment interest thereon in the amount of $11,025.52.  Finally, Dang     agreed to pay a civil penalty of $59,765.27.                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\x0c"

Litigation Release No. 15786  / June 18, 1998     Accounting and Auditing Enforcement     Release No.  1046 / June 18, 1998     SEC v. William P. Trainor, Vincent D. Celentano, Medical Diagnostic     Products, Inc. (f/k/a Novatek International, Inc.), Karen Losordo, Diane M.     Trainor, Daniel J. Trainor, Geraldine Trainor and Mary N. Celentano  (Civil     Action No. 98-CV01533) (EGS) (USDC/DC)     The Commission today filed a Complaint in the United States District Court     for the District of Columbia against Medical Diagnostic Products, Inc.     (f/k/a Novatek International, Inc.  Novatek  ), a Columbia Maryland-based     company that purports to distribute medical diagnostic test kits, William     P. Trainor and Vincent D. Celentano.  The Commission s Complaint alleges     that Trainor and Celentano committed a massive fraud on investors by, among     other things, orchestrating a series of sham transactions among Novatek and     other companies that they controlled, followed by their issuing a series of     press releases which announced that Novatek had entered into highly     profitable contracts with a variety of other entities.  No such contracts     existed. The Complaint also names Karen Losordo, Diane M. Trainor, Daniel     J. Trainor, Geraldine Trainor and Mary N. Celentano as relief defendants.     The Complaint alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud and     reporting provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, specifically     Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and (B), 13(b)(5), 13(d) and 16(a) and     Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-13, 13b2-1, 13d-1 and 16a-3 thereunder, and seeks     to enjoin them from future violations of the federal securities laws.  The     Complaint also seeks to obtain civil penalties from the individual     defendants and to bar them from serving as officers or directors of public     companies.      The Complaint further alleges that Trainor and Celentano controlled     Novatek, although neither they nor the company disclosed this fact to     investors.  Through the sham transactions, the last of which occurred in     April 1996 and involved a merger between Novatek and Medical Products, Inc.     ( MPI ), a private company owned by Trainor and Celentano, Novatek acquired     a license to distribute medical diagnostic test kits in South America and     Latin America.  Novatek accounted for the combination on its financial     statements as an acquisition of MPI by Novatek and falsely claimed that the     distribution license had a value in excess of $50 million.  From that point     until October 1996, Trainor and Celentano caused the price of Novatek     common stock to increase by knowingly or recklessly causing Novatek to     issue materially false and misleading press releases which falsely  stated,     among other things, that Novatek had entered into agreements worth a total     of $400 million with various South American and Latin American entities.      The Complaint also alleges that Trainor and Celentano fraudulently     disbursed more than $4.5 million of Novatek investor funds to family                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\x0c     members and entities associated with them without any legitimate business     reason.     The Complaint further alleges that Trainor and Celentano caused Novatek to     file periodic reports with the Commission on Forms 8-K/A and 10-QSB that     contained materially false and misleading financial statements.  Novatek     grossly overstated the value of its assets at more than $57 million when,     in reality, Novatek s assets were approximately $2 million.       The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the National Association of     Securities Dealers, the Comiss\x83o De Valores Mobiliarios of Brazil, the     Comision Nacional De Valores de Argentina, and the Superintendencia De     Valores y Seguros of Chile  in this matter.                              ======END OF PAGE 2======\x0c"

Carter, Kelly Polatis and Eunice Polatis, Civil Action      No. 2:98CV 0440B, (USDC D.Ut.)(June 18, 1998)     On June 18, 1998, a civil complaint was filed against Albert E. Carter,     Kelly Polatis and Eunice Polatis alleging the defendants have, since at     least March 1997, been perpetrating a securities fraud by selling over $3.5     million of nineteenth century state and railroad bonds, which have only     nominal value as collectibles, to investors as investment vehicles capable     of generating extraordinary returns to those investors.  The bonds being     sold by the defendants were issued by the Chicago, Saginaw & Canada Railway     Co. in 1873, the East Alabama & Cincinnati Railway Co.in 1870 and by the     State of Mississippi in 1838.  The defendants have represented among other     things that the bonds are redeemable in gold and are guaranteed by the     United States government; Carter has also represented that the East Alabama     bonds are guaranteed by the State of Alabama.  It is also alleged that     Carter has sold interests in an offshore investment program into which he     claims the nineteenth century bonds can be placed, generating annual     returns of 100% to 500%.     The complaint alleges that the defendants violated Section 17(a) of the     Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of     1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  As part of the complaint, the Commission     seeks, among other relief:  a preliminary injunction; a freeze of the     defendants  assets; a freeze of the assets of Valice Ltd. LLC, Duro L.C.     and Iron Horse One, Inc., three relief defendants who received proceeds of     sales by the Polatises; disgorgement of all illegally obtained profits with     prejudgment interest thereon and the imposition of civil money penalties.     Also on June 18, 1998, the Honorable Dee V. Benson, United States District     Judge, issued an order freezing the assets of Carter, Kelly Polatis, Eunice     Polatis and the three relief defendants.                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\x0c"

SHILLING (United States     District Court for the District of New Hampshire, Civ. No. 98-CV-329-B)          The Commission announced that, on June 1, 1998, Chief Judge Paul J.     Barbadoro of the United States District Court for the District of New     Hampshire issued a judgment permanently enjoining Terry S. Shilling     ( Shilling ) from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities     Exchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act ) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and     ordering Shilling to pay disgorgement of $10,761.78, plus prejudgment     interest of $1,168.99, and a civil money penalty of $10,761.78.  The     Commission s complaint, filed on May 21, 1998, alleged that Shilling, a     former Healthsource, Inc. ( Healthsource ) executive and a resident of     Marietta, Georgia, engaged in unlawful insider trading in the common stock     of Healthsource.  Simultaneously with the filing of the Complaint, Shilling     consented, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint,     to the entry of the final judgment.          According to the Complaint, on February 19, 1997, a Healthsource     executive called Shilling and informed him, in a confidential briefing,     that Healthsource was negotiating with both CIGNA Corporation ( CIGNA ) and     another company regarding a business combination.  The Complaint alleged     that the Healthsource executive also told Shilling that Healthsource was     conducting a mini-auction and that the matter could be decided by the end     of the following week.  The Complaint also alleged that the Healthsource     executive called Shilling a second time that day to emphasize the     confidential and privileged nature of the information.  According to the     Complaint, on February 20, 1997 and after his conversations with the     Healthsource executive, Shilling bought 1,900 shares of Healthsource common     stock for $15-1/8 per share.  The Complaint further alleged that Shilling     did not preclear his February 20, 1997 trade as required by Healthsource s     procedures and that, had he done so, he would not have received approval     for this trade.  On February 28, 1997, Healthsource and CIGNA announced an     agreement to merge the two companies, with a premium payable to     Healthsource shareholders and with CIGNA as the surviving entity.  The     Complaint alleged that, by purchasing Healthsource shares on February 20,     in advance of the February 28, 1997 merger announcement and for $5-3/4 per     share less than the post-announcement closing price, Shilling realized     unlawful trading profits of $10,761.78.

LENNOX INVESTMENT GROUP, LTD., ACTIVE     INTERNATIONAL, INC., RANDALL W. LAW, JAMES F. WARDELL, MONICA M. ILES,     FRANK L. PEITZ, AND DANIEL B. BENSON, 4:98CV536-Y, USDC, ND/TX  (Fort Worth     Division)          On June 22, 1998,  the United States District Court for the Northern     District of  Texas granted the Commission s request for an order freezing     the assets of Lennox Investment Group, Ltd. ( Lennox ), Active     International, Inc. ( Active ), Randall W. Randall W. Law ( Law ), James F.     Wardell ( Wardell ), Monica M. Iles ( Iles ), Frank L. Peitz ( Peitz ), and     Daniel B. Benson ( Benson ), and relief defendants P.B.F. Capital Corp,     Inc., Benson Financial, Inc., Robert Paladino, People s Residential     Mortgage Corp., Benny Griffis, and L. E. Consultant Company. Additionally,     the Court ordered all defendants to account for investor monies and to     repatriate any funds not subject to the jurisdiction of the Court, and     ordered the appointment of a receiver to take control of the assets of the     defendants for the benefit of investors.          According to the Commission s complaint,  Lennox, Active, Law,     Wardell, Iles, Peitz and Benson raised approximately $11.1 million from     more than 50 investors in at least 10 states through the fraudulent offer     and sale of unregistered  prime bank  securities. Investors were told that     their funds would be placed in an escrow account, with the investment     principal guaranteed, and that their funds would be invested in a trading     program where  investors could expect a yield of 122.5% per week for 40     weeks during the 54 week term of the program. In fact, according to the     complaint,  the trading program did not exist and these defendants, instead     of investing the funds, stole the entire $11.1 million of investors  funds     which were disbursed for the benefit of themselves and their designees,     including the relief defendants. The complaint further requests an order     permanently enjoining Lennox, Active, Law, Wardell, Iles, Peitz and Benson,     an order requiring disgorgement of all wrongfully obtained profits, with     prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against each defendant, as well     as disgorgement with prejudgment interest against the relief defendants.          The Commission s request for a preliminary injunction enjoining     Lennox, Active, Law, Wardell, Iles, Peitz and Benson from future violations     of 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities     Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Lennox, Law, Wardell     and Iles from future violations of Section 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities     Act will be heard on July 2, 1998.                              ======END OF PAGE 1======"

Litigation Release No.   15792 / June 29, 1998          Securities and Exchange Commission v. Atlantic Capital Corporation, Wall     Street Marketing, Inc., Pullman Publications, Inc., Stephen DeCesare, Mark     Missler, Patrick Kephart, Howard Jenkins, Scott Mijares, Robert Thomas     Beatty, Vincent St. Clair Beatty, Michael Cardascia, David Scott Rossman,     Adrian Wilson, Timothy B. Daley, and David M. Connochie (M.D. Fla.) No. 96-     1043-CIV-ORL-19A           The Commission announced today that a stock promoter, previously     charged with paying kickbacks to brokers for selling certain securities to     their clients, has settled the charges against him.  On September 27, 1996,     the Commission filed a Complaint in U.S. District Court for the Middle     District of Florida alleging that a group of stock promoters engaged in an     18-month fraudulent scheme in which they paid $477,580 in bribes to seven     stockbrokers to induce them to retail securities to the public.  The     Complaint further alleged that the stock promoters issued promotional     brochures concerning various public companies without disclosing that they     were being paid by the companies to issue the brochures.  The Complaint     alleges that the promoters netted approximately $2.6 million from the     scheme.          The settling stock promoter is Howard C. Jenkins (Jenkins), age 45,     formerly of Ovida, Florida.  Jenkins consented, without admitting or     denying the allegations in the Complaint, to the issuance of a Final     Judgment by Judge Patricia C. Fawsett of the United States District Court     for the Middle District of Florida enjoining him from future violations of     Sections 17(a) and 17(b) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of     the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.  Jenkins also consented     to disgorge $39,500 in profits he received from the alleged scheme, plus     $19,759.28 in prejudgment interest and to pay a penalty of $10,000.           The Commission s litigation is still pending against two brokers.

In the Complaint, the Commission sought a permanent     injunction, disgorgement and an accounting against Phoenix Metals and     Flaherty.  Phoenix Metals and Flaherty previously consented to the entry of     a judgment of permanent injunction, without admitting or denying the     allegations in the Complaint, which enjoined them from future violations of     Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 [15 U.S.C. \x15 77q(a)], Section     10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [15 U.S.C. \x15 78j(b)] and Rule     10b-5 thereunder [17 C.F.R. \x15 240.10b-5].          The Final Judgment did not require Phoenix Metals and Flaherty to pay     disgorgement or prejudgment interest thereon based upon Phoenix Metals  and     Flaherty s representations that they subsequently spent that sum in     purchasing and operating the Phoenix Metals refinery.                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\x0c"
15794,1998,,"b     UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION     Litigation Release No. 15794 / June 29, 1998     Accounting and Auditing Enforcement     Release No. 1048 / June 29, 1998     Securities and Exchange Commission v. Charles T. Young and Selig Adler     (June 29, 1998, S.D.N.Y.) 98 Civ. 4564 (J. Batts)          The Securities and Exchange Commission ( Commission ) announced today     that it filed and simultaneously settled enforcement proceedings against     Venator Group, Inc., formerly known as Woolworth Corporation (hereinafter     referred to as  Woolworth  or  the company ), and four of its former senior     officers, based on Woolworth s material misstatement in filings with the     Commission of its quarterly financial results for the first three quarters     of its fiscal year 1993, and for the fourth quarter of fiscal 1993 in a     company press release.            In a cease-and-desist proceeding against Woolworth, which the company     simultaneously settled without admitting or denying the Commission s     allegations, the Commission found that former officers at Woolworth and two     of its major subsidiaries, Kinney Shoe Corporation ( Kinney Shoe ) and     Woolworth Canada Inc. ( Woolworth Canada ), engaged in a scheme to manage     the company s reported earnings by inflating profits in early quarters, so     that Woolworth could report positive earnings.  Results were then adjusted     in subsequent quarters so that results would be accurate by year-end.          In a separate Complaint, seeking permanent injunctions and monetary     relief in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New     York against former Woolworth officers Charles T. Young ( Young ) and Selig     Adler ( Adler ), the Commission alleged that the fraud was accomplished at     the direction, or with the knowledge, of Young, the former senior vice-     president of finance and chief financial officer of Woolworth.  The     Complaint also alleges that the fraud was conducted by the chief financial     officers of two Woolworth subsidiaries, including Adler at Kinney Shoe     Corporation U.S. ( Kinney ) and the chief financial officer of Woolworth     Canada, Inc. ( Woolworth Canada ), both of whom falsified the subsidiaries      quarterly results by understating cost of sales and improperly deferring     expenses reported by the subsidiaries. The Commission also named E. Ronald     Gamble ( Gamble ), former chief financial officer at Woolworth Canada, in     the related cease-and-desist proceeding.  Without admitting or denying the     findings, Gamble consented to the entry of the Order.           The Complaint against Young and Adler alleges that they violated     Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act ) and     Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder, and Young violated Rule 13b2-2 of the     Exchange Act by signing management representation letters for each quarter     of fiscal 1993 in which he falsely represented information relating to     Woolworth s true financial condition.  It is also alleged that each of the                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\x0c     defendants aided and abetted Woolworth s violations of Sections 13(a),     13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-13     thereunder.          Simultaneous with the filing of the Commission s Complaint, Young and     Adler, without admitting or denying the allegations of the Complaint,     consented to the entry of Final Judgments permanently enjoining them from     violating the relevant provisions of the federal securities laws.  Adler     also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $25,000; no penalty was entered     against Young due to his demonstrated inability to pay.  Based upon the     entry of the injunction, Young also consented to the entry of an     administrative order pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the Commission s Rules of     Practice barring him for a period of five years from appearing or     practicing before the Commission as an accountant.                In the related cease-and-desist order proceeding, Woolworth, Gamble     and Laura T. Kirsner ( Kirsner ), the former assistant controller of     Woolworth, consented to entry of an Order ( Order ) finding that Woolworth     violated and Gamble and Kirsner caused violations of Sections 13(a),     13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-13     thereunder.           The Order makes further findings that, Gamble, under pressure from     Woolworth to report strong results, adjusted Woolworth Canada s preliminary     results from the general ledger each month in fiscal 1993, to smooth     expenses over the entire year and to bring Woolworth Canada s results into     line with the company s internal forecasts. Based on these facts, the     Commission found that Gamble had violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act     and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder.          The Order entered by the Commission requires Woolworth, Gamble and     Kirsner to cease and desist from committing any violation and any future     violation of the federal securities laws alleged against them.                              ======END OF PAGE 2======\x0c"
15795,1998,,"b          UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION     Litigation Release No.  15795 / June 30, 1998      Securities and Exchange Commission v. James G. Freeman, et al., (United     States District Court for the Northern District of California, Civil Action     No. C-96-2316).     The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on April 29, 1998,     Magistrate Judge Bernard Zimmerman of the United States District Court for     the Northern District of California entered an Order of Disgorgement and     Other Relief against James G. Freeman (Freeman) and 18 companies controlled     by Freeman, holding Freeman and the corporate defendants jointly liable for     disgorgement of $10,823,727.74 in illegal profits, but waiving payment of     all but $15,444.78 based on defendants\ financial inability to pay.      Defendants consented, without admitting or denying the allegations in the     Commission\s complaint, to the entry of the Order.  Freeman and 19 of the     corporate defendants had previously consented to the entry of an Order of     Permanent Injunction enjoining them from further violations of Sections     5(a), 5(c), 17(a)(1), 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933     and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5     promulgated thereunder.  [See Litigation Release No. 15130, October 21,     1996]  The April 29, 1998 Order concludes the litigation.     The Commission\s Complaint, filed on June 25, 1996, alleged that, among     other things, during the period from approximately April 1994 through April     1995, Freeman operated a nation-wide Ponzi scheme involving nearly 500     investors and raising over $26 million in proceeds.  During the one-year     period, Freeman and the companies offered and sold promissory notes     (Freeman notes).  The Freeman notes were renewable every 9 months and     guaranteed a 12% annual return.  In addition, investors were promised a     longevity bonus equal to 8% interest on all funds maintained in the     alleged investment for each year the Freeman note was renewed.  The     investor funds raised through the sale of the Freeman notes allegedly were     to be invested in various European ventures.  In reality, however, Freeman     deposited all investor funds into bank accounts under his control and used     the proceeds to make purported interest payments, pay exorbitant     commissions, satisfy unrelated business and personal expenses and meet     obligations to prior investors.                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\x0c"
15796,1998,,"b     UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION     Litigation Release No. 15796 / June 30, 1998     SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION V. NICHI CAPITAL, LTD., OLAWANDE A. AGUNLOYE,     WISE CHOICE DISCOUNT BROKERAGE, INC., RALPH ANTEBY, AND BRIAN WALFISH, AND     STRATEGIC RISK MANAGEMENT AS RELIEF DEFENDANT, 98 Civ. 2218 (CSH) (S.D.N.Y)     The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) announced today that     Relief Defendant Strategic Risk Management, has consented to the issuance     of a Final Judgment by the Honorable Charles S. Haight, Jr., Senior Judge     of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York,     ordering it to disgorge $100,000 it obtained from Wise Choice Discount     Brokerage, Inc. (Wise Choice), a registered broker-dealer located in     Manhattan.  Disgorgement of the remaining $204,000 received by Strategic     from Wise Choice was waived based on Strategic\s demonstrated inability to     pay.     In its Complaint, filed March 27, 1998, the Commission alleges that since     October 1997, Nichi Capital, Ltd. (Nichi); Wise Choice; Nichi\s     President, Olawande A. Agunloye (Agunloye); and two registered     representatives of Wise Choice, Ralph Anteby and Brian Walfish     (collectively the Defendants); have induced over $200,000 in investments     in Nichi securities by misrepresenting to investors that an IPO of Nichi     stock was about to take place and that their money would be placed in an     escrow account until the IPO took place.  The Commission alleges that, in     fact, the investors\ money was used by Agunloye, at least in part, in     connection with his acquisition of an equity interest in relief defendant     Strategic Risk Management, Inc.

15798,1998,,"b                                         SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION           LITIGATION RELEASE NO. 15798 / July 1, 1998     SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION V. ALFRED J. ALMEDER AND HAROLD J. LEE     (United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, C.A. No.     97-12143-GAO (D. MA))          The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on June 3, 1998,     the Honorable George A. O Toole, U.S. District Judge for the District of     Massachusetts, issued a Judgment Against Defendant Alfred J. Almeder     ( Almeder ).  The judgment, entered by default, permanently enjoins Almeder     from further violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal     securities laws, orders him to disgorge $259,000 plus prejudgment interest     of $151,113, and orders him to pay a civil monetary penalty of $75,000.      The complaint alleged that, between January 1992 and May 1993, Almeder, a     resident of Braintree, Massachusetts, and Harold J. Lee ( Lee ), a resident      of Lynn, Massachusetts, fraudulently offered and sold stock of DreamWorld, Inc.      (DreamWorld) to at least 28 investors who invested more than $250,000.       According to the defendants, the proceeds of the sales of the securities would      be used for the development of a vast theme park and entertainment complex on      the banks of the Cape Cod Canal in Bourne, Massachusetts, when, in fact, the      money was used for personal and living expenses, including Almeder\s lease of a     Jaguar automobile.          The complaint alleged that the defendants committed securities fraud     by falsely telling investors that: (1) they had obtained a commitment of     $300 million in financing; (2) they had secured or were about to secure     sponsorship of the theme park by major corporate investors; (3) they owned     sufficient land on which to build the theme park; (4) DreamWorld was a     secure investment due to the value of land it already owned; (5) DreamWorld     stock was currently worth $1.00 to $1.50 per share, based upon the current     value of its assets, and would be worth $15 per share within a couple of     years; and (6) they had obtained all necessary permits for a large portion     of the park.

PAPSON     USDC/SD NY 98-CV-4748          On July 6, 1998, the Commission filed a civil insider trading case in     the Southern District of New York against Frank J. Papson, a former vice     president of Xerox Corporation s (Xerox) Office Document Products Group     (ODPG).  Simultaneously with the filing of the Complaint, Papson consented     to the entry of a Final Judgment on a neither admit nor deny basis, which     imposes an injunction against future violations of the antifraud provisions     of the federal securities laws and requires Papson to disgorge $35,593.98,     representing the profits he made by trading in Xerox stock and options     while in possession of material non-public information.  The agreed Final     Judgment also orders Papson to pay prejudgment interest of $4,493.62 and a     civil penalty of $35,593.98.          According to the Complaint, Papson was responsible for consolidating     and reporting ODPG s financial results, which historically produced     approximately 50 percent of Xerox s total revenue.  The Complaint alleged     that on or about October 7, 1996, Papson learned that ODPG s total profit     for the 1996 third quarter was down $59 million or thirty-four percent     below the same year-ago period and that, with this knowledge, he sold short     1650 shares of Xerox common stock and purchased 65 Xerox put options     between October 7 and October 15.           On October  18, 1996, Xerox publicly announced a two percent decline     in its 1996 third quarter earnings from the 1995 third quarter.  According     to the Complaint, the 1996 third quarter results were well below analysts      expectations for Xerox, which had previously posted increased earnings for     12 preceding quarters.  After the disappointing earnings announcement, the     price of Xerox stock dropped $8.25, or fourteen percent, and Papson covered     his short sale of Xerox stock and sold his Xerox put options for a profit     of  $35,593.98.  As a result of his trading, the Complaint alleged that     Papson violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section     10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\x0c"

SAMPSON, BRUCE SAMPSON, and TRACY ANN     STODDART, 97 Civ. 8144.                 On June 12, 1998, the United States District Court for the Southern     District of New York entered a Final Judgment as to Tracy Ann Stoddart, the     last of seven defendants in this case involving insider trading in advance     of The Thomson Corporation s ( Thomson s ) November 16, 1994 tender offer     for The MEDSTAT Group, Inc. (Medstat).  On November 4, 1997, the six     other defendants consented to the entry of permanent injunctions against     them and agreed to pay a total of $888,665.67 in disgorgement of illegal     profits, prejudgment interest and penalties, without admitting or denying     the allegations in the Commission\s complaint.            According to the Commission\s Complaint, Stoddart, 36, a certified     public accountant residing in Santa Fe, New Mexico, was tipped by Andrew S.     Lane, 34, with whom she had worked at the Stamford, Connecticut office of a     major accounting firm.  The Complaint alleged that Lane learned of     Thomson\s plans to acquire Medstat while working as Director of Finance at     a Thomson subsidiary.  According to the Complaint Stoddart bought a total     of 1906 shares of Medstat for herself, 700 of which she sold before the     tender offer announcement, and also recommended Medstat to a family member     who bought 235 shares.          Stoddart consented to the entry of the final judgment against her     without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint. Stoddart     consented to an injunction against future violations of Sections 10(b) and     14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3     thereunder, and agreed to disgorge $14,600.98, representing her and her     family member s gains from the conduct alleged in the Complaint, plus pre-     judgment interest thereon in the amount of $4,897.58.  However, payment of     that amount was waived in light of her demonstrated inability to pay based     on her sworn representations in a statement of financial condition.

LATIN AMERICAN             RESOURCES, INC., JOHN B. LOWY AND HAROLD J. GLASBAND, United             States District Court for the Eastern District of New York,             Civil Action No.CV98 4605 (E.D.N.Y.  July 8, 1998)             The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed suit             seeking injunctive relief against Latin American Resources,             Inc. (LARI), John B. Lowy, a principal stockholder of LARI             who also served as counsel to the company, and Harold J.             Glasband, Chief Financial Officer and a director of LARI.             The Commission\s Complaint alleges that LARI, the corporate             successor of Security Asset Management International, Inc.             (SAMI), Lowy and Glasband violated the antifraud             provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the             Exchange Act) by knowingly or recklessly making material             misstatements in an October 1993 Information Statement filed             with the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. by             a New York brokerage firm, and a July 1994 Registration             Statement filed by LARI with the Commission.             According to the Complaint, the principal misstatements             contained in these documents were LARI\s false claims that             it owned certain Brazilian agricultural plantations,             properties that comprised approximately 95% of LARI\s assets             at the time of LARI\s false filings.  These properties were             purportedly acquired in a series of transactions by SAMI,             and LARI claimed to have acquired the assets as SAMI\s             corporate successor.  The Complaint alleges that LARI could             not own the plantations under Brazilian law, never owned             them, and dramatically overstated the value of these             Brazilian properties.  The Complaint further alleges that             Lowy, who was the president and a director of SAMI, was             chiefly responsible for negotiating the purported Brazilian             transactions, and that Glasband, also a SAMI officer and             director, participated in carrying out the purported             acquisitions.  The Complaint alleges that Lowy and Glasband             became aware of information which indicated that there were             infirmities in the purported title to the Brazilian             plantations and material inaccuracies in their valuations.             According to the Complaint, Lowy and Glasband knew, or were             reckless in not knowing, that the Information Statement and             Registration Statement for which they provided information             were materially false and misleading because, among other             things, they misrepresented the ownership of the Brazilian             plantations and materially overstated the value of these             assets, properties said to be worth in excess of $50             million.             Additionally, the Complaint alleges that LARI violated the             Exchange Act\s annual and quarterly reporting requirements             and its requirements that issuers maintain proper books and             records and internal accounting controls; that Lowy and             Glasband directly or indirectly falsified, or caused to be             falsified, LARI\s books and records; and that Glasband made             false and misleading statements and omitted, or caused             others to omit, to state material facts to LARI\s accountant             in connection with the audit of LARI\s financial statements             attached to the Form 10-SB.             The Complaint seeks Final Judgments enjoining:  (a) LARI             from future violations of Exchange Act Sections 10(b),             13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B), as well as Rules 10b-5,             12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder; (b) Lowy from future             violations of Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rules 10b-5 and             13b2-1 thereunder; and (c) Glasband from future violations             of Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rules 10b-5,             13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder.  In addition, the Complaint             seeks civil penalties against Lowy and Glasband.  With the             filing of the Complaint, LARI and Glasband consented to the             entry of Final Judgments against them permanently             restraining and enjoining them from violating the Exchange             Act provisions described above; Glasband also consented to             the imposition of a $25,000 civil penalty.  LARI and             Glasband consented to the entry of the Final Judgments             without admitting or denying the Complaint\s allegations.             On August 1, 1994, the Commission suspended trading in             LARI\s securities for a ten-day period pursuant to Section             12(k) of the Exchange Act (Exchange Act Release No. 34467).             In an earlier proceeding, LARI\s former auditor, Dennis             Klein, consented to a Commission Order denying him the             privilege of practicing before the Commission as an             accountant (In the Matter of Dennis Klein, C.P.A., Exchange             Act Release No. 38844, Accounting and Auditing Enforcement             Release No. 937, July 17, 1997)."

The  Commission  filed  its civil action  in  the  United  States          District Court for the Northern  District  of  California against          Paul  C.  Jain,  former  President, Chief Executive  Officer  and          Director of Media Vision; Steven J. Allan, former Vice President,          Finance and Administration,  and  Chief Financial Officer; Robert          S.  Williams,  former  Controller;  and  Wayne  Nakamura,  former          Director of Manufacturing.          The SEC complaint alleges that Media Vision materially overstated          its financial results for the last three  quarters  of  1993,  as          well  as  the  fiscal  year  as a whole.  On July 15, 1993, Media          Vision announced revenue of $45.1  million for the second quarter          ended June 30, 1993, an amount that  was  overstated  by at least          $3.5  million,  or  eight  percent.   On  October 19, 1993, Media          Vision announced revenue of $64.3 million for  the  third quarter          ended September 30, 1993, an amount overstated by at  least $10.2          million,  or  18.9  percent.   On  February 17, 1994, the Company          released unaudited financial results  for the year ended December          31,  1993,  reporting revenue of $241.1 million,  net  income  of          $19.9 million,  and  fourth quarter revenue of $95 million.  In a          restatement  in August  1994,  Media  Vision  reported  that  its          revenue for fiscal  year  1993 was only $149.7 million, resulting          in a net loss of $99.2 million.  The previously announced results          had overstated revenue for  the  fiscal year by $91.4 million (61          percent) and net income by $119.1 million.          The  SEC  complaint  alleges  that  Media   Vision\s   false  and          misleading financial statements led the market to overvalue Media          Vision\s  stock,  which  reached  a  high of 46 1/2 (and a market          capitalization  of  $630 million) in January  1994.   During  the          spring of 1994, the media  reported   declines  in  the Company\s          business,  increasing  competition in the multimedia market,  and          ultimately, allegations  of  fraud.   On  May 10, 1994, the stock          reached an interim low of 2 5/8.          The SEC complaint also alleges that Jain and  Allan orchestrated,          and  Williams and Nakamura participated in, key  aspects  of  the          financial  reporting  fraud.   During the third and fourth fiscal          quarters of 1993, Jain and Allan directed subordinates to falsify          documents in order to artificially inflate revenue and understate          expenses in an extensive scheme  to defraud investors.  After the          end of the fiscal year, all four helped hide the fraud from Media          Vision\s outside auditors by lying  to  the auditors and creating          false accounting entries on company documents.          The SEC complaint also charges that Jain, Allan and Nakamura sold          Media Vision stock while in the possession  of material nonpublic          (or  inside) information.  The complaint alleges  that  through          these  trades,  Jain  obtained  gross  proceeds of $1.49 million;          Allan obtained gross proceeds of $825,000;  and Nakamura obtained          gross proceeds of $21,250.          In  its  complaint,  the Commission alleges that  the  defendants          violated Section 17(a)  of  the  Securities Act of 1933, Sections          10(b),  13(a),  13(b)(2)(A),  13(b)(2)(B)  and  13(b)(5)  of  the          Securities Exchange Act of 1934  and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-13,          13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder.  The  SEC  complaint  seeks against          all four Defendants a permanent injunction, disgorgement  of ill-          gotten  gains,  civil  penalties,  and  against Jain and Allan an          order barring them from serving as an officer  or director of any          public company.          Williams has pleaded guilty to one criminal count of lying to the          Commission staff and to the FBI.  The Commission  and  the United          States  Attorney\s Office for the Northern District of California          previously  brought  settled  civil  and criminal actions against          Russell Faust, former Chief Operating  Officer  and a Director of          Media   Vision,   and  Michael  Humphress,  former  Senior   Vice          President, Worldwide Sales."

Horton, Hazel A. Horton and Merle B. Gross of Irving, Texas.                According to the Commissions complaint, the defendants raised at least                $3 million from some 486 investors in several states through the                fraudulent offer and sale of American Automation, Inc. stock.  The                Hortons and Gross represented to investors that: American Automation                would develop and market its automated insurance vending machines in                high traffic areas; projected profits would be almost $100 million by                the end of its third year of operation; and  the company would make a                public offering which would significantly increase the value of the                American Automation stock.  It appears that no automated vending                machines have been sold and that American Automations only source of                revenue came from investor funds.  Additionally, according to the                complaint, the defendants used investor funds to pay for their personal                expenses, including cars, clothing and living expenses, and for business                expenses unrelated to American Automations operations.                      The temporary restraining order entered on July 10, 1998, by Judge                Fitzwater, enjoins American Automation, Kendyll R. Horton, Hazel A.                Horton and Merle B. Gross from violating the federal securities laws,                and includes an order freezing the assets of the defendants and relief                defendants, MuscleWear, Inc., Angel World Insurance Group, Inc.,                Direction Management Co., LLC, Lord & Kendyll Investments, Inc., and                Family Light Co., LLC, companies believed to be controlled by one or                more of the defendants.                      In its complaint, the Commission alleges that defendants have                violated Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and                Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5                thereunder.  The Commission also seeks an order permanently enjoining                American Automation, Kendyll R. Horton, Hazel A. Horton and Merle B.                Gross, an order requiring disgorgement of all wrongfully obtained                profits, with prejudgment interest , and civil penalties against each                defendant, as well as disgorgement with prejudgment interest against the                relief defendants.  In addition, the Commission seeks the appointment of                a receiver to conserve assets for the benefit of investors."

ASSOCIATION OF             INDIVIDUAL MINISTRIES, CHARLES R. GROESCHEL and SAGE             COMPUTER SERVICES, 98 Civ. 4840 (RPP) (S.D.N.Y.)                  The Commission announced that on July 9 it filed an             emergency action in federal court to halt a religious             pyramid scheme, the Association for Individual Ministries,             or AIM, based in Palm Desert, California.  The Commission             charged AIM and Charles Groeschel (known as Pastor Chuck)             with defrauding investors by promising huge returns in             exchange for their donations.   Groeschel, a former             Baptist pastor, aged 66, was previously convicted for a             fraudulent pyramid scheme involving Silver Eagle coins.             State of New Mexico v. Charles Groeschel a/k/a Charles             Groschel, CR 91-2288 (2d Jud. Dist. Ct. NM).  Using Biblical             language, Groeschel tells investors that the more they give,             the more they will receive.  Meanwhile, the Commission             alleges, AIM is transferring funds to a corporation             controlled by Groeschel, Sage Computer Services, which is             also named as a defendant.   The Commission also charged             that AIM had transferred over $200,000 to an off-shore bank             account immediately after Groeschel learned that the             Commission was investigating AIM.  Since mid-1996, the             Commission alleges, AIM has taken in at least $1.5 million,             from over 2,000 investors, many of whom live in the New York             area.  The Commission sought a freeze of  assets and other             emergency relief.                  Judge Robert P. Patterson, Jr., of the Southern             District of New York, granted the Commission\s emergency             application, finding at a hearing on July 9 that the             Commission had presented sufficient facts to demonstrate the             likelihood of succeeding with its complaint.  Judge             Patterson ordered a freeze of all assets controlled by             Groeschel , AIM and Sage, and ordered that a receiver be             appointed for Sage and AIM, pending a hearing scheduled for             Friday, July 17th.  The temporary restraining order and             order to show cause also order an accounting of investor             proceeds, repatriation of off-shore funds, protection of             documents, and expedited discovery.  In its complaint, the             Commission seeks permanent injunctions against future             violations of the antifraud provisions of the securities             laws, as well as disgorgement and civil penalties against             Groeschel, AIM and Sage.                  Groeschel was arrested on Wednesday, July 8th, on a             criminal complaint alleging fraudulent conduct relating to             AIM.  The U.S. Attorney\s Office for the Southern District             of New York brought the criminal charges."

Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission\s           complaint, Mersky consented to be permanently enjoined from future           violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws           found in Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of           the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rules 10b-5 and 10b-6 thereunder.           The Commission\s complaint, filed November 23, 1992, alleged that Mersky,           and others,  participated in a scheme to distribute and manipulate the           securities of Bancus Richmond, Inc., a now defunct penny stock company he           and Glenn Schuster controlled.                The Court also ordered Mersky to pay disgorgement in the amount of           $114,782.14, plus prejudgment interest of $127,352.80, representing his           gains from the conduct alleged in the complaint.

15807,1998,,"b                       U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION             Litigation Release No. 15807  /  July 13, 1998             Securities  and  Exchange Commission v. Derryl W. Peden, Civil Action No.             398-CV-483 WS        (S.D. Miss)                  The  Securities and Exchange Commission announced today             that  it  filed  a  civil action  against  Derryl  W.  Peden             (Peden),  an  attorney   in   Jackson,  Mississippi.   The             Commission\s complaint charges that  between  1987 and April             1996, Peden violated Section 17(a) of the Securities  Act of             1933  and  Section  10(b)  of the Securities Exchange Act of             1934  (Exchange  Act)  and Rule  10b-5,  by,  among  other             things, causing 39 Mississippi  counties,  cities  and towns             (collectively the municipalities) to issue and sell  urban             renewal  revenue  notes  based  on an opinion from Peden, as             bond counsel, that interest on the notes was exempt from the             federal income tax.  The complaint  alleges  that Peden knew             or  was  reckless  in  not  knowing that a substantial  risk             existed that interest on the notes was not tax exempt.  That             risk was not disclosed to investors.                  On December 2, 1994, the Commission issued a cease-and-             desist  order against Peden, directing  that  he  cease-and-             desist from  committing  or  causing  violations  or  future             violations  of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5.  See Securities             Exchange Act of 1934 Release No. 35045. That order was based             on fraudulent  offerings of purportedly tax exempt municipal             bonds unrelated to the notes in this case.  The Commission\s             complaint alleges  that  Peden\s  subsequent conduct in this             case constitutes a violation of the cease-and-desist order.                  Between  1987  and   April   1996,  the  municipalities             individually  issued,  offered  and  sold 74 separate  urban             renewal  revenue  note  issues in amounts  ranging  from  $2             million to $5 million, totaling  approximately $287,300,000.             The  notes  were sold based upon unqualified  opinions  from             Peden which concluded  that  interest  on the notes would be             exempt  from federal income tax. The notes  were  issued  in             reliance  on  the  temporary  period  exception to the anti-             arbitrage  provisions  of the Internal Revenue  Code,  which             permits municipalities to  issue  securities  and invest the             proceeds at a higher rate, provided the funds,  among  other             things,  are  reasonably  expected to be used for qualifying             municipal projects within a three year period.                  After issuance,  the bulk of the offering proceeds from             each offering was used to purchase an  investment  paying  a             higher  yield  than  the notes.  The remaining proceeds were             used to pay the premium  or fee paid to the issuer, the fees             and expenses of bond counsel,  the underwriter, the trustee,             and other costs of issuance.                  The  respective   official   statements  and  arbitrage             certificates  for  each  offering,  among  other  documents,             without exception, represented that the issuers intended  to             spend  the full amount of the offering proceeds within three             years on  various  capital projects, such as roads, parks, a             courthouse, and other  projects.  All  of the documents were             prepared  by  Peden.  Peden  knew,  or was reckless  in  not             knowing, that these statements were not  true.   None of the             municipalities  had the resources, intent or expectation  to             utilize any proceeds  from  the  offerings,  other  than the             premium  or  fee,  for capital projects.  Subsequent to  the             offerings, none of the  municipalities  utilized  any of the             offering  proceeds,  other than the premium or fee, for  any             capital project.  The  lack  of  a reasonable expectation to             utilize  more  than  a small portion  of  the  proceeds  for             capital  projects  made   the   temporary  period  exception             inapplicable, creating a substantial risk that the IRS would             declare interest on the notes subject  to the federal income             tax.             The substantial risk to the tax exempt status of interest on             the  notes  was  not disclosed to investors  or  prospective             investors in any of the offerings.                   The Commission\s complaint seeks a permanent             injunction enjoining Peden from violating the antifraud             provisions, disgorgement of his ill-gotten gains from the             scheme, and civil penalties. The Commission\s complaint also             seeks an order directing that Peden comply with the             requirements of the cease-and-desist order previously             entered against him."

Touch Tone purportedly was going to establish and operate a 900-          number dating service.  The Commission\s complaint alleged that          the defendants raised approximately $3.9 million from investors          nationwide from the sale of the Touch Tone securities from August          1994 through January 1995.  The complaint alleged that neither          the Touch Tone securities nor any of the sales offices selling          the securities were registered with the Commission.  The          complaint further alleged that Lopuszynski, Courtney, Shoucair,          Engelhardt, and their salespeople made material          misrepresentations to potential investors about the use of the          Touch Tone offering proceeds and other aspects of this          investment.

The Commission\s July 28, 1997 complaint charged that the           defendants offered and sold unregistered securities in the form of           promissory notes.  Though claiming to use the proceeds from these           notes to buy bulk telephone time and establish a calling-card           business, the defendants actually operated a Ponzi scheme in           which they used the funds from new investors to pay interest on           notes held by their older clients.  According to records obtained           by the Commission, the defendants raised approximately $4.8 million           from at least 200 investors as of July 18, 1997.                The Court ordered the defendants to pay disgorgement and           prejudgment interest in the following amounts: Insnet--           $5,452,381.66; SCB--$603,031.83; Salin--$1,517,772.35; Bravo--           $981,900.36; and Berthelot--$32,600.  Relief defendant Grijalva           consented to disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $14,641.00,           with the Commission waiving payment of all but $4011.00 based on           Grijalva\s demonstrated financial inability to pay.  Salin, Bravo,           and Berthelot were also ordered to pay civil monetary penalties of           $100,000 each.  Finally, the Court appointed a distribution agent           to disburse approximately $200,000 frozen in the defendants\ four           known bank accounts to Insnet\s investors.

Insnet, SCB, Salin, Bravo and Berthelot were all                permanently enjoined from future violations of Sections 5(a),                5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b)                of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and                Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In addition, SCB was enjoined from                future violations of 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act. The Court                also ordered all defendants to pay disgorgement, and Salin,                Bravo and Berthelot to pay civil money penalties.                Additionally, a final judgment of disgorgement was entered by                consent against Eduardo Eddie Grijalva, a defendant solely                for purposes of equitable relief.                The Commission\s complaint charged that the defendants offered                and sold unregistered securities in the form of promissory                notes.  Though claiming to use the proceeds from these notes                to buy bulk telephone time and establish a calling-card                business, the defendants actually operated a Ponzi scheme in                which they used the funds from new investors to pay interest                on notes held by their older clients.

Scheindlin                entered a final judgment of permanent injunction and other relief as to                defendant Karla Dorsch on consent.                      The complaint in this insider trading case was filed on May 17,                1994.  It alleged illegal trading from June 1989 through March 1990 by                Carlos Roman, his then wife, Karla Dorsch, and Karla Dorschs father,                William Dorsch, and by Romans stockbroker, Andrew Cohen.  The complaint                alleged that Roman and Karla Dorsch were tipped by Lee A. Haddad, an                analyst employed by Morgan Stanley, and Co., Inc., to planned corporate                acquisitions involving Time, Inc., Squibb Corporation, Combustion                Engineering, Inc., Lin Broadcasting, Inc. and American General                Corporation.                      The complaint alleged that Karla Dorsch and Roman made unlawful                trading profits of $714,118.75; that they tipped William Dorsch who made                $1,083,250 in unlawful profits and that Roman tipped Andrew Cohen who                made $300,233.81 in unlawful profits.  Haddad and Cohen previously                settled the Commissions complaint against them without admitting or                denying the allegations.

Haddad et al., December 17, 1992]                      During the course of the Commissions investigation into her                conduct, Karla Dorsch left the United States for Greece, where the                Commission served her with the summons and complaint in this action.                After Karla Dorsch left the United States she was indicted in the                Southern District of New York and charged with conspiracy and securities                fraud.  In March, 1998, she returned to the United States and thereafter                pled guilty before Judge Lawrence M. McKenna.

GILLETTE, JR.,          Civil Action No. 98- CV 1265S CGA (S.D. Cal.).          The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) announced          that on July 10, 1998, it filed and settled an action in United          States District Court against John W. Gillette, Jr. (Gillette).          The Commissions complaint alleged that, from June 1994 through          July 1997, Gillette, a resident of San Diego, California, acted          as an unregistered investment adviser to over 85 clients, most of          whom were professional athletes.  The Commission further alleged          that Gillette made materially false and misleading statements          when recommending investments to these clients, and          misappropriated client monies, resulting in client losses of over          $11 million.  Among other things, the Commission alleged that          Gillette misappropriated his clients investment profits, paid          certain clients with other clients monies, and represented he          had invested client funds in partnerships and municipal bonds          when in fact he had misappropriated those funds.  In addition,          the Commission alleges that from late 1993 through June 1994,          Gillette, who was a registered representative at the time,          liquidated the securities of a brokerage firm client without her          knowledge, and misappropriated over $400,000 from her account for          his personal benefit.  The Commission alleged that Gillette spent          the misappropriated funds on, among other things, his familys          personal expenses, his companys overhead expenses, and to invest          in undisclosed business ventures.  Finally, the Commission          alleged that, by giving investment advice to his clients in          exchange for a fee, Gillette was acting as an unregistered          investment adviser.          Without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations,          Gillette agreed to be permanently enjoined from future violations          of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of          the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and          Sections 203(a), 206(1), and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers          Act of 1940."

No.          98CV11378-NG)               The Commission announced today that the Honorable Reginald          C. Lindsay issued a  Temporary Restraining Order, an order for          the freezing of assets, an order prohibiting the acceptance of          additional investor funds, an accounting of assets, an order          requiring the repatriation to the United States of assets          transferred abroad, and other relief against Michael D.

(Meridian Monetary), William Duke          (Duke), Meridian Management Services, LLC (Meridian          Management), K. Bruce Nuckols (Nuckols), Anthony Garry          (Garry), and Thomas Connolly (Connolly).               The Commission requested this relief in a complaint, filed          on July 15, 1998 in the United States District Court for the          District of Massachusetts, which alleged that the defendants are          engaging in an on-going Ponzi scheme, offering unregistered          securities, in the form of International Certificates of          Deposits (CDs) and that $7.2 million has been raised from at          least 185 investors in fourteen states, including Massachusetts,          Virginia, Illinois and Indiana.  According to the Commission\s          allegation, since at least October 1997, Richmond has          orchestrated the Ponzi scheme, in which he used internet websites          and a network of Liberty sales agents to convince unsophisticated          investors, including many elderly persons and widows, to          liquidate annuities and other investments in order to purchase          fraudulent securities issued by RMIB.               Further, the Commission alleged that, using false          information and promotional brochures provided by Richmond, sales          agents including defendants Nuckols, Garry and Connolly falsely          informed investors that the RMIB CDs would provide a guaranteed          rate of return of 12%, 18%, or in some cases 24%, that RMIB holds          125% in cash reserves for each investment, that all investments          would be secured by Government National Mortgage Association          (GNMA) bonds, and that certain large investors will receive a          security interest in their investment evidenced by a UCC-1 issued          by the The Federal Bank.  The brochures and websites authored          by Richmond, also misrepresented that RMIB was a fully-          chartered private, offshore bank, with offices in Canada, the          Bahamas, Guernsey and Turks & Caicos.  The Commission alleges          that RMIB is a shell with no offices and no apparent significant          sources of revenue from which it can pay the guaranteed return          except through the sale of additional fraudulent securities to          unwitting investors.               In addition, the Commission charges in its complaint that          investor funds, instead of being deposited with RMIB, secured and          reinvested as represented, are being deposited into a series of          money market and bank accounts controlled by Richmond or his          affiliates, and subsequently are being used to repay other          investors and for personal expenses incurred by the Richmond and          others.  According to the complaint, of the $7.2 million raised,          only approximately $2.69 million remains to repay defrauded          investors.               In connection with this scheme, the Commission alleges that          the defendants directly and indirectly have engaged, are engaging          or are about to engage in transactions, acts, practices and          courses of business which constitute violations of the antifraud          and registrations provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and          the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  The Commission\s action          continues as the Commission seeks preliminary and permanent          injunctions against future violations, disgorgement of ill-gotten          gains and the imposition of civil monetary penalties as to all          defendants.

15814,1998,,"b                         SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION                                  Washington, D.C.          Litigation Release No. 15814/ July 16, 1998          SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION v. SAM M. ANTAR, ET AL., Civil          Action No. 93-3988 (HAA) (D.N.J. July 15, 1998)               The Honorable Harold A. Ackerman of the United States          District Court for the District of New Jersey issued a 129-page          opinion on July 15, 1998, finding in favor of the Securities          Exchange Commission on all claims and holding that defendants Sam          M. Antar, Allen Antar and Benjamin Kuszer committed insider          trading in violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of          1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and          Rule 10b-5.  The decision was based on a 22-day bench trial in          September and October 1997.  The Court found that the defendants          engaged in an extensive, multifaceted fraud beginning in the          1970s and continuing through 1987 at Crazy Eddie, Inc., an          electronics retailing chain that at its peak operated forty          stores in the greater New York metropolitan area.  Defendants\          schemes artificially inflated the price of their Crazy Eddie          stock holdings, which they sold to unwitting investors for over          $27 million.               Crazy Eddie was founded in 1969 by Eddie Antar and his          father, Sam M. Antar, 75, of West End, New Jersey.  Allen Antar,          48, of Oakhurst, New Jersey, is one of Eddie\s brothers.          Benjamin Kuszer, 48, of Brooklyn, New York, is Eddie\s brother-          in-law.               Judge Ackerman began his opinion as follows:                    There is perhaps no more insidious drain on the               overall welfare of society than greed unchecked.  The               saga of the Antar family and their operation of a major               retail consumer electronics business is but a               manifestation of that tenet.  In this and related               cases, it has become evident that various members of               the Antar family engaged in a pattern of fraud and               deceit in their attempt to enrich themselves by selling               securities, the price of which had been artificially               inflated through a multitude of schemes.  This appears               to be the last chapter in a story of a family and its               deception of the public.               The Court explicitly rejected the defendants\ trial          testimony that they were unaware of the frauds that were          committed at the company, finding that all three defendants          lacked credibility.  Judge Ackerman noted specifically with          respect to Sam M. Antar, who testified for six days at trial:          Over that time, this court obtained a rather clear sense of him          as hardworking, ambitious, and highly intelligent.  I also found          him to be a skillful and inveterate liar.                              In addition, the Court ruled in favor of the Commission on          its claims against six relief defendants, Rori Antar, Sam A.          Antar, Michelle Antar, Adam Kuszer, Sam Kuszer and Simon Kuszer,          who are nieces and nephews of Eddie Antar.  Judge Ackerman          ordered them to disgorge the proceeds -- totaling $3,150,000 --          of Crazy Eddie stock that Eddie sold on their behalf in March          1985 while he was in possession of material, nonpublic          information.  Although there was no evidence that the relief          defendants participated in or were aware of the Crazy Eddie          frauds, the Court held that they have no legitimate claim to the          fraudulent stock sale proceeds generated on their behalf by Eddie          Antar.               The Commission sued the defendants and relief defendants for          stock sales in which they reaped a total of over $27 million in          gross proceeds.  The Court stated that it would order full          disgorgement of illegal profits by the defendants and relief          defendants.  The Court also held that the protection of the          investing public necessitated that Sam M. Antar, Allen Antar and          Benjamin Kuszer be enjoined from any further violations of          federal securities laws.

Norman Greg Cornelius, et              al., 4:97CV379, USDC, ND/TX, Fort Worth                   The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission)              announced on that on March 9, 1998, a Final Judgment was entered              against Norman Greg Cornelius in United States District Court,              Fort Worth, Texas. Without admitting or denying the allegations in              the Commission\s complaint, Cornelius consented to be permanently              enjoined from future violations of  Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a)              of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities              Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.                   The Commission\s complaint alleged, among other things, that              Cornelius, doing business as Avalon Custom Homes, Inc., raised              approximately $12 million from more than 400 investors, primarily              through the sale of unregistered promissory notes.  The complaint              also alleged that Cornelius misrepresented to investors that all              of their funds would be invested in separate companies, for the              most part limited liability companies, to build residential              housing; and that such investments were low risk.  Instead,              according to the complaint, at least $653,917 of the amount was              misapplied by Cornelius, additional amounts were commingled              between and among the limited liability companies, and the              investments were, in fact, high risk ventures unsuitable for many              of the elderly investors to whom they were sold.                   The Final Judgment ordered Cornelius to pay disgorgement in              the amount of  $653,917, plus prejudgment interest; however,              payment was waived based on Cornelius\ demonstrated financial              inability to pay. Also, the Court did not impose a civil money              penalty based on Cornelius\ poor financial condition.              NORMAN G. CORNELIUS PERMANENTLY ENJOINED                   The Commission announced on that on March 9, 1998, a Final                   Judgment was entered against Norman Greg Cornelius in United                   States District Court, Fort Worth, Texas. Without admitting                   or denying the allegations in the Commission\s complaint,                   Cornelius consented to be permanently enjoined from future                   violations of  Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the                   Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities                   Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

BRUMFIELD et          al., United States District Court for the  Southern  District  of          New York, 95 Civ. 9283 (JES)               The Securities and Exchange Commission has settled its          insider trading claims against Joseph Penna based on Pennas          purchase of stock options of NCR Corporation in November 1990.          Without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, Penna          consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining          him from violating Sections 10(b) and 14e-3 of the Securities          Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3, requiring him to          disgorge his alleged unlawful trading profits of $36,671, and          ordering him to pay prejudgment interest.  Based on his          demonstrated financial inability to pay, payment of prejudgment          interest was waived and no civil penalty will be imposed.  The          settlement papers, which are subject to judicial approval, were          filed with the United States District Court for the Southern          District of New York today.               Penna, 55, of Roseland, New Jersey, is one of twenty persons          the Commission accused of participating in an insider trading          ring centered around Charles Brumfield, a former AT&T labor          relations executive who from 1988 through 1991 learned about          AT&Ts secret plans to acquire four companies.  During that          period, Penna, an executive board member of Local 827,          International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, frequently          negotiated with Brumfield over labor issues.  In its complaint,          the Commission alleged that Brumfield tipped Penna in November          1990 concerning AT&Ts plan to acquire NCR Corporation.          According to the complaint, Penna thereafter purchased a total of          approximately $3,200 worth of NCR call option contracts.  After          AT&T publicly announced an offer for NCR on December 2, 1990,          Penna sold the options for a profit of over $36,000-more than          eleven times his investment in eleven days.               The Commission filed its civil action against Brumfield,          Penna, and fifteen other defendants in October 1995.  See SEC          Lit. Rel. 14706 (Oct. 31, 1995).  Eleven of those defendants have          now settled, and two had summary judgments entered against them          based in part on their prior criminal convictions arising out of          the same scheme.  See SEC Lit. Rel. 15559 (Nov. 13, 1997).  Four          defendants-Robert Allen, Sharon Seiden, Warren Smith, and John          Lynch-remain in the case, which is scheduled for trial beginning          on January 11, 1999.  Three other alleged participants in the          insider trading ring entered into settlements with the Commission          in separate proceedings brought by the Commission in 1997 and          earlier this year.

Solv-Ex Corporation, et          al., Civil Action No. Civ. 98-860-LH  (USDC D. New Mexico)          The Commission announced the filing today of an injunctive action          against  a New Mexico corporation and two  of  its  officers  and          directors  for disseminating fraudulent statements concerning the          nature and extent of the company\s products and the status of its          purported  proprietary   technological   processes.    Named   as          defendants were Solv-Ex Corporation, its Chief Executive Officer,          John  S.  Rendall  (Rendall), and the company\s vice-president,          Herbert M. Campbell II (Campbell).          The complaint, filed  in  federal  district court in Albuquerque,          New Mexico, alleges that from January  1995  though  April  1997,          Solv-Ex,  Rendall  and  Campbell  represented  that the company\s          plant  in  Alberta,  Canada had developed operational  technology          which produced salable  bitumen  from  oil  sands on a commercial          scale,   that  this  bitumen  extraction  process  also   yielded          industrial  minerals  of  marketable quality and volume, and that          Solv-Ex had successfully tested a revolutionary electrolytic cell          capable  of  producing  metallic  aluminum.   Contrary  to  these          statements,  according  to   the   complaint,  Solv-Ex\s  bitumen          extraction process has at all times  been  in  the  research  and          development   stage,   and  the  company\s  attempts  to  recover          industrial  minerals  from  that  process,  pursued  only  on  an          experimental basis to date, have failed to yield any commercially          viable product.  Further, the Commission\s complaint alleges that          Solv-Ex\s single test of  the  electrolytic  cell, in 1996, was a          failure.  According  to the Commission\s complaint,  while  these          false and misleading statements  were being disseminated by Solv-          Ex, Rendall and Campbell, the price of the company\s stock, which          traded on the Nasdaq Small Cap Market, rose from approximately $5          per share to $38 per share.          The  Commission\s  complaint alleges  that  Solv-Ex  and  Rendall          violated the antifraud  and  issuer reporting provisions, Section          17(a) of the Securities Act of  1933, Sections 10(b) and 13(a) of          the Securities and Exchange Act of  1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20,          13a-1  and  13a-13  thereunder.   Campbell  is  alleged  to  have          violated the antifraud provisions and  to  have aided and abetted          the issuer reporting violations."

No. 97-12443-PBS)               The Commission announced that Judge Patti B. Saris issued a          judgment permanently enjoining Bond Dellapp Fletcher (Fletcher)          and Mediajet, Inc. (Mediajet) from future violations of certain          antifraud, reporting and bookkeeping provisions of the Securities          Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and ordering Fletcher to          pay disgorgement of $7,024,184, plus prejudgment interest          thereon.  Under the terms of the settlement, Fletcher will pay          approximately $3 million and the remainder will be waived based          on his demonstrated inability to pay.  Fletcher and Mediajet          consented, without admitting or denying the allegations in the          Complaint, to the entry of the final judgments.               The Commission\s Complaint, filed on October 30, 1997,          alleged that Fletcher, the owner and president of Mediajet, aided          and abetted the financial fraud conducted by Emanuel Pinez          (Pinez) and Centennial Technologies, Inc. (Centennial).          Mediajet, located in Beverly, Massachusetts, is a manufacturer of          font cartridges for laser printers.  According to the Complaint,          Pinez and Centennial engaged in a fraudulent scheme to defraud          investors in Centennial stock by falsely overstating the          company\s revenues and profits.  The Complaint alleged that          Defendants Fletcher and Mediajet aided and abetted the scheme by,          among other things, fabricating fictitious purchase orders,          signing backdated sales orders falsely acknowledging receipt of          products from Centennial, accepting shipment of mock and/or          obsolete computer equipment, and using Centennial\s funds to          purchase treasurers checks, payable to Centennial, on behalf of          purported Centennial customers.  For example, in January 1997,          Fletcher, at Pinez\s request, signed and backdated fictitious          Centennial sales orders totaling $1,250,000.  Fletcher, according          to the Complaint, was acknowledging receipt of Centennial          products for Mediajet and two other Centennial customers, when,          in fact, the only goods shipped were holiday fruit baskets.          Fletcher was enjoined from further violations of Sections 10(b),          13(a), and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules          10b-5, 13a-1, 13a-13, 13b2-1, and 12b-20.

The complaint alleged that  the investment programs were scams, the instruments  themselves bogus.

FIRST NATIONAL ENTERTAINMENT  CORP., MILTON J. VERRET, RICKY D. BUSBY, MICHAEL D. SWINGLER, RICHARD C.  MAESTRE, AUBURN R. BUSBY, AND MICHAEL B. BYRD, Civil Action No. A  95CV371 (AA) (W.D. Tex., Austin Division)  The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that on June 24,  1998, the United States District Court for the Western District of  Texas, Austin Division, entered a final judgment of permanent injunction  and other relief against defendants Milton J. Verret and Ricky D. Busby  for violations of Sections 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and  Sections 10(b), 13(a) and 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,  and Rules 10b-5, 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13, 13d-2 and 12b-20 thereunder.  Verret and Busby consented to the entry of the judgment without  admitting or denying the Commission\s allegations.  The Commission alleged that between the fall of 1992 and June 1993,  Verret and Busby, members of the management of defendant First National  Entertainment Corp. (FNAT), participated in issuing a series of false  and misleading statements to the public in various press releases and  newsletters that materially inflated the projected revenues for a  feature-length animated film called Happily Ever After.  When the film  was released, FNAT\s revenues from the film fell far short of these  projections.   According to the Commission\s complaint, First National  stock, which had traded at a high of over $9 in April 1993, fell to an  average of approximately $0.28 a share in the first five months of 1995.  The Commission sought disgorgement of illegal insider trading proceeds  from Verret and Busby, who sold stock prior to release of the movie  while allegedly in possession of material non-public information  concerning more realistic revenue projections for the film, avoiding  more than $4 million in losses.   Verret also allegedly failed to make  the required disclosures to the Commissions about his sales.   The  Commission further alleged that Verret and Busby participated in making  a series of false statements in periodic filings with the Commission and  other public statements which overstated the financing that First  National had obtained to release the film.  The Court\s judgment enjoins Verret and Busby from further violations of  the antifraud and reporting provisions, orders disgorgement of trading  profits, and payment of prejudgment interest.   The Court determined not  to impose a civil penalty and not to require payment of disgorgement and  prejudgment interest based on Verret\s and Busby\s demonstrated  inability to pay.   The judgment also permanently prohibits Verret and  Busby from acting as an officer or director of any public company.  The Commission continues to prosecute its claims against the remaining  defendants in this action, Michael B. Byrd and Richard C. Maestre.   A  trial date has been set for March 1, 1999.  The Court previously entered  final judgments of permanent injunction and other relief against  defendant FNAT on July 5, 1995, and against defendants Auburn R. Busby  and Michael D. Swingler on May 9, 1996.   On February 26, 1996, the  Commission instituted administrative proceedings in a related matter,  making findings and imposing remedial sanctions against respondents John  R. Manion and Continental Capital & Equity Corp."

Francis X. Wazeter, III, et. al., (C-97-3566-CW),             entered final judgments of permanent injunction and other             equitable relief against John W. Howell (Howell) of Sonoma,             California, Maria M. Wenner (Wenner) of San Francisco,             California, and Stanley M. Blanshei (Blanshei) of Alamo,             California, for their respective roles in a multimillion             dollar scheme involving the fraudulent misstatement of the             financial statements and accounts of International Research             and Development Corp. (IRDC), a Mattawan, Michigan company.             During the relevant period, IRDCs common stock was traded             on NASDAQ, and it filed periodic reports with the             Commission.             The Complaint in S.E.C. v. Francis X. Wazeter, III, et. al.             alleged that from at least June 1993 through at least             September 1994, Howell, the general manager of Carme, Inc.             (Carme), a Novato, California company and former subsidiary             of IRDC, Wenner, the chief financial officer of Carme, and             Blanshei, the sales manager of Carme, engaged in a scheme to             defraud investors in IRDC common stock by booking millions             of dollars in fictitious sales to various customers of             Carme, thereby materially overstating Carmes accounts             receivable, sales and earnings.  In addition, their scheme             resulted in the inclusion of these figures in IRDCs             consolidated financial statements causing IRDC to materially             overstate its accounts receivable and revenue by a total of             more than $3.5 million and its net earnings and earnings per             share by 50% to 1800% in IRDCs Forms 10-Q dated June 30,             1993, September 30, 1993, March 31, 1994, June 30, 1994 and             September 30, 1994 and its Form 10-K for the year ending             December 31, 1993, filed with the Commission.  According to             the Complaint, IRDCs inflated revenue and earnings figures             were also included in press releases issued to the public,             resulting in a fraud on the market for IRDC common stock.             The Complaint also alleged that Howell, Wenner and Blanshei             attempted to prevent detection of their scheme by, among             other things, creating false documents and lying to IRDCs             independent auditor.             Howell, Wenner and Blanshei admitted the allegations of the             Commissions complaint and, pursuant to their consent, were             permanently enjoined from future violations of Sections             10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,             and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 promulgated thereunder.  The             court also ordered Wenner and Blanshei to pay civil             penalties in the amount of $50,000 and $25,000,             respectively.  The court did not order civil penalties             against Howell based on his demonstrated inability to pay."

The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission)             announced today that  on July 28, 1998, it filed a Complaint             in the United States District Court for the Central District             of California charging seven individuals and three             businesses from Orange County, California (Defendants)             with securities fraud in a multi-million dollar scheme             concerning oil and gas partnerships (Partnerships).             Named in the Complaint are:  Larry R. Crowder (Crowder),             age 40, residing in Coto de Caza, California; John R. Powell             (Powell), age 40, residing in Laguna Beach, California;             and three Irvine, California based businesses --             Environmental Energy, Inc. (EEI), Environmental Operating,             Inc. (EOI) and Irvine Securities, Inc. (Irvine             Securities).  Also named in the Complaint are five             securities salesmen:  Christian R. Higgins (Higgins), age             22, residing in Newport Beach, California; Charles L. Powell             (C. Powell), age 45, residing in Huntington Beach,             California; James P. Gallaher (Gallaher), age 44, residing             in San Juan Capistrano, California; Dale J. Engelhardt             (Engelhardt), age 33, residing in Trabuco Canyon,             California; and Trey L. Friedmann (Friedmann), age 33,             residing in Costa Mesa, California.             According to the Complaint, from 1993 to the present,             Crowder and Powell developed and ran the Partnership scheme             through EEI, EOI and Irvine Securities, raising $15.7             million from over 600 investors nationwide.  Partnership             offering documents provided to investors represented that             large percentages of the investor funds would be used to             acquire oil and gas interests, and the offering documents             sometimes explicitly stated that these acquisition             transactions would be between EEI (directly or through an             affiliate) and that EEI would make a profit on the             transaction.  The offering documents, however, do not             adequately disclose the extent of the profit that EEI made             on the acquisition transactions.  The Complaint alleges             that, in fact, EEI made massive profits that ranged from at             least 159% to over 64,000% of the amount that EEI paid.             Crowder, Powell, EOI and Irvine Securities also represented             to investors that certain oil and gas interests would be             purchased when, in fact, Crowder and Powell knew that they             had lost the right to purchase those interests because their             option contract had expired.             The Complaint further alleges that the salesmen made             material misrepresentations in their solicitations to             investors by inflating the expected return on investment,             overstating the actual return on investment, misrepresenting             that they themselves had invested in the Partnerships (they             had not) and misrepresenting the status of a related utility             that was to buy gas produced from the Partnerships.             The Commission seeks permanent injunctions and civil             penalties against all of the Defendants.  It also seeks             disgorgement of ill-gotten gains and prejudgment interest             against Crowder, Powell, EEI and EOI.             The Commission charged Crowder, Powell, EEI, EOI, and Irvine             Securities with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a)             of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section             10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange             Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Commission             additionally charged Irvine Securities with violations of             Section 15(c) of the Exchange Act and Rule 15c1-2             thereunder.  The Commission charged Higgins, C. Powell,             Gallaher and Engelhardt with violations of Section 17(a) of             the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and             Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Finally, the Commission charged             Friedmann with violations of Sections 17(a) of the             Securities Act and Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act."
15823,1998,,"b          SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION   Litigation Release No.  15823 / July 30, 1998   SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION v. JAMES R. BEERS, United States   District Court for the District of Columbia, Civil Action No.:  98-1884   (CKK)   The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced the filing of a   civil injunctive action for illegal insider trading against James R.   Beers, a certified public accountant and managing partner of Beers &   Cutler, a Washington, D.C., accounting firm.   The Commission\s Complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the   District of Columbia, alleges that on March 7, 8, and 10, 1995, Beers,   while in possession of material, nonpublic information concerning the   likelihood of a sale of Columbia First Bank (CFB), purchased a total   of 1,000 shares of CFB stock.  On April 6, approximately one month after   Beers\s purchases, CFB and First Union Corporation (FTU) announced the   signing of a merger agreement whereby FTU would acquire all outstanding   shares of CFB for $60 per share.  Following the public announcement that   day, the market price of CFB rose to $56 a share, up $10.50 from the   prior day\s closing price.  The Complaint alleges that Beers realized   $14,500 in illegal profits from his March trades.   According to the Complaint, Beers had been the longtime personal   accountant to the chairman of the board of CFB.  In the fall of 1994,   CFB\s chairman spoke to Beers about his lack of liquidity and how that   problem could be solved.  The sale of CFB was discussed as a solution to   the problem.  CFB\s chairman and his family owned approximately 75   percent of the CFB stock held by CF Financial Associates, L.P. (CF   Financial), a limited partnership that held as its only asset a   controlling block of CFB stock.  CFB\s chairman also controlled the   general partner of CF Financial.   In September 1994, the Complaint alleges, CFB\s chairman decided to   sell, or seek to merge, CFB.  That decision caused CFB\s chairman to   seek tax planning advice from Beers\s firm sometime in September or   October of 1994 regarding the income tax implications to him of the   bank\s eventual sale or merger.  The Complaint alleges that between   approximately September 1, 1994, and December 29, 1994, CFB\s chairman   had conversations with Beers about whether he should change his   residency from Maryland to Florida, and how the sale of CFB would affect   that decision.  In this time period, CFB\s chairman also had further   conversations with Beers about his lack of liquidity and how to solve   this problem, and a sale of CFB was discussed as such a solution.   According to the Complaint, based on Beers\s knowledge of the chairman\s   financial condition, and conversations he had with the chairman prior to   and at a meeting with the chairman on December 29, 1994, Beers concluded   that a sale of CFB would be a solution to the chairman\s liquidity bind.   The Complaint further alleges that on March 6, 1995, a partner at   Beers\s firm consulted with Beers about a memo the partner was preparing   for CFB\s chairman on tax planning that assumed CF Financial would   report income.  As of the date of this meeting, CF Financial had never   reported income.  The next day, March 7, Beers purchased 100 shares of   CFB.  In addition, the Complaint alleges that on March 8, 1995, Beers   met with a lawyer who was providing advice to CFB\s chairman in   connection with the chairman\s contemplated sale or merger of CFB.   During this meeting, Beers and the lawyer discussed matters relating to   the chairman\s tax planning, including a memo the lawyer\s firm had   prepared on March 6 for CFB\s chairman that contained statements such as   if the sale of [CFB] is structured as a tax-free exchange for stock    . . . [or] is structured as a taxable sale of stock for cash . . . .   That day, March 8, Beers purchased 175 shares of CFB.  Finally, on March   10, Beers purchased 725 shares of CFB.   Simultaneously with the filing of the Complaint, Beers, without   admitting or denying the allegations of the Commission\s Complaint,   consented to the entry of a proposed Final Judgment of Permanent   Injunction and Other Relief that would enjoin him from violating Section   10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.   Beers also agreed to disgorge $14,500, plus prejudgment interest thereon   of $4,659.32, and to pay a civil penalty of $14,500, pursuant to the   Insider Trading Sanctions Act of 1984.  The Commission has submitted the   proposed Final Judgment for approval and entry by the Court.  The   Commission acknowledges the assistance of the National Association of   Securities Dealers, Inc., in this matter."

HOTTOVY, JIMMY          DUCKWORTH, JOSEPH I. MORRIS and EUGENE A. BREITENBACH, Civil          Action No. 98-S-1636 (D.Col.) (filed July 30, 1998)          On July 30, 1998, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a          financial fraud action seeking permanent injunctions and monetary          and other relief in the United States District Court for the          District of Colorado against four former senior officers of          Scientific Software-Intercomp, Inc. (SSI), a Denver, Colorado oil          and gas software company -- Ronald J. Hottovy (Hottovy),          formerly SSI\s chief financial officer, who is a certified public          accountant (CPA), Jimmy Duckworth (Duckworth), formerly SSI\s          executive vice president for sales and member of the board of          directors, who is an inactive CPA, Joseph I. Morris (Morris),          formerly SSI\s corporate controller, who is a CPA, and Eugene A.          Breitenbach (Breitenbach), formerly SSI\s chief executive          officer and chairman of the board of directors.          The Commission\s complaint alleges that during 1993, 1994 and          1995, the defendants engaged in a fraudulent scheme to materially          overstate SSI\s revenue and earnings by backdating contracts,          booking revenue without contracts, overaccruing project revenues          and providing confidential side letters modifying payment          obligations.  As a result of these practices, the complaint          alleges that SSI reported false and misleading information in its          Annual Reports for fiscal 1993 and 1994, its Quarterly Reports          for the first three quarters of fiscal 1994 and the first quarter          of fiscal 1995.  In addition, SSI conducted an offering of 2          million shares of common stock from which it obtained more than          $8 million on a registration statement that materially overstated          revenue, net income and earnings per share for the 1993 fiscal          year and the first quarter of 1994.  The complaint further          alleges that defendants misled SSI\s auditors by withholding          documents and creating false documents to support revenue          recognition.  Specifically, defendants withheld the side letters          from SSI\s auditors, backdated documentation and, in the first          quarter of 1995, created false affidavits supporting revenue          recognition.  By engaging in such conduct, the complaint alleges          that defendants violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of          1933, and Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange          Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder.          Simultaneous with the filing of the complaint, without admitting          or denying the allegations of the complaint, Breitenbach          consented to the entry of a permanent injunction prohibiting          future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and          Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5,          13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder, ordering Breitenbach to disgorge          $33,600 of profits predicated on the acts alleged in the          complaint, plus prejudgment interest thereon of $9,961, and          directing Breitenbach to pay a civil penalty of $50,000.          Also on July 30, 1998, the Commssion entered two settled          administrative orders.  Ivor R. Ellul and Joseph R. Summa, two          managers in SSI\s Houston-based Pipeline and Facilities Division          consented, without admitting or denying the Commission\s          findings, to the entry of a cease and desist order finding that          Ellul and Summa caused violations of Section 10(b) of the          Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and violated Section          13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder. The          Commission\s order finds that Ellul and Summa assisted in SSI\s          improper booking of revenue by, among other things, backdating          contracts and executing side letters at the Pipeline and          Facilities Division, where the majority of the accounting          improprieties occurred.  Barbara J. Cavallo, the division          controller in the Houston Pipeline and Facilities Division,          consented, without admitting or denying the Commission\s          findings, to the entry of a cease and desist order finding that          Cavallo caused violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act          and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13, by, among other things,          holding the Houston Pipeline and Facilities Division\s books open          after quarter-end at the direction of senior management, and          preparing inaccurate division financial statements incorporated          into SSI\s public filings.

SCHWARTZ, BROAD          CAPITAL ASSOCIATES, INC., MURRAY A. HUBERFELD, AND DAVID B.          BODNER, Civil Action No. CV 98-6142 DDP (MCx)(C.D. Cal.)               On July 30, 1998, the Commission announced that it filed          various legal proceedings against Incomnet, Inc., a publicly held          corporation headquartered in Woodland Hills, California, and          three of its former officers and directors for their roles in a          series of fraudulent schemes in violation of the federal          securities laws.  The Commission also charged Broad Capital          Associates, Inc. and Broad Capitals owners with violations of          the securities registration and reporting provisions of the          federal securities laws.               The proceedings brought by the Commission include a lawsuit          filed in federal court in Los Angeles against Sam D. Schwartz,          Incomnets former President and Chairman of the Board, Broad          Capital, and Broad Capitals owners, Murray A. Huberfeld and          David B. Bodner.  Schwartz, who is 58 years old and a resident of          Encino, California, is charged with securities fraud for causing          Incomnet to file false forms with the Commission and issue false          press releases.  Schwartz is also charged with using a nominee          account to personally trade in Incomnet securities and for          failing to disclose this trading as required by the federal          securities laws.               Specifically, the Complaint alleges that on August 28, 1995,          Schwartz caused Incomnet to file a Form 8-K with the Commission          which falsely stated that Schwartz had received prior written          approval and consent from Incomnets Board of Directors to          establish a personal account to trade in Incomnets stock.  The          Complaint further alleges that Schwartz caused Incomnet to issue          a false press release in September 1995 that repeated some of the          false statements in the Form 8-K and to file a Form 10-Q with the          Commission in November 1995 that referenced the false Form 8-K.          Finally, the Complaint alleges that in January 1995, Schwartz          caused Incomnet to issue two press releases falsely denying the          existence of the Commissions then-ongoing investigation of          Incomnet, even though Schwartz knew at that time of the          Commissions investigation.               The Complaint also alleges that from June 1994 through July          1995, Schwartz purchased, through a nominee account,          approximately 1,100,000 shares of Incomnet stock and sold          approximately 900,000 shares of Incomnet stock without timely          disclosing these transactions.  The Complaint seeks to          permanently enjoin Schwartz from future violations of Sections          10(b), 13(a), 13(d), and 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of          1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-11, 13a-13, and 16a-3          thereunder.  The Complaint also seeks a civil monetary penalty          from Schwartz.                       The Complaint also charges Broad Capital, a private          investment firm based in New York City which acted as a          consultant to Incomnet, Huberfeld, age 37, and Bodner, age 41,          both residents of New York, with receiving over 513,000 shares of          restricted Incomnet stock from Joel W. Greenberg, a former          director of Incomnet, and immediately reselling these shares for          a profit of approximately $3,700,000 in violation of the          securities registration provisions of the federal securities          laws.  Additionally, the Complaint alleges that Broad Capital          never disclosed that it held over 5% of Incomnets outstanding          securities, as required by the reporting provisions of the          federal securities laws.  Broad Capital, Huberfeld, and Bodner          agreed to settle this matter by consenting to a judgment, without          admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions          Complaint, that enjoins them from committing future violations of          the securities registration and reporting provisions of the          federal securities laws.  The judgment also orders Broad Capital,          Huberfeld, and Bodner, to disgorge their profits plus interest,          for a total of $4,694,125.  Finally, the judgment orders Broad          Capital to pay a civil penalty of $50,000 and Huberfeld and          Bodner each to pay a civil penalty of $15,000.               The Commission also brought a cease-and-desist proceeding          against Incomnet, Greenberg, and Stephen A. Caswell, a former          officer and director of Incomnet.  In this proceeding, the          Commission found that Incomnet violated the antifraud and          reporting provisions of the federal securities laws by filing          materially false forms with the Commission and by issuing several          false press releases, and that Greenberg and Caswell caused          Incomnets violations of these provisions.  The Commission also          found that Greenberg failed to disclose a loan arrangement he          entered into in January 1995 with Broad Capital in which he used          513,167 shares of Incomnet stock as collateral.

KHAN AND TIMOTHY J.          TYRRELL, Civil Action No. CV-98-6143 MMM (SHx) (C.D. Cal.)          The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a complaint today in          federal district court in Los Angeles against Rafi M. Khan          charging him with fraud for engaging in stock manipulation. Khan,          age 47, is a Los Angeles-area stockbroker who the Commission          alleges manipulated the stocks of two companies, Future          Communications, Inc. (FCMI), a now defunct cable television          programming company based in Dallas, Texas, and The L. L.          Knickerbocker Co., Inc. (KNIC), a celebrity-endorsed marketing          company based in Lake Forest, California.  From June 30 to August          30, 1993, FCMI\s stock price rose from $6.50 to $27.25. Shortly          thereafter, FCMI\s price collapsed and the company declared          bankruptcy.  From July 3 to August 11, 1995, KNIC\s stock price          rose from $6 to $52 per share.  Shortly thereafter, the price          dropped 46%.          The Complaint alleges that Khan orchestrated these price runs          using a variety of manipulative practices, including acquiring          substantial control of the market for each stock; restricting the          available supply of each stock; making purchases to stabilize or          raise the price of each stock; executing unauthorized trades;          parking stock in fictitious and nominee accounts and discouraging          sales in order to maintain control of the market; creating demand          by making misleading statements and touting wildly exaggerated          earnings projections; promoting a short squeeze scheme, i.e.,          using market control to withhold stock from short sellers and          concurrently raise stock prices to force short sellers to cover          their positions at increasing prices; and engaging in trading          collusion.  The Complaint alleges that Khan and a relative had a          significant financial stake in both manipulations.  Khan\s          improper trading profit from the two manipulations was $552,500.          The Complaint alleges he would have realized significant          additional gains had he and his relative sold their available          stock at the artificially inflated prices.          The Complaint also alleges that Los Angeles-area stockbroker          Timothy J. Tyrrell, age 37, committed fraud by participating in          the FCMI manipulation.  Tyrrell was a market maker for FCMI stock          at Reynolds Kendrick Stratton, Inc., the now defunct brokerage          firm where he and Khan worked, and acted as Khan\s trader during          the FCMI stock manipulation.  The Complaint alleges that Tyrrell          engaged in a variety of manipulative practices to create          artificially high prices for FCMI stock, including  refusing to          execute sell orders (as a means to maintain control of the market          for FCMI stock); purchasing FCMI stock and raising FCMI\s bid          price merely for the purpose of creating artificially high stock          prices; promoting and furthering a short squeeze scheme; and          orchestrating a collusive trading arrangement with another market          maker, Paul I. Comi, who worked at the now defunct AmeriNational          Securities brokerage firm.  Comi previously consented, without          admitting or denying the Commission\s findings, to the entry of a          cease-and-desist order, a $5,000 civil penalty, and a six-month          suspension from associating with a broker-dealer.  In the Matter          of Paul I. Comi, Exchange Act Release No. 39968 (May 6, 1998).          The Complaint alleges that Tyrrell had a significant financial          stake in the FCMI manipulation.  Tyrrell\s improper trading          profit was $224,850.  The Complaint alleges he would have          realized significant additional gains had he sold his available          stock at the artificially inflated prices.          Khan allegedly manipulated KNIC stock from his one-person          Southern California office of Shamrock Partners, Ltd., a Media,          Pennsylvania based brokerage firm.          The Complaint alleges that as a result of their conduct, Khan and          Tyrrell violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the          Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities          Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Complaint          seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement with prejudgment          interest, and civil penalties."

Calvin Douglas Brace, et          al., Civil Action No. 98-Z-1644 (D. Colo.)               The Commission filed a complaint charging Calvin Douglas          Brace (Brace), GAI Holdings, Ltd. (GAI Holdings), Howard Wesley          Huether (Huether), and G2 Resources, Ltd. (G2 Resources) with          operating between November 1995 and March 1997 a Ponzi scheme          through which they falsely promised that investors\ funds would          be used to purchase nonexistent prime bank notes. The complaint          alleges that Brace, a resident of Colorado, and GAI Holdings, a          Bahamian corporation, raised $5.5 million from investors residing          nationwide and in Canada, of which Huether, a resident of          Alberta, Canada, and G2 Resources, a Canadian corporation, raised          $1.3 million.               The complaint alleges that Brace, Huether, GAI Holdings and          G2 Resources made numerous materially false statements and          omissions to investors concerning, among other things, the          existence of prime bank instruments and related trading programs,          investors\ ability to achieve the rates of return of up to 30          percent a month, the lack of risk to investors, and the use of          investor proceeds.  According to the complaint, Brace and Huether          used new investor proceeds to pay previous investors as part of a          Ponzi scheme, and diverted approximately $858,000 and $208,000 to          their respective personal uses.               The complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the          District of Colorado, seeks to permanently enjoin Brace, Huether,          GAI Holdings and G2 Resources, from further violations of          Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933,          Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange          Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Additionally, the complaint          seeks to enjoin Huether and G2 Resources from violating Section          15(a) of the Exchange Act because they did not register as          broker-dealers before soliciting investors.  The complaint also          seeks disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in          regard to all defendants.               The Commission thanks the Arizona Securities Commission for          its assistance in this matter."
15829,1998,,"b                  U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION          Litigation Release No. 15829 / August 3, 1998          SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION v. DAIN RAUSCHER, INC.,          KENNETH D. OUGH, AND VIRGINIA O. HORLER, Civil Action No. SA CV          98-639 LHM (ANx) (C.D. Cal.).          The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on          August 3, 1998, it filed a Complaint in federal court in Los          Angeles against the broker-dealer Dain Rauscher, Inc. and two          investment bankers, Kenneth D. Ough and Virginia O. Horler.  The          Complaint charges the defendants with fraud in the offer and sale          of over $980 million in notes by municipal issuers in          Orange County, California, in 1993 and 1994.  This lawsuit is the          Commission\s latest enforcement action in its ongoing          investigation relating to the financial collapse of Orange          County.  The Commission is seeking permanent injunctions and          civil penalties against each of the defendants.          Dain Rauscher underwrote or was financial adviser for thirteen          municipal bond offerings related to the Orange County Investment          Pools (the Pools).  Twelve of the municipal bond offerings were          of Taxable Notes.  These notes were offered for the sole purpose          of generating profits by investing the proceeds in the Pools,          specifically either in the Commingled Pool or in specific          investments with the Orange County Treasurer.  The municipalities          which issued these Taxable Notes were the City of Anaheim, City          of Irvine, North Orange County Community College District, Irvine          Unified School District, Orange County Board of Education, and          Newport-Mesa Unified School District.  The thirteenth offering          was a pooled offering of tax-exempt Tax and Revenue Anticipation          Notes (the Pooled TRANs) issued by Orange County on behalf of          27 educational districts located in Orange County.  The repayment          account for the Pooled TRANs was invested in the Commingled Pool.          The Commission alleges in its Complaint that the offering          documents for the Taxable Notes and the Pooled TRANs (known as          Official Statements) were materially misleading to investors in          the securities.  Dain Rauscher, Ough, and Horler participated in          drafting the Official Statements and approved these documents for          use in sales to investors.  The Complaint further alleges that          Dain Rauscher, Ough, and Horler knew, or were reckless in not          knowing, significant negative information that was misrepresented          in and/or omitted from the Official Statements.  Specifically,          the Official Statements failed to disclose to investors that:\x07the sole purpose of the offerings was to invest in the Pools forinvestment profit;\x07the Pools\ investment strategy was premised on the assumption thatinterest rates would remain relatively low for at least three years;\x07the Pools employed a high degree of leverage through reverse repurchaseagreements, which magnified the risk of loss in the event of a rise ininterest rates;\x07the Pools invested heavily in certain risky derivative securities thatreacted negatively to a rise in interest rates; and\x07as a result of rises in interest rates during 1994, the Pools had sufferedsignificant market losses and collateral calls.          The Complaint further alleges that, with respect to the Pooled          TRANs offering, Dain Rauscher and Ough also knew, or were          reckless in not knowing, that 17 of the educational districts in          the Pooled TRANs offering passed resolutions restricting certain          moneys in their general funds.  The effect of the restrictions          was to increase the amount the districts could borrow on a tax-          exempt basis and invest in the Commingled Pool.  The Official          Statement for the Pooled TRANs failed to disclose these facts to          investors, and failed to disclose that the Internal Revenue          Service could challenge the tax-exempt status of the offering          based upon the actions taken by these 17 school districts.          The Commission\s Complaint charges Dain Rauscher, Ough, and          Horler with fraud in the offer and sale of these securities in          violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and          Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange          Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and with deceptive, dishonest,          and unfair practices in violation of Section 15B(c)(1) of the          Exchange Act and Rule G-17 of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking          Board.  The Commission has also charged Dain Rauscher with fraud          by a broker-dealer in violation of Section 15(c)(1) of the          Exchange Act and Rule 15c1-2.  The defendants named in this          action are:Dain Rauscher, Inc., a registered broker-dealer.  Rauscher Pierce Refsnes, Inc., a Dallas-based brokerage firm and investment adviser, merged into Dain Rauscher on January 3, 1998.  Dain Rauscher was the senior underwriter for 11 of the Taxable Note offerings.  As underwriter, Dain Rauscher purchased the Taxable Notes from the issuers and sold them to investors.  Dain Rauscher also was the financial adviser for one offering of Taxable Notes and the Pooled TRANs offering.  As financial adviser, Dain Rauscher advised the issuers on structuring the transactions, and participated in drafting and reviewing the Official Statements;Kenneth D. Ough, age 45, of Post Falls, Idaho.  Ough was employed by Dain Rauscher from 1993 through 1995 in Glendale, California, and from 1996 to 1997 in the firm\s San Francisco office.  In 1993 and 1994, Ough was a Vice President in the Public Finance Department of Dain Rauscher\s Municipal Securities Division.  Ough was the investment banker assigned to Dain Rauscher\s underwriting of nine of the Taxable Note offerings.  Ough was also the Dain Rauscher investment banker assigned to represent the firm in its financial adviser engagements in connection with one Taxable Note offering and the Pooled TRANs; andVirginia O. HorlerViVvvFFfiiiwkw, age 57, of Moraga, California.  Horler was employed by Dain Rauscher from 1983 through March 1998.  In 1993 and 1994, Horler was a Senior Vice President and co-Managing Director in the Public Finance Department of the Municipal Securities Division in Dain Rauscher\s San Francisco office.  Horler was the investment banker assigned to two of the Taxable Note offerings.          Earlier this year, the Commission instituted and settled an          administrative proceeding against CS First Boston and two of that          broker-dealer\s investment bankers for fraudulent conduct in the          offer and sale of securities issued by Orange County.  In a          lawsuit filed in 1996, the Commission obtained injunctions          against Orange County\s former Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L.          Citron and former Assistant Treasurer Matthew R. Raabe for their          fraudulent conduct in the offer and sale of over $2.1 billion in          municipal securities issued by Orange County and two local          governmental agencies.  In a separate administrative proceeding,          the Commission ordered Orange County, the Orange County Board of          Supervisors, and a local government agency to cease and desist          from future fraudulent conduct in the offer and sale of          securities.  The Commission also previously issued a report          relating to the conduct of the individual members of the Board of          Supervisors in the offer and sale of securities.          The Commission\s investigation remains ongoing.                                        - 1 -"

The           arrest warrant is the latest development in Moss continuing failure to           fully comply with a Securities and Exchange Commission subpoena served           on Moss on November 11, 1997. The subpoena required Moss to appear and           testify and produce certain documents and records related to Moss           financial dealings and securities sales activities.                When Moss failed to comply with the Commissions subpoena, the           Commission filed an application with the Court on May 4, 1998 to           enforce compliance. On May 13,  Judge McBryde ordered Moss to appear in           Court on July 17 to provide evidence as to why he should not be           compelled to comply with the Commissions subpoena. At the hearing on           July 17,  Judge McBryde ordered Moss to appear at the Commissions           offices on July 20 to testify and produce all required documents. On           July 20, Moss appeared for testimony at the Commissions offices, but           failed to produce all the documents mentioned in the subpoena in           violation of the Courts order. Upon a second subpoena enforcement           application by the Commission on July 29, Judge McBryde ordered Moss to           appear  again in Court on August 3 or be subject to coercive sanctions           to enforce compliance of the Commissions subpoena.  Moss failure to           appear before Judge McBryde as ordered prompted the issuance of the           arrest warrant."

SONY CORPORATION, CaseNo.  1:98CV01935 (D.D.C.) (filed August 5, 1998)     On August 5, 1998, the Commission issued a settledcease-and-desist order against Sony Corporation (Sony) andSumio Sano (Sano) and filed a related settled complaintagainst Sony in the United States District Court for theDistrict of Columbia.     In the settled cease-and-desist order, the Commissionfound that Sony, a Japanese corporation whose securitiestrade on the New York Stock Exchange in the form of AmericanDepositary Receipts, violated the periodic reportingprovisions applicable to foreign private issuers in Section13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 13a-1, 13a-16, and 12b-20 thereunder, and that Sano, who was adirector of Sony and the General Manager of its CapitalMarket and Investor Relations Division during the relevantperiod, was a cause of Sony\s violations.  Specifically, theCommission found that during the four months precedingSony\s November 1994 writedown of approximately $2.7 billionof goodwill associated with the acquisition of its SonyPictures subsidiary, Sony made inadequate disclosures aboutthe nature and extent of Sony Pictures\ net losses and theirimpact on the consolidated results Sony was reporting.Those inadequate disclosures were contained in two currentreports furnished to the Commission on Form 6-K, whichincluded copies of quarterly earnings releases issued bySony, and in the Management\s Discussion and Analysissections of Sony\s annual report to shareholders for thefiscal year ended March 31, 1994, and its annual reportfiled with the Commission on Form 20-F for the same fiscalyear.  The Commission also noted that during the relevantperiod, Sony did not report the results of Sony Pictures asa separate industry segment, but instead reported thecombined results of Sony Pictures and Sony\s profitablemusic business as a single entertainment segment, whichhad the effect of obscuring the losses sustained by SonyPictures.     The Commission ordered Sony to cease and desist fromcommitting or causing violations of the Exchange Actprovisions cited above, and ordered Sano to cease and desistfrom causing such violations.  The Commission also orderedSony to comply with three undertakings:  (i)  to engage anindependent auditor to examine its MD&A presentation for thefiscal year ending March 31, 1999; (ii) to adopt andimplement procedures and practices to ensure that Sony\sChief Financial Officer will be designated henceforth as theofficer primarily responsible for ensuring that Sony\spublic financial disclosures are accurate and otherwise incompliance with applicable legal and accountingrequirements; and (iii) to continue to apply FAS 131, whichprovides guidance relating to industry segment reporting,for purposes of reporting its financial results.  Insettling the proceeding, Sony and Sano consented to issuanceof the Commission\s order without admitting or denying thematters set forth therein.     In its Complaint filed in federal court against Sony,the Commission alleged the same violations as it found inits administrative order, and requested the Court to imposea civil penalty pusuant to Exchange Act Section 21(d)(3).In settling the case, Sony consented to entry of a finaljudgment imposing a $1 million penalty without admitting ordenying the allegations in the Commission\s complaint.

BAKRIE, CivilAction No. 98 CIV 5570 (AGS) (S.D.N.Y.)   (filed August 6, 1998)On August  6, 1998, the Securities and Exchange Commission(Commission) filed an insider trading complaint in the UnitedStates District Court for the Southern District of New York againstAnindya N. Bakrie (Bakrie), a former junior financial analyst inthe Global Power Group of Salomon Smith Barney Inc.\s New Yorkoffice (Salomon). The Commission\s complaint alleges that Bakrie,an Indonesian national, engaged in insider trading in a companythat was involved in merger negotiations for which Salomon\s GlobalPower Group was participating as an adviser.Specifically, the complaint alleges that:*    On September 5, 1997, Bakrie asked his friend, Roy Handojo, to  purchase common stock of Washington Gas Light Company (Washington  Gas) on Bakrie\s behalf, promising to share any resulting profits  with Handojo.*    At the time, Washington Gas was engaged in confidential merger  negotiations with a potential acquirer, Consolidated Natural Gas  Company (Consolidated), for which Salomon, including its Global  Power Group, was serving as investment banker.*    On September 5, 1997, Handojo purchased 25,000 shares of  Washington Gas common stock for a total investment of $650,000.*    In the days prior to September 5, Bakrie had learned through  Salomon that a merger announcement was imminent.*    Bakrie had also performed limited work on the transaction for  Salomon in August 1997.*    On September 7, 1997, Bakrie learned through Salomon that the  merger was no longer likely.*    Immediately thereafter, Bakrie told Handojo that he had  changed his mind about purchasing Washington Gas stock.*    Over the next two days, September 8 and 9, 1997, Handojo sold  all of the Washington Gas stock, incurring a $13,869 loss.On September 12, 1997, the Commission filed an emergency civilaction against Handojo in the United States District Court for theSouthern District of New York concerning unrelated allegations ofinsider trading (SEC v. Handojo, 97 Civ. 6805 (LAP)). See Lit. Rel.Nos. 15492 and 15540.  That same day, the U.S. Attorney\s Officefor the Southern District of New York arrested Handojo for the sameconduct alleged in the Commission\s complaint in SEC v. Handojo.According to the complaint in SEC v. Bakrie:*    Within a week after Handojo\s arrest, Bakrie abruptly returned  to Indonesia to work for the Bakrie Group, which is an Indonesian  conglomerate engaged in the business of, among other things,  raising capital in the international markets and providing  financial advisory services.*    Bakrie resigned from Salomon shortly after returning to  Indonesia.The Commission\s complaint seeks a permanent injunction againstBakrie for violations of the antifraud provisions of the SecuritiesExchange of 1934 (Exchange Act) and civil penalties.Simultaneously with the filing of the Commission\s complaint,Bakrie consented, without admitting or denying the allegations ofthe complaint, to the entry of a final judgment permanentlyenjoining him from violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act andRule 10b-5 thereunder and ordering him to pay a $40,000 civilpenalty."

Edward  Snyder  et al., Civil Action No. 3:98CV1215-H          (USDC ND Tex).          On May 22, 1998, the  Commission filed a complaint in the U.S.          District Court, Northern District of Texas, against Edward Snyder          (Snyder) and Robert E. Carroll (Carroll) for the fraudulent sale          of at least $516,000 in securities to investors in several          states.  The complaint alleges that from about October 1997          through February 1998 Snyder and Carroll had marketed an          investment roll program, also referred to as an investment          enhancement program, in which investors would invest funds with          Carroll.  These funds were to be pooled and invested by Carroll          in prime bank instruments, bank guarantees, or bank          debentures through a major world bank in Europe.  Investors          were promised returns of between 10 percent and 100 percent per          month over a period of from 30 days to five years, to be          generated by repeated purchases and sales of these bank          instruments.  Funds received from investors appear to have been          diverted to Carroll\s personal use.          The complaint alleges that the defendants violated Section 17(a)          of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities          Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks          preliminary and permanent injunctions, an asset freeze, civil          penalties, accountings, and disgorgement. A temporary restraining          order and asset freeze was entered on May 22, 1998, by the          Honorable Barefoot Sanders, United States District Judge.  On          June 12, 1998, Judge Sanders entered an order of preliminary          injunction against Snyder and Carroll pursuant to their consent."

Causey  (Causey),  Haven          Quest  and  Cayman  South  International,  Inc.  (Cayman).  The          complaint  alleges  that  defendants Cook and Causey  used  their          controlled entities Haven Quest and Cayman to orchestrate a prime          bank offer and sale of investments  in  fraudulent  international          trading program using misrepresentations and omissions of fact to          investors  and  agents.  The  Commission also announces that,  on          August 6, 1998, Judge Jack T. Camp  of the United States District          Court for the Northern District of Georgia  entered  a  temporary          restraining  order against the four defendants and directed  that          their assets be frozen and that they provide an accounting.             The  Commission\s  complaint  alleges  that  Cook  and  Causey          individually  and  through   Haven Quest and Cayman, effected the          scheme by falsely promoting the  purported  trading  programs  as          legitimate,  virtually no-risk investments with projected returns          of 900% in 20  weeks  for  the Cayman program and up to 500% over          ten months for the Haven Quest  program, when the programs touted          were  non-existent  and they had no  reasonable  basis  for  such          projections.  Cook and  Causey  falsely represented that investor          funds  would  be  secured by bank certificates  of  deposit,  and          failed to disclose that Haven Quest would pay at least 20% of all          investor funds directly  to  themselves  as purported commissions          pursuant to undisclosed agreements with Haven  Quest.   Cook  and          Causey also failed to disclose that $430,000 of funds raised from          Haven  Quest  investors  would be used to refund monies to Cayman          program  investors when the  Cayman  program  failed  due  to  an          unsuccessful  trade.  The  complaint further alleges that while          continuing their scheme, the defendants  conducted  offerings  by          use  of  the  mails  and other channels in interstate commerce to          sell at least $3 million  in  securities  in the Cayman and Haven          Quest programs to investors throughout the country."

The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it          filed an enforcement action in federal court in Los Angeles          against Michael A. Todd, Kim J. Brown, Jerry L. Aubrey, Gary          Jason McCrory, Gary L. Cleverly, Calvin J. Calvin, and Todd J.          Taylor.  The Commission alleges fraud in the offer and sale of          stock issued by two companies, Casino Cruises Corp. and BRW          Leasing Services, Inc.  The Commission asserts that the          defendants sold the stock through a fraudulent scheme based in          Newport Beach, California that promoted a fictitious cruise ship,          with gambling facilities, that would operate between Los Angeles,          San Diego and Ensenada, Mexico.  Defendants, led by Michael A.          Todd and Kim J. Brown, raised $908,000 from 120 investors.  The          complaint alleges that, contrary to the representations made to          investors, Todd and Brown took most of the investor funds for          themselves.  They misappropriated approximately $313,000,          transferred $125,000 to an offshore account they controlled, and          paid approximately $101,000 in undisclosed sales commissions.          Todd and Brown also hid their own involvement in these          businesses, claiming that other, experienced individuals operated          the companies.  They also falsely claimed that BRW Leasing shares          would be quoted on NASDAQ. The complaint further alleges that the          remaining defendants acted as sales agents for an unregistered          broker-dealer that solicited investors for the stock.  The          Commission filed this action in connection with the Federal Trade          Commission\s Risky Business initiative against fraud in the          entertainment industry.          The Commission seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement and          civil penalties from Todd and Brown, and permanent injunctions          and civil penalties from the other defendants.  The action          against Todd and Brown is based upon violations of Section 17(a)          of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities          Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.  The action against the          other defendants is based upon violations of Section 15(a) of the          Exchange Act."

The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) announced          that it filed a lawsuit today in federal court in Los Angeles          against several entities and persons for their roles in a          fraudulent investment scheme to purportedly fund, produce and          distribute a motion picture.  Named in the Complaint are Rynell &          Associates, Inc. with offices in Riverside and San Francisco,          California; Lengurnal, Inc. headquartered in Riverside,          California; First Paragon, Inc. headquartered in San Francisco,          California and Movie Management Services, Inc. headquartered in          Hollywood, California.  Also named in the Complaint are David L.          Burnell, age 46, of Lafayette, California; J. Eric Rymland, age          40, of San Francisco, California and Daniel B. Rung, age 45, of          Riverside, California.  The lawsuit was filed in conjunction with          the Federal Trade Commission\s sweep of entertainment firms          entitled Risky Business.          The Complaint alleges that between November 1995 and December          1997, the defendants, through Desert Gold Partners, a California          general partnership (Desert Gold), raised approximately $8          million from the offer and sale of Desert Gold\s general          partnership units to about 600 investors nationwide.  The          Complaint further alleges that the defendants made material          misrepresentations and omissions in connection with the offer and          sale of these securities.  The defendants represented that          investor funds would be used to produce and distribute a motion          picture entitled Operation: Desert Gold and that investors          could potentially earn a 160-445% return.  However, the          defendants misused investors\ funds by transferring most of the          funds to themselves and their affiliates.  To date, no movie has          been produced and all of the investors\ funds have been spent.          The Complaint also alleges that Rynell & Associates, Lengurnal,          First Paragon, Burnell and Rymland offered and sold securities in          Desert Gold without being registered as broker-dealers, as          required under the federal securities laws.          The Complaint alleges that Rynell & Associates, Lengurnal, First          Paragon, Burnell,  Rymland and Rung violated Sections 5(a) and          5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), the          securities registration provisions, and that all of those          defendants except Rung violated Section 15(a) of the Securities          Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), the broker-dealer          registration provisions.  The Complaint also charges that the          defendants violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section          10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and          Rule 10b-5 thereunder, the anti-fraud provisions.  The Complaint          seeks to permanently enjoin the defendants from violations of the          securities registration, antifraud and broker-dealer registration          provisions of the federal securities laws.  The Complaint also          seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains and the imposition of          civil monetary penalties against the defendants."

The Securities and Exchange Commission announced the             filing of a Complaint in the United States District Court             for the District of Utah, on August 10, 1998, seeking a             permanent injunction and other relief against Autocorp             Equities, Inc. fka Chariot Entertainment, Inc., Michael             Carnicle, Robert Cord Beatty, Amotz Frenkel, Hillel Sher and             Nili Frenkel.                  The Commission alleges that in 1994 Diamond             Entertainment, Inc., a privately-held company whose sole             asset was the right to stage live performances of the             American Gladiators at a single location adjacent to the             Imperial Palace Hotel in Las Vegas, merged with Eagle             Automotive, Inc., a company listed on NASDAQ which had just             divested itself of all its assets.  It is further alleged             that in order to maintain this NASDAQ listing after the             anticipated merger with Eagle and a change of the companys             name to Chariot, Carnicle, Beatty, Amotz Frenkel and Sher             engaged in a scheme to inflate the assets of Diamond by             acquiring $5 million in certificates of deposit ostensibly             issued by a Russian bank but actually created by Sher at a             Kinkos copy shop in Hollywood, Florida.  The Complaint             alleges that to finance the acquisition of these             certificates of deposit, Carnicle, Beatty, Amotz Frenkel and             Sher arranged to have Chariot issue stock, ostensibly in             reliance on Regulation S, to a California corporation             controlled by Amotz Frenkel; those shares were then to be             sold after forty days with $1.5 million of the proceeds used             to pay for the certificates of deposit.  It is alleged that             actual sales of the stock were made through Nili Frenkel.                  It is also alleged that Chariot, Carnicle and Beatty             misrepresented the status of the companys arrangement to             lease a location from the Imperial Palace on which the             American Gladiators performances would be staged.  The             Complaint alleges that almost from the time Chariot entered             into a lease with the hotel, it began to violate the terms             of the lease by failing to secure a performance bond and by             failing to meet other lease requirements.                  The Complaint alleges the defendants violated Sections             5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and             Sections 10(b), 13(a) and 13(b) of the Securities Exchange             Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-13, 13b2-1 and             13b2-2 thereunder."

Vivra was a major provider of dialysis services in the United States.               Incentive AB is a Swedish investment company.               The complaint alleges that on March 29, 1997, Cosmas Anastassiou, a               Greek citizen then residing in London, England, learned of the proposed               tender offer by surreptitiously reading confidential documents               concerning the transaction.  The confidential documents were in the               custody of a friend who was working on the deal as an employee of Morgan               Stanley & Co., Inc., Incentives investment banking firm.               According to the complaint, Cosmas Anastassiou purchased Vivra stock and               options prior to the announcement and tipped his father, defendant Othon               Anastassiou, who also purchased Vivra stock and options before the               announcement.  The complaint alleges that Othon Anastassiou tipped his               friend, Richard Panzer of Boca Raton, Florida, who purchased Vivra               options before the announcement.               The complaint alleges that after the tender offer was announced publicly               on May 5, 1997, the market price of Vivra rose, resulting in illegal               profits of $121,557 for Cosmas Anastassiou, $189,634 for Othon               Anastassiou, and $104,496 for Panzer.  According to the complaint,               Cosmas Anastassiou rescinded most of his options purchases after he               learned of the Commissions investigation.                Without admitting or denying the substantive allegations in the               complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of orders permanently               enjoining them from violating Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Exchange               Act and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3, and ordering Cosmas Anastassiou to               disgorge $62,045 plus prejudgment interest, Othon Anastassiou to               disgorge $189,634 plus prejudgment interest, and Panzer to disgorge               $104,496 plus prejudgment interest.  Under the terms of his consent,               Panzer was ordered to pay a penalty of $26,124, an amount equal to one               quarter of his illegal profits.  In assessing the penalty, the               Commission considered Panzers cooperation in the investigation               The Commission wishes to acknowledge the assistance of the NYSE in this               matter."

MICHAEL D. JENKINS,             LAWRENCE A. PETERSEN, JAMIE T. TSUTSUI AND MICHAEL L.             KINNEY             3: 98 CV 1892-X, USDC, ND/TX.             The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission)             announced today that it filed a Complaint in the United             States District Court in Dallas, Texas, against Michael D.             Jenkins, Lawrence A. Petersen, Jamie T. Tsutsui and Michael             L. Kinney.  Jenkins was the founder of Absolute Resource             Corporation (ARC), a privately-held Texas corporation that             purportedly engaged in mining operations in Missouri.             Peterson and Tsutsui are former licensed securities             salesmen and Kinney is a former employee of a registered             broker-dealer.             The Complaint alleges that between 1992 and 1996, ARC             conducted at least two unregistered securities offerings             that raised approximately $4.6 million from the sale of             promissory notes to at least 150 investors in fifteen             states.  It is further alleged that Jenkins misappropriated             at least $1.5 million of investor funds from both note             offerings.  The stated purpose of the first note offering             was to develop a sand mine located in Pemiscot County,             Missouri.  In connection with the first offering the             Complaint alleges the defendants made numerous             misstatements and omissions of material facts concerning,             among other things, ARC\s purported ownership of the sand             mine, the use of investor funds, the safety of the             investment, the compensation paid to the defendants, the             financial condition of ARC, and the risks associated with             the investment.  The Complaint also alleges that after a             Missouri court ruled that ARC had no ownership interest in             the sand mine, defendant Jenkins conducted a second             fraudulent note offering involving a Missouri rock quarry.             In April 1996, ARC filed for bankruptcy and defaulted on             over $4.4 million in investor notes.  In May 1998, Jenkins             was indicted by a federal grand jury on numerous counts of             securities fraud, wire fraud, and money laundering, based             on his activities described in the Commission\s Complaint             (Criminal No. 398-CR-177-G, N.D/TX, Dallas Division).             The Commission\s Complaint alleges that each defendant             violated the securities registration and antifraud             provisions found in Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the             Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities             Exchange Act of 1934.

The Complaint seeks a permanent injunction             against each defendant, as well as an accounting,             disgorgement and civil penalties.             COMPLAINT FILED AGAINST MICHAEL D.

15842,1998,,"b                   UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION             Litigation Release No. 15842  / August 12, 1998             Securities and Exchange Commission v. Timothy J. Lyons,             Civil Action No. 98 CV 1471J RBB (S.D. Cal.);                  On August 12, 1998, the Commission announced the filing             of a Complaint in the United States District Court for the             Southern District of California against Timothy J. Lyons             (Lyons), age 48, a resident of Rancho Santa Fe,             California, and a former trader and portfolio manager at two             registered investment adviser firms.  The Commission\s             Complaint charges Lyons with violating the antifraud             provisions of the federal securities laws by failing to             disclose his conflict of interest in fraudulently allocating             profitable equity day trades (buying and selling the same             security within the same day or within a few days) to his             personal accounts at the expense of client accounts.  The             Complaint alleges that these violations occurred: 1) from at             least 1991 through July 1993, at Nicholas-Applegate Capital             Management (NACM), a registered investment adviser located             in San Diego, California, which employed Lyons as the trader             and portfolio manager for NACM\s employee profit-sharing             retirement plan; and 2) from August 1993 through August             1995, at Lyons Capital Partners (LCP), an investment             adviser firm formerly registered with the Commission of             which Lyons was a 70% owner, and where he acted as the             trader and portfolio manager for all of LCP\s client             accounts.  As of August 1995, LCP managed over $30 million             in assets for its clients.                  According to the Complaint, Lyons used the time between             placing an order for a day trade and allocating such trade             to a specific account to assess whether the trade was             profitable.  The Complaint alleges Lyons perpetrated a             fraudulent scheme by consistently allocating profitable day             trades to his personal accounts (which generated net profits             of approximately $1.75 million) and unprofitable day trades             to his clients\ accounts (which generated net losses of over             $358,000).  Additionally, the Complaint alleges that Lyons             breached his fiduciary duty to his clients by failing to             disclose his conflict of interest in favoring his personal             accounts over client accounts in allocating day trades.             Further, the Complaint alleges that Lyons aided and abetted             NACM\s books and records violations by failing to report             completely and accurately his personal trading to NACM.                  The Commission seeks a permanent injunction against             Lyons prohibiting further violations of Section 10(b) of the             Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder             and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers             Act of 1940, and aiding and abetting violations of Section             204 of the Advisers Act and Rule             204-2(a)(12) thereunder.  The Complaint also seeks an order             that Lyons disgorge his illicit profits ($1.75 million) and             pay prejudgment interest on those profits.  The Complaint             further seeks an order that Lyons pay civil monetary             penalties for his violative conduct.                  In a related matter, the Commission instituted and             settled a cease-and-desist and administrative proceeding             against NACM in which NACM consented to the entry of an             Order, without admitting or denying the findings in the             Commission\s Order, that it pay a civil penalty of $250,000             and cease and desist from committing or causing violations             and any future violations of the books and records             provisions of the Advisers Act.  In addition, NACM was             censured and agreed to maintain and implement procedures             reasonably designed to supervise its employees with a view             toward preventing and detecting violations of the books and             records provisions of the Advisers Act.  Further, the             Commission\s Order found that NACM failed reasonably to             supervise Lyons while he was employed at NACM.

ALEJANDRO C. ZAFFARONI, EUGENE FARBER, NICOLAS VIDA,         ALBA ROSA ARZATE, YOLANDA ROCCO, INES ROMERO, AND PEDRO         ZAFFARONI, Civil Action No. C-98 20843 (JW) (N.D. Cal. Aug.         12, 1998)         The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that         it filed an insider trading action against Alejandro C.         Zaffaroni, the founder and former chief executive officer of         Affymax N.V., (Affymax), and against six other defendants.         The Complaint charges that Zaffaroni violated the securities         laws by communicating information about the January 1995         acquisition of Affymax by Glaxo plc to three friends and to         certain family members in Uruguay.  Zaffaroni\s friends and         family members profited by purchasing Affymax securities         before the acquisition was publicly announced.  At the time         of the trading, Affymax, a drug discovery company located in         Palo Alto, California, and pharmaceutical giant Glaxo plc         (now Glaxo Wellcome plc) were engaged in confidential         negotiations that resulted in Glaxo\s acquisition of Affymax         in a friendly tender offer.         Simultaneous with the filing of the Complaint each of the         defendants, without admitting or denying the allegations in         the Complaint, consented to the entry of Final Judgments         permanently enjoining them from violating the insider         trading prohibitions contained in Section 14(e) of the         Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule         14e-3 thereunder, and ordering them to disgorge profits and         to pay penalties on the trading.  Section 14 (e) and Rule         14e-3 prohibit communicating or trading on inside         information in connection with a tender offer.  Zaffaroni         has also consented to an injunction enjoining him from         future violations of Section 10 (b) of the Exchange Act and         Rule 10b-5 thereunder.         In addition to the entry of injunctions, five of the six         defendants have agreed to pay a total of $1,849,953 in         penalties, disgorgement of profits, and interest, as         follows:Zaffaroni, of Atherton, California, will pay a civil penalty of$552,021.Eugene Farber, of Portola Valley, California, will pay $230,510,which includes disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $132,510 anda penalty of $98,000.Nicholas Vida, of San Mateo, California will pay $83,501, whichincludes disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $48,001 and apenalty of  $35,500.Alba Rosa Arzate, of Mexico City, Mexico, will pay $165,809, whichincludes disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $95,316 and apenalty of $70,493.Pedro Zaffaroni, of Montevideo, Uruguay, will pay $746,973, whichincludes disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $429,402 and apenalty of $317,571.Ines Romero, of Montevideo, Uruguay, will pay $71,639, which includesdisgorgement and prejudgment interest of $41,182 and a penalty of$30,457.         The Commission\s Complaint alleges that Zaffaroni\s friends,         Farber, Vida and Arzate purchased large blocks of Affymax         shares in the two weeks preceding the Glaxo tender offer         announcement following meetings or telephone calls with         Zaffaroni.  During the same period, Zaffaroni told a family         member living in Uruguay that he was in the final stages of         selling Affymax. At the time of the trading, Zaffaroni was         CEO and a member of the board of directors of Affymax.         After learning of the acquisition, Zaffaroni\s nephew and         niece, Pedro Zaffaroni and Ines Romero, and Zaffaroni\s         former sister-in-law, Yolanda Rocco, all of whom live in         Uruguay, purchased Affymax shares before the tender offer\s         announcement.  The Commission\s Complaint also alleges that         Pedro Zaffaroni used four nominees to buy Affymax shares and         that he passed news of the acquisition to two others,         resulting in trading profits by the Zaffaroni family and         friends of the Zaffaroni family in Uruguay of approximately         $348,000."

Trainor and Vincent D.             Celentano, both residents of Hillsboro Beach, Florida.  The             amended Complaint adds  Trainor\s daughter, Karen Losordo,             of Hingham, Massachusetts and New England Diagnostics, Inc.,             which operated out of Losordo\s home, as defendants.  The             amended Complaint adds allegations of fraud arising out of             sales of securities by defendants Trainor, Celentano,             Losordo and New England Diagnostics of Health Care, Ltd.,             purportedly a Russian company.             The Commission\s initial Complaint alleged that Trainor and             Celentano committed a massive fraud on investors by, among             other things, orchestrating a series of sham transactions             among Novatek and other companies that they controlled,             followed by their issuing a series of press releases which             announced that Novatek had entered into highly profitable             contracts with a variety of other entities.  No such             contracts existed.  The Complaint also named Diane M.             Trainor, Daniel J. Trainor, Geraldine Trainor and Mary N.             Celentano as relief defendants.             The amended Complaint retains all of the earlier allegations             and adds allegations that from 1995 or earlier, through at             least February 1996, Trainor, Losordo, Celentano and New             England Diagnostics, a company owned and controlled by             Trainor and operated by Losordo, sold U.S. investors stock             in Health Care, Ltd., a company created and controlled by             Trainor and Celentano.  The Complaint alleges that the offer             and sale of the stock was not registered with the             Commission, as required by law.  The Complaint also alleges             that Trainor, Celentano, Losordo and New England Diagnostics             defrauded investors by falsely claiming that Health Care             Ltd. had contracts, purportedly worth millions of dollars,             with Russian health agencies for the sale of test kits for             the rapid diagnosis of communicable diseases, including AIDS             and cholera.  The Complaint alleges that, in fact, Health             Care, Ltd. had no purchase contracts with any Russian             agency, never sold any product for commercial purposes or             engaged in any other commercially significant business in             Russia, and that the stock never was offered for public sale             in Russia.             The Complaint alleges that the defendants violated the             antifraud provisions of the securities laws, specifically             Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and             Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 17(a) of the Securities             Act of 1933.

The Complaint seeks to enjoin the defendants from further             violation of these provisions, as well as other violations             alleged in the original Complaint.  The Complaint also seeks             to obtain civil penalties from the individual defendants, an             accounting of their profits and of sales to investors, and             seeks to bar Trainor and Celentano from serving as officers             or directors of public companies.

Named          in the Complaint are Internet Casino Sports Gaming, LLC and          Internet Casino Sports Gaming, Inc., both located in Sherman          Oaks, California, and Robert Matias a/k/a Robert DuVall, age 35,          of Granada Hills, California and Alan Lenchner a/k/a Alan Lane,          age 62, also of Granada Hills, California.  Matias and Lenchner          are managing members of Internet Casino Sports Gaming, LLC and          officers of Internet Casino Sports Gaming, Inc.  The lawsuit was          filed as part of the joint SEC and Federal Trade Commission          sweep of entertainment firms entitled Risky Business.          The Complaint alleges that from April 1997 through the present,          the defendants raised approximately $2 million from the offer and          sale of limited liability units in Internet Casino Sports Gaming,          LLC to about 152 investors nationwide.  The Complaint further          alleges that the defendants made material misrepresentations and          omissions in connection with the offer and sale of these          securities.  The defendants represented that investor funds would          be used to develop and operate a virtual casino website and that          investors could potentially earn a 581% return.  However, the          defendants misused investors\ funds by spending only          approximately 10% of investor funds on the development and          licensing of the website while spending almost all of the          remaining funds on undisclosed and undetermined expenses          including sales commissions of 35-40% to sales agents and the          defendants, undisclosed salaries and other payments to the          defendants and their family members (including payments to          Matias\ father and mother-in-law and Lenchner\s daughter),          undisclosed automobile allowances for the defendants (including a          1998 Mercedes Benz Sport Utility Vehicle), and operating costs of          the boiler room soliciting investors.          The SEC obtained an order freezing the assets of the defendants          and temporarily enjoining the defendants from future violations          of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933          (Securities Act), the securities registration provisions,          Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange          Act), the broker-dealer registration provisions and Section          17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act          and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, the anti-fraud provisions.  The          Complaint seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions, and other          relief, including disgorgement and civil penalties, against the          defendants.          In this case, the Internet was used by the Defendants to publish          offering materials and to solicit potential investors.  Investors          are advised to read the SEC\s Cyberspace Alert before purchasing          any investment promoted on the Internet.

On July 15, 1998, after a five-week criminal jury trial in San          Francisco prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney for the Northern          District of California, two former officers of California Micro          Devices Corporation (Cal Micro) were convicted of securities          fraud in connection with a stock collapse that cost shareholders          more than $100 million.  Chan Desaigoudar, former chairman and          chief executive officer of Cal Micro, and Steven J. Henke, the          Company\s former vice president, treasurer and principal          financial officer, were each convicted of six felony charges of          fraud, making false statements to the Securities and Exchange          Commission and insider trading.  Sentencing is scheduled for          October 13, 1998 before U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker.  Cal          Micro is now operating under new management.          The Securities and Exchange Commission has previously filed          settled enforcement actions against four former Cal Micro          officers, including the Company\s former president, its former          chief accounting officer, and two former vice-presidents of          production.

The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today the filing of            final consent judgments of permanent injunction and other relief against            defendants Robert Hunter and Thomas F. Goldman in the United States District            Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.  According to the Commission\s            Complaint, filed on July 16, 1997, Hunter, an INBC director at the time,            learned that CoreStates Financial Corp. had made an acquisition proposal to            acquire Independence Bancorp, Inc. (INBC).  Hunter purchased INBC stock just            prior to the merger announcement in November 1993 while in possession of this            material, nonpublic information and made $250,875 in profits.  Hunter tipped            eight of his relatives and friends who also purchased INBC stock, and he            financed the INBC trades of others. Goldman, an attorney who was one of            Hunter\s tippees, made $9,000 in profits.                  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, Hunter            and Goldman consented to the entry of final judgments of permanent injunction            against future violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal            securities laws.  Hunter agreed to disgorge $262,775, which includes his            profits, the profits of his now-deceased sister, and the profits of one of his            alleged tippees against whom the action is still pending.  He will pay            prejudgment interest of $123,438.22 and a penalty of $262,775.  Hunter has            also agreed to an officer and director bar.  Goldman agreed to disgorge his            profits of $9,000 and to pay prejdugment interest of $4,431.54 and a penalty            of $9,000."

MELTON;             ASSET MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH,  INC.;  WESTVIEW CAPITAL, L.C.;             TRADING PARTNERS, L.C.; and TRADING PARTNERS II, L.C., Civil             Action File No. 2:97-CV-00151 (M.D.N.C.)             The  Securities and Exchange Commission  announced  that  on             August  7,  1998,  the  Honorable William L. O\Steen, United             States  District Judge for  the  Middle  District  of  North             Carolina, entered an order of permanent injunction and other             relief as to defendants Westview Capital, L.C. (Westview),             Trading Partners,  L.C. (TP) and Trading Partners II, L.C.             (TP2).  Westview,  TP and TP2, which are under the control             of  a  court appointed Receiver,  consented  to  the  relief             without  admitting  or  denying the allegations set forth in             the complaint, filed by the Commission on February 24, 1997.             In its complaint, the Commission  alleged that violations of             the  antifraud  provisions  of  the securities  by  Marshall             Melton and the defendant companies  had  occurred  primarily             between   mid-1994   and   late  1996.   During  that  time,             defendants  Westview,  TP  and   TP2   raised  approximately             $5,000,000 from 44 investors, many of whom  had  invested in             more  than  one of the entities.  Through misrepresentations             and omissions  of  material  facts,  Melton  solicited   and             raised   funds   from   unwitting  investors.   Among  other             violations, the investors were advised that their funds were             being invested in specific investments when, in fact, Melton             was commingling monies among the limited liability companies             and using investors\ funds  to  operate  other  entities  he             controlled.             The order permanently enjoins and restrains Westview, TP and             TP2   from   future  violations  of  Section  17(a)  of  the             Securities Act  of  1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities             Exchange  Act  of  1934.   The  order  further  enjoins  and             restrains Westview from  future  violations of Section 15(a)             of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.             Westview was ordered to pay disgorgement  in  the  amount of             $108,913.50,   representing  the  fees  and  commissions  it             received  from  the   sales  of  interests  in  the  limited             liability companies outlined  in  the  complaint  along with             prejudgment  interest thereon.  Payment of disgorgement  and             prejudgment interest  was waived based upon Westview\s sworn             statement which demonstrated an inability to pay the ordered             amount.   Civil  penalties   were  not  imposed  based  upon             Westview\s demonstrated inability to pay.             TP  was  ordered  to  pay  disgorgement  in  the  amount  of             $2,041,510,  representing  the   fees   and  commissions  it             received  from  the  sales  of  interests  in  the   limited             liability  companies  outlined  in  the complaint along with             prejudgment interest thereon.  Payment  of  disgorgement and             prejudgment  interest  was  waived  based  upon  TP\s  sworn             statement which demonstrated an inability to pay the ordered             amount.   Civil  penalties were not imposed based upon  TP\s             demonstrated inability to pay.             TP2  was  ordered to  pay  disgorgement  in  the  amount  of             $995,735, representing  the fees and commissions it received             from  the  sales  of  interests  in  the  limited  liability             companies outlined in the  complaint  along with prejudgment             interest thereon.  Payment of disgorgement  and  prejudgment             interest  was waived based upon TP2\s sworn statement  which             demonstrated  an inability to pay the ordered amount.

The Securities  and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that on August            11, 1998, the Honorable  Steven  D. Merryday, United States District Judge for            the Middle District of Florida, entered  a  Temporary  Restraining  Order  and            Other  Relief  (Order)  against  defendants  Certain  Unit Investment Trusts            (Trusts), Inside Edge Communications Southeast, Inc. (Southeast),  Holding            International  Corp. (Holding Int\l), Derek Bartsch (Bartsch), and Burnell            Hoekstra  (Hoekstra),   halting   their  sale  of  fraudulent,  unregistered            securities through what the SEC alleges  to  be  a boiler-room operation.  The            Order restrains the defendants from violating the  registration and anti-fraud            provisions  of  the federal securities laws, namely Sections  5(a),  5(c)  and            17(a) of the Securities  Act  of  1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of            the  Securities  Exchange  Act  of  1934  (Exchange  Act)  and  Rule  10b-5,            thereunder.   The  Order  also restrains  Holding  Int\l  from  acting  as  an            unregistered broker-dealer in violation Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act.                  On August 11, 1998, the Commission filed a complaint against the Trusts,            Southeast, Holding Int\l, Bartsch,  and  Hoekstra  seeking  emergency  relief.            That  same  day, the Court entered the Order, which also froze the defendants\            assets.  The  Court also appointed a receiver, who immediately secured Holding            Int\l\s premises  and  is now in possession of Holding Int\l\s offices and its            books and records.                  According  to  the  SEC\s   complaint,   the  defendants  made  material            misrepresentations and omissions in connection with their sale of $2.5 million            in units to the investing public.  The defendants  represented  to investors            that  the  funds  raised through these offerings would be used to establish  a            prepaid telephone service  for  the  credit  impaired, i.e., individuals and            businesses with poor or no credit histories.  In  the  complaint, the SEC also            alleges  that  the  defendants  represented  to  investors  that  the  prepaid            telephone service had entered into a joint venture or service agreement with a            California-based  telecommunications company, Uni-Net, Inc. (Uni-Net).   The            SEC\s complaint alleges  that,  in  fact, there is no joint venture or service            agreement with Uni-Net.  In addition,  the complaint alleges that the offering            materials  sent  to  investors  contained  financial  projections,  which  are            baseless in the absence of a joint venture or  service agreement with Uni-Net.            The SEC complaint also alleges that the defendants,  unbeknownst to investors,            intended to keep 70% to 85% of the funds raised from as commissions, fees, and            costs.   The SEC\s complaint  further alleges, among other  things,  that  the            defendants  lied  about the background and experience of those associated with            the offerings.                  In addition to  preliminary  and permanent injunctions, the SEC\s action            also seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten profits against the defendants and money            penalties against Bartsch and Hoekstra.                  Named as relief defendants in the Commission\s lawsuit are Capital Asset            Allocators,  Inc.,  The  Inside Edge Communications,  Inc.,  The  Inside  Edge            Nationwide, Inc., and Trinity Alliance, Inc."

JAMES MICHAEL COGLEY and          THE OHIO ESTATE GROUP, DEFENDANTS,  United  States District Court          for the Southern District of Ohio, No. C2-98-802.          The Securities and Exchange Commission announced  that  on August          11,  it  obtained  an  Order of temporary restraint against James          Michael Cogley (Cogley)  and  The  Ohio  Estate Group (OEG).  The          Order restrains Cogley from continuing to engage in violations of          Section  17(a)  of the Securities Act of 1933  (Securities  Act),          Sections 10(b), 15 (a)(1) and 15(c)(1) of the Securities Exchange          Act of 1934 (Exchange  Act),  Rules  10b-5 and 15c1-2 promulgated          thereunder and Section 206(1) and (2)  of the Investment Advisers          Act of 1940. The Order restrains OEG from continuing to engage in          violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities  Act, Section 10(b)          of  the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.   The          Commission  also  received an order freezing all of the assets of          Cogley and OEG.          On August 13, the Commission  moved  for  a  finding  of contempt          against  Cogley  alleging  that  Cogley  had  violated  the Order          entered on August 11.  In its motion, the Commission alleged that          Cogley,  within  a  day of the Court entering the Order, violated          two provisions of the  Order that froze his assets and prohibited          him from receiving funds  for  investment.  The  Court  issued  a          warning  to Cogley during the hearing on the Commissions motion,          but  reserved   ruling   on  the  motion  until  the  preliminary          injunction hearing scheduled for August 18.          In its complaint, the Commission  alleged  that  since  at least          August  1997,  Cogley  and  OEG have been engaged in a scheme  to          defraud   primarily   elderly   and    retired    investors    by          misrepresenting  facts relating to the use of invested funds, the          safety  of  those funds,  and  the  return  on  the  investments.          Moreover, Cogley  and  OEG  failed  to tell investors of Cogleys          disciplinary and financial history and OEGs financial condition.          The defendants received approximately $2,400,000 from at least 44          investors.   Investors  were  told  that  their  funds  would  be          invested  in  real estate or business development  projects.   In          fact, less than  10%  of  the funds received were invested in any          real estate projects.  The  majority  of funds were actually used          to pay Cogleys personal expenses, OEGs  business  expenses  and          principal and interest payments to earlier investors."

Litigation Release No. 15852  /  August 18, 1998          SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION v. ROY HANDOJO,  Civil Action          No. 97 Civ. 6805 (S.D.N.Y.) (LAP) (filed September 12, 1997)          The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that the          United States District Court for the Southern District of New          York entered an Order of Final Judgment of Permanent Injunction          and Other Equitable Relief against Roy Handojo, an Indonesian          national and visiting analyst formerly employed in J.P. Morgan &          Co., Inc.s New York office, for engaging in flagrant insider          trading in five companies.  According to the Commissions amended          complaint filed on October 20, 1997, Handojo, while working in          J.P. Morgans Financial Institutions Group, purchased the          securities in five companies involved in four separate merger          negotiations in which J.P. Morgan was participating as an          adviser.  From July through September 1997, in each of the merger          transactions, Handojo purchased securities days before the          companies announced that they had entered into definitive merger          agreements.  The Courts Order permanently restrained and          enjoined Handojo from violating the antifraud provisions of the          Securities Exchange Act of 1934.          According to the Commissions complaint, Handojo purchased the          common stock of Signet Banking Corp., a J.P. Morgan client, less          than a week before the July 21, 1997 announcement of Signets          acquisition by First Union Corp.  As a result of that trade,          Handojo realized $90,728 in profits.  Handojo also bought shares          of ACC Consumer Finance Corp.s common stock several days before          the August 25, 1997 announcement that Household International          Inc., another J.P. Morgan client, would acquire ACC by merger,          thus realizing $60,250 in profits.  In addition, in the three          days prior to the August 29, 1997 announcement of NationsBank          Corporations acquisition of Barnett Banks, Inc., a J.P. Morgan          client, Handojo purchased the securities of Barnett and realized          $216,062 in profits.  Handojo also engaged in insider trading          with respect to his purchases of the securities of Great          Financial Corporation two weeks prior to the September 15, 1997          announcement that another company would acquire Great Financial.          At the time of Handojos purchases of Great Financials common          stock, J.P. Morgans Financial Institutions Group acted as an          adviser to an Ohio-based bank holding company in its competing          effort to acquire Great Financial.  As a result of Handojos          Great Financial purchases, he realized $261,012 in profits.          Thus, Handojos total profits from all of his illegal trading is          $628,052.          Handojo, without admitting or denying the allegations contained          in the Commissions amended complaint, consented to the entry of          the Order.  Handojo also agreed to disgorge the          sum of $628,052, representing his gains from the conduct alleged          in the Commissions amended Complaint, plus pre-judgment interest          thereon in the amount of $36,571; however, based upon Handojos          demonstrated financial inability to pay, all but $588,765.72 of          such disgorgement and pre-judgment interest was waived and a          civil penalty was not imposed on Handojo.          Previously, on November 6, 1997, Handojo pleaded guilty to a one-          count information of securities fraud in the U.S. District Court          for the Southern District of New York in connection with his          illegal insider trading.  On March 10, 1998, the Court sentenced          Handojo to fifteen months of incarceration, followed by two years          of supervised release.  Handojo is currently serving his          sentence.

Camp of the United States District Court          for  the  Northern  District  of  Georgia  entered  an  Order  of          Preliminary Injunction  and  Other  Relief against Clarence Wayne          Cook (Cook), Brian E. Causey (Causey), Haven Quest and Cayman          South  International,  Inc.  (Cayman).    The  four  defendants          consented  to  the  entry  of  preliminary  injunctions   without          admitting   or   denying  the  allegations  of  the  Commission\s          complaint.  The complaint alleges that defendants Cook and Causey          used  their  controlled   entities  Haven  Quest  and  Cayman  to          orchestrate  a  prime  bank offer  and  sale  of  investments  in          fraudulent international trading program using misrepresentations          and omissions of fact to investors and agents.          The  Commission\s  complaint   alleges   that   Cook  and  Causey          individually  and through  Haven Quest and Cayman,  effected  the          scheme by falsely  promoting  the  purported  trading programs as          legitimate, virtually no-risk investments with  projected returns          of 900% in 20 weeks for the Cayman program and up  to  500%  over          ten  months for the Haven Quest program, when the programs touted          were non-existent  and  they  had  no  reasonable  basis for such          projections.   Cook and Causey falsely represented that  investor          funds would be secured  by  bank  certificates  of  deposit,  and          failed to disclose that Haven Quest would pay at least 20% of all          investor  funds  directly  to themselves as purported commissions          pursuant to undisclosed agreements  with  Haven  Quest.  Cook and          Causey also failed to disclose that $430,000 of funds raised from          Haven  Quest investors would be used to refund monies  to  Cayman          program  investors  when  the  Cayman  program  failed  due to an          unsuccessful  trade.  The complaint further alleges that  while          continuing their scheme,  the  defendants  conducted offerings by          use  of  the mails and other channels in interstate  commerce  to          sell at least  $3  million  in securities in the Cayman and Haven          Quest programs to investors throughout the country.

The Securities and Exchange Commission  on August 19, 1998, filed          a  civil  action  in  the  United  States  District Court for the          District  of  Columbia against David L. Chandler.  The  complaint          alleges that Chandler  violated  a Commission order requiring him          to  cease  and  desist  from,  among  other   things,  committing          violations of the reporting requirements applicable to securities          transactions of officers, directors, and certain  shareholders of          public companies (Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of          1934  (Exchange Act)). Chandler had previously been  sanctioned          for violating  these  legal  requirements:  in  October 1994, the          Commission  issued  an order finding that Chandler  had  violated          Sections 13(d) and 16(a)  of the Exchange Act, former Rule 16a-1,          and Rules 13d-1, 13d-2, 16a-2, and 16a-3 thereunder.  In December          1995, Chandler again improperly  failed to report transactions he          effected in the securities of Jupiter  National,  Inc., through a          securities  account  he  opened  in  the  name  of  his daughter.          Chandler  was  chairman  of  the  board  of  directors  and chief          executive  officer  of  Jupiter  National  at that time. Chandler          consented,   without   admitting  or  denying  the   Commission\s          allegations, to the entry  of  an  order  requiring  him to pay a          civil penalty of $60,000.          In   a   related   matter,   the   Commission   today  issued  an          administrative order pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act,          requiring  Chandler  to  cease  and  desist  from  violating  the          reporting requirements as set forth above.  Chandler consented to          the  entry  of  the  order  without  admitting  or  denying   the          Commission\s  allegations.

Baird, United States          District Judge, entered Supplemental Judgments against defendants          Robert Reed Rogers and Gregory Armijo.  Rogers  was  formerly the          chairman,  chief  executive  officer  and treasurer of Comparator          Systems   Corporation   (Comparator);   Armijo   was   formerly          Comparator\s vice president for operations,  corporate  secretary          and   a   member   of   Comparator\s  board  of  directors.   The          Supplemental Judgment against  defendant  Rogers  orders  him  to          disgorge $263,106 in salary from Comparator, $4,469.50 in profits          from  the  sale  of stock in Comparator Systems Corporation by an          entity known as the Talisman trust, and $29,921.17 in prejudgment          interest on those  amounts.   Rogers also was ordered to disgorge          30,536,575 shares of Comparator  stock  and  to disavow all debts          owed to him by Comparator and incurred during  the period covered          by the Commission\s Complaint.  The Supplemental Judgment against          defendant Armijo orders him to disgorge $106,401  in  salary from          Comparator,  $9,990  from  the  sale  of  Comparator  stock,  and          $13,038.06 in prejudgment interest on those amounts.  Armijo also          was  ordered to disgorge 3,579,816 shares of Comparator stock and          to disavow  all  debts  owed  to  him  by Comparator and incurred          during  the  period covered by the Commission\s  Complaint.   The          injunctive relief  and  the  officer  and  director  bars ordered          against defendants Rogers and Armijo on September 18, 1996 remain          in full force and effect; the Commission withdrew its  claim  for          civil money penalties against those defendants.          The  Commission  also  announced  today that on May 18, 1998, the          Court entered a Final Judgment of Permanent  Injunction and Other          Relief  by  Default  Against  Defendant  Scott  Hitt.   Hitt  was          formerly Comparator\s executive vice president and  a  member  of          Comparator\s  board  of  directors.   That  Judgment  permanently          restrains  and  enjoins  defendant Hitt from violating the  anti-          fraud,  reporting,  and  books  and  records  provisions  of  the          securities laws, specifically Section 17(a) of the Securities Act          of 1933 and Sections 10(b),  13(a), 13(b)(2)(A)-(B), and 13(b)(5)          of the Securities Exchange Act  of  1934  and Rules 10b-5, 13a-1,          13a-13,  13b2-1,  and  12b-20  thereunder.   The   judgment  also          permanently bars Hitt from serving in the future as an officer or          director  of  any  public  corporation;  orders  him  to disgorge          $516,614.31   along   with  prejudgment  interest  of  $87,635.35          thereon; orders him to pay a civil money penalty in the amount of          $516,614.31; and continues the freezes on Hitt\s assets.          The Complaint, filed on  May  31,  1996,  alleged that Comparator          issued false and misleading financial statements  for  the fiscal          years  ending  June 30, 1994 and June 30, 1995 and for the  first          three quarters of  fiscal  year  1996, which grossly inflated the          company\s assets throughout that period.   The  Complaint further          alleges   that   defendants  Rogers,  Armijo,  and  Hitt   caused          Comparator to file  these  false  financial  statements  for  the          purpose  of enabling Comparator common stock to remain listed for          trading on  the  Nasdaq  SmallCap Market System and to facilitate          the sale of Comparator common stock to the public.          The Commission\s investigation  is  continuing as to other issues          concerning Comparator and trading in  its  securities.

Cal.)          The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced today          that on August 17 it obtained a preliminary injunction in a          lawsuit filed in federal court in Los Angeles last week halting          the operations of two Southern California entities that were          conducting a fraudulent investment scheme over the Internet to          purportedly finance, own and operate a virtual casino on-line          website.  The defendants consented to the entry of the          preliminary injunction without admitting or denying the          allegations in the SEC\s complaint.  Named in the Complaint are          Internet Casino Sports Gaming, LLC and Internet Casino Sports          Gaming, Inc., both located in Sherman Oaks, California, and          Robert Matias a/k/a Robert DuVall, age 35, of Granada Hills,          California and Alan Lenchner a/k/a Alan Lane, age 62, also of          Granada Hills, California.  Matias and Lenchner are managing          members of Internet Casino Sports Gaming, LLC and officers of          Internet Casino Sports Gaming, Inc.  The lawsuit was filed as          part of the joint SEC and Federal Trade Commission sweep of          entertainment firms entitled Risky Business.          The Complaint alleges that from April 1997 through the present,          the defendants raised approximately $2 million from the offer and          sale of limited liability units in Internet Casino Sports Gaming,          LLC to about 152 investors nationwide.  The Complaint further          alleges that the defendants made material misrepresentations and          omissions in connection with the offer and sale of these          securities.  The defendants represented that investor funds would          be used to develop and operate a virtual casino website and that          investors could potentially earn a 581% return.  However, the          defendants misused investors\ funds by spending only          approximately 10% of investor funds on the development and          licensing of the website while spending almost all of the          remaining funds on undisclosed and undetermined expenses          including sales commissions of 35-40% to sales agents and the          defendants, undisclosed salaries and other payments to the          defendants and their family members (including payments to          Matias\ father and mother-in-law and Lenchner\s daughter),          undisclosed automobile allowances for the defendants (including a          1998 Mercedes Benz Sport Utility Vehicle), and operating costs of          the boiler room soliciting investors.          The preliminary injunction freezes the assets of the defendants          and enjoins the defendants from future violations of Sections          5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act),          the securities registration provisions, Section 15(a) of the          Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), the broker-          dealer registration provisions and Section 17(a) of the          Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5          thereunder, the anti-fraud provisions.  In addition to the          preliminary injunction, the Complaint seeks a permanent          injunction and other relief, including disgorgement and civil          penalties, against the Defendants.          In this case, the Internet was used by the Defendants to publish          offering materials and to solicit potential investors.

15857,1998,,"b                          SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION             Litigation Release No. 15857  / August 21, 1998             Securities and Exchange Commission  v. Hugh F. Rollins,             Civil Action Number 98-2023 (D.D.C.)             The Commission announced today that it filed a civil             injunctive action in the U.S. District Court for the             District of Columbia against Hugh F. Rollins, a resident of             Bristow, Virginia, alleging that Rollins operated a             fraudulent Ponzi scheme over a six-year period, causing             losses to investors of more than $8 million.             The complaint alleges that from 1992 to February 1998             Rollins sold between $10,000,000 and $20,000,000 in             unregistered securities to hundreds of investors, many of             whom resided in the Washington metropolitan area.  The             complaint states that the securities took the form of             promissory notes that bore unusually high rates of interest,             sometimes exceeding 84%.  In fact, according to the             complaint, the promissory notes were nothing more than props             in a fraudulent scheme to extract money from investors.  The             complaint alleges that, as in any Ponzi scheme, Rollins made             periodic interest payments to holders of the promissory             notes only from the money he received from new or repeat             investors.             According to the complaint, Rollins falsely represented that             he could offer investors the extremely high interest rates             because his company, Venture Associates, lent money to cash-             starved government contractors who paid above-market             interest rates on loans that would enable them to complete             their contractual work.  The complaint also alleges that             Rollins falsely represented that the promissory notes were             fully secured by a huge trust fund called Commercial Funding             Trust.  In reality, according to the complaint, Commercial             Funding Trust did not exist and the promissory notes that             Rollins sold to investors were completely unsecured.             The complaint alleges that Rollins took millions of dollars             from investors to support his lavish lifestyle, which was             embellished with works of fine art, luxury automobiles,             membership in a country club, and expensive clothing,             jewelry, and furs.  The complaint also alleges that Rollins             contributed more than $200,000 of investor money to various             charities in the Washington metropolitan area.             The Commission\s complaint seeks an order of the federal             district court permanently enjoining Rollins from violating             the registration and antifraud provisions of the federal             securities laws.  Rollins has entered a guilty plea in a             related criminal prosecution by the Office of the U.S.             Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia and is             awaiting sentencing.  In his plea agreement, Rollins agreed             to make restitution of $8,324,031.62 to the victims of his             fraud.             The Commission wishes to acknowledge the cooperation of the             U.S. Postal Inspection Service, the Office of the U.S.             Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, and the             Division of Securities of the Virginia State Corporation             Commission in this matter."

LARRY K. ODELL,            United States District Court for the Middle District of            Florida, Civil Action No. 98-948-CIV-ORL-18A            The  Securities and Exchange Commission today announced            the filing  of a Complaint against Larry K. ODell, the            former Director  of  Public  Works  for Osceola County,            Florida, for failing to disclose his  receipt of bribes            for assisting a brokerage firm in its selection to sell            County bonds.            The Complaint, filed in the Middle District of Florida,            alleges the following:  In 1992, while the Director of            Public Works, ODell entered into a secret arrangement            with a consultant working for a brokerage firm.  The            arrangement provided that, in exchange for ODells            assistance with the brokerage firms selection as one            of the firms to sell the $149,999,313 Osceola Parkway            Project bonds (dated July 15, 1992), the consultant            would share his compensation from the firm with ODell.            After entering into the arrangement, ODell persuaded            the Osceola County Manager to put the firm in the            selling group for the bonds, without disclosing his            economic interest in the matter to the County Manager.            Following closing of the bond offering, the consultant            gave ODell money and other things of value totaling            $1,755.82.  Neither the arrangement nor the benefits            conferred thereunder were disclosed to the issuer of,            or investors in, the bonds.  ODells failure to            disclose the arrangement,  the payments, and the actual            and potential conflicts of interest created thereby,            violated the following antifraud provisions of the            federal securities laws:  Section 17(a) of the            Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the            Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5            thereunder.            Simultaneously with the filing of the Complaint, and            without admitting or denying the allegations contained            in the Complaint, ODell agreed to the entry of a final            judgment permanently enjoining him from future            violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and            Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5            thereunder; and ordering him to pay (1) disgorgement to            Osceola County totaling $2,649.57, consisting of the            $1,755.82 ODell received pursuant to the undisclosed            arrangement, plus prejudgment interest thereon, and (2)            a civil penalty of $5,000.            Also today, the United States Attorney for the Middle            District of Florida filed a criminal plea agreement with            ODell, pursuant to which ODell has agreed to plead            guilty to a single felony count of bribery in violation of            18 U.S.C. \x15 666, arising from the conduct that is the            subject of the Commissions Complaint.            The Commissions investigation concerning pay-to-play            practices in Florida continues."

DAVID BEDNARSH, M.D. Fla., 98-1586-CIV-T-26E, filed August 3, 1998            The Commission announced the entry of an Order and Final Judgment of Permanent            Injunction   and   other  Equitable  Relief  (Order)  against  David  Bednarsh            (Bednarsh).  The Order,  which  was  entered on August 10, 1998, by the United            States District Court for the Middle District  of  Florida,  enjoins  Bednarsh            from  future  violations  of  the  antifraud provisions the federal securities            laws.  The Order imposes no civil penalties  against  Bednarsh  based  on  his            demonstrated  inability  to pay.  Bednarsh consented to the entry of the Order            without admitting or denying the allegations of the Complaint.            In its Complaint, filed on August 3, 1998, the Commission alleged that            Bednarsh, as president of Wireless Advantage, Inc. (Wireless), was responsible            for disseminating to the public three false and misleading press releases            between November 1993 and June 1994.  Specifically, in a November 1993 press            release, Wireless reported six-month earnings of over $15 million and assets            of more than $18 million, when Wireless actual earnings and assets were no            more than a fraction of the reported amounts.  Another press release, issued            in June 1994, trumpeted Wireless purchase of a company that owned Specialized            Mobile Radio (SMR) license rights for $12 million.  In the actual transaction,            however, Wireless paid no cash, only restricted shares of its thinly traded            preferred stock, to acquire SMR license rights, and the rights were worth            nowhere near $12 million.  Third, in June 1994, Wireless issued a press            release announcing that it had developed exclusive hand-held technology for            gambling and that a Las Vegas casino would soon begin using this technology.            In fact, neither the technology nor the casino itself existed at the time of            the press release.  According to the Commissions complaint, during the time            that Wireless issued these press releases, its stock traded on the NASD            Bulletin Board System for between $5 and $10.50 per share, and these press            releases had the effect of supporting this inflated stock price.            All further inquiries should be directed to John J. Sikora, Jr. of the Midwest            Regional Office of the Securities and Exchange Commission at (312)353-1678."

LITIGATION RELEASE NO.    15860  /  August 27, 1998          SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION v. MYLES R. WREN, Civil Action          No. 3:CV-98-1406 (M.D. Pa.) (filed August 27, 1998)          On August 27, 1998, the Commission filed a settled complaint in          the United States District Court for the Middle District of          Pennsylvania against Myles R. Wren, an attorney with the          Scranton, Pennsylvania law firm of Nogi, Appleton, Weinberger &          Wren, alleging insider trading in the securities of First Eastern          Corporation (First Eastern) and Independence Bancorp, Inc.          (Independence) prior to the announcement on July 27, 1993 by          PNC Bank Corp. (PNC) that PNC would purchase First Eastern, and          the announcement on November 19, 1993 by Corestates Financial          Corp. (Corestates) that Corestates would acquire Independence.          The Commission\s complaint alleges that, prior to purchasing          First Eastern stock in July 1993, Wren learned certain          confidential information during the course of his work as a          bankruptcy attorney for First Eastern regarding First Eastern\s          negotiations with PNC that allowed him to conclude that an          acquisition was imminent.  The Commission\s complaint further          alleges that, prior to purchasing Independence stock in November          1993, Wren misappropriated confidential information from his law          partner, a director of Independence, which allowed Wren to          conclude that Independence would be acquired.  The Commission\s          complaint alleges that Wren breached his duties to his clients          and his law firm when he traded stock while in possession of this          material non-public information.          The Commission\s complaint seeks an injunction against Wren for          violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of          1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as          disgorgement of Wren\s profits earned, including prejudgment          interest, and civil penalties pursuant to the Insider Trading and          Sanctions Act of 1984.  Simultaneous with the filing of the          complaint, without admitting or denying the allegations of the          complaint, Wren consented to the entry of a Final Judgment          permanently enjoining him from violating Section 10(b) of the          Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, ordering him to pay          $42,362 in disgorgement, $22,894 in prejudgment interest and a          $42,362 penalty for a total amount of $107,618.          The Commission\s investigation is continuing."

Litigation Release No.  15861 / August 27, 1998             Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release No. 1070 /             August 27, 1998             Securities and Exchange Commission v. The Nikko Securities             Co. International, Inc.             No. 98 Civ. 2058 (D.D.C.) (August 27, 1998)             On August 27, 1998 the Securities and Exchange Commission             (Commission) filed a settled complaint in the United             States District Court for the District of Columbia against             The Nikko Securities Co. International, Inc. (Nikko New             York).  The Commission\s complaint alleges that Nikko New             York, in connection with certain sales of its mortgage-             backed securities (MBS) portfolio, violated the broker-             dealer recordkeeping and reporting provisions of the federal             securities laws.  The complaint further alleges that Nikko             New York failed to comply with the terms of a prior order             issued by the Commission in May 1993 requiring Nikko New             York to comply with these same recordkeeping and reporting             provisions.  Without admitting or denying any of the             allegations in the complaint, Nikko New York consented to             the entry of a final judgment which orders Nikko New York to             comply with the Commission\s prior order and to pay a $2.5             million civil penalty.             The complaint alleges that from August to November 1994,             Nikko New York, by improperly using an internal interest             rate forecast rather than the market\s interest rate             forecast, overstated the fair value of its MBS portfolio in             its books and records and FOCUS reports filed with the New             York Stock Exchange.  The complaint alleges that during the             summer of 1994, MBS market prices declined following an             increase in long-term interest rates and a drop in demand             for MBS derivative securities like those held in the Nikko             New York portfolio.  Consequently, the fair value of Nikko             New York\s MBS portfolio declined.  The complaint alleges             that Nikko New York carried the MBS portfolio at values             exceeding fair value by $9.6 million at the end of August             1994 and by $17.5 million by the end of October 1994.             The complaint alleges that in November 1994, Nikko New York             sold the majority of the MBS portfolio to its London-based             affiliate, Nikko Europe Plc (Nikko Europe), for $134             million, at least $17 million above fair value.  Nikko New             York then improperly booked the entire transaction as             trading proceeds and failed to report the $17 million loss             that would have been recognized had the securities purchased             by Nikko Europe been properly valued.             Several months later, in February 1995, Nikko New York,             acting as broker for Nikko Europe, sold a portion of the MBS             portfolio.  In connection with those sales, two Nikko New             York employees violated the antifraud provisions by             misappropriating approximately $842,000 from Nikko Europe.             The employees arranged to sell the MBS portfolio securities             in four swap transactions with an unaffiliated broker in             which the prices were deliberately marked down to allow             Nikko New York to profit at the expense of Nikko Europe.  In             order to conceal the scheme, the employees falsified the             books and records to hide the illicit profits.  As a result             of these activities, Nikko New York\s books and records and             FOCUS reports were inaccurate.             Throughout the period of these violations, Nikko New York             was subject to a May 19, 1993 Commission administrative and             cease-and-desist order for violating the same provisions and             was working with a consultant on a report to be delivered to             the Commission with respect to its compliance with the             Commission\s outstanding order.             In a related settled cease-and-desist and administrative             proceeding (In the Matter of The Nikko Securities Co.             International, Inc., Masao Ebina, Tadao Osada, and Toshiyuki             Sagiuchi, Admin. Proc. File No. 3-9687), the Commission             found that Nikko New York violated the broker-dealer             recordkeeping and reporting provisions, and failed             reasonably to supervise its employees with a view to             preventing violations of the antifraud provisions and             broker-dealer recordkeeping and reporting provisions of the             Exchange Act.  Without admitting or denying the Commission\s             findings, Nikko New York settled the administrative and             cease-and-desist proceedings.  The Commission censured Nikko             New York, ordered Nikko New York to cease and desist from             committing or causing any violations and any future             violations of the broker-dealer recordkeeping and reporting             provisions, and further ordered Nikko New York to appoint             two unaffiliated directors to constitute an audit committee.             The Commission also found that three senior officers of             Nikko New York, Masao Ebina (Chairman and Chief Executive             Officer during the relevant period), Tadao Osada (President             during the relevant period) and Toshiyuki Sagiuchi (Senior             Vice President and General Manager of the Fixed Income             Division during the relevant period) each knew that Nikko             New York\s books and records relating to its MBS portfolio             were inaccurate, but failed to take steps to correct them.             The Commission found that Ebina, Osada and Sagiuchi             willfully aided and abetted Nikko New York\s violations of             the broker-dealer recordkeeping and reporting provisions.             In addition, the Commission found that Sagiuchi failed             reasonably to supervise the two Nikko New York employees in             connection with the swap transactions.  Without admitting or             denying the Commission\s findings, all three settled the             administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings.  The             Commission suspended Ebina, Osada and Sagiuchi from             association with any broker or dealer for a period of six             months, ordered each to cease and desist from committing or             causing any violation or any future violation of the broker-             dealer recordkeeping and reporting provisions and further             ordered each to pay a $50,000 civil penalty.

The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on August          25, 1998 the Honorable Zita L. Weinshienk, United States District          Judge for the District of Colorado entered an order of permanent          injunction against Paul B. Vernon (Vernon) of Denver, Colorado.          The order, which was entered pursuant to Vernon\s consent, in          which he neither admitted nor denied the allegations of the          complaint, prohibits him from further violations of the          registration, anti-fraud, and filing provisions of the federal          securities laws. Specifically, Vernon is enjoined from further          violations of Sections 10(b), and 13(d) of the Securities          Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 13d-1 and Sections 5(a),          5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.

The order also requires          Vernon to pay a civil penalty of $5,000 the U.S. Treasury.

AMERICAN AUTOMATION,  INC., et           al.           3:98-CV-1596-D, USDC, ND/TX (Dallas Division)                On August 28, 1998, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a           first amended complaint in federal district court, Dallas, Texas,           adding Jayne R. Roose as a defendant in its previously filed civil           action.  The Commission alleges that Roose acted in concert with           defendants Kendyll R. Horton, Hazel A. Horton and Merle B. Gross in the           fraudulent offer and sale of American Automation, Inc. stock  in which           $4.5 million was raised from over 1400 investors in several states. In           fact, according to the first amended complaint, Roose and fellow           defendant Gross continued their fraudulent activity after the           Commission filed the civil action and obtained a temporary restraining           order prohibiting future fraudulent conduct.                The first amended complaint alleges that the defendants told           investors that American Automation would develop and place automated           insurance vending machines in high traffic areas, and that projected           profits would be almost $100 million by the end of its third year of           operation; apparently, however, no automated vending machines have been           sold and American Automations only source of revenue has come from           investors funds.  Additionally, according to the first amended           complaint, the defendants used investor funds to pay for their personal           expenses, and for business expenses unrelated to American Automations           operations.                Roose is charged in the first amended complaint with violations of           the securities registration and antifraud provisions of the federal           securities laws found in Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the           Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act           of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  On July 10, 1998, a temporary           restraining order was issued against American Automation and the           individual defendants prohibiting violations of the federal securities           laws and freezing the companys and the individual defendants  assets.           The first amended complaint seeks to extend this temporary restraining           order to Roose, to permanently enjoin Roose from future violations of           the federal securities laws, an order requiring disgorgement of all           wrongfully obtained profits, with prejudgment interest, and a civil           money penalty."
15864,1998,,"b                  UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION          Litigation Release No.   15864 /  September 1, 1998          The  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  announced that it has          filed  a  civil law suit against Green Oasis Environmental,  Inc.          (Green Oasis),  William  D.  Carraway,  Raymond  C. O\Brien and          Ronald V. Reece for using false and misleading press releases and          other  public  statements  to  increase  the price and volume  of          trading  in  Green  Oasis  shares  for their personal  profit  in          violation   of  the  antifraud,  antitouting   and   registration          provisions of  the  federal  securities laws. The Commission also          named Mary Ann Carraway as a relief  defendant  to  compel her to          disgorge   the  benefits  she  received  as  the  result  of  the          defendants\ scheme. The Commission\s complaint alleges that Green          Oasis  and  its  president,  William  D.  Carraway  (Carraway),          effected  the   scheme  by  publishing  a  series  of  false  and          misleading press  releases  prepared by the public relations firm          the company retained, owned and  controlled by Raymond C. O\Brien          (O\Brien).  Carraway  paid  O\Brien   and   others  to  publish          purportedly  objective  descriptions  about  the company  and  to          encourage positive discussion about the company  in Internet news          groups. Carraway and O\Brien used these false press  releases  to          increase  investor interest in the company. The complaint further          alleges that  while continuing their scheme, Carraway and O\Brien          conducted an unregistered  partnership  offering  by means of the          company\s  Internet web site, and, together with their  families,          sold more than $3 million of Green Oasis stock.          The complaint  alleges  that Carraway and O\Brien published press          releases which materially  misrepresented  the  status  of  Green          Oasis\s  technology,  its  commercial  viability  as  well as the          existence  of  purchase  orders  for  its  equipment.   Two press          releases  and  other  misleading  documents  failed  to  disclose          material facts showing the relationships between Green Oasis  and          O\Brien.  O\Brien as a purported financial analyst, separate from          his control  over  Green Oasis\s public relations firm, published          misleading recommendations  to  purchase Green Oasis shares while          failing  to  disclose  that he had been  paid  to  publicize  the          company. O\Brien also controlled  the  company  that  gave  Green          Oasis the first purchase order and deposit for its equipment  but          did  not disclose his relationships with both Green Oasis and the          customer  in the press release he published touting the purported          purchase order.  Beginning  in  March,  1996  at  a time when the          company  had no money and its prototype product lay  disassembled          in a field,  Carraway  and  O\Brien  began publishing false press          releases in order to increase investor  interest  in  the company          and  increase  the  price  and volume of trading in the company\s          stock.  As  alleged in the complaint,  in  furtherance  of  their          scheme, Carraway and O\Brien encouraged Ronald V. Reece (Reece)          to publish positive  information  about  the  company in numerous          Internet  news  group  messages  he  wrote  and in an  electronic          newsletter he published about the company. In  his  publications,          Reece  claimed  to  be  merely an interested investor and  denied          receiving  any consideration  from  the  company.  In  fact,  the          company gave  Reece  a  valuable  discount on his purchase of the          company\s securities and paid his travel  expenses,  all of which          he failed to disclose in his publications."

Litigation Release No. 15865 / September 1, 1998             Securities and Exchange Commission v. Douglas G. McCaskey,             et al., 98-Civ-6153 (S.D.N.Y.) (September 1, 1998)                     SEC FILES SUIT IN $5 MILLION MICROCAP FRAUD:                  THREE REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVES, TWO OFFICERS AND                DIRECTORS, AND ONE UNDISCLOSED PRINCIPAL NAMED IN 1994                            MANIPULATION OF MARCORP, INC.             The Commission announced that it filed a complaint in the             U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York             alleging that Douglas G. McCaskey, Neal E. Fitzpatrick, Hope             D. Trowbridge, and Robert A. Schatz manipulated the             securities of Marcorp, Inc. from May through December 1994.             The complaint further alleges that two former registered             representatives, John von der Lieth III and Daniel F. Dugan,             violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities             laws in connection with sales of Marcorp stock to their             customers in 1994.  The Commissions complaint also alleges             that Marcorp made materially false and misleading statements             and omissions in its periodic filings with the Commission in             1993 and 1994.             At the time of the manipulation, according to the complaint,             Marcorp held the licensing rights to a low-voltage electron             beam technology.  At its peak, Marcorp had a market             capitalization of over $12 million, and its stock was listed             for trading on the OTC Bulletin Board.             According to the complaint, Douglas McCaskey, an undisclosed             principal of Marcorp, artificially increased Marcorps share             price and volume by purchasing and selling millions of             shares of Marcorp stock among 20 accounts at 14 brokerage             firms in the U.S. and Canada, obtaining proceeds in excess             of $5.2 million.  The complaint alleges that two of             Marcorps officers and directors, Neal Fitzpatrick and Hope             Trowbridge, caused Marcorp to make false Commission filings,             concealed McCaskeys control of Marcorp, opened nominee             trading accounts for McCaskey, and surreptitiously             transferred Marcorp shares to McCaskey for use in the             manipulation.  The complaint further alleges that McCaskey,             Fitzpatrick, and Trowbridge obtained aggregate illegal             profits in excess of $1 million by selling restricted and             unregistered shares before and during the manipulation.             According to the complaint, former registered representative             Robert Schatz knowingly participated in the manipulation by             selling McCaskeys shares while McCaskey simultaneously             purchased the same number of shares through accounts at             other brokerage firms.             The complaint also alleges that Daniel Dugan and John von             der Lieth recommended Marcorp stock to their retail clients             without adequate basis for making the recommendations.             Further, the complaint alleges that Dugan accepted $10,000             in undisclosed compensation for recommending the stock to             his clients, and that Von der Lieth sold Marcorp stock to             his clients despite knowing or recklessly disregarding that             the market for Marcorp stock was being manipulated.              Without admitting or denying the substantive allegations in             the complaint, Dugan and Von der Lieth have consented to the             entry of orders permanently enjoining them from violating             Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the             Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5, ordering Dugan to disgorge             $10,000 plus prejudgment interest and Von der Lieth to             disgorge $5,000 plus prejudgment interest, and waiving the             payment of disgorgement based on their demonstrated             inability to pay.             In addition, without admitting or denying the Commissions             findings, Dugan and Von der Lieth have agreed to settle a             separate administrative proceeding to be instituted against             them under Sections 15(b) and 19(h) of the Exchange Act.             Dugan and Von der Lieth have consented to the issuance of an             order of the Commission barring them from association with             any broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer, investment             advisor, or investment company, with rights to reapply for             association after five years.             This enforcement action is part of the Commissions four-             pronged approach to minimizing microcap fraud: enforcement,             inspections, regulation, and investor education.

KELLIN INVESTMENT             CORP. and ORLANDO R. LANDA, Civil Action No. 98-7153 ABC             (RCx) (C.D. Cal.)             The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission)             announced that, on September 1, 1998, it filed a Complaint             in the United States District Court for the Central District             of California against Kellin Investment Corp. (Kellin) and             its president, Orlando R. Landa (Landa), alleging that             they violated the antifraud and securities registration             provisions of the federal securities laws in connection with             the sale of investments through Kellin.             The Commission\s Complaint alleges that, from April to             September 1997, Landa, formerly a resident of Temecula,             California, and Kellin offered and sold securities             purportedly backed by collateral and typically offering             returns of 2% per month, raising approximately $4.1 million             from about 58 investors.  The funds raised were to be used             for unspecified investment purposes.  The Complaint             alleges that Landa and Kellin represented to investors that             funds would be released for investment purposes only after             collateral in the form of United States Treasury bills,             certificates of deposit or prime bank guarantees had been             obtained.  Landa and Kellin, however, never obtained any             collateral for the investments.  Although they did invest             approximately $1.9 million of the funds raised in various             private businesses and ventures, Landa and Kellin failed to             disclose that they used at least $315,000 of the funds             raised to pay returns to investors.  The Complaint seeks,             among other things, permanent injunctions enjoining Landa             and Kellin from future violations of the provisions of the             federal securities laws they are alleged in the Complaint to             have violated, disgorgement of all ill-gotten gains from             Landa, and the appointment of a receiver over Kellin.             Landa and Kellin, without admitting or denying the             allegations in the Complaint, have consented to the entry of             judgments:  (1) permanently enjoining them from future             violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of             the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Section 10(b)             of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5             thereunder, and the securities registration provisions of             Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act; (2) ordering             Landa to pay disgorgement in the amount of $99,310,             representing compensation received by him from Kellin,             together with prejudgment interest, but waiving payment of             disgorgement and not assessing civil penalties based upon             his demonstrated inability to pay, except that he is ordered             to disgorge certain shares of stock; and (3) providing for             the appointment of a receiver over Kellin."

CHIMNEYVILLE          INVESTMENTS GROUP, INCORPORATED AND JOSEPH RANDOLPH BELEW          Civil Action No. 3: 98 CV 574 WS (U.S.D.C. S.D. MISS.)          SECURITIES REGULATORS HALT THEFT OF CUSTOMER MONEY          Joe  R. Belew withdrew at least $220,000 from the accounts of his          customers  at  Chimneyville  Investments  Group, Incorporated, of          Jackson, Mississippi, without the knowledge  or  authorization of          the effected customers.  These funds were traced directly  to one          of  Belew\s  personal  checking accounts.  Chimneyville and Belew          consented  Tuesday  to an  order  issued  by  the  federal  court          preliminarily  enjoining   them  from  committing  future  fraud,          freezing the company\s and Belew\s  assets,  and  prohibiting the          destruction  of  documents  as  the  result  of a civil complaint          brought by the SEC.  The SEC asked the court to  order  repayment          of all the customer funds, based upon a thorough accounting to be          conducted,  and  to  impose  civil penalties against each of  the          defendants.          More  particularly,  the SEC\s Complaint,  filed  in  the  United          States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi on          September  1,  1998,  sought   a   temporary  restraining  order,          preliminary  and  permanent  injunctions   against   Chimneyville          Investments Group, Incorporated, a registered broker-dealer  with          its principal office located in Jackson, Mississippi, and one  of          its managing principals, Joseph Randolph Belew.  In addition, the          Complaint  sought  an order providing for expedited discovery and          prohibiting  the  destruction,   alteration,  or  concealment  of          documents;  providing  for  an  accounting,  disgorgement,  civil          penalties,  and  prejudgment interest  against  Chimneyville  and          Belew; and freezing  both  Chimneyville\s and Belew\s assets.  In          its Complaint, the Commission  alleged that Chimneyville violated          Sections 10(b), 15(c) and 17(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act          of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules  10b-5, 15c3-1, 15c3-3, 17a-3,          and 17a-4 thereunder and that Belew violated Section 10(b) of the          Exchange  Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder  and  aided  and  abetted          Chimneyville\s  violations  of Sections 15(c) and 17(a)(1) of the          Exchange  Act  and  Rules  15c3-1,   15c3-3,   17a-3   and  17a-4          thereunder.          The  Commission\s  Complaint  alleges,  among other things,  that          Chimneyville, as an introducing broker-dealer, failed to maintain          $5,000 in net capital as required by Rule  15c3-1.   In addition,          the Complaint alleges that Chimneyville failed to make  and  keep          current  books  and records, including, among others, net capital          computations and  a general ledger as required by Rules 17a-3 and          17a-4, and failed to  comply  with  the customer protection rules          set forth in Rule 15c3-3.  The Complaint  also alleges that Belew          fraudulently converted at least $220,000, and  probably more than          $650,000,  of investors\ funds to his own uses, in  violation  of          Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.          In addition,  the  SEC consented to the combination of its action          with an application  for  a  protective  decree  brought  by  the          Securities   Investor  Protection  Corporation  (SIPC)  against          Chimneyville,  and  the  subsequent  appointment  of  a  trustee,          pursuant  to  Sections  5(b)(1)  and  5(b)(3)  of  the Securities          Investor Protection Act of 1970 (SIPA).

Wingate entered  a  Preliminary Order of          Injunction   enjoining   Chimneyville   and  Belew  from   future          violations of the foregoing sections and  rules  and freezing the          assets of the parties.          The SEC staff gratefully acknowledges the substantial  assistance          of the Securities Enforcement Division, Office of the Mississippi          Secretary of State and District No. 5 of the National Association          of Securities Dealers - Regulation, Inc. in the investigation  of          the facts leading to this action.

Utah)             On September 2, 1998, the Securities and Exchange             Commission filed an amended complaint in this pending             civil action alleging that the defendants perpetrated a             second Ponzi scheme, through a company called Laser             Leasing, Inc. (Laser Leasing), in addition to the             Ponzi scheme alleged in the initial complaint.  The             amended complaint also added Pete J. Buffo (Buffo), a             convicted felon, as a defendant and charged him with             controlling both schemes.  The defendants allegedly             raised $9 million in the Laser Leasing scheme in             addition to the $24 million raised in the other scheme             under the name Capital Acquisitions, Inc. (Capital             Acquisitions). At the same time, Judge David Sam,             Chief United States Judge for the District of Utah,             granted the Commission\s application for a receiver for             Capital Acquisitions, and expanded the receivership to             include Laser Leasing and other entities which are             affiliated with the defendants.             The original complaint, filed in December 1997, charged             that Capital Acquisitions, Clealon B. Mann, Wayne C.             Notwell, and The Somerset Group, Inc. defrauded             investors by operating a Ponzi scheme, whereby funds             raised from investors were used make interest payments             to earlier investors, and by failing to disclose, among             other things, excessive commissions.  The amended             complaint makes similar charges against Laser Leasing,             and names as relief defendants the following entities             which allegedly received funds from investors in both             alleged schemes: Surety Underwriters and Control Corp.,             Capitol Investment Partners, Inc., Spectrim             International, Inc., Ute Cal Auto Sales, Inc., Best             Rate Rent-A-Car, Inc., High-Line Medical Instruments,             Inc., Genie Total Products, Inc., and Fund Line             International, Inc.  The relief defendants are all             alleged to be affiliated with one or more of the             individual defendants.             Judge Sam appointed Robert G. Wing, a Salt Lake City             attorney, as the receiver for Capital Acquisitions,             Laser Leasing, and their affiliated entities, which             include all Laser Leasing Limited Liability Companies,             Laser Equipment, Inc., Fund Line International, Inc.,             Capitol Investment Partners, Inc., Chaparral Petroleum,             Inc., K&B Gas Company, Inc., Donna Lee Petroleum, Inc.,             and Capital Kansas, Inc.

15869,1998,,"b          UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION          LITIGATION RELEASE NO.  15869 / September 2, 1998          Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  v. Scott B. Walker, Equity          Management  Services, Scott L. Simpson, and  Zappa  International          Corporation, Civil Action No. 98-CV-213-B (USDC Wyo.)          The Commission  announced  today  that  it  obtained an emergency          restraining order prohibiting the fraudulent sale of interests in          two  prime  bank-type  trading  programs  which  falsely  offered          guaranteed returns up to 100 percent per year and  which  claimed          to  be  sponsored  by  the  Federal Reserve and the International          Monetary Fund.   The order, entered  September  1,  1998 by Judge          Clarence  A.  Brimmer (D.C. Wyoming), included an order  freezing          the assets of the  defendants  and  requiring the repatriation of          assets.          The  complaint  named  as defendants Scott  B.  Walker  (Walker),          Equity Management Services (EMS), Scott L. Simpson (Simpson), and          Zappa International Corporation  (Zappa),  and alleged that since          February 1998 to the present, the  defendants  had  engaged  in a          fraudulent  prime bank investment scheme in which they guaranteed          high rate of  return  and falsely represented that the investors\          principal was fully secured  by  a top European Bank and that the          programs  were  implemented  through   traders  licensed  by  the          International Monetary Fund.  The Commission  alleged that Walker          and EMS, both located in Afton, Wyoming, failed  to  disclose the          use  of  investor  funds  to pay solicitation fees to others  who          referred the investor and to  make  Ponzi  payments  to earlier          investors  who  sought  the  return  of  their  investment.   The          complaint  also  alleged  that  Simpson  and  Zappa,  located  in          Richmond,  Texas,  offered  interests  in the Zappa International          Asset  Management  Program  which  would  generate   returns  for          investors  of 25 percent per month.  The Commission alleged  that          materials regarding  the  Zappa  program also were distributed by          Walker and EMS.  The Zappa program,  according  to the complaint,          falsely  stated  that  the program was sponsored by  the  Federal          Reserve and the International  Monetary Fund and that the program          was  guaranteed by a top world bank.   The  Commission  alleged          that through  their false and misleading statements, Walker, EMS,          Simpson and Zappa  violated  the  antifraud  provisions,  Section          17(a)  of  the  Securities  Act  of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the          Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.          Judge Brimmer also ordered a freeze  upon all assets derived from          the fraudulent conduct of Walker, EMS,  Simpson and Zappa held by          the relief defendant Eagle Vision Holdings,  Inc.  of Washington.          The Commission requested the emergency action to prevent  Walker,          EMS,   Simpson,  Zappa  and  Eagle  Vision  Holdings,  Inc.  from          transferring or liquidating any funds.          The Commission  wishes  to thank the Wyoming Secretary of State\s          Securities Division for its assistance in this matter."

Litigation Release No.  15870 / September 3, 1998          Accounting and Auditing Enforcement          Release No.   1071 / September 3, 1998          SECURITIES  AND  EXCHANGE  COMMISSION  v. JUI-TENG LIN AND YUCHIN          LIN,   U.S.   District  Court  for  the  District   of   Columbia          (1:98CV02123) (September 3, 1998)               The Securities & Exchange Commission today filed a Complaint          in the U.S. District  Court  for the District of Columbia against          Jui-teng  Lin  (Dr.  Lin),  the   former  President  and  Chief          Executive  Officer  of LaserSight, Inc.,  and  Yuchin  Lin  (Ms.          Lin),  his  wife  and  Lasersight\s   former  bookkeeper.    The          complaint alleges that the Lins, assisted  by  Ms. Lin\s brother,          Kuo-chang Wong (Wong), diverted LaserSight corporate  funds  to          themselves  through  certain consulting and other arrangements,          and concealed their interest  in  those  transactions.   It  also          alleges  that  the  Lins  and  Wong  orchestrated a sham offshore          transaction as part of a scheme to sell  unregistered  LaserSight          stock the Lins owned in purported reliance on Regulation S.               Without   admitting   or  denying  the  allegations  in  the          Complaint,  Dr.  and Ms. Lin consented  to  the  entry  of  final          judgments of permanent  injunction  against  them  and  agreed to          disgorge  their  wrongful  gains  from  their sales of LaserSight          stock  together  with  prejudgment interest,  and  to  pay  civil          penalties of $100,000 and  $50,000  respectively.  In  a  related          matter, the Commission issued a cease-and-desist order by consent          against  Wong finding that he was a cause of the Lins\ violations          of the antifraud and securities registration provisions.               Specifically,   the   Commission\s   complaint  alleges  the          following:          \x07  LaserSight, Inc. is an Orlando, Florida  based manufacturer of             optical  materials,  electronic components and  laser  systems             used in medical applications.   Its common stock is registered             with the Commission and listed on  the  NASDAQ National Market             System.          \x07  On  three  occasions  between  April and July  1992,  Ms.  Lin             disbursed funds totaling $265,000 from LaserSight to Northgard             Industries,  purportedly for consulting  fees.   Northgard,  a             Taiwanese  entity  controlled  by  Wong,  was  in  the  lumber             business.     It  never  performed  services  for  LaserSight.             Rather, in each  instance,  Wong  deposited the funds into his             personal  bank  account  in  Taiwan,  and  then  within  weeks             transferred them back to the Lins\ personal  bank  account  in             Florida.   The  Lins  used  those funds to exercise LaserSight             stock options.          \x07  In December 1992 Dr. Lin transferred  $110,151 to Green Summit             Corp.,   another   Taiwanese   entity  controlled   by   Wong,             purportedly  to  develop  software   for   LaserSight.    Wong             deposited the funds in his personal bank account in Hong Kong,             and  Green  Summit  never  developed any software.  In January             1993,  Wong  transferred  the  funds  to  the  Lins\  personal             account.   Dr.  Lin  subsequently repaid  LaserSight  $100,000             after the contract with Green Summit was questioned.          \x07  On seven occasions in  1993,  the  Lins transferred a total of             $984,000 directly from LaserSight\s  corporate bank account to             their  personal  bank  account.   The  Lins   did  not  inform             LaserSight\s Board of Directors or get its prior  approval for             these  loans,  but  repaid them with interest after LaserSight             discovered them.          \x07  The Lins falsified LaserSight  corporate records in the course             of  carrying out the Green Summit  and  Northgard  diversions.             Because  those  diversions and the unauthorized loans were not             disclosed, LaserSight\s  quarterly  reports for the second and             third  quarters  of 1992, its 1992 annual  report,  its  three             quarterly reports  in  1993  and  its  1993 annual report were             materially  false.   The loans were documented  by  promissory             notes that purport to  have  been  executed  contemporaneously             with  the  disbursements, but were in fact created  after  the             disbursements.          \x07  Beginning in  the  spring  of  1993  the  Lins  carried out an             elaborate  sham  to enable them to sell restricted  LaserSight             shares they owned without registration.  As part of that sham,             they purported to sell 160,000 LaserSight shares to KCC Group,             an Antiguan entity,  pursuant  to  Regulation  S.  Dr. Lin had             previously  caused  KCC Group to be established and  installed             Wong as its sole director  and  owner.   Dr. Lin provided Wong             with  the  moneys  KCC  Group used to purchase  the  shares.             After the sale, Dr. Lin  made  false  representations  to an             attorney  to  secure an opinion letter authorizing the removal             of  the  restrictive   legend   from   KCC   Group\s   shares.             Thereafter, the Lins opened brokerage accounts in the name  of             KCC Group from which they directed the sale of the shares into             the market.          \x07  Dr.  Lin  filed  false  ownership  reports with the Commission             disclosing that he had sold LaserSight stock to KCC Group when             in fact he still retained beneficial  ownership, and failed to             disclose that he had sold the shares when  he  finally gave up             beneficial ownership.               Simultaneously  with  the filing of the Complaint,  Dr.  Lin          consented, without admitting  or  denying  the allegations in the          Complaint, to the entry of a final judgment  enjoining  him  from          future  violations  of  Sections  5(a),  5(c)  and  17(a)  of the          Securities  Act  of  1933  (Securities Act) and Sections 10(b),          13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B),  13(b)(5),  13(d),  and 16(a) of          the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act),  and  Rules          10b-5,  12b-20,  13a-1,  13a-13,  13b2-1, 13b2-2, 13d-2 and 16a-3          promulgated thereunder, ordering him to disgorge jointly with Ms.          Lin $58,016 representing the gains from the sales of unregistered          LaserSight securities as alleged in  the  Commission\s  Complaint          including prejudgment interest thereon, and ordering him to pay a          civil  penalty of $100,000.  Ms. Lin consented, without admitting          or denying  the  allegations  in the Complaint, to the entry of a          final judgment enjoining her from  future  violations of Sections          5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act and Sections 10(b) and          13(b)(5)  of  the  Exchange  Act  and  Rules  10b-5   and  13b2-1          promulgated  thereunder,  ordering  her  jointly with Dr. Lin  to          disgorge  $58,016  in  gains  from  the  sales  of   unregistered          LaserSight,  Inc.  securities  as  alleged  in  the  Commission\s          Complaint  including  prejudgment interest thereon, and  ordering          her to pay a civil penalty of $50,000.               In  a settled cease-and-desist  proceeding,  the  Commission          found that K.C. Wong caused violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and          17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act          and Rule 10b-5  thereunder.   Without  admitting  or  denying the          findings  therein,  he  has  consented  to  the entry of an Order          making findings and ordering him to cease and desist from further          violations of these provisions.

JAMES MICHAEL COGLEY and          THE OHIO ESTATE GROUP, DEFENDANTS,  United  States District Court          for the Southern District of Ohio, No. C2-98-802.          The Securities and Exchange Commission announced  that  on August          18,  it  obtained  by  consent an Order of Preliminary Injunction          (the Order) against James  Michael Cogley (Cogley) and The Ohio          Estate Group (OEG).  The Order  restrains  Cogley from continuing          to engage in violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of          1933 (Securities Act), Sections 10(b), 15 (a)(1)  and 15(c)(1) of          the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act),  Rules  10b-5          and  15c1-2 promulgated thereunder and Section 206(1) and (2)  of          the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The Order restrains OEG from          continuing  to  engage  in  violations  of  Section  17(a) of the          Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and  Rule 10b-5          promulgated  thereunder.   The  Order also freezes the assets  of          Cogley and OEG with the exception  of  payroll  payments  to  OEG          employees  for  the  pay period immediately preceding the Court\s          entry of a temporary restraining  order  (the  Temporary Order)          against  Cogley and OEG on August 11, and the liquidation  of  an          annuity in  Cogley\s  name  for purposes of paying for his living          expenses.          On  August 28, the Court entered  an  order  by  consent  on  the          Commission\s  emergency  motion  to show cause why the Defendants          should not be held in contempt.  The  order,  among other things,          finds that Cogley and OEG violated the provision of the Temporary          Order that froze Cogley\s and OEG\s assets.          Since at least August 1997, Cogley and OEG have been engaged in a          scheme  to  defraud  primarily elderly and retired  investors  by          misrepresenting facts  relating to the use of invested funds, the          safety  of  those  funds, and  the  return  on  the  investments.          Moreover, Cogley and  OEG  failed  to  tell investors of Cogley\s          disciplinary and financial history and OEG\s financial condition.          The defendants received approximately $2,400,000 from at least 44          investors.   Investors  were  told  that  their  funds  would  be          invested  in  real estate or business development  projects.   In          fact, less than  10%  of  the funds received were invested in any          real estate projects.  The  majority  of funds were actually used          to pay Cogley\s personal expenses, OEG\s  business  expenses  and          principal and interest payments to earlier investors."

In addition, the court ordered the           continuation of an asset freeze, previously granted in the temporary           restraining order entered July 10, 1998, against all defendants,           including relief defendants Musclewear, Inc.,  Angel World insurance           Group, Inc., Lord & Kendyll Investments, Inc., Family Light Co., LLC           and Direction Management Co., LLC. The court also appointed a receiver           to take possession of the assets of American Automation.           In its complaint, the Securities and Exchange Commission alleged the           defendants raised over $4.5 million dollars in the fraudulent offer and           sale of American Automation stock  to over 1400 investors in several           states. The complaint also alleges that the defendants told investors           that American Automation would develop and place automated insurance           vending machines in high traffic areas, and that projected profits           would be almost $100 million by the end of its third year of operation;           apparently, however, no automated vending machines have been sold and           American Automation\s only source of revenue has come from investors\           funds.  Additionally, according to the complaint, the defendants used           investor funds to pay for their personal expenses, and for business           expenses unrelated to American Automation\s operations.

SCARANO,  No.          98 Civ. 6350 (LAP)  (S.D.N.Y.  filed  Sept. 9, 1998)             STEVEN M. SCARANO, CPA, CONSENTS TO CEASE-AND-DESIST AND             BAR ORDER AND TO FINAL JUDGMENT IMPOSING A CIVIL PENALTY          The  Securities  and  Exchange Commission (Commission) today          filed a complaint in the  United States District Court for the          Southern District of New York  against  Steven M. Scarano, CPA          for  violations of the securities registration  provisions  of          the federal  securities  laws.   Scarano was formerly with the          accounting firm of Scarano & Lipton,  P.C.  (S&L),  auditors          for Visual Cybernetics Corp., a start-up, microcap company.          The complaint alleges that Scarano improperly offered and sold          Visual   Cybernetics   securities   registered   on  Form  S-8          registration statements to public investors through  a  Visual          Cybernetics employee nominee.  Because the securities were not          registered  for sale to the public, Scarano willfully violated          Sections  5(a)   and  5(c)  of  the  Securities  Act  of  1933          (Securities Act).          Without admitting or denying any of the allegations in the          complaint, except as to jurisdiction, Scarano consented to the          entry of a final judgment.  The final judgment against Scarano          orders him to pay a civil penalty of $5,000.          The Commission also  instituted  an  administrative proceeding          against Scarano today.  The administrative order finds that as          a  result  of  his  actions  in  offering and  selling  Visual          Cybernetics securities, Scarano was engaged in the business of          effecting  transactions  in securities  for  the  accounts  of          others.  Because neither he  nor his accounting firm, S&L, was          registered as a broker with the  Commission  at  that time, he          willfully  violated  Section 15(a) of the Securities  Exchange          Act of 1934 (Exchange Act).           In addition, the administrative order finds that, as a result          of offering and selling  Visual  Cybernetics securities, while          auditing  Visual  Cybernetics\ financial  statements,  Scarano          willfully violated, and willfully aided and abetted and caused          S&L\s violation of, the Commission\s independence requirements          in connection with  that  audit.   The  order  also finds that          Scarano  willfully violated, and willfully aided  and  abetted          and  caused   S&L\s   violation  of,  Section  210.2-02(b)  of          Regulation  S-X  by issuing  an  audit  report  containing  an          unqualified   opinion   on   Visual   Cybernetics\   financial          statements which  stated  falsely that the audit was performed          in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  auditing  standards          (GAAS)  when,  in fact,  the  audit  was  not  performed  in          accordance with GAAS  because  the firm was not independent at          the time of the audit.          Without  admitting  or denying any  of  the  findings  in  the          administrative  order,  except  as  to  jurisdiction,  Scarano          consented to the  entry  of  an order that (a) requires him to          cease and desist from committing  or  causing  violations, and          future violations, of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities          Act,  Section  15(a) of the Exchange Act, and Regulation  S-X,          and (b) denies him  the  privilege  of appearing or practicing          before  the Commission as an accountant,  with  the  right  to          apply for reinstatement after two years.          The Commission also brought enforcement actions against Visual          Cybernetics\  principal  officers  and  directors  and outside          counsel,  and  the  other member of the accounting firm,  S&L.

The Complaint, filed in the  United  States District Court for          the Southern District of New York, alleges the following:          DiMauro,  DiLorenzo  and  Pensley  implemented   a  scheme  to          circumvent   the   registration  requirements  for  sales   of          securities to the public.          DiMauro  and  Bashir  misappropriated   $580,000  from  Visual          Cybernetics.   To  hide  the  misappropriations,  DiMauro  and          Bashir  prepared and signed Visual  Cybernetics  filings,  and          DiMauro  prepared   a  Visual  Cybernetics  private  placement          memorandum, that misrepresented  and omitted information about          the amount of money that DiMauro and  Bashir were compensated.          DiMauro also falsified Visual Cybernetics\ books, records, and          accounts to hide further the misappropriations.          Pensley  prepared,  and DiMauro and DiLorenzo  signed,  Visual          Cybernetics filings that  omitted any discussion of a material          provision  of  the  agreement   by  which  Visual  Cybernetics          acquired Compass Rose Chartering Corp. Compass Rose was Visual          Cybernetics\  primary  source  of  revenue,  and  the  omitted          provision enabled Compass Rose to rescind  the  acquisition if          Visual Cybernetics filed for bankruptcy.  DiMauro  and Pensley          also   prepared   a   Visual   Cybernetics  private  placement          memorandum that omitted any discussion of the provision.          DiLorenzo fabricated an agreement  purporting  to  modify  the          Compass  Rose  acquisition  agreement  and  filed  it with the          Commission.    The  modified  agreement  purportedly  expanded          Compass Rose\s right  to  rescind  the acquisition by allowing          rescission  to  be  based  upon insolvency  rather  than  only          bankruptcy.    Immediately   after   filing   the   fabricated          agreement,   DiLorenzo  relied  upon   it   to   rescind   the          acquisition.          DiMauro failed  to  make  certain that Visual Cybernetics kept          and maintained accurate books, records, and accounts, and that          it devised and maintained internal accounting controls.          Without admitting or denying  any  of  the  allegations in the          Complaint, except as to jurisdiction, DiMauro consented to the          entry  of  a final judgment that (a) permanently  enjoins  him          from future  violations  of  Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of          the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Sections 10(b),          13(a),  13(b)(2)(A),  13(b)(2)(B),   and   13(b)(5)   of   the          Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Exchange          Act  Rules  10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, and 13b2-1; (b) bars          him from serving  as  an  officer  or  director  of any public          company; and (c) orders him to disgorge his ill-gotten  gains,          plus   prejudgment   interest   thereon,  but,  based  on  his          demonstrated inability to pay, waives  such  disgorgement  and          does not impose civil penalties.          The litigation is continuing against the remaining defendants.          As to them, the Complaint seeks the following:          (a)   a   permanent  injunction,  officer  and  director  bar,          disgorgement  plus  prejudgment  interest, and civil penalties          against Bashir for violations of Sections  10(b)  and 13(a) of          the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 12b-20,  13a-1,          and 13a-13;          (b)  a  permanent  injunction,  officer  and director bar, and          civil penalties against DiLorenzo for violations  of  Sections          5(a)  and  5(c)  of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b), 13(a),          and 13(b)(5) of the  Exchange Act, and Exchange Act Rules 10b-          5, 12b-20, 13a-11, and 13b2-1; and          (c) a permanent injunction and civil penalties against Pensley          for  violations of Sections  5(a),  5(c),  and  17(a)  of  the          Securities  Act,  Section  10(b)  of  the  Exchange  Act,  and          Exchange Act Rule 10b-5.          The Commission also brought enforcement actions against Visual          Cybernetics\ auditors. See Litigation Release No. 15873 (Sept.          9, 1998) and Release No. 33-7573 (Sept. 9, 1998).

The Commissions complaint alleges that the             unknown purchasers engaged in illegal insider trading just             before the announcement on September 2, 1998 that DST             Systems, Inc. intended to acquire USCS.                  The Commission alleges that the unknown persons             purchased 200 out-of-the-money USCS call options and 61,800             shares of USCS common stock for more than $1.6 million             through an account in Zurich, Switzerland on September 2.             According to the complaint, the buyer or buyers sold the             option contracts on September 3, obtained profits of nearly             $70,000, and transferred the proceeds to Switzerland.  The             Commission also alleges that on September 3 the unknown             persons sold all 61,800 shares of USCS common stock for             profits of as much as $500,000.  According to the complaint,             the 61,800 share sales transaction will not settle until             today.                  In the pending lawsuit, the Commission alleges that the             unknown defendants engaged in illegal insider trading in             violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act             and Rule 10b-5.  The Commission seeks permanent injunctive             relief, the disgorgement of all illegal profits, and the             imposition of civil monetary penalties.                  The Courts Temporary Restraining Order prohibits the             removal of the trading proceeds, estimated to be             approximately $2 million, for a 10-day period.  In addition,             the courts Order imposes an expedited discovery schedule             and prohibits the defendants from destroying documents.                  The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the             American Stock Exchange in this matter."

Carraway   (Carraway)   signed  the          stipulation on the company\s behalf.          The Commission\s complaint alleges that Green Oasis and  Carraway          effected   the  scheme  by  publishing  a  series  of  false  and          misleading press  releases  prepared by the public relations firm          the company retained, owned and  controlled by Raymond C. O\Brien          (O\Brien).   Carraway  paid  O\Brien   and  others  to  publish          purportedly  objective  descriptions  about the  company  and  to          encourage positive discussion about the  company in Internet news          groups.  Carraway and O\Brien used these false  press releases to          increase investor interest in the company.  Carraway  and O\Brien          encouraged    Ronald  V.  Reece  (Reece)  to  publish  positive          information about  the  company  in  numerous Internet news group          messages he wrote and in an electronic  newsletter  he  published          about  the  company.   In  his publications, Reece claimed to  be          merely  an  interested  investor   and   denied   receiving   any          consideration  from the company.  In fact, the company gave Reece          a valuable discount  on  his purchase of the company\s securities          and paid his travel expenses,  all of which he failed to disclose          in his publications."

Appalachian Investment Corporation, Inc., et al. , Civil          Action No. 98-1506 (W.D. Pa.)               The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission)          announced today that, on September 10, 1998, it filed a complaint          in the United States District Court for the Western District of          Pennsylvania, against Appalachian Investment Corporation          (Appalachian),  Dennis G. Cerilli (Cerilli), Frank A. DeBone          (DeBone), Robert C. Walters (Walters), Dennis J. Oslosky          (Oslosky) and John W. Hinton (Hinton).  The complaint alleges          that the defendants violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act          of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934          and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and, based on those violations, seeks          permanent injunctions, disgorgement, prejudgment interest and          civil penalties against each of the defendants.               In its complaint, the Commission alleges that, between          November 1995 and August 1996,  the defendants engaged in a          scheme to misappropriate investor funds raised through the          fraudulent offer and sale of more than $4.6 million worth of          securities in the form of subordinated debentures of Appalachian          and its affiliate, CCMI, Inc.  The complaint charges that the          defendants induced approximately 75 investors, most of whom were          elderly, to purchase the securities by misrepresenting the degree          of risk associated with their investment and the intended use of          proceeds raised in the offering.  The complaint further alleges          that defendants misled investors by guaranteeing them a 10%          annual rate of return while providing little or no information          about the financial condition of Appalachian, CCMI or its          affiliates.               The complaint also charges that, rather than use investor          proceeds to loan money to an affiliated entity of Appalachian as          represented,  the defendants used those funds for their personal          benefit, to keep their businesses afloat and to make interest          payments to existing investors.  The individual defendants          received investor funds for their personal benefit in the          following approximate amounts:  Cerilli, $696,255; DeBone,          $376,200; Oslosky, $201,706; Walters $270,789; and, Hinton,          $46,262."

The Commission also filed an           amended complaint to seek recovery from four persons who refuse to           return $400,000 of funds Solomon obtained from investors.           The orders, which enjoin Solomon, Stevens and Quantum from future           violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section           10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5           thereunder, arise from charges in the Commission\s original complaint           that they fraudulently offered and sold interests in fictitious Prime           Bank Instrument trading programs through Platinum International           Associates and Quantum.  The complaint alleged that Solomon and Stevens           represented, among other things, that they were agents for foreign           securities traders trading in large-denomination debt instruments           issued by one of the top 25 world banks, and that an investment in           the trading programs would generate safe, guaranteed returns of as           much as 4,300% annually. In fact, according to the complaint, Solomon\s           and Stevens\ representations were false:  the trading programs did not           exist, and Solomon and Stevens, in an apparent ponzi scheme,  used           funds taken from investors to pay supposed profits to their business           associates, to repay other investors, and for their own purposes.           The court also ordered Solomon, Quantum and relief defendants Quantum           Air Express, Inc., and Cherokee Worldwide Express, Inc., to pay           disgorgement, jointly and severally, in the amount of  $2,929,510, plus           prejudgment interest, with two provisos: (1)  that Solomon be credited           for any sums actually collected by the Commission in this or any           ancillary proceeding against any person holding funds that were paid or           given to them by Solomon from the proceeds of the unlawful activities           alleged in the complaint;  and (2) that any remaining amount be waived           based on Solomon\s demonstrated financial inability to pay. Stevens was           also ordered to pay disgorgement in the amount of $19,210, plus           prejudgment interest; however, payment of the full amount was waived           based on her demonstrated financial inability to pay. Because of their           poor financial condition, no civil money penalties were imposed on           Solomon or Stevens.           In pursuit of recovering additional investor funds, the Commission           amended its original complaint to add four relief defendants to the           action;  Fidelity International Bank (FIB), Dunamis Enterprises           International (Dunamis), Gilbert Zeigler, and Graham Young.  The           amended complaint charges that FIB, Dunamis, Zeigler and Young hold,           and refuse to return, $400,000 of funds Solomon obtained from           investors, which they know to have been obtained illegally by Solomon           and subject to an asset freeze order entered by the court."

Albin(Albin) from  violations of the antifraud provisions of thefederal  securities  laws. The TRO also temporarily prohibitsAlbin, the Trust, and relief defendant J.F. Albin Companies,Ltd.  (Albin  Companies)  from  dissipating funds, pending ahearing on the Commissions request for a preliminary injunction.In its Complaint, the Commission alleges that Albin has raisedmore than $1.7 million from at least 35 individuals who haveinvested in promissory notes sold by the Trust.  The Trust andmost Trust investors are located in the Kansas City, Missouriarea.  The Commission alleges that the Trust is an ongoing Ponzischeme controlled by Albin and that Albin has misrepresented theuse of investor proceeds, misappropriated investor funds andmisrepresented the safety and liquidity of an investment with theTrust.  In particular, the Commission alleges that Albinmisrepresented the use of investor proceeds to some investors byfalsely claiming investor funds would be used to purchaseinvestment vehicles like certificates of deposit, annuities,bonds and other securities.  Contrary to Albins representations,the Commission alleges, Albin has directed Trust investorproceeds to paying himself, paying Albin Companies operatingexpenses and repaying earlier investors.  According to theCommissions allegations, Albin has also failed to disclose toTrust investors that investors proceeds were used by himpersonally and by Albin Companies for its operating expenses.Further, the Commission alleges that Albin has represented thatthe notes sold by the Trust were safe and liquid, when he knewthat they were not.  The Commission named Albin Companies asrelief defendant because, the Commission alleges, Albin Companieshas received more than $500,000 in ill-gotten gains.

MARSHALL NEIL CRAIG          RONALD, RUDOLF ALEXANDER VICTOR LINSCHOTEN A/K/A RUDOLF VAN LIN          OR DR. RUDOLF VAN LIN, AND FRIEDA G. FREITAS, Civil Action No.          98-7502 WDK (BQRx) (C.D. Cal.).          The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it          filed an enforcement action in federal district court in Los          Angeles against Marshall Neil Craig Ronald (Ronald), Rudolf          Alexander Victor Linschoten (Linschoten), and Frieda G. Freitas          (Freitas).  The Commission alleges that the defendants engaged          in the fraudulent offer and sale of unregistered securities          through Sabre Asset Management Corporation in connection with a          fictitious bank trading program.  The complaint alleges that          from December 1996 through October 1997 the defendants raised          approximately $6.6 million from about 170 investors.           The complaint alleges that the defendants represented to          investors that their funds would be used for a secret bank          trading program.  The defendants guaranteed investors a 100%          return within 90 banking days from the time their funds were          placed into the trading program.  They also represented to          investors that their principal would be secured and that their          investment was risk free.  There  was, however, no bank trading          program.  Rather, the complaint alleges that the defendants          misappropriated 87% of investor funds.  Among other things,          Ronald used investor funds to purchase cars, guns, residential          property, and to pay credit card and hotel bills.  Ronald also          transferred a substantial amount of investor funds to the          overseas account of a company with which he is affiliated.  In          addition, a portion of investor funds was transferred to          Linschoten.  These type of frauds are commonly referred to as          prime bank schemes and have been the subject of repeated          warnings by several federal agencies, including the Commission          and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.          The Commission\s complaint alleges that investors learned of the          investment program at off-shore seminars that were part of a          retail and multi-stage marketing program run by Investors          International Publishing, a company operated by Linschoten in          Orange County.  The off-shore seminars were held in Aruba, on a          cruise from Los Angeles to Ensenada, Mexico, and on cruises from          Cape Canaveral to the Bahamas.  Defendant Ronald resides in          England, Linschoten resides in Orange County, and Freitas resides          in Koloa, Hawaii.  The investors reside in various states          including California, Utah, Arizona, Nevada, Washington, Oregon,          Hawaii, New York and New Jersey.  The complaint seeks an          injunction and disgorgement with prejudgment interest against          each of the defendants for violating Sections 5 and 17 (a) of the          Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities          Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder."

TEDDY  WAYNE  SOLOMON AND LISA DEBRA STEVENS,          3:98-CR-299-X, USDC, ND/TX (Dallas Division)               On  September  10, 1998, a federal  grand  jury  in  Dallas,          Texas,   returned  an indictment  charging  Teddy  Wayne  Solomon          (Solomon)   and Lisa  Debra  Stevens  (Stevens)   with  three          counts of wire  fraud  in connection with their offer and sale of          fictitious  Prime  Bank  Instrument   trading   programs.   The          indictment  alleges  that Solomon and Stevens falsely represented          themselves  to  potential   investors   as   agents  for  foreign          securities  traders  who were trading in large denomination  debt          instruments allegedly issued by one of the top 25 world banks.               As  part  of their  scheme,  according  to  the  indictment,          Solomon and Stevens  told  investors, among other things, that an          investment  in  the  trading  programs   would   generate  safe,          guaranteed returns of as much as 4,300% annually  and  that  the          programs  were  secured by U. S. Government securities.  In fact,          the indictment states that the trading programs were no more than          a ponzi scheme,  whereby new investors\ contributions were used          in part to refund some  portion  of  prior  investors\ principal,          while a substantial portion of the new funds were diverted to the          personal use of Solomon and Stevens.               The  indictment  comes  one  day after Solomon  and  Stevens          agreed to be permanently enjoined from  future  violations of the          federal  securities  laws  in  a  civil  action  brought  by  the          Securities and Exchange Commission which was based  on  the  same          activities alleged in the indictment."

Casey          Ordered Fraudulent Nondisclosures, Directed False Recordkeeping,             and Made False Statements to Auditors          The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil injunctive          action in the federal district court for the District of Columbia          alleging that Thomas F. Casey, the chairman and CEO of Audre          Recognition Systems, Inc., ordered fraudulent nondisclosures in          Audre\s filings with the Commission, directed the falsification          of corporate records, and made materially false statements to          Audre\s auditors in 1993 and 1994.  Audre, based in San Diego,          California, develops and markets document-conversion software.          Fraudulent Nondisclosures          In August 1993, according to the complaint, Casey took an          undisclosed $908,000 personal loan from Audre to pay off a margin          call on his personal holdings of Audre stock.  The complaint          alleges that, despite the materially large size of the loan,          Casey directed Audre\s executive vice president and its senior          accountant to withhold disclosure of the loan from Audre\s          internal records and periodic reports with the Commission.          Accordingly, Audre\s Form 10-Q filings for the quarters ended          October 1993 and January 1994 and its Form 10-K filing for the          year ended April 1994 failed to disclose the loan, the complaint          alleges.          According to the complaint, Casey reviewed and signed the Forms          10-Q and the Form 10-K knowing that those filings failed properly          to disclose the loan as a related-party transaction and that they          contained financial statements that were not prepared in          conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).          The complaint also alleges that in 1994 Casey caused Audre to          file with the Commission a Form S-1 registration statement that          included the false and misleading quarterly and year-end          financial statements.          False Recordkeeping          According to the complaint, Audre\s financial statements, which          were included in the Forms 10-K, 10-Q, and S-1 filings,          improperly accounted for the loan in Audre\s cash and cash          equivalents account.  The complaint also alleges that Casey          deliberately caused the loan to be improperly recorded as an          investment on Audre\s books and records.          False Statements to Auditors          According to the complaint, Casey directed his staff not to          disclose the loan to Audre\s auditors during the 1994 year-end          audit.  The complaint alleges that Casey, along with the          executive vice president and the senior accountant, signed a          representation letter in 1994 that falsely stated that all loans          had been properly recorded or disclosed in Audre\s financial          statements.          The complaint states that Casey repaid the loan in April 1994,          before Audre\s April 30 fiscal year-end.  The complaint also          states that Audre eventually disclosed the loan and its repayment          in a June 1995 amendment to the 1994 Form 10-K.          After the 1995 disclosure of the loan, according to the          complaint, Casey directed the vice president and senior          accountant to conceal from the auditors the true circumstances          surrounding Audre\s earlier failures to make disclosure.  Indeed,          the complaint alleges that Casey directed the executive vice          president and the senior accountant to assert that a          miscommunication had caused the transaction to be improperly          recorded as an investment on Audre\s books and records.          Pending Settlement          The Commission\s complaint seeks an order enjoining Casey from          further violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act,          Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 10b-5,          13b2-1, and 13b2-2, as well as the imposition of civil monetary          penalties.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the          Commission\s complaint, Casey has agreed to a settlement whereby          he would be fully enjoined by an order of the court but would not          pay civil monetary penalties in view of his demonstrated          financial inability to pay.          Related Administrative Proceeding          The Commission has also instituted an administrative proceeding          against Beverly E. Johnston, Audre\s former executive vice          president, Nick R. Avila, Audre\s former senior accountant, and          Audre in connection with this matter.  Without admitting or          denying the Commission\s findings, Johnston, Avila, and Audre          have consented to an order compelling them to cease and desist          from committing or causing violations of the antifraud,          recordkeeping, and other provisions of the federal securities          laws.

SEC OBTAINS JUDGMENTS AGAINST FOUR MORE                     DEFENDANTS IN PILLSBURY INSIDER TRADING CASE          The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that it has          obtained summary judgments against two defendants and settled          judgments against two others in its insider trading case arising          from the 1988 tender offer by Grand Metropolitan PLC for The          Pillsbury Company.  Granting in substantial part the Commissions          motion for summary judgment against defendants Robert Falbo and          Lorre Meade, U.S. District Judge Peter K. Leisure ruled that          Falbo would be enjoined from violating Sections 10(b) and 14(e)          of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3          thereunder, and that both Falbo and Meade must disgorge their          illicit trading profits and pay civil penalties.  Specifically,          Falbo was ordered to disgorge $136,000 plus prejudgment interest          and to pay a civil penalty of $50,000, while Meade was ordered to          disgorge $34,125 plus prejudgment interest and to pay a civil          penalty of $5,000.  Defendants Anthony Capricuso and Michael          Nardino settled the case, without admitting or denying the          allegations of the Commissions complaint, by consenting to entry          of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating          Exchange Act Sections 10(b) and 14(e) and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3,          and that order them to disgorge illicit trading profits of          $301,447 and $177,317, respectively, plus prejudgment interest.          Based on their demonstrated inability to pay, the disgorgement          obligations of both Capricuso and Nardino were waived and no          civil monetary penalties were imposed against them.          The Commissions complaint, filed on September 16, 1992, alleged          that the defendants violated Exchange Act Sections 10(b) and          14(e) and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder by purchasing          Pillsbury common stock and call options before Grand Mets tender          offer was publicly announced and while possessing material          nonpublic information about it.  Earlier this year, the          Commission obtained judgments by settlement against two other          defendants in the case, Eric Muenster and his brother Mark          Muenster.  See Litigation Release No. 15773 (June 9, 1998).          Falbos wife, Theresa Billings Falbo, is also a defendant in the          case.  The Commission did not move for summary judgment against          her.  The litigation is continuing."

Schaefer  (Schaefer), AMPG, Inc. (AMPG),  an             investment adviser registered  with  the Commission, and the             following Schaefer-controlled corporations: American Capital             & Equity Corporation (ACEC), Asset Management  &  Planning             Group,  Inc.  (Asset Management), Bristol Insurance Group,             Inc. (Bristol)  and  Steven R. Schaefer & Associates, Inc.             (SSA). On March 27, 1998, the Commission filed a complaint             seeking  injunctive and other  equitable  relief  and  civil             penalties  against  Schaefer,  AMPG  and  ACEC,  and seeking             equitable relief against Asset Management, Bristol  and SSA.             In  its  complaint,  the  Commission  also  named  as relief             defendants, seeking against them disgorgement only, Parallex             Industries, Inc. (Parallex) and United States Cryobanks of             Florida (Cryobanks).  On March 28, 1998, the Court granted             the Commission\s motion for a temporary restraining order as             against   Schaefer,  AMPG  and  ACEC,  pending  the  Court\s             determination  of  the  Commission\s contemporaneously filed             motion for a preliminary injunction.             The Commission alleged in  its  complaint that Schaefer, who             operates  and  is  president  and  principal  of  AMPG,  was             responsible for the sale of unregistered  notes  to his AMPG             clients.   Schaefer\s  private  company,  ACEC,  issued  the             notes;  an  officer  of  both AMPG and AMPG\s parent company             promoted the notes to the  AMPG  clients.   Between February             1997 and December 1997, approximately  $2.5  million in ACEC             promissory notes were sold to about 40 senior  citizens.  On             their  face,  the  notes  show  a  9% annual return, payable             quarterly.  The elderly clients were  assured  that the ACEC             note   proceeds,   representing  funds  they  had  carefully             accumulated for retirement, would be placed in safe, secured             investments.  Contrary  to  these  representations, Schaefer             loaned  his clients\ funds to entities,  including  entities             Schaefer  owned or controlled, which had no apparent ability             or intention  of  generating a return for his clients, or of             preserving their funds  for  distribution  upon  the  notes\             maturities.   As  a  result  of  the fraudulent diversion of             investors\ funds, the ACEC notes appear to be worthless, and             the investors stand to lose approximately $2.5 million.             The  permanent injunction enjoins Schaefer,  AMPG  and  ACEC             from violations  of  Section  206 of the Investment Advisers             Act of 1940, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and             Section 10(b) of the Securities  Exchange  Act  of 1934, and             Rule   10b-5  thereunder.

(filed September 18, 1998)          On September 18, 1998, the Commission filed a complaint in the          United States District Court for the District of Columbia against          Safetech Industries, Inc. (Safetech Industries).  The complaint          alleges that Safetech Industries, a company that manufactures and          markets hurricane protection products whose securities are quoted          in the pink sheets, failed to make available to the investing          public current and accurate information about its financial          condition and results of operation through the filing of periodic          reports with the Commission as required by the Securities          Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act).  Specifically, the          complaint alleges that Safetech Industries has not filed its          Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31,          1998, its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters          ended December 31, 1997 and June 30, 1998 and nine Notifications          of Late Filing with respect to its delinquent reports.  The          Commission seeks to compel Safetech Industries to file its          delinquent periodic reports and enjoin Safetech Industries from          further violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act of 1934          and Rules 12b-25, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder."

(SOE) in 1995 and          1996.  The Complaint, filed  in  United States District Court for          the  District  of  Columbia,  alleges  that  Sotnikow  introduced          Charles O. Huttoe (Huttoe), the former CEO and Chairman of SOE,          to  several  stock  brokers  to help  push  SOE  stock  on  the          investing public.  Huttoe then bribed those firms with SOE shares          and cash for their cooperation.  For her participation in the SOE          fraud, Sotnikow received 600,000  shares  of  unregistered, free-          trading SOE stock.  She sold 210,000 of those shares for proceeds          of $474,308.          Simultaneously  with  the  SEC  filing  the Complaint,  Sotnikow,          without admitting or denying the SEC\s allegations,  settled  the          action  by consenting to the entry of a permanent injunction from          violations  of the securities registration (Sections 5(a) and (c)          of the Securities  Act of 1933) and antifraud provisions (Section          17(a) of the Securities  Act and 10(b) of the Securities Exchange          Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5  thereunder) of the federal securities          laws, and an order requiring  her to disgorge her illegal profits          of $474,308, provided that upon  her transfer of $110,000 in cash          and certain other non-cash assets to the Court-appointed Receiver          in the action, collection of the remaining  disgorgement  will be          waived in light of Sotnikow\s demonstrated inability to pay based          on  her  sworn  representations  in  her  statement  of financial          condition.   Sotnikow  also agreed to a Commission order  barring          her from participating in an offering of penny stock.          In the parallel criminal  action,  the Honorable Albert V. Bryan,          United  States  District  Judge  for  the   Eastern  District  of          Virginia, today sentenced Sotnikow to three years  of  supervised          probation  with  the  special  conditions  of  being  barred from          participation  in  the  securities industry, participation  in  a          substance abuse program,  100 hours of community service, and the          costs of her probation.  Sotnikow  was  sentenced  pursuant  to a          criminal information charging her with one count of conspiracy to          commit  securities  fraud  and  defeat the lawful function of the          Internal Revenue Service.  Sotnikow entered into a plea agreement          with  the  government  on  June  12,  1998.   Both  the  criminal          information  and the plea agreement were  filed  under  seal  and          remained sealed until September 16, 1998.  Sotnikow\s guilty plea          was the sixth related to the SOE pump and dump scheme.          The  Commission   previously   has   made  several  announcements          concerning these matters.  See Lit. Rel.  15677 (March 19, 1998);          Lit. Rel. 15617 (January 14, 1998); Lit. Rel. 15600 (December 22,          1997);  Lit.  Rel.  15571 (November 25, 1997);  Lit.

SANJAY SAXENA AND MUMTAZ          SAXENA, Civil Action No. 98-cv-11918-EFH (D. Mass., filed          September 18, 1998)                   SEC SUES REPEAT VIOLATOR OF THE SECURITIES LAWS          The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) today          announced the filing of a complaint against Sanjay Saxena, a          former registered investment adviser and newsletter publisher,          and his wife, Mumtaz Saxena.  The complaint alleges that the          Saxenas violated the antifraud and registration provisions of the          federal securities laws, and that Saxena violated a previous          Commission order permanently barring him from the securities          industry.  The complaint alleges that Saxena\s role in the          formation and operation of an investment adviser and two          investment companies violated the Commission\s bar order, and          that Saxena used his wife as a front to create the appearance          that he had not violated the order.          The complaint alleges that the Saxenas made material          misrepresentations and omissions in connection with the          solicitation of investors and the operation of the investment          companies.  Between February 1996 and February 1997, the Saxenas          conducted unregistered public offerings of interests in the          investment companies by soliciting thousands of potential          investors, mostly Saxena\s newsletter subscribers, through direct          mailings and internet notices that contained material          misrepresentations.  They subsequently sold approximately $3.4          million in interests in the two investment companies to 32          persons and entities.  The Saxenas received approximately          $280,000 in management fees from the investment companies.          The complaint alleges that, between March and November 1995, also          in violation of his bar order, Saxena acted as an investment          adviser for certain accounts at a broker-dealer, for which he          collected approximately $27,000 in advisory fees.          The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of the          Saxenas\ fees (plus prejudgment interest), civil monetary          penalties, and an order commanding Saxena to comply with the          Commission\s bar order.          The prior issuance of the Commission\s bar order against Saxena          arose from its lawsuit against him in 1994.  In that action, the          Commission obtained a temporary restraining order and asset          freeze based on allegations that he misappropriated over $600,000          that he had solicited from his newsletter subscribers for a          pooled investment.  The Commission also alleged that Saxena sent          false monthly statements of the pooled investment to investors.          On February 25, 1995, Saxena consented to the entry of a final          judgment of permanent injunction restraining him from further          violations and an order to disgorge $703,000 (representing all          monies owed to investors), and to pay prejudgment and          postjudgment interest.  On February 28, 1995, the Commission          entered its order permanently barring Saxena from the securities          industry.          [See prior Litigation Release Nos. 14348, 14419]."

Commercial Express,             LLC et al., Civil Action No. 98-M-2014 (USDC CO.)             On September 17, 1998, the U.S. Securities and Exchange             Commission (the Commission) filed a complaint in the             United States District Court for the District of Colorado             against the perpetrators of  a telemarketing Ponzi scheme             that raised at least $15 million from investors nationwide,             including Colorado.  Named in the complaint as defendants             are Commercial Express, LLC (Commercial Express) and             Progressive Financial, Inc. (Progressive Financial), both             operating in Santa Monica, California, as well as eighteen             other entities and individuals.  The Commission also filed a             motion in the action seeking a temporary restraining order,             a preliminary injunction and, among other things, an asset             freeze.             Commercial Express and Progressive Financial, headed by Joel             A. Fein (Fein), Timothy M. Hazzard (Hazzard), Mark D.             McClafferty (McClafferty) and Grace Na, each of whom are             named as defendants in the action,  have raised funds from             investors since approximately September 1997 with the avowed             purpose of purchasing air time on television stations to run             infomercials for consumer goods.  Commercial Express and             Progressive Financial have raised at least $15 million from             500 investors nationwide through sales of media units and             equity positions offering quarterly returns ranging from 8%             to 26%.  Investors were solicited through a boiler room             operation at the offices of Progressive Financial and             Commercial Express, as well as by independent sales offices             (ISOs) throughout the United States.             The Commission alleges that the defendants have defrauded             investors by conducting a Ponzi scheme, with payment of the             promised returns being made from funds received from the             ongoing sale of media units and equity positions.  The             Commission also alleges that more than $4.5 million was             transferred to Fein, Hazzard and McClafferty directly, or             through entities named as relief defendants in the             Commission\s action, and that only approximately $1.4             million was spent on product development and the acquisition             of television advertising time.             The Commission further alleges that the defendants have             failed to disclose the excessive commissions, up to 60% of             each invested dollar, being paid to ISOs and salespeople;             falsely stated that Creative Entertainment Group, Inc., a             consultant to Commercial Express, now owns Commercial             Express and  has taken over its operations; misleadingly             stated that no distributions would be made to investors for             at least six months during a cooling off period, without             disclosing that Commercial Express currently has no business             operations to generate revenue for future distributions; and             misrepresented to investors that Commercial Express has             several significant contracts with third parties including,             among others, QVC.             The Commission\s complaint charges that the defendants have             violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities             laws -- Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and             Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and             Rule 10b-5 thereunder -- as well as the broker dealer             registration provisions of Section 15(a) of the Exchange             Act.             The Honorable Richard P. Matsch, Chief Judge, denied the             Commission\s motion for a temporary restraining order and             ordered that the Commission\s motion for a preliminary             injunction will be heard on September 28, 1998."

No. 98 CV 11904-NG)          The Commission announced that a seal has been lifted on an          emergency action freezing the assets of ten defendants who were          participating in a massive prime bank Ponzi scheme in which more          than $19 million was raised from more than 80 investors in 16          states.  The records had been previously sealed until all known          bank accounts were frozen.  The Commission alleged that beginning          in August 1997, three Tampa-area defendants, Terry Koontz          (Koontz), Jeffrey DeVille (J. DeVille) and Mykael DeVille (M.          DeVille), recruited and used a network of salesmen on the East          Coast to sell interests in  an international bank debenture          trading program named Private Pool. LLC.              Using false information and offering materials provided by defendants           Koontz, J. DeVille and M. DeVille, sales agents, including defendants          Richard J. Fulcher, Thomas Dolan, Lawrence E. Seppanen, Walter Lapp,           and Kurt Fox, residents of Florida, Virginia, New York and New Jersey,           falsely informed investors that their funds would be invested in a           40-week bank debenture trading program through Koontz, an international           bond trader affiliated with Barclays Bank .  The defendants falsely           promised investors that investments in the trading program would provide           a 1% weekly return and would be secured by Government National Mortgage          Association  or Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation bonds. The bank           debenture trading program does not exist, and Koontz is not affiliated           with Barclays. To support these misrepresentations, the defendants           distributed fraudulent documents bearing forged signatures of Barclays           officials as well as counterfeit stamps of Barclays and the State of           New York to convince people that their investments were effectively secured          by the bonds.          The Complaint alleges that investor funds are being deposited          into a bank account in the name of Zone Productions, which is          controlled by Koontz .  Koontz dissipated at least $9.9 million          from the Zone account.  Among other things, he spent $468,000 on          automobiles; over $250,000 on jewelry; and $650,000 on real          estate. Koontz made gratuitous transfers of over $500,000 to his          wife, relief defendant Marilyn Koontz, $3.1 million to relief          defendant Dorothy Gerodemos, $481,000 to relief defendant Nancy          Chamich,  $1.9 million to relief defendant Emanon II, Inc.  and          $727,000 to relief defendant Stewart Koral. The Complaint alleges          that the Devilles also used investor funds for their own personal          use, buying a Cadillac, 2  BMWs, and  jewelry.  The DeVilles also          transferred $300,000 to an off-shore account.          The Commission obtained an order temporarily restraining the          fraudulent activities, freezing assets, prohibiting the          acceptance of additional investor funds,  requiring repatriation          of funds transferred abroad and other relief in a complaint filed          on September 17, 1998 in the United States District Court for the          District of Massachusetts.          This matter is a related case to another emergency fraudulent          offering action,  SEC v. Michael D. Richmond, et al., Civ. Action          No. 98-11378 (NG) (Richmond), filed with this Court on July 15,          1998, in which Koontz, Zone Productions and Purr Trust are also          are defendants.  The case is related  because the main defendant          in the Richmond case transferred to Koontz and Zone over $6          million of proceeds he  had raised by selling fictitious          certificates of deposit   (See Litigation Release No. 15813).

(September 18, 1998)             COURT FREEZES PROCEEDS OF ALLEGED INSIDER TRADING BY HALTON          TECHNOLOGIES, LTD., IN SECURITIES OF TELEDATA COMMUNICATIONS LTD.                   SEC, In Emergency Federal Court Action, Obtains                Order Freezing About $300,000 In Profits From Trading                 In The Securities Of Teledata By Trader That Bought                       Shortly Before Acquisition Announcement          The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that the          U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered          a Temporary Restraining Order late Friday against Halton          Technologies, Ltd., temporarily prohibiting Halton from obtaining          or disposing of proceeds from the sale of the securities of          Teledata Communications Ltd., an Israeli firm whose stock trades          on the Nasdaq market in the United States.  The Commissions          complaint alleges that Halton engaged in illegal insider trading          shortly before the September 16, 1998 announcement that ADC          Telecommunications, Inc., a Minnesota corporation, intended to          acquire Teledata.          According to the Commissions complaint, Halton is an Israeli          entity located in the same city, Herzelyia, where Teledata is          headquartered.  The Commission alleges that on September 1 and 2,          1998, Halton, while in possession of material, non-public          information about the acquisition, spent more than $450,000 to          purchase a total of 225 Teledata call options and 45,000 shares          of Teledata common stock through an account with CIBC Oppenheimer          Corp. in New York.  After ADC and Teledata announced their          merger, Haltons investment rose in value by more than $300,000,          or 66%.          In the pending lawsuit, the Commission alleges that Halton          engaged in illegal insider trading in violation of Section 10(b)          of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.  As          relief, the Commission seeks a permanent prohibitory injunction,          the disgorgement of all illegal profits, and the imposition of          civil monetary penalties.          The Courts Temporary Restraining Order prohibits the removal of          any proceeds from the sale of Haltons Teledata securities for a          10-day period.  In addition, the courts Order imposes an          expedited discovery schedule and prohibits the defendants from          destroying documents.          The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Chicago Board          Options Exchange, and the National Association of Securities          Dealers in this matter."
15894,1998,,"b                          SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION          Litigation Release No. 15894 / September 22, 1998          SECURITIES  AND  EXCHANGE  COMMISSION v. BARNARD SACKETT, JOHN H.          SCHRIEK   AND  ENVIROLAND,  LTD.,   Civ.   Action   No.   97-5934          U.S.D.C., E.D. Pa.                     The Commission announced that on September 14, 1998, the          Honorable Anita Brody, United States District Court Judge for the          Eastern District of Pennsylvania, issued a final judgment that          permanently enjoins defendant Barnard Sackett (Sackett) from          committing securities fraud.  The Commission\s Complaint, which          was filed on September 22, 1997, alleges, among other things,          that Sackett, together with defendants John H. Schriek          (Schriek) and Enviroland, Ltd. (Enviroland), solicited the          Bankruptcy Estate for the Foundation For New Era Philanthropy,          Inc. in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as well as at least one other          investor, to invest as much as $100 million in fraudulent prime          bank securities.  The Complaint also alleges that the defendants          guaranteed investors the repayment of principal and returns on          their investments at the annual rate of at least 360% and as          great as 528%.  The Commission\s Complaint further alleges that          the defendants requested that those investors recommend the          fictitious prime bank securities to hundreds of non-profit          organizations and charities that are associated with or creditors          of those investors.  The final judgment permanently enjoins          Sackett from violating Section 17 of the Securities Act of 1933,          and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule          10b-5 thereunder, but does not impose a civil penalty against          Sackett based on his demonstrated inability to pay.  Sackett          consented to the entry of the final judgment without admitting or          denying the allegations contained in the Complaint.  The          Commission\s action remains pending against defendants Schriek          and Enviroland."
15895,1998,,"b                   UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION             LITIGATION RELEASE NO. 15895 / September 23, 1998             SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION v. ONE OR MORE UNKNOWN             PURCHASERS OF CALL OPTIONS AND COMMON STOCK OF USCS             INTERNATIONAL, INC., No. 98-Civ-6327 (S.D.N.Y.)                       UNKNOWN PURCHASERS OF SECURITIES OF USCS                       INTERNATIONAL FAIL TO APPEAR AT HEARING;                               ASSETS TO REMAIN FROZEN             On September 17, 1998, the Honorable Leonard B. Sand of the             U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York             entered a Preliminary Injunction against one or more unknown             purchasers of call options and common stock of USCS             International, Inc.             The Preliminary Injunction supersedes the Courts Temporary             Restraining Order, which had temporarily frozen more than             $1.9 million in funds involved in an alleged insider trading             scheme.  The funds consist of more than $1.6 million that             the one or more unknown purchasers used to purchase the USCS             common stock, as well as more than $300,000 in profits from             the sales of the stock.  The unknown defendants did not             oppose the Commissions application for a Preliminary             Injunction and failed to show for the Courts hearing on the             matter.             The Commission initially had sought and obtained a Temporary             Restraining Order that froze the $1.9 million in assets and             granted other emergency relief.  See Lit. Rel. No. 15875             (September 9, 1998).  The Commissions complaint alleged             that the unknown purchasers had engaged in illegal insider             trading in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities             Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5.  According to the complaint,             one or more unknown persons had purchased 200 USCS call             options and 61,800 shares of USCS common stock just hours             before the announcement on September 2, 1998, that DST             Systems, Inc. intended to merge with USCS.  The complaint             further alleged that the defendants had hidden their             identities by trading through a Swiss bank."

15905,1998,,"b                         SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION                                             Washington, D.C.          Litigation Release No. 15905 / September 24, 1998          SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION v. RANGARAO PANGULURI, ET AL.,          Civil Action No. SACV 97-298 GLT (EEX) (C.D. Cal. April 9, 1997).               The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced the          entry of final judgments (Final Judgments) in the second of two          related bad news insider trading cases involving the securities          of Alpha 1 Biomedicals, Inc. (Alpha 1) and SciClone Pharmaceu-          ticals, Inc. (SciClone).  The Commission\s Complaint alleged          that, in April 1994, Rangarao Panguluri, then a Fellow at Wayne          State University in Detroit, Michigan, tipped a group of doctors          practicing in Anaheim, California about the negative results of          clinical tests of a new drug developed by Alpha 1 and licensed to          SciClone.  Prior to the public announcement of the test results,          the doctors traded in the securities of Alpha 1 and SciClone and,          as a result, avoided losses and realized profits in the amount of          $137,256.               On September 17, 1998, Judge Gary L. Taylor of the United          States District Court for the Central District of California          entered Final Judgments against defendants Panguluri, Ravindra          Alapati, Syam Gaddam, Gowtami Gaddam, and Ravi Makam.  The Final          Judgments to which Alapati, the Gaddams, and Makam consented,          without admitting or denying the Complaint\s allegations, enjoin          them from further violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities          Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder,          and order them to pay disgorgement of $61,000, $16,931, and          $59,325, respectively, plus prejudgment interest thereon, and to          pay civil penalties of $61,000, $16,931, and $59,325,          respectively.  In addition, the Final Judgment to which Panguluri          consented, without admitting or denying the Complaint\s          allegations, enjoins him from further violations of antifraud          provisions of the Exchange Act and orders him to pay a civil          penalty of $75,000, an amount equal to the total avoided losses          and realized profits of his direct tippees.              The Complaint alleged that Thymosin alpha 1 (Thymosin), an          experimental, anti-hepatitis drug, was Alpha 1\s primary product-          in-development during the relevant period and underwent a well-          publicized, double-blinded, Phase III clinical trial at three          medical research institutions.  Successful performance by          Thymosin in the Phase III clinical trial was a necessary step          towards approval of the drug by the Food and Drug Administration.          The Complaint also alleged that, on April 25, 1994, Dr. Panguluri          and another doctor unblinded the study and learned that patients          treated with Thymosin fared no better than patients given a          placebo with respect to the study\s most significant test          parameter. The Complaint alleged that Panguluri tipped the          negative results to his friends, Dr. Ravindra Alapati and Dr.          Syam Gaddam, whose medical practice in California he was hoping          to join upon completion of his fellowship.  Panguluri\s tip          prompted Alapati and Gaddam to immediately sell all their Alpha 1          and/or SciClone securities, and Alapati to sell short 2,000          shares of Alpha 1 stock, on April 25 and 26, 1994.  The Complaint          further alleged that, after being tipped by Panguluri, Alapati,          in turn, tipped his professional and social friend, Dr. Ravi          Makam, and that Dr. and Mrs. Gaddam tipped Mrs. Gaddam\s sister,          who was not named as a defendant in the case.  Prior to the          opening of the market on April 28, 1994, Alpha 1 announced the          negative news about the Thymosin clinical trial.  The share price          of both Alpha 1 and SciClone declined that day by approximately          two-thirds.

15906,1998,,"b                         SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION                                  Washington, D.C.          LITIGATION RELEASE NO.   15906  / September 24, 1998          SECURITIES  AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION v. CHARLES O. HUTTOE, ET AL.,          Civil Action No. 96-02543 (GK)(D.D.C.)          SEC WINS SUMMARY JUDGMENT AGAINST INTERNET MICROCAP STOCK TOUT               The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission)          announced that on September 14, 1998, the United States District          Court for the District of Columbia granted the Commission\s          motion for summary judgment against Shannon B. Terry (Terry)          and Dunbar Holdings, Ltd., (Dunbar), two defendants in the case          arising out of the manipulation of the market for the securities          of Systems of Excellence, Inc. (SOE).  The Court found that          Terry and Dunbar, Terry\s wholly owned Bahamian shell company,          violated the antitouting and antifraud provisions of the          securities laws by touting and scalping the securities of SOE and          seventeen other microcap issuers.  The Court ordered Terry and          Dunbar to disgorge trading profits of $828,448 and certain other          compensation, together with prejudgment interest on that amount,          and permanently enjoined them future violations of Section 17(a)          of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities          Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.               In particular, the Court found the following:          \x07  From August 1993 until November 1996 Terry was employed by SGA             Goldstar Research, Inc., publisher of the SGA Goldstar Whisper             Stocks newsletter.  That newsletter profiled and made             recommendations promoting largely unknown and untested penny             stock or small capitalization companies, and was distributed             over the internet and otherwise.          \x07  Terry\s duties included writing articles and commentaries             about some of the companies, selling newsletter subscriptions             and assisting in production and distribution of the             newsletter.          \x07  Companies paid SGA with stock in exchange for articles             promoting their stock in the Whisper newsletter. Terry got             stock from SGA for companies he promoted in the articles he             wrote.          \x07  Continuously over a two year period, Terry sold stocks after             the Whisper newsletter recommended that its subscribers             purchase those stocks.  Terry sold both stock that he received             as compensation for touting the issuer and stock that he             purchased in the market shortly before promotional articles             appeared in the Whisper newsletter.          \x07  Terry\s failure to disclose that he had been given shares in             exchange for promoting the companies in the newsletter             violated the antitouting and the antifraud provisions of the             securities laws.  The Court rejected a disclaimer that             personnel associated with SGA may own shares in the companies             mentioned herein or may act as consultants thereto for             compensation as inadequate disclosure of those facts, and             held that [i]t is inherently misleading to present articles             as objective reporting when they are in fact promotions paid             for by the company featured.          \x07  Terry\s failure to disclose that he intended to sell his             personal holdings of stock despite the recommendations to buy             made in the Whisper newsletter -- a practice known as             scalping -- separately violated the antifraud provisions of             the securities laws.          \x07  Terry\s undisclosed touting and scalping separately defrauded             subscribers to the newsletters. The Court ordered Terry and             Dunbar to disgorge the commissions he earned for selling             subscriptions to the Whisper newsletter.               The Court also rejected Terry\s and Dunbar\s claims that          Section 17(b) of the Exchange Act -- requiring disclosure of          compensation received from an issuer, underwriter or dealer in          exchange for publishing a description of a security -- violated          the First and Fifth amendments of the Constitution as applied to          them.               In the same decision, the Court denied the Commission\s          motion for summary judgment against J.S. Holdings, a relief          defendant in the case.  It also granted J.S. Holdings\ motion to          lift the preliminary injunctive relief previously imposed.               In other developments in recent months, the Commission has          entered into settlements with, or dismissed from the litigation,          seven additional relief defendants.  On August 6, 1998, the Court          ordered, pursuant to a consent in which she neither admitted nor          denied the Commission\s allegations, Nancy Ellis, aka Nancy Ellis          Davis, aka Nancy Davis (Ellis) to pay disgorgement of          $3,579,770, which is the amount of illegal proceeds that she          received from the SOE fraud.  The settlement provided that upon          the transfer by Ellis to the Court-appointed Receiver of          $2,805,047 in bank accounts that were previously frozen in this          case, collection of the remaining disgorgement would be waived in          light of her demonstrated inability to pay based on the          representations in Ellis\s sworn financial statements.  On August          17, 1998, those funds were transferred to the Receiver in full          compliance with the Court\s order.  As part of the settlement          with Ellis, the Commission agreed to dismiss without prejudice          Ellis\s son and daughter-in-law, relief defendants William K. Daw          and Sonya Daw, from the litigation.               In addition, relief defendants Jack Weinstein, Nancy          Weinstein, and Adobe Galleries Inc. (Weinstein relief          defendants) consented, without admitting or denying the          Commission\s allegations, to the entry of a final judgment in          which the Court declared that they have no right, interest, or          claim to three checks that they received from Ellis totaling          $2,600,000 and ordered them to surrender these instruments.          These three checks, drawn on accounts containing fraud proceeds,          were the basis for the Commission\s claims against the Weinstein          relief defendants.  The Court entered this final judgment on July          15, 1998.  Finally, the Commission dismissed without prejudice          relief defendant Lynda Lou Kane-Kraft from the ongoing litigation          on April 10, 1998.  Kane-Kraft\s husband, Sheldon Kraft, settled          on January 14, 1998 a related Commission action filed against him          pursuant to which he paid to the Receiver $1,107,000 in cash,          surrendered a vacation house, and assigned claims against his          former employer.  The Commission\s settlement with Kraft, which          virtually eliminated the combined assets of Kraft and Kane-Kraft,          encompassed the relief that potentially could be obtained from          Kane-Kraft.               The Commission  previously  has  made  several announcements          concerning  these matters.  See  Lit. Rel. 15888  (September  18,          1998); Lit. Rel. 15677 (March 19, 1998); Lit. Rel. 15617 (January          14, 1998); Lit.  Rel.  15600 (December 22, 1997); Lit. Rel. 15571          (November 25, 1997); Lit.  Rel.  15490 (September 12, 1997); Lit.

No. 33791 (October 7, 1996).               The Commission\s investigation in this matter is continuing.               This enforcement action is part  of  the  Commission\s four-          pronged  approach  to  minimizing  Microcap  fraud:  enforcement,          inspections,   investor   education  and  regulation.

Gateways, now a defunct entity, attempted to             develop and market a series of educational videotapes             related to the United States space program until the company             ceased operations in 1996.             The Commissions complaint makes the following allegations.             Between approximately 1993 and March 1996, the defendants             fraudulently offered and sold Karabochos unregistered,             restricted Gateways stock to more than 780 investors             nationwide, resulting in investor losses of approximately $5             million.  In their offer and sale of Karabochos stock, the             defendants made material misrepresentations or omissions to             investors.  For example, Karabochos misrepresented to             prospective investors that after six months they could             exchange their restricted stock either for the amount of             their original investment, plus interest, or for             unrestricted Gateways shares.  The complaint also alleges             that Karabochos and his wife overstated the Companys sales             of videotapes to investors, prepared false sales reports and             instructed Gateways employees to mislead investors as to the             true level of current sales.  Defendants Ratto and Boyd             allegedly told investors that they did not have a direct             financial interest in the sale of Karabochos restricted             stock when, in fact, they received commissions of up to 20%             on sales in which they were involved.  Finally, the             defendants allegedly offered and sold Karabochos restricted             stock without complying with the registration provisions of             the federal securities laws.             The complaint alleges violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and             17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) and 15(a)             of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5             thereunder.  The Commission also seeks disgorgement of ill-             gotten gains, civil penalties, and other appropriate relief             against Defendants."

No.   15909  /  September 29, 1998          DISTRICT   COURT   ENTERS   FINAL  JUDGMENTS  IN  CASE  INVOLVING          CONECTISYS STOCK MANIPULATION               The Securities and Exchange  Commission (Commission) today          announced that on September 22, 1998,  the United States District          Court  for  the Central District of California  entered  a  final          judgment of permanent  injunction  against Conectisys Corporation          (Conectisys),  which  is  the  final  relief  obtained  by  the          Commission in this case.  The Commission  brought  this action in          June  1996 to enjoin the ongoing manipulation of the  market  for          Conectisys  stock.  In its final judgment against Conectisys, the          Court permanently enjoined  the company from future violations of          Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)  of  the  Securities  Act  of 1933          (Securities  Act),  the  registration and antifraud provisions.          The  Court  also  ordered  Conectisys  to  disgorge  $175,000  of          proceeds derived from its fraudulent conduct.               The  entry  of  final judgment  against  Conectisys  follows          earlier judgments the  Court  entered  on  June  29, 1998 against          defendants  Andrew  S. Pitt (Pitt), Devon Investment  Advisors,          Inc. (Devon), Mike  Zaman (Zaman), B&M Capital Corp. (B&M),          and Smith Benton & Hughes,  Inc.  (Smith  Benton).  On June 29,          the Court permanently enjoined Zaman, Smith  Benton, and B&M from          future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section          10(b)  of  the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange  Act),          and further  enjoined  Zaman  and  Smith  Benton  from  violating          Section 15(c)(1)(A) of the Exchange Act.  The Court also  ordered          Zaman,  Smith Benton, and B&M, jointly and severally, to disgorge          $611,193  in  unlawful  proceeds derived from the manipulation of          the market for Conectisys  stock.   The  Court enjoined Pitt from          future  violations  of  Sections 5(a), 5(c),  and  17(a)  of  the          Securities Act, and enjoined  Devon  from violating Sections 5(a)          and 5(c).  The final judgment against Pitt and Devon also ordered          them, jointly and severally, to disgorge $399,980, and ordered an          additional  $50,000  of disgorgement against  Pitt,  jointly  and          severally with Conectisys.               The final judgments against Conectisys, Pitt, Devon, Zaman,          Smith Benton, and B&M were entered following a bench trial held          in July 1997.  Based on the evidence presented at the trial, the          Court found that Pitt and Zaman together planned the manipulation          of Conectisys stock, and Zaman and Smith Benton carried out that          manipulation with Pitt\s assistance.  In the course of carrying          out the manipulation, Zaman and Smith Benton controlled the          number of Conectisys common shares available for sale on the          market, dictated the prices at which those shares traded, engaged          in daisy chain trading with market participants to fill retail          customer orders, and artificially increased the price of the          stock purchased by retail customers.  The Court also found that          Pitt and Conectisys offered and sold restricted stock to private          investors based on material misrepresentations and that Pitt and          Conectisys drafted a false and misleading business plan that was           supplied to potential investors.  Finally, the Court found that           Pitt, Conectisys, and Devon sold unregistered securities in           violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act.               The Commission also today instituted and settled an          administrative proceeding against Mike Zaman.  On consent, the          Commission permanently barred Zaman from association with any          broker, dealer, investment adviser, investment company or          municipal securities dealer.               This enforcement  action  was part of the Commission\s four-          pronged  approach  to  minimizing  Microcap  fraud:  enforcement,          inspections,  investor  education  and   regulation.

15910,1998,,"b                  UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION          LITIGATION RELEASE NO.   15910  / September 29 , 1998          SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION v. LLOYD MYERS, ET AL. (United          States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, Civil          Action No. CV98-5984)               The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission)          announced the filing, on September 28, 1998, of a complaint in          the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New          York, alleging insider trading in the securities of Health          Management, Inc. (Health Management) by Lloyd Myers, a former          officer of Health Management, his wife, Deborah Myers, and his          in-laws Martin Freiwirth and Beverly Freiwirth.  The complaint          seeks permanent injunctions for violations of the antifraud          provisions of the securities laws, disgorgement and civil          penalties.  Lloyd and Deborah Myers live in Pittsburgh,          Pennsylvania.  Martin and Beverly Freiwirth live in Oceanside,          New York.               Health Management, headquartered in Holbrook, New York,          provides outpatient drug therapies to individuals and performs          management services for the health care industry.  On June 14,          1995, the company announced lower than expected earnings for its          fourth quarter ending April 30, 1995.  Following the          announcement, the price of Health Management common stock dropped          by 29 percent, from $17 1/2 to $12 1/2 per share.               The complaint alleges that Lloyd Myers learned of the          earnings shortfall during the first week of June 1995 while          attending a senior staff meeting.  He then tipped his wife and          in-laws regarding Health Management\s anticipated earnings          shortfall and impending announcement.  On June 9, 1995, Deborah          Myers purchased 600 put option contracts on Health Management          stock for a total purchase price of $30,403.  A put option gives          its buyer the right to sell a specified number of shares of stock          at a particular price within a specified time period.  As of the          close of business on June 16, 1995, two days after the June 14th          announcement, the value of the put options had increased to          $105,000, affording Deborah Myers an unrealized profit of          $74,597.  The complaint further alleges that on June 13, 1995,          after being tipped by Lloyd Myers, and instructed by him to sell          shares of Health Management stock which they owned, Martin and          Beverly Freiwirth sold 2,000 shares of Health Management common          stock, and avoided losses of $10,750.               Simultaneously with the filing of the complaint, and without          admitting or denying the Commission\s allegations, the defendants          consented to the entry of Final Judgments and Orders.  The Orders          permanently enjoin the defendants from  future violations of          Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule          10b-5 thereunder.  Lloyd Myers, Martin Freiwirth and Beverly          Freiwirth are also enjoined from future violations of Section          17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.  The Order also requires          that the Myers disgorge $74,597 plus prejudgment interest, and          pay a civil penalty of $37,298, and that the Freiwirths disgorge          $10,750 plus prejudgment interest, and pay a civil penalty of          $10,750."

Shane T. Vaessen, Veronika          M. Vaessen, Otis Herring, Marvin Moses, Taft Womack, William          McNamara, Dale Van Wyk, and Frank Gaines, Civil Action No. 98-          1964-CV-10-26F (M. D. Florida)               The  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission (SEC) announced          that  today it filed a complaint in a seven  state  Ponzi  scheme          which included three Florida insurance agents.  The SEC filed its          complaint  in  the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of          Florida against Shane T. Vaessen (Vaessen), Veronika M. Vaessen          (V. Vaessen), Otis Herring (Herring), Marvin Moses (Moses),          Taft Womack (Womack),  William  McNamara (McNamara), Dale Van          Wyk  (Van  Wyk)  and Frank Gaines (Gaines),  and  is  seeking          orders of permanent  injunction,  disgorgement,  and  civil money          penalties.   Vaessen,  age  54,  and  V.  Vaessen,  age  52,  are          residents  of  Las  Vegas, Nevada.  Vaessen was the President and          Chief  Executive Officer  of  ICC  2000,  a  now  defunct  Nevada          corporation, and V. Vaessen was its Secretary and Treasurer.  The          SEC\s complaint  alleges,  among  other things, that the Vaessens          sold ICC 2000 securities and raised  over  $3.3 million from over          100 investors in Florida, Georgia, Indiana,  Nebraska,  Michigan,          Tennessee, and California between 1994 and 1997.               The SEC\s complaint alleges that all defendants violated the          antifraud  provisions of the federal securities laws.  The  SEC\s          complaint also  alleges,  among other things, that the defendants          illegally sold unregistered  securities, and that Herring, Moses,          Womack, McNamara, Van Wyk, and  Gaines illegally acted as broker-          dealers without being registered with the SEC.               The SEC\s complaint alleges  that  the  Vaessens  and  their          sales  agents  represented  to  investors  that  their funds were          pooled   in   bank  accounts  and  offered  to  Major  Brokerage          Companies  as  collateral   to   purchase  and  sell  Guaranteed          Insurance Contracts (GICs).  In return  for  their investments,          which  ranged  from  $2,200  to  over  $150,000,  investors  were          provided with a written ICC 2000 investment contract, a specified          number  of  post-dated  checks purportedly representing  interest          payments   for  the  investment,   and   one   post-dated   check          representing  a  return  of  the investor\s principal.  The SEC\s          complaint  alleges,  however that  investors  monies  were  never          invested in GICs.  Instead,  the  SEC\s  complaint  alleges  that          investment  funds  were used primarily for interest and principal          payments to earlier ICC 2000 investors, to pay sales commissions,          and for the Vaessens\  personal  expenditures.   Instead of using          ICC  2000  program  funds  for  investment  purposes, funds  were          withdrawn from the accounts in amounts ranging  from  about $1000          to  over  $10,000,  as  cash.   Vaessen and V. Vaessen also  used          investor funds to make mortgage payments  of  approximately $3500          per month for the Vaessen residence in Las Vegas,  Nevada, to pay          over  $50,000  for construction and remodeling work performed  on          that residence,  to  pay over $20,000 for jewelry for V. Vaessen,          and to pay over $10,000  for  a  high-end department store credit          card account.               The  SEC\s complaint alleges that  Herring,  Moses,  Womack,          McNamara, Van Wyk, and Gaines received commissions as high as 56%          for their sale  of  investment  contracts to many unsophisticated          and  elderly residents of Florida,  Georgia,  Indiana,  Nebraska,          Michigan, Tennessee, and California.               This  enforcement  action  is  part of a joint action by the          Regional SEC, the Florida Office of the  Comptroller, the Florida          Department  of  Insurance,  and  the  Hillsborough  County  State          Attorney\s Office.               The SEC thanks the Florida State Comptroller\s Department of          Banking and Finance, the Indiana Secretary  of State\s Securities          Division   and  the  Indiana  State  Police,  and  the   Colorado          Department of Regulatory Agencies\ Division of Securities for the          assistance they  provided  in  connection  with the investigation          leading to this action."

MAMIE TANG, ET AL.,             United States District Court for the District of Northern             California, Civil Action No. CV98-3739             The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that             it has sued three Northern California residents for the             fraudulent sale of $4.2 million in high-risk stock and bonds             issued by Valley Forge Capital Holdings, Inc. (Valley             Forge), a financial services company formerly headquartered             in San Francisco.  Among those sued are Mamie Tang, of San             Francisco, who the Commission previously enjoined for an             earlier fraud and who is currently under indictment for the             prior fraud.  Also named are Deborah Mello, of Sacramento,             and Victoria Gong, of San Francisco.  The three are all             former senior officers and directors of Valley Forge.             The complaint alleges that between January 1994 and             September 1996, Tang, Mello and Gong misused at least             $838,000 (or 20%) of the $4.2 million in offering proceeds             raised by Valley Forge, using the money for purposes that             were contrary to the representations contained in the             offering materials that Valley Forge used to sell the             securities.  These improper uses included payments to Tang             and other entities controlled by her, as well as payments to             Gong and others.  After the fraud, Valley Forge was acquired             by a new owner and is no longer operating under the name             Valley Forge.             The complaint seeks an order compelling Tang, Mello and Gong             to disgorge all monies they misappropriated from Valley             Forge and pay civil monetary penalties.  The complaint also             seeks to enjoin Tang, Mello and Gong from violations of             Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b)             of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5             thereunder.  In addition, the complaint seeks to bar Tang             from serving in any capacity as an officer or director of a             publicly-held corporation.             The complaint also seeks the return from other persons and             entities of Valley Forge offering proceeds that were             diverted to them.  The persons named as relief defendants             are:  Amy and Emily Tang, Mamie Tang\s daughters; the Tang             Children\s Trust; Richard Tang, Mamie Tang\s ex-husband; and             Broad Street Securities, formerly a Michigan-based brokerage             firm controlled by Mamie Tang.             Tang\s prior injunction was entered in February 1995 by the             U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California             in connection with the fraudulent offer and sale of real             estate limited partnership units through Continental Capital             Financial Group, Inc. (Continental).  In that action the             Commissioned alleged that Tang and her partner, John Hickey,             misappropriated at least $3.5 million from investors. In             July 1997, Tang and Hickey were indicted for their conduct             in connection with the sale of the Continental securities.             The criminal case against them is pending.  For further             information see Litigation Release Nos. 14260, 14296, 14415             and 14416.                "

SCOTT             Civil Action No. : 98-S-2090   (U.S. Dist.Ct. Colo.)                  The Commission today filed an insider trading case             against Terri R. Scott, a former officer of Fischer Imaging             Corporation based in Denver, Colorado.  The Commission             alleges that, between July and September 1996, Scott engaged             in illegal insider trading in Fischer stock and avoided             losses of $23,402.                  The complaint, filed in the United States District             Court for the District of Colorado, alleges that Scott             received earnings information and projections as director of             a Fischer division and that she attended executive staff             meetings in July and August 1996 at which it was announced             that Fischer would achieve lower than anticipated earnings             for the third quarter of 1996.  As the projections of an             earnings decline became more definite, Scott sold increasing             amounts of Fischer stock.  By September 19, 1996, when             Fischer publicly announced that its third quarter 1996             earnings would be lower than analysts projections, Scott             had sold her entire position, 4,233 shares, of Fischer             common stock.  The Commission seeks to enjoin Scott from             further violations of the antifraud provisions of the             federal securities laws, as well as disgorgement of the             $23,402 in avoided losses, prejudgment interest and civil             money penalties."

(filed September          30, 1998)          SEC Files Complaint Against Former Director And His Brother For          Insider Trading Prior To 1996 Bank Merger; Settles With          Defendants For $31,074               On September 30, 1998, the Commission filed a civil          complaint in the United States District Court for the Eastern          District of Virginia alleging that James Bowman, a former          director of F&M National Corporation (F&M), traded in the          securities of Allegiance Banc Corporation (Allegiance) and          tipped his brother, Wallace Bowman, who also traded in          Allegiance, prior to the companies\ April 22, 1996 public          announcement that the companies had entered into a definitive          agreement for F&M to acquire Allegiance through a stock swap.               The Commission\s complaint alleges that in March 1996, James          Bowman, a director of F&M, purchased a total of 2000 shares of          Allegiance common stock (NASDAQ: ALLG) while in possession of          material, nonpublic information about the merger, reaping $8,125          in profits when he sold the shares shortly after the          announcement.  The complaint further alleges that in January and          March 1996, Wallace Bowman, James Bowman\s brother, bought a          total of 1000 shares of Allegiance common stock, earning $4,250          in profits when he sold the shares shortly after the          announcement.  Two days before each of Wallace Bowman\s          purchases, James Bowman attended meetings of F&M\s Board of          Directors during which the Board approved offers for Allegiance.          The Commission\s complaint alleges that Wallace and James Bowman          spoke shortly after each of these meetings, at which time James          provided material, nonpublic information to Wallace concerning          the merger in breach of James\ fiduciary duty to F&M.  James          Bowman resigned as an F&M director in July 1996, after a National          Association of Securities Dealers\ inquiry identified him as          having traded in Allegiance stock prior to the merger          announcement.               The Commission\s complaint seeks a permanent injunction          against James and Wallace Bowman for violations of the antifraud          provisions of the Securities Exchange of 1934 (Exchange Act),          disgorgement of their profits, and civil penalties pursuant to          the Insider Trading Sanctions Act, Section 21A of the Exchange          Act (ITSA).  Simultaneously with the filing of the Commission\s          complaint, James Bowman consented, without admitting or denying          the allegations of the complaint, to the entry of a final          judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Section 10(b)          of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering him          to pay $21,862, which comprises $8,125 in disgorgement of his          illicit profits, $1,362 in prejudment interest thereon, and a          $12,375 ITSA penalty (representing a penalty on his profits and          Wallace Bowman\s profits).  Also simultaneously with the filing          of the Commission\s complaint, Wallace Bowman consented, without          admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, to the          entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from          violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5          thereunder, and ordering him to pay $9,212, which comprises          $4,250 in disgorgement of his illicit profits, $712 in prejudment          interest thereon, and a $4,250 ITSA penalty."

SAVLA, Civil Action          No. 98-CV-119 84 (EFH) (D. Mass.)                   FORMER H.J. MEYERS BROKER SETTLES FRAUD CHARGES          The Commission announced that it filed a complaint today against          Rita K. Savla of Toledo, Ohio, a former broker at the Boston          office of H.J. Meyers & Co., Inc., for engaging in a free-riding          scheme which resulted in trading losses of approximately          $162,000.  Free-riding is a pattern of purchasing securities in          accounts in which there were not sufficient funds to pay for the          securities and which had no means of paying for the shares except          through the sale of the same shares.  Without admitting or          denying the allegations in the Commissions Complaint, Savla has          agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud          and credit extension provisions of the federal securities laws.          The Commission also sought disgorgement but it has been waived in          view of Savlas demonstrated financial inability to pay.  Savla          has also agreed to be barred from the securities industry.          The Complaint alleges that during June and July 1996, Savla          purchased 58,000 shares of Palomar Medical Technologies, Inc.          stock and 18,000 shares of Atmel Corporation stock in nominee          accounts at a cost of more than $1.25 million, without any          intention or ability to pay for the purchases.  Savla lied about          the nominees financial, employment and investment background,          and created the false impression that they could afford to          purchase large amounts of securities on a cash basis.  The free-          riding scheme collapsed when, after several successful free          rides, the price of the stock she purchased dropped before it          could be sold, leaving approximately $162,000 in losses.          In a related matter, the Commission instituted administrative and          cease and desist proceedings against H.J. Meyers and Tobin J.          Senefeld of Crestwood, Kentucky, the former branch manager of          H.J. Meyers Boston branch office and Savlas supervisor.  The          Commissions Order alleges that when Savla told Senefeld about          her scheme and the profits that she had made, he participated in          the free-riding scheme rather than stopping it.  The Commissions          Order alleges that Senefeld purchased an additional 30,000 shares          of stock in nominee accounts at a cost of $364,825 without any          intention or ability to pay for the purchases.  Senefelds          trading left customer accounts with approximately $49,000 in          losses.          The Commission charged H.J. Meyers with failing reasonably to          supervise Savla and Senefeld.  The Order alleges that H.J. Meyers          received indications of possible free-riding in its Boston branch          office but failed to investigate or take any action.  The          Commission also charged H.J. Meyers with failing to cancel or          liquidate on a timely basis purchases of stock in accounts used          by Savla and Senefeld for free-riding."

BING SUNG (United States          District Court for the District of Massachusetts, C.A. No. 98-cv-          11985 (WGY))               The Commission announced today that it filed an action in          Massachusetts District Court against Bing Sung, the former chief          investment officer of RhumbLine Advisers, a Boston, Massachusetts          investment adviser, charging that Sung engaged in unauthorized          trading in two of RhumbLines clients accounts, the AT&T Corp.          pension fund and the Massachusetts Pension Reserves Investment          Trust.  The Commissions Complaint alleges that, as the losses          mounted, Sung repeatedly misled AT&T about the performance of the          account in an effort to conceal losses.  In 1996, the AT&T          account sustained losses of $150 million, and the PRIT account          sustained losses of $12 million, caused, in large part, by Sungs          unauthorized trading.               AT&T and PRIT both were clients who participated in an          options trading program developed and managed by Sung.  Both          clients had written risk-limiting guidelines which prohibited          Sung from writing unhedged options (AT&T and PRIT) and in-the-          money options (AT&T), and which employed various mechanisms to          limit the number of options contracts he could write.  Beginning          in early 1995, stock market increases caused the options trading          program to sustain losses.  According to the Complaint, to make          up losses, Sung began to deviate from the clients written          guidelines by writing unhedged and in-the-money options, and by          writing drastically more options than permitted.  The Complaint          alleges that starting in November 1995, Sung, using false          information surreptitiously obtained from AT&T, applied for and          obtained exemptions from the Chicago Board Options Exchange and          the Philadelphia Stock Exchange which allowed him to trade well          in excess of the limits in the guidelines.               Between July and September of 1996, according to the          Complaint, Sung increased the magnitude and riskiness of his          trading.  The Complaint alleges that, in the AT&T account, he          wrote unhedged and in-the-money options, as well as options          against hundreds of millions of dollars of volatile stock          indices, in violation of account guidelines.  In the PRIT          account, he wrote more options than permitted.  Further, the          Complaint alleges that, during the third quarter of 1996, Sung          repeatedly misrepresented, concealed and failed to disclose these          losses to AT&T.  On several occasions, he provided false          performance reports to representatives of AT&T, which understated          losses by millions of dollars.               The Commissions Complaint alleges that Sung violated          Section 17(a)  of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of          the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder,          and that he aided and abetted violations of Sections 206(1) and          206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.               In a related matter, the Commission also announced that it          instituted and simultaneously settled an administrative          proceeding against RhumbLine and its chief executive officer,          John D. Nelson, for failing to supervise Sung.  The Commissions          Order found that Nelson and RhumbLine failed to detect and deter          Sungs unauthorized trading, despite red flags which should have          alerted them.  Further, RhumbLine had no controls or procedures          for reviewing Sungs trading or his performance reports.          RhumbLine has agreed to a censure, certain undertakings and a          penalty of $50,000.  Nelson has agreed to a suspension and a          penalty of $10,000."

According to the SEC\s complaint, Bulas, a former registered             representative,  offered  brokerage  services  to the public             through   his  unregistered  broker-dealers,  JLH  Financial             Services, Inc. and J.L. Henry & Company, Inc.  The complaint             alleges that  Bulas  obtained  funds  from  investors on the             false pretense that he would invest their monies  in stocks,             mutual   funds,   secured   promissory   notes   and   other             investments.  The SEC contends that Bulas employed a variety             of schemes and devices in order to misappropriate investors\             funds,  including  the  creation of false stock certificates             and false purchase confirmation  statements.  Based upon the             above conduct, the SEC alleges that  Bulas  violated Section             17(a)  of  the  Securities Act of 1933, Sections  10(b)  and             15(a)(1) of the Securities  Exchange  Act  of  1934 and Rule             10b-5 thereunder."
15918,1998,,"b                       U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION          Litigation Release No. 15918 / September 30, 1998          UNITED STATES OF AMERICA V. BENJAMIN BUSH, Criminal Action No. 98          CR 35 (C.D. Cal.)               On September 28, 1998, Benjamin Bush (Bush), a formerly          registered investment adviser and former president of the defunct          investment advisory firm, Ben Bush Investment Management, Inc.          (BBIM), was sentenced to 51 months in federal prison for          stealing $1.3 million from his clients and ordered to pay          restitution upon his release from prison.  The criminal action,          by the U.S. Attorney\s Office for the Central District of          California, followed an enforcement action by the Securities and          Exchange Commission which, on January 24, 1997, obtained consent          judgments against Bush and BBIM based on the same conduct          underlying the criminal action.  The consent judgments          permanently enjoined Bush and BBIM from future violations of the          antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, the          Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Investment Advisers Act          of 1940 (Advisers Act), as well as the custody and possession,          books and records and filing requirements of the Advisers Act.          The judgments further required Bush and BBIM to pay disgorgement,          prejudgment interest and civil penalties.  The Commission also          barred Bush from the securities industry and revoked BBIM\s          investment adviser registration.               The Commission\s complaint alleged that from January 1995          through September 1996, Bush, through BBIM: misappropriated at          least $450,000 from clients; sent clients account statements          falsely showing that he had purchased investments on their behalf          when he had not; commingled client and personal funds in a single          bank account which he used to pay personal expenses such as rent          and alimony, and to purchase personal items such as hockey          tickets and jewelry; used forged brokerage statements to solicit          business; and induced several clients to purchase 94 year old          Brazilian bonds of uncertain value, which Bush kept in a personal          safety deposit box at a local bank.               On September 26, 1996, the Commission obtained a temporary          restraining order which ordered Bush and BBIM to cease their          fraudulent activities and froze Bush\s assets.  This relief was          continued by a preliminary injunction entered on October 4, 1996.          On April 7, 1998, Bush plead guilty to one count of money          laundering.

HENKE AND CHAN M.          DESAIGOUDAR, United States District Court for the Northern          District of California, Civil Action No. 98-21004 JF.               The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced the          filing of a lawsuit against two former top officers of California          Micro Devices Corporation for illegal insider trading and          financial reporting fraud.  The Commission filed its complaint in          the Northern District of California on September 30, 1998,          against Chan M. Desaigoudar, a resident of Los Gatos, California          and the former chairman and chief executive officer of Cal Micro,          and against Steven J. Henke, a resident of Danville, California          and the companys former treasurer and principal financial          officer.               The Commissions complaint alleges that throughout Cal          Micros fiscal year ended June 30, 1994, Desaigoudar and Henke          artificially inflated the companys publicly reported revenue by,          among other things, directing employees to generate shipping          invoices indicating that product had been shipped to customers          when, in fact, the product had not been shipped or, in most          cases, even manufactured.  As a result, Cal Micros financial          statements, as incorporated in its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q          for at least the third fiscal quarter of 1994 and its annual          report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1994, were          materially false and misleading.               The complaint also alleges that Desaigoudar and Henke          engaged in illegal insider trading by selling Cal Micro stock in          the fourth quarter of fiscal year 1994 while knowing that the          company had falsified its books and records, circumvented its          internal accounting controls, and artificially inflated its          reported revenues.  By trading either in their brokerage accounts          or in Cal Micros  401(k) plan, Desaigoudar and Henke illegally          avoided losses of approximately $444,175 and $469,020,          respectively.               Between August 4, 1994 and January 10, 1995, Cal Micro          issued a series of press releases describing the fraud and its          impact on the companys financial results, which allegedly caused          the price of Cal Micros common shares to drop from approximately          $22 to $3.88 per share.  The company restated its results for          fiscal year 1994 on February 6, 1995, restating product revenue          from $38.3 million to $22.4 million.  On July 15, 1998, after a          five week jury trial in the Northern District of California,          Desaigoudar and Henke were convicted of criminal conspiracy,          securities fraud, filing false statements with the Commission,          and insider trading.               In its complaint, the Commission seeks disgorgement of the          losses Desaigoudar and Henke avoided by their illegal insider          trading, civil penalties for insider trading and financial          reporting fraud, and orders from the court barring Desaigoudar          and Henke from serving as an officer or director of a public          company.  The Commission also seeks orders from the court          permanently enjoining Desaigoudar and Henke from violations of          Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b),          13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act          of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2          thereunder.               The Commission has previously filed settled enforcement          actions against four former Cal Micro officers, including the          Companys former president, its former chief accounting officer,          and two former vice-presidents of production.

Named as defendants in the  complaint  are  Ellison  C.             Morgan and Peter J. Brix.  Brix was a member of the Board of             Directors of Portland General at the time of its merger with             Enron.                  According to the complaint, at a Portland General Board             meeting  on  June 18, 1996, Brix learned that, after several             months of negotiations, Portland General expected to reach a             definitive merger  agreement  with Enron within six to eight             weeks.  The complaint alleges that  following  this  meeting             Brix  disclosed  non-public  information  about  the  merger             negotiations  to  Morgan,  a close personal friend, and that             Morgan  then purchased 20,000  shares  of  Portland  General             stock on June 21 in the name of a corporation he controlled.             Morgan purchased  the  stock  at an average price of $29.684             per share, for a total cost of $593,682.76.                  The complaint further alleges  that  following the July             22,  1996  announcement  of  a  definitive merger  agreement             between Portland General and Enron,  Portland  General stock             opened  at $34.50, up $6.375 (22.7%) over its prior  closing             price.  The  complaint  alleges  that Morgan sold his 20,000             shares the day after the announcement at an average price of             $35.25,   for  total  receipts,  net  of   commissions,   of             $702,974.49.    Morgans   profits   on   the   trades  were             $109,291.73.                  In  settlement of the Commissions lawsuit, Morgan  and             Brix consented to the issuance of permanent injunctions that             will prohibit  each  man from committing fraud in connection             with the purchase or sale  of  securities,  in  violation of             Section  10(b)  of  the Securities Exchange Act of 1934  and             Rule 10b-5 thereunder.   Morgan  further  agreed to disgorge             his illegal profits of $109,291.73, plus a  civil penalty of             an equal amount and prejudgment interest of $11,224.56,  for             a  total  of  $229,808.02.   Brix also agreed to pay a civil             penalty of $109,291.73, equal to Morgans disgorgement.  The             two consented to issuance of the  permanent  injunctions and             other  relief  without admitting or denying the  allegations             contained in the Commissions complaint."
15921,1998,,"b          UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION          LITIGATION RELEASE NO. 15921 /   September 30, 1998          SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION v. Intercontinental Resources,          NA, Inc., et. al., 98-7898CM (JGx) (USDC CD Cal.)               The Commission filed a civil action today to halt efforts by          a purported conglomerate located in the Los Angeles area to          obtain funds from investors who are offered free shares of          stock and then solicited to make loans to the company.  The          company is Intercontinental Resources, NA, Inc. (IRC), which          claims to be a mining, agriculture, timber, mineral processing          and consulting company headquartered in Highland, California.          Also named as defendants are IRC\s president Thomas A.          Rebenstorf, its president of African projects John C. Rebenstorf          III, and its treasurer and acting secretary Bruce M. Rebenstorf.          John Rebenstorf was enjoined by federal courts in 1976 and 1983          for violations of the antifraud and other provisions of the          federal securities laws.               The Commission alleges that IRC and the Rebenstorfs misled          investors with a litany of wildly exaggerated, inaccurate and          incomplete statements concerning the company\s assets and          operations.  For example, the Commission asserts that IRC and the          Rebenstorfs informed investors that the Nigerian government owes          the company $26.5 million pursuant to a contract for the          construction of computerized communication equipment in Nigeria          even after the American embassy in Nigeria and the London, U.K.          police told IRC that the supposed arrangement was non-existent          and fraudulent.  According to the Commission, the defendants also          falsely represented that IRC held an interest in a refinery and          certain gold mining claims.  The complaint further alleges that          the defendants misrepresented the status of IRC\s efforts to get          listed on Nasdaq or another public market.  The Commission also          contends that IRC distributed false financial statements which          inflated assets and revenues and understated liabilities.               The Commission seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions          to prevent IRC and the Rebenstorfs from continuing to violate the          antifraud provisions of the securities laws, including Section          17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the          Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and          from obtaining funds on the basis of fraudulent information.  The          Commission also seeks civil money penalties against the          defendants."

LAUDERDALE FOREIGN CURRENCY          TRADING COMPANY THAT IT ALLEGES DEFRAUDED APPROXIMATELY $18          MILLION FROM OVER 1000 INVESTORS          Securities and Exchange Commission v. International Capital          Management, Inc., et al., Civil Action No.98-7062-CIV-          DIMITROULEAS (S. D. Florida (Complaint filed Sept. 30, 1998))               The  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that          on September 30, 1998 it filed a complaint and obtained emergency          relief in an  offering  fraud  case  involving  a  Ft. Lauderdale          company,  International Capital Management, Inc. (ICM)  that  the          SEC alleges  solicited  investors  with  claims  that  they would          profit  from its foreign currency exchange program.  Among  other          things, at  the  SEC\s  request,  in  order  to protect remaining          investor funds, the United States District Court for the Southern          District  of  Florida  ordered  a  freeze  of  ICM\s  assets  and          temporarily froze those of a company to which the  SEC claims ICM          had  transferred  assets.   The  federal  court also appointed  a          receiver  over ICM.  ICM consented to the SEC\s  proposed  relief          without admitting or denying the SEC\s allegations.               According  to  the  SEC\s complaint, defendant ICM solicited          investors from October 1997  to early September 1998 to invest in          its securities.  The SEC alleges  ICM used high pressure boiler-          room  telemarketing  sales tactics to  raise  approximately  $18          million from more than 1000 investors.  According to the SEC, ICM          told investors that it  had  consistently  achieved extraordinary          profits while promising that investors\ principal  would be safe.          ICM told investors and potential investors that they could obtain          returns  of  3%-6% per month, and sent investors monthly  account          statements  that   showed  consistent  profits.   ICM  also  told          investors that 80% of  investor  funds  would  be  held in a bank          account  and  the  remaining  20%,  which would be used in  ICM\s          foreign  currency  trading  program,  would   be  protected  from          significant losses by ICM\s purported use of a  stop-loss order          on   every  trade.   The  SEC\s  complaint  alleges  that   these          representations  were  false  -- (a) the foreign currency trading          generated a net loss for ICM investors,  (b) ICM did not keep 80%          of  investor  funds in bank accounts, and (c)  ICM  did  not  use          stop-loss orders on all trades.               The SEC\s  claim  also  named  WorldCorp Traders & Co., Inc.          (WorldCorp)  as  a  relief  defendant,  alleging   that  ICM  had          transferred at least $10 million of investor funds to WorldCorp.,          which  used  at  least  some  of those funds to trade in  foreign          currencies.               The SEC sought and obtained  a freeze on all of ICM\s assets          and on those assets of WorldCorp that  were  provided by ICM.  In          addition, ICM consented to a permanent injunction  against future          violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal  securities          laws  and consented to the appointment of a receiver.  The  court          appointed  Dan  Gelber, Esq., of the law firm of Holland & Knight          as receiver.  Among  other  things,  the Court\s order authorizes          Mr. Gelber to institute legal proceedings  for the benefit of ICM          investors.   Investors  who  wish to contact Mr.  Gelber  or  his          assistants may call Holland & Knight at (305) 374-8500."

The complaint  alleges that the defendants made a number of false          and  misleading  representations   and  omissions  regarding  the          expected return on investment, the escrowing of investors\ funds,          the use to which investors\ funds would  be put, the repayment of          investors\ funds, and the process of bringing  the  companies, in          which the investors invested, public.  The complaint also alleges          that  the  defendants  raised  over  $1.8  million  from numerous          investors in at least seven states and misappropriated  for thier          own purposes a significant amount of these investors\ funds.  The          alleged antifraud violations occurred at least from 1993  through          July 1997 in connection with the offer and sale of the securities          of  EarthNet  Companies,  Inc.,  International  Equity Resources,          Inc.,  Mississippi Motorplex, Inc., Bio-Solutions  of  Louisiana,          Inc., Blacklidge  International,  Inc., and CFC Income and Growth          Fund.  The complaint additionally alleges  that  Wade was engaged          in  the business of a securities broker and dealer  but  was  not          registered as required by federal securities law.               The  Commission  filed  this  action  in  federal  court  in          Shreveport,  Louisiana.  The Commission charged Wade and Campbell          with violating  Section  17(a)  of the Securities Act of 1933 and          Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange  Act  of  1934  and Rule          10b-5   thereunder.    The  Commission  also  charged  Wade  with          violating Section 15(a)  of the Securities Exchange Act for being          an unregistered broker and  dealer.   The  Commission  is seeking          permanent injunctions, disgorgement of all ill-gotten gains  plus          prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and sworn accountings."

SEC SUES LAWYERS AND OTHERS FOR INSIDER TRADING IN CONNECTION          WITH FT. LAUDERDALE TIME-SHARE COMPANY          Securities and Exchange Commission v. Daniel Lambert, John Pape,          James Verrillo and Gerard Verrillo, Civil Action No. 98-2280-CIV-          KING (S. D. Florida, filed Sept. 29, 1998)               The  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that          on September  29, 1998 it filed a complaint in an insider trading          case involving  the securities of Vacation Break U.S.A. (Vacation          Break), a Ft. Lauderdale company in the time-share business.  The          SECs complaint charges four individuals with having violated the          federal securities  laws  by  trading  on the basis of non-public          information,  or  having  provided  non-public   information,  in          advance of a merger with The Berkley Group, Inc. (Berkley  Group)          that  Vacation  Break  announced on November 27, 1996.  Following          news of the merger, Vacation Breaks stock, which was then traded          on the NASDAQ,  closed at  about  56%  higher  than its price the          prior  day.   The  SECs  complaint seeks more than  $400,000  in          disgorgement from the defendants  and requests civil penalties of          more than $1,200,000.               The SECs complaint alleges that  defendant  Daniel  Lambert          (Lambert),   who  is  a  29 year old attorney residing in the Ft.          Lauderdale, Florida, area,  negotiated the Vacation Break/Berkley          Group merger in the fall of 1996  on  behalf of the Berkley Group          and  other  related companies, all of which  were  controlled  by          Lamberts family.   The  SEC  further  alleges  that beginning in          October 1996, Lambert provided his friend and then  law  partner,          defendant  John  Pape  (Pape), a 30 year old Miami area attorney,          with inside information  in  advance  of the merger announcement.          The   SEC   alleges   that   Pape  used  that  information,   and          approximately $74,000 that Lambert transferred him, to accumulate          Vacation  Break stock.  After the  Vacation  Break/Berkley  Group          merger announcement, Pape sold his Vacation Break stock at profit          of approximately $110,000.               The SECs  complaint  also  alleges  that James Verrillo (J.          Verrillo), a 31 year old resident of Lighthouse  Point,  Florida,          who  did  telemarketing  work  for  both  Vacation  Break and the          Berkley  Group,  was tipped about the proposed merger before  the          announcement. The SEC further alleges that J. Verrillo tipped his          father, Gerard Verrillo  (G. Verrillo), a 47 year old resident of          Syracuse, New York who is a retired police officer.  According to          the  SECs complaint, J. Verrillo  was  a  guest  in  the  shared          Vacation  Break/Berkley  Group  suite at Pro Player stadium for a          Monday  night  football game on November  25,  1996.   The  SECs          complaint alleges  that  J.  Verrillo was tipped that night about          the  impending Vacation Break/Berkley  Group  merger.   The  next          morning, November 26, 1996, J. Verrillo purchased nearly $300,000          worth of Vacation Break stock in two brokerage accounts.  The SEC          also alleges  that  J.  Verrillo tipped his father, who purchased          another $100,000 worth of  Vacation  Break  stock for his son, J.          Verrillo, as well as $30,000 worth of the stock for himself.  The          SECs  complaint  claims  that  after  November  27,  1996,  when          Vacation Break and the Berkley Group announced their  merger,  J.          Verrillo  sold  his  Vacation  Break  stock at a profit of nearly          $276,000 and his father, G. Verrillo, sold  his stock at a profit          of about $17,000.               The SECs complaint charges Lambert, Pape,  J. Verrillo, and          G. Verrillo with having violated Section 10(b) of  the Securities          Exchange  Act  of  1934  (15  U.S.C.  \x15  78j(b))  and  Rule 10b-5          thereunder (17 C.F.R. \x15240.10b-5).  The complaint seeks permanent          injunctions  against future violations of Section 10(b) and  Rule          10b-5,  disgorgement   of   ill-gotten  gains  (with  prejudgment          interest), and civil penalties  of  up to three times the profits          for which each defendant is liable.               The SECs complaint arises out of Vacation Breaks announced          merger with the Berkley Group,  a privately  held  Ft. Lauderdale          based  company also in the time share business.  The  merger  was          eventually canceled in the spring of 1997.               The  SEC  thanks  the  National  Association  of  Securities          Dealers,  Inc. for the assistance it provided in connection  with          the investigation leading to this matter."

TALLEY, SR., Civil          Action No. 3:98-CV-2318-L, USDC, ND/TX  (Dallas Division)               On September 30, 1998, the Commission filed a civil lawsuit          charging fraud in connection with sales of $3.2 million in          investments to 200 investors nationwide for the stated purpose of          constructing and operating I Can\t Believe its Yogurt (ICBIY)          stores.  The Commission\s complaint alleges that investors were          misled about, among other things, the estimated return on their          investment and the use of their investment funds.               The complaint named as a defendant former Dallas resident          Larry C. Talley, Sr. (Talley), individually and through Hawk          Wing International Corporation (Hawk Wing) and Orchard Hills          International Inc. (Orchard Hills), neither of which is still          in business.  According to the complaint, Talley and his          companies raised approximately $3.2 million from more than 200          investors nationwide through the fraudulent offer and sale of          unregistered securities in the ICBIY store ventures.   In          connection with such sales, investors were told, among other          things, that their monies would be used to construct and operate          certain planned ICBIY stores to be located in Spain and that they          would receive eighty percent (80%) of the stores\ profits.  The          complaint further alleges that certain investors were promised a          payout in two years and that other investors were told that          they would receive an 18% return in the first year and a 25% one          thereafter. In fact, none of the promised returns were ever          achieved and Talley had no reasonable basis for making such          claims.  The complaint further alleges that Talley misapplied          investor monies by spending approximately $300,000 for personal          expenses and a substantial amount for business expenses of Hawk          Wing and Orchard Hills unrelated to the yogurt store ventures.          ICBIY was not implicated in the fraudulent activities.               In its complaint, the Commission seeks a Court order          permanently enjoining Talley from engaging in further violations          of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933          and Sections 10(b) and 15(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of          1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Commission also seeks to          have Talley  disgorge all his ill-gotten gains, with prejudgment          interest, and pay a civil monetary penalty for committing the          alleged violations.          CIVIL ACTION FILED AGAINST LARRY C. TALLEY, SR. IN SCHEME          INVOLVING OVERSEAS YOGURT STORES          On September 30, the Commission filed a civil lawsuit charging          fraud in connection with sales of $3.2 million in investments to          200 investors nationwide for the stated purpose of constructing          and operating I Can\t Believe its Yogurt (ICBIY) stores. The          complaint named as a defendant Larry C. Talley, Sr. individually          and through Hawk Wing International Corporation (Hawk Wing) and          Orchard Hills International Inc. (Orchard Hills), neither of          which is still in business..   In connection with the offer and          sale of unregistered securities in the ICBIY store ventures,          investors were told, among other things, that their monies would          be used to construct and operate certain planned ICBIY stores to          be located in Spain and that they would receive eighty percent          (80%) of the stores\ profits.  The complaint further alleges that          certain investors were promised a payout in two years and that          other investors were told that they would receive an 18% return          in the first year and a 25% one thereafter. In fact, none of the          promised returns were ever achieved and Talley had no reasonable          basis for making such claims.  The complaint further alleges that          Talley misapplied investor monies by spending approximately          $300,000 for personal expenses and a substantial amount for          business expenses of Hawk Wing and Orchard Hills unrelated to the          yogurt store ventures.  ICBIY was not implicated in the          fraudulent activities.          In its complaint, the Commission seeks to permanently enjoin          Talley from  further violations of the securities registration          and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. The          Commission also seeks to have Talley  disgorge all his ill-gotten          gains, with prejudgment interest, and pay a civil monetary          penalty for committing the alleged violations.

SANJAY SAXENA, Criminal Action No.          98cr10298-WGY (D. MA., filed September 29, 1998)                         BARRED INVESTMENT ADVISER INDICTED               The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) and          the United States Attorney for the District of Massachusetts          announced that, on September 29, 1998, Sanjay Saxena, of Cary,          North Carolina, a former registered investment adviser and          newsletter publisher, was indicted by a federal grand jury for          securities fraud and mail fraud.  The 52-count indictment charges          Saxena with failing to register securities that he publicly          offered in an investment pool, failing to invest a large portion          of investor funds, delivering false monthly account statements to          investors that stated that the invested funds were making profits          when they were actually losing money, and using a portion of          investor funds to purchase a home in North Carolina.  The          indictment also alleges that, while Saxena was being investigated          by the Commission, he agreed to repay original investors, but          concealed from the Commission the identity of 45 investors, who          he transferred into a separate investment pool, using their funds          to repay the original investors.               In a complaint filed in the United States District Court for          the District of Massachusetts on December 7, 1994 arising out of          the same conduct, the Commission alleged that Saxena violated the          antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities          laws.  On February 25, 1995, Saxena consented to the entry of a          final judgment of permanent injunction restraining him from          further violations and an order to disgorge $703,000          (representing all monies owed to investors), and to pay          prejudgment and postjudgment interest.  On February 28, 1995, the          Commission entered an order permanently barring Saxena from the          securities industry.               On September 18, 1998, the Commission filed a second civil          injunctive action against Saxena, which also included his wife,          Mumtaz Saxena, as a defendant.  The complaint alleges that the          Saxenas violated the antifraud and registration provisions of the          federal securities laws, and that Saxena violated the          Commission\s February 28, 1995 order permanently barring him from          the securities industry.  The complaint alleges that Saxena\s          role in the formation and operation of an investment adviser and          two investment companies violated the Commission\s bar order, and          that Saxena used his wife as a front to create the appearance          that he had not violated the order.  That action is pending.          [See prior Litigation Release Nos. 14348, 14419, and 15889]."

The  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced             that on Friday,  July 17,  1998,  the  Honorable  Donald  M.             Middlebrooks  of  the  United  States District Court for the             Southern District of Florida entered  an  order  temporarily             halting on-going sales of unregistered securities  by  three             Florida based boiler-rooms and a group of Florida companies.             On  July  23  and  30,  1998,  the  Court  entered orders of             preliminary  injunctions against all named defendants.   The             orders  of  preliminary  injunction  as  to  Friendly  Power             Company LLC,  Friendly  Power  Company,  Inc.,  and Friendly             Power Franchise Company (collectively Friendly Power), Scott             J.  Levine,  and  Sabrina  Levine,  were entered upon  their             consent, without admitting or denying the SECs allegations.             The remaining defendants did not oppose  the entry of orders             of preliminary injunction.                  The  Court acted on an emergency motion  and  complaint             that the SEC  filed on July 17, 1998, alleging that Friendly             Power  Company  LLC,   Friendly  Power  Company,  Inc.,  and             Friendly  Power  Franchise  Company  (collectively  Friendly             Power), a newly-formed  group  of  companies run by Scott J.             Levine and his wife, Sabrina Levine, of Plantation, Florida,             which purported to sell electricity in Californias recently             restructured electrical market, sold unregistered securities             to  the public in violation of the Securities  Act  of  1933             (Securities  Act).   The  SECs  complaint also alleges that             Friendly Power used defendants Rich  Management  Corp. (Rich             Management) of Miami, Florida, Packard Energy Corp. (Packard             Energy) of Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, and Cyber-Tech Marketing             & Consulting, Inc. (Cyber-Tech) and its President, Dwight H.             Stephens (Stephens), both of Longwood, Florida to  sell  its             securities  and  that  those  defendants  used high pressure             tactics and illegal means to make those sales.  According to             the SECs complaint, the boiler-rooms violated the antifraud             provisions   of  the  federal  securities  laws  by   making             egregious misrepresentations  to  investors regarding, among             other   things,   Friendly   Powers  risk,   profitability,             capitalization, the need to invest  quickly  and  investors             returns.                  The  SECs  complaint  also  named  Joel  Marcus,  Inc.             (Marcus)  and  Rich Holdings, Inc. (Rich Holdings) as Relief             Defendants.  The  SEC alleges that Marcus, who served as the             purported escrow agent  for the Friendly Power offering, and             Rich Holdings, which is controlled  by  the  same person who             controlled Rich Management, received investor funds that the             boiler-rooms had fraudulently raised.                  According to the SECs complaint, Friendly Power             already had raised at least $4.2 million and intended to             sell up to $70 million of unregistered securities.  The             SECs complaint also alleges that many victims of the             boiler-rooms fraud are elderly and retired, and that about             25% of the investors used their retirement savings to invest             in  defendants scheme.                  The preliminary injunctions enjoin defendants Friendly             Power, Scott J. Levine, and Sabrina Levine from violating             Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C.              77e(a) and 77e(c), and enjoin defendants Cyber-Tech,             Stephens, Packard Energy, and Rich Management from violating             Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C.             77e(a) and 77e(c), Sections 17(a)(1), 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3)             of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. 77q(a)(1), 77q(a)(2),             and 77q(a)(3), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act             of 1934 (Exchange Act), 15 U.S.C.  78j(b), and Rule 10b-5             thereunder, 17 C.F.R.   240.10b-5, and Section 15(a)(1) of             the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C.  78o(a)(1)."

The Commission\s complaint alleged that  on  July  16, 1997,             Duncan,  a  resident  of Denver, Colorado, violated Sections             10(b)  and 14(e) of the  Securities  Exchange  Act  of  1934             (Exchange Act), and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder, when             he purchased  2,500 shares of Louisiana Land and Exploration             Company (LLE) common  stock while in possession of material,             nonpublic information.   Duncan  signed a consent agreement,             and the case was settled prior to filing.                  Under the consent agreement,  Duncan, without admitting             or denying the Commission\s allegations,  disgorged  $20,875             of unlawful profits plus $1,609.60 prejudgment interest, and             paid  an  additional $20,875 penalty.  Duncan also consented             to  the  entry   of   a  permanent  injunction  from  future             violations of Section 10(b)  of  the  Exchange  Act and Rule             10b-5 thereunder, and Section 14(e) of the Exchange  Act and             Rule  14e-3  thereunder.  On  September  28, 1998, the court             approved the settlement and entered the consent injunction.                  Specifically, the Commission\s Complaint alleged:             \x07  On July 16, 1997, the boards of directors  of  Burlington                Resources  Inc. (BR) and LLE approved a deal under  which                LLE shareholders  would  tender  their common stock to BR                shareholders in exchange for BR common  stock.   Once the                shares  were  exchanged,  LLE would cease to exist as  an                independent corporation.                         \x07  Duncan misappropriated from  an  LLE  employee  material,                nonpublic information relating to the BR/LLE merger.                         \x07  On  July  16,  1997,  while in possession of this insider                information, Duncan purchased  1,000  shares of LLE stock                at a price of $58.00, and 1,500 shares  of LLE stock at a                price of $58.25.  Duncan executed these trades during the                Pacific Exchange\s after-hours trading session.                          \x07  On  July 17, 1997, after an early-morning  press  release                announced  the merger, LLE common stock opened trading at                $66.50, netting Duncan an immediate profit of $20,875.                  The Commission  thanks  the  Pacific  Exchange  for the             substantial  assistance  it provided in connection with  the             investigation leading to this action."

On September 25, 1998, the           Honorable Nancy F.

TOAL (United States          District Court for the District of Connecticut, Civ. No. B-87-          338-WWE)               The Commission announced that Judge Warren Eginton issued an          Order of Civil Contempt holding defendant John M. Toal, a          resident of Old Greenwich, Connecticut, in civil contempt of a          previously-entered permanent injunction.  The injunction enjoined          Toal from free riding, or purchasing securities with the          proceeds from the sale of those same securities, in violation of          Exchange Act Section 7(f) and Federal Reserve Board Regulations T          and X.  The Contempt Order bars Toal from trading securities          through brokerage accounts known as delivery-vs.-payment (DVP)          and receipt-vs.-payment (RVP) accounts.  In his DVP and RVP          accounts, Toal used a bank as an intermediary to settle          securities transactions rather than deal directly with brokerage          firms.  By using DVP and RVP accounts, Toal was able to trade          securities in amounts that greatly exceeded the amount of money          he had.  Toal consented to the entry of the Order of Civil          Contempt, which was entered on September 25, 1998.               The Commission\s Motion for an Order holding Toal in          contempt alleged that Toal formed a partnership to trade in          securities shortly after he was permanently enjoined, in 1987,          from free riding.  That partnership, called St. Paul Management,          regularly traded millions of dollars of securities each month.          St. Paul Management frequently sold stock through different          brokers than the ones used to purchase that stock, and used banks          as intermediaries to settle stock trades."

FIRST AMERICAN RELIANCE,          INC., et al., No. 98-CV-6423T, U.S.D.C., W.D.N.Y.                  The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission)          announced that, on October 6, 1998, the United District Court for          the Western District of New York issued a temporary restraining          order against First American Reliance, Inc. (FAR), Money          Managers, Inc. (MMI), Unified Commercial Capital, Inc. (UCC),          and American Freedom Securities, Inc. (AFS).  The Order entered          by Judge Michael A. Telesca: (1) freezes the defendants\ assets;          (2) temporarily restrains the defendants from violating the          antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws; (3) appoints          a temporary receiver for the defendants; (4) imposes a          constructive trust on life insurance policies purchased with          investor funds; and (5) imposes a stay on all actions filed          against the defendants.  The Order arises from a complaint filed          on October 6, 1998, in which the Commission alleges that the          defendants fraudulently offered and sold debentures issued by          FAR, MMI and UCC, through AFS, a registered securities broker-          dealer.  The defendants were owned or controlled by Samuel A.          Yacono (Yacono), formerly of Rochester and Williamson, New          York.  On August 24, 1998, at the age of 50 and shortly after          being served with subpoenas in the Commission\s investigation          into the defendant companies, Yacono committed suicide.               The defendants are described in the Complaint as follows:               FIRST AMERICAN RELIANCE, INC. is a New York corporation with               its principal office in Fairport, New York.  Yacono was the                president, a director and the sole shareholder of FAR.  FAR                purports to be in the business of making highly secured loans               to businesses.               MONEY MANAGERS, INC. is a New York corporation with its               principal office in Fairport, New York.  Yacono was the president,                a director and the sole shareholder of MMI.  MMI purports to be in                the business of both financial planning and making highly secured                loans to businesses.               UNIFIED COMMERCIAL CAPITAL, INC. is a New York corporation               with its principal office in Fairport, New York.  Yacono was a 25%               shareholder, a director and president and treasurer of UCC.  UCC                purports to be in the business of factoring, or financing accounts                receivables of local corporations.               AMERICAN FREEDOM SECURITIES, INC. is a New York corporation               with its principal office in Fairport, New York.  AFS is registered                with the Commission as a broker-dealer.  Yacono was a majority                shareholder, director, vice-president and a broker for AFS.               The Commission\s complaint alleges as follows:               Between 1994 and August 1998, FAR, MMI, and UCC, through               AFS, and various registered representatives associated with               AFS, all acting under Yacono\s control, sold to the               investing public at least $5 million worth of debentures.               These debentures were marketed to the public as CD               Alternatives which were just like putting money in the               bank, promising guaranteed interest rates of between 6%               and 12%, and emphasizing safety of principal.  FAR and MMI               represented that they would use money raised from investors               to finance secured loans to companies at lucrative interest               rates, generating profits to pay their investors a               relatively high return.  UCC claimed that it would engage in               the business of factoring.  These representations were               false.  Yacono diverted investor funds to himself, his other               business ventures, his friends, relatives, and business               associates.               In addition, Yacono misappropriated investor funds to pay               the premiums on two $1 million life insurance policies               issued by Prudential Life Insurance Company of America               (Prudential) and one $2 million life insurance policy               issued by the William Penn Life Insurance Company of New               York (William Penn).  The Commission named Prudential and               William Penn in its complaint as relief defendants.  The               relief sought by the Commission includes having the court               impose a constructive trust on the proceeds of these               policies.               In its Complaint, the Commission seeks from all of the               defendants an accounting and disgorgement of their unjust                enrichment plus prejudgment interest, as well as civil               penalties. The Commission also seeks preliminary and                permanent injunctive relief against the defendants from                violating Sections 17(a) of the Securities               Act of 1933 and Section10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of               1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.               The litigation is pending."

The Barr Financial Group,  Inc.  and  Alfred E. Barr,             Civil Action No. 98-1806-CIV-17-T-17E                  The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced             that on September 11, 1998, the U.S. District Court for the             Middle District of Florida issued a preliminary injunction             against The Barr Financial Group, Inc. (BFG), an SEC             registered investment adviser located in Tampa, Florida             that, the SEC alleges, claims to have over $72 million in             client funds under management.  The preliminary injunction             also applies to BFG\s CEO, Alfred E. Barr (Barr), age 40, of             Tampa, Florida.  The preliminary injunction enjoins BFG and             Barr from violating or aiding and abetting violations of             Section 204 of the Advisers Act and also specifically             ordered BFG and Barr to produce to the SEC that same day             five categories of documents that the Advisers Act and rules             promulgated thereunder require registered investment             advisers to maintain.  The Court entered the preliminary             injunction over defendants\ argument that the Advisers Act             permits registered investment advisers to keep confidential             client identifying information, even from the SEC\s             examination staff.                  The preliminary injunction followed a temporary             restraining order that the Court entered on September 3,             following the SEC\s filing of a complaint which alleged that             BFG, aided and abetted by Barr, repeatedly refused to give             the SEC records containing client identifying information,             in violation of Section 204 of the Advisers Act.  The SEC\s             complaint alleges that the defendants consistently . . .             responded to the SEC\s attempts to exercise its well-             established examination rights with obstruction, veiled             threats, and intimidation.  Additionally, the SEC\s court             papers provide evidence that BFG and Barr appear to be             financially troubled and may have made fraudulent             misrepresentations about Barr\s credentials.                  Also on September 11, the SEC filed a motion seeking to             have Barr and BFG show cause why they should not be held in             contempt for having failed to comply with the temporary             restraining order and the preliminary injunction.  In a             separate order entered on September 11, the Court ordered             that the U.S. Marshal\s Service take possession of computers             maintained at Barr\s house in order to maintain the status             quo of the information contained therein.  The SEC             subsequently alleged that Barr failed to provide all             relevant computers to the U.S. Marshal\s Service and also             failed to provide to the SEC all of the documents that BFG             possessed encompassed by the categories of documents             specified in the preliminary injunction.                  On September 24, 1998 the Court held a hearing on the             SEC\s motion to hold Barr in contempt of the preliminary             injunction order.  On September 28, 1998, the Court issued             an order finding denying the contempt motion because, at the             contempt hearing, BFG and Barr produced additional documents             to the SEC and represented to the Court that they would             fully cooperate with the SEC, including cooperating by             providing a computer that Barr had previously withheld from             the U.S. Marshal\s Service and providing access to the             information on the computer so that the SEC can verify that             BFG has provided all of the records it maintains.  In its             order denying the motion to hold the defendants in civil             contempt, however, the Court also referred the matter to the             office of the United States Attorney to investigate the             testimony Barr had given in Court.                  The SEC\s complaint charges BFG with having violated             Section 204 of the Advisers Act, 15 U.S.C. 80b-4 and charges             that Barr is liable for BFG\s violations as an aider and             abetter under Section 209(d) of the Advisers Act, 15 U.S.C.             80b-9(d)."

CITY SERVICES CORP.,         et al., 98 Civ. 1867 (RPP), U.S.D.C., S.D.N.Y.              The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission)         announced that, on October 2, 1998, the United States         District Court for the Southern District of New York entered         a Final Judgment by Default Imposing Remedies against City         Services Corp. (City Services) and Joseph Burgio         (Burgio).  The order permanently enjoins and restrains         City Services and Burgio from violating the antifraud         provisions of the securities laws, in particular Section         17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and         Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934         (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and permanently         restrains and enjoins Burgio from violating antifraud         provisions applicable to broker-dealers, in particular         Section 15(c)(1) of the Exchange Act and Rules 15c1-2 and         15c1-5 thereunder, and from violating the broker-dealer         registration provisions of Section 15(a)(1) of the Exchange         Act.  The order also requires City Services and Burgio,         jointly and severally, to disgorge $1,014,605 and $43,055 in         prejudgment interest ($1,057,660 in total) and Burgio to pay         $5,000 as a civil penalty.  The order arises from a         complaint filed on March 16, 1998, in which the Commission         alleged that City Services and Burgio fraudulently offered         and sold City Services stock and that Burgio also was acting         as an unregistered broker-dealer.              The defendants are described in the Complaint as         follows:              JOSEPH BURGIO, age 29, is a resident of Brooklyn, New              York.  He has held himself out to be the president,              corporate secretary, and chairman of City Services\              board of directors.  Between January and March 1, 1998,              Burgio was associated as a registered representative              with Three Arrows Capital Corp. (Three Arrows), a              registered broker-dealer that employed Burgio in an              office located in New York, New York. Burgio was not              separately registered with the Commission.              CITY SERVICES CORP. is a Delaware corporation.              According to a private placement memorandum for the              City Services stock offering it purports to have              offices at 29 John Street, New York City.  That              location is a mail drop only.  Since its inception in              May 1997, City Services has not generated any revenue              or engaged in any operations.  City Services stock is              not publicly traded.              The Complaint alleged as follows:              Since at least January 1998, City Services and Burgio              have fraudulently offered and sold City Services stock.              City Services, Burgio and others working with them made              telephonic cold calls, and offered and sold the City              Services stock to investors by means of a variety of              false and misleading representations, including false              claims that: (a) City Services would hold an initial              public offering in the near future that would enable              investors to more than double their money; (b) City              Services was in the check cashing business; and (c) the              funds raised in the offering would be held in escrow              until the offering closed.  While soliciting investors,              Burgio held himself out to be a registered              representative of Three Arrows.  Burgio failed to              disclose to at least some of the investors that he was              also an officer of City Services.              Burgio continued to solicit investors to purchase City              Services after his association with Three Arrows              terminated.  During the period he was associated with              Three Arrows, he solicited investors without the              authorization of Three Arrows.              Burgio and City Services failed to answer, plead or              otherwise respond to the Commission\s Complaint."

Alliance Leasing Corporation and Prime Atlantic, Inc.,          Case No. 98 CV 1810J CGA  (S.D. Cal. Oct. 6, 1998).               On October 7, 1998, the Securities and Exchange Commission          (Commission) obtained a temporary restraining order against          Alliance Leasing Corporation (Alliance), based in San Diego,          California, and Prime Atlantic, Inc. (Prime), based in          Jacksonville, Florida, in order to stop an ongoing fraud.          Specifically, the Honorable Napoleon A. Jones, Jr., United States          District Court Judge for the Southern District of California,          issued the temporary restraining order against Alliance and Prime          and also froze over $22 million in Alliance and Prime assets.               The Commission\s action, filed on October 6, 1998, alleges          that since at least December 1997, Alliance has offered and sold          units in its equipment leasing program to at least 240 investors          nationwide.  These investments are being sold through Prime,          which is not registered with the Commission as a broker or          dealer.  Investors are solicited to participate in Alliance\s          two-year leasing program for a minimum investment of $10,000.          Alliance represents in its solicitation that investor money will          be used to purchase commercial equipment (such as computers and          cellular telephones) that will then be leased to third parties          (the end-users).  The end-users\s lease payments to Alliance          purportedly constitute the source of revenue to be shared by          Alliance and the investors, who are promised a minimum of a 28-          32% return over 25 months.               The complaint further alleges that Alliance and Prime have          lied to investors about certain important facts:               \x07  Alliance and Prime told investors that, except for a 10%                  management fee paid to Alliance, all investor funds                  would be used to purchase equipment for the leasing                  program; in fact, Alliance also paid 30% to Prime as an                  undisclosed sales commission;               \x07  Alliance and Prime told at least some investors that                  their funds would be placed in an escrow account at                  Merrill Lynch and would not be released until Alliance                  purchased the equipment that would be leased; in fact, no                  escrow account exists; and                             \x07  Alliance touted its CEO and COO, Charles Browne and Susan                  Browne, respectively, as reputable businesspeople; in                  fact, both have histories of securities law violations.          The defendants are:          \x07  Alliance Leasing Corporation, a Nevada corporation, that             maintains its principal place of business in San Diego,             California.  It maintains a website at www.alleasing.com.             Alliance is charged with violations of the securities             registration and antifraud provisions.                    \x07  Prime Atlantic, Inc., a Florida corporation, that maintains             its principal place of business in Jacksonville, Florida.             Prime is charged with violations of the securities             registration, broker-dealer registration and antifraud             provisions.               The Court has set a hearing for October 15, 1998 at 1:30          p.m. on the Commission\s request for a preliminary injunction.          The Commission\s complaint alleges that Alliance and Prime          violated the securities registration provisions (Sections 5(a)          and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act)) and          the antifraud provisions (Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and          Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange          Act), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder), and additionally that Prime          violated the broker-dealer registration provisions (Section          15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act).               The Commission wishes to thank the Mississippi Secretary of          State, Business Services Division, for its valuable assistance in          this matter."

Sargents and Scharns convictions stem from false statements the          two men made in telephone interviews with a Commission staff          attorney during the inquiry into trading in Purolator stock prior          to a public announcement that Mark IV Industries, Inc. would make          a tender offer for all Purolator shares.

The Orders, entered on October 2, 1998 by the United  States District Court for the Northern District of  Illinois, permanently enjoin TAN and Nelson from future  violations of the registration and antifraud provisions  of the federal securities laws and impose a $15,000 civil  penalty against Nelson. TAN and Nelson consented to the  entry of the Orders without admitting or denying the  allegations made in the Commissions Complaint, which was  filed on September 22, 1998. The Orders enjoin TAN and  Nelson from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of  the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the  Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5  thereunder.    In its Complaint, the Commission alleged that, from 1993  through 1996, TAN raised more than $10 million by selling  unregistered promissory notes to more than 1000 investors  nationwide through the TAN Loan Program. The Commission  alleged that Nelson and TAN misrepresented the safety and  liquidity of an investment in the Loan Program, as well  as the use of Loan Program proceeds, in offering  materials sent to Loan Program investors. In particular,  TAN and Nelson claimed that TAN could repay an investment  in the Loan Program on short notice when, in fact, it  could not do so at all and that the value of TANs  inventory exceeded what it owed to Loan Program  participants when, in fact, the value of the inventory  was only a fraction of what was owed under the Loan  Program. The Commission also alleged that TAN and Nelson  told Loan Program participants that a portion of the loan  proceeds would be used by TAN to purchase a new  headquarters building when those proceeds actually were  given to Nelson himself to buy the building and rent the  building to TAN. TAN, headquartered in Rockford,  Illinois, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in December  1996 and now operates under a plan of reorganization."

Nite was also ordered to pay $3,678,500 in disgorgement plus prejudgment interest thereon and $100,000 in civil penalties. Nite is currently incarcerated in Missoula, Montana, where he is awaiting trial for conspiracy to commit fraud, wire fraud, bank fraud and interstate transportation of stolen property, charges unrelated to the Commission\s action.  Judgments against the other two defendants, Philip L. Thomas and David V. Sims, were entered on March 2, 1998.  Thomas and Sims, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission\s complaint, consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.     The Commission\s complaint, filed in federal district court, alleged that Nite, Thomas and Sims conducted a multi- million dollar fraudulent investment scheme involving the fictional trading of securities purportedly issued by major international banks.  The complaint alleged that from July 1994 through October 1994, the defendants, Nite, age 47, Thomas, age 43 and Sims, age 47, offered and sold to the public interests in a phony program to trade these purported securities, amassing approximately $3.7 million.  For their investment, the victims were promised astronomical returns on relatively small investments.  Specifically, the complaint alleges that the defendants guaranteed the victims that for an initial investment of either $50,000 or $150,000, they would receive returns of $1 million per week for 40 weeks, or $40 million. Contrary to their promises, the defendants did not invest the victims\ funds, but instead misappropriated the funds for their own personal benefit, including donations to religious organizations, purchases of luxury automobiles and gifts to family members."

On October 2, 1998, Matthew Peter Bowin (Bowin) was convicted of 54 felony counts, including fraudulently obtaining money in connection with the sale of securities.  Bowin was convicted after a three-week criminal jury trial in Santa Cruz County, California, prosecuted by the District Attorney for Santa Cruz County.  Bowin, the chairman, president, and chief executive officer of Interactive Products and Services (IPS), was charged with conducting a fraudulent initial public offering over the Internet between November 1996 and July 1997.  Sentencing is currently scheduled for October 30, 1998 before the Honorable Thomas Kelly.     The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) previously filed a civil complaint against Bowin and IPS on April 8, 1998, charging violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The Commission\s action is currently pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, Case No. C-98-20313 (PVT).     The IPS stock offering was one of the first public offerings conducted entirely over the Internet.  Bowin raised approximately $190,000 from about 150 investors nationwide.  The Commission\s complaint alleges that Bowin made numerous misrepresentations to investors and misappropriated investors\ funds for personal use.

Richard Warren & Associates, Inc., et. al., Civil Action No. C-97-3050MMC (USDC ND CA/San Francisco Div.)      The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California granted  permanent injunctions against Richard Warren & Associates, Inc. (RWA), and Richard E. Warren (Warren) on October 13, 1998. The Court\s order enjoins them from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b - 5 thereunder. The order also requires RWA and  Warren, jointly and severally, to disgorge $7.2 million plus interest and requires relief defendant Citadel Enterprises Ltd. (Citadel), an Isle of Man entity, to disgorge $2.05 million plus interest.      The Commission\s August 1997 complaint charged that RWA and Warren raised approximately $8 million from investors nationwide through two fraudulent offerings of securities. RWA and Warren misrepresented, among other things, the existence of prime bank debenture instruments, the use of investor proceeds, the rates of return, and the risks associated with the investment. Citadel received investor proceeds fraudulently obtained by RWA and Warren and held them in London bank accounts.      On August 19 and 28, 1997, respectively, the Court entered a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction against RWA and Warren. On August 26, 1997  the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice of England and Wales granted the Commission\s petition for a mareva injunction against RWA and Warren. That  injunction froze the assets held world-wide by RWA and Warren and required them to disclose all such assets to the High Court.

On severaldays, the percentage of call options purchased by the defendantsaccounted for the entire volume of the calls in that seriesbought on those days.  The total amount invested in options andstock by the defendants was approximately $8 million. TheCommission has not yet identified all the defendants because manyof the trades were made anonymously through accounts at U.S.brokerage firms in the names of banks located in The Netherlands,Switzerland and Luxembourg.

15944,1998,,"b                   UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION             LITIGATION RELEASE NO.  15944  / October 23, 1998             SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION v. UNIQUE FINANCIAL             CONCEPTS, INC., ET AL.,  Civil Action No. 98-7147 (S.D.             Fla.)                  The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that,             on October 22, 1998, the Honorable Shelby Highsmith,             District Judge, United States District Court for the             Southern District of Florida, entered a Temporary             Restraining Order (TRO) against Unique Financial Concepts,             Inc. (Unique), of Boca Raton, Florida; Frederick N.             Hollander, Unique\s founder and sales manager, who lives in             Parkland, Florida; Ernest J. Patti, another founder, as well             as president and owner, a resident of  Fort Lauderdale,             Florida; and Nicholas D. DeAngelis, Unique\s primary             salesperson, who lives in Lake Worth, Florida.  The             defendants were charged with fraudulently offering             unregistered securities, namely interests in a purported             trading program involving options on foreign currency.  The             TRO also freezes the defendants\ assets and grants other             emergency relief, including an order requiring them to             repatriate assets located outside of the United States.  A             preliminary injunction hearing is scheduled for October 30,             1998.                  The Commission\s complaint, filed the same day, alleges             that, from October 1997 through the present, the defendants             have engaged in a scheme to defraud investors by making             material misrepresentations and omissions in connection with             the sale of interests in a purported trading program             involving options on foreign currency through a foreign             currency market known as Forex, and misappropriating             investor funds.  Through high-pressure sales tactics and             aggressive nationwide advertising in major newspapers and on             cable television outlets such as CNBC,  the defendants have             raised at least $6,575,714 from hundreds of investors             nationwide.  The complaint alleges that Unique has failed to             produce evidence of any actual trading, and that the             defendants have misappropriated at least 60 percent of funds             invested.                  The complaint alleges that the defendants advertised             returns as high as 1,000 percent, and represented to             investors that their funds would be sent to an account in             the Bahamas from which trading would occur.  In fact, of the             approximately $6.5 million raised, less than $2.5 million,             or 38 percent, was actually sent to the Bahamas.  The             defendants used at least $3.3 million of investor funds on             personal and business expenses, including advertising,             luxury car rentals, purported commissions, loans to             principals and salaries.  In addition, Unique used $644,704             of new investor funds to pay its obligations to existing             investors, the hallmark of a Ponzi scheme.                  The TRO temporarily enjoins the defendants from             violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the             Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b)             of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5             thereunder, as well as the registration provisions of             Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act.  The             Commission is also seeking  preliminary and permanent             injunctions against the defendants, disgorgement,             prejudgment interest and civil penalties.                  The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the             Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Office of             Comptroller, Department of Banking and Finance, of the State             of Florida in this action."

Wallace from further fraud and          registration violations under the federal securities laws.  The          Court found that Wallace, in conjunction with other promoters,          solicited investors to invest in certain bank instrument          trading programs offered by Kenton Capital, Ltd., falsely          projecting to investors annual returns on these trading programs          ranging from 34,200% to over 1,200,000%.               The Court\s order requires Wallace to pay a civil monetary          penalty of $1.2 million.   The Court also requires Kenton and          Wallace to disgorge, jointly and severally with all other          defendants, $1,745,000, all but $264,245.10 of which previously          has been paid.  On October 13, 1998, the Court also ordered          Kenton and Wallace to pay $86,665.83  in prejudgment interest.               Pursuant to the Court\s order, Kenton and Wallace are          permanently enjoined from future violations of Sections 5(a),          5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and          15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5          thereunder, and Section 203(a) of the Investment Advisers Act of          1940.

MARK MAY, CRAIG A. HERL,          USA FINANCIAL NETWORK, INC., S-CORP FINANCIAL, INC., BANCORP          MORTGAGE, INC., BILTMORE DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION, and NETWORK          FINANCE CORP., Defendants, and CYNTHIA R. MAY AND USA TRUST,          Relief Defendants, United States District Court for the Southern          District of Ohio, Civil Action No. c-3-98-468 (WHR).               The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that it          obtained a temporary restraining order (Order) against Mark May          (May), Craig A. Herl (Herl), USA Financial Network, Inc. (USA          Financial), S-Corp Financial, Inc. (S-Corp), Bancorp Mortgage,          Inc. (Bancorp), Biltmore Development Corporation (Biltmore), and          Network Finance Corp. (Network Finance).  The order enjoins these          persons and entities from violations of Section 17(a) of the          Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Section 10(b) of the          Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5          thereunder.  The order also enjoins USA Financial from violations          of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of          1940 (Advisers Act) and May and Herl from aiding and abetting          such violations.               The Complaint alleges that from December 1994 to the          present, May and Herl used two investment advisory businesses to          offer and sell approximately $3.6 million in unsecured promissory          notes to approximately 33 advisory clents.  The promissory notes          were issued by corporations May and Herl controlled and operated          and had little or no net worth.  According to the Complaint, May          and Herl recommended that the clients, many of whom earned modest          incomes, had low net worths, and had conservative investment          objectives, use money from their home equity loans or their self-          directed IRAs to purchase the promissory notes.  The Complaint          also alleges that May and Herl told the investors that their          money would be used to fund the issuing corporations business          when, in fact, May and Herl routinely used investor funds to          cover cash flow shortages in affiliated corporations, to make          interest payments to prior promissory note investors, and to          divert approximately $500,000 to themselves and to Mays wife,          Cynthia May.               The Order also freezes the assets of defendants May, Herl,          S-Corp and Network Finance and the assets of relief defendants          Cynthia May and USA Trust, freezes $50,000 in USA Financials          bank account, prohibits USA Financial, Bancorp and Biltmore from          transferring assets to May, Herl, S-Corp, Network Finance,          Cynthia May or USA Trust, a relief defendant, prohibits the          defendants and relief defendants from destroying any documents,          requires the defendants and relief defendants to produce any          books and records relating to the offer and sale of promissory          notes and any of their businesses, and requires the defendants          and relief defendants to provide an accounting of all funds          received from investors."

GOLDMAN LENDER & CO.             HOLDINGS, BLACKWELL CO., TRADERZ ASSOCIATES HOLDING INC.,             SHARON HAROSH and AMERICO ROBERT GALLO, 98 Civ. 7525             (S.D.N.Y.)(JGK)             NEW YORK-- The Securities and Exchange Commission filed an              action in federal court in Manhattan on October 23, 1998,              alleging that two individuals and three entities              fraudulently raised over $210,000 through a scheme involving              phony private placements of securities.  According to the              Commission\s Complaint, the defendants told investors that              they could purchase securities in the private placements of              three entities and in a few months the companies would go              public and the investors would double or triple their money.               The defendants also falsely told investors that investing in              the private placements involved low risk because the investors\             money would be kept in an escrow account at a law firm.   In             fact, there was no escrow account and the two principals of             the three entities misappropriated a significant portion of             the investors\ money.             Named in the Complaint were:             Americo Robert Gallo, age 32, the President of Traderz             Associates Holding Inc. (Traderz Associates), and a             resident of Brooklyn, New York;             Sharon Harosh, age 25, the President and Secretary of             Goldman Lender & Co. Holdings (Goldman Lender) and the             sole proprietor of Blackwell Co.  Harosh resides in             Brooklyn, New York;             Traderz Associates,  a Delaware corporation whose principal             place of business was in New York City;             Goldman Lender, a Delaware corporation whose principal place             of business also was in New York City; and             Blackwell, a sole proprietorship owned by Sharon Harosh.             Blackwell\s principal place of business was in New York             City.                  The Commission\s Complaint alleges that Gallo             telephoned investors and solicited them to purchase the             securities of Traderz Associates in a private placement.             The Complaint alleges that in those phone calls, Gallo made             misrepresentations to investors concerning, among other             things, the risk of investing in Traderz Associates             securities, the potential profit investors could expect to             make by purchasing Traderz Associates securities and the use             of investors\ funds by Traderz Associates.  In fact, Gallo             has misappropriated a significant portion of the offering             proceeds and has given other large sums to colleagues.                  The Commission\s Complaint also alleges that Harosh             used several fictitious names, or instructed his agents to             use fictitious names, in soliciting investors to purchase             the securities of Goldman Lender and Blackwell.  Harosh, or             his unknown agents, made misrepresentations to investors             concerning, among other things, the risk of investing in the             securities of Goldman Lender and Blackwell, the potential             profit investors could expect to make by purchasing the             securities of Goldman Lender and Blackwell, the use of             investors funds by Goldman Lender and Blackwell and the             existence of Blackwell securities.  Harosh ultimately             received all of the money that investors sent to Goldman             Lender and Blackwell and deposited those funds into various             bank accounts in the names of those entities.  Shortly after             depositing the investors\ funds, Harosh wired a significant             part of the funds to offshore bank accounts and also             withdrew in cash a significant part of the remaining             proceeds.                  The investors in each of the three offerings have not             received any securities nor any confirmation of their             supposed purchases.  The investors have never been refunded             their money.                  In addition to the above-described violations, in July             1998, several of the investors who had purchased Goldman             Lender\s securities were again solicited to purchase shares             in Ramtron International Corp. (Ramtron), a Delaware             corporation that designs, manufactures and sells             semiconductor memory chips.  Ramtron\s stock price is quoted             on the NASDAQ National Market System.  Investors were told             that they could purchase shares of Ramtron at approximately             $2 per share and sell them later that same day through             Goldman Lender at approximately double the price.  At least             two investors agreed to buy Ramtron stock and sent at least             $37,500 to Goldman Lender.  These investors never received             any Ramtron shares nor did they receive confirmation that             they had purchased or sold shares of Ramtron stock.  None of             these investors in Ramtron ever received back any of the             funds that they sent to Goldman Lender.                  In its Complaint, the Commission alleges that the             defendants violated the antifraud provisions of the federal             securities laws -- Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of             1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of             1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Commission is seeking             an asset freeze, an accounting of investors\ money and a             temporary restraining order against all five defendants.             The Commission also seeks permanent injunctions against             future violations of the antifraud provisions, disgorgement             of defendants\ ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest,             and civil penalties."

DARIN SPENCER RUEBEL,          United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas,          Civil Action No. 3-98CV2536D (N.D. Tx.)          The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) today          announced the filing of a complaint in the U.S. District Court          for the Northern District of Texas seeking a permanent injunction          and civil penalty against Darin Spencer Ruebel (Ruebel) for          violations of the anti-touting provision of the Securities Act of          1933.  Ruebel authored and published several investment          newsletters, including an investment newsletter named The Equity          Journal which was published on the Internet.          The complaint alleges that Ruebel violated Section 17(b) of the          Securities Act of 1933 by publishing and circulating at least          three newsletters touting the stock of an issuer without          disclosing that he anticipated and received compensation from          this issuer.  Beginning in or around July 1997, Ruebel was          negotiating with this issuer to provide consulting services for          eighteen months in exchange for compensation of $2,500 per month.          One element of the services to be provided by Ruebel was to          heighten public awareness of the existence and merits of this          issuer.          The complaint further alleges that after Ruebel began negotiating          with this issuer, he touted the stock of this issuer in an          untitled newsletter without any disclosure that he anticipated          receiving compensation from this issuer. After Ruebel entered          into a written agreement with this issuer and this issuer began          compensating Ruebel on a monthly basis, Ruebel touted the stock          of this issuer in two separate issues of The Equity Journal          without disclosing that he had received compensation and          anticipated additional compensation from this issuer.  The Equity          Journal contained only a general disclaimer that The Equity          Journal and/or its affiliates may receive compensation from          some of the profiled companies.          Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint,          Ruebel consented to the entry of a permanent injunction          prohibiting him from committing violations of Section 17(b) of          the Securities Act of 1933.  He also agreed to pay a civil          penalty of $5,000."

(Brommer)                  (collectively, the defendants).  Carlisle and Sitra run                  self-described investor relations services  from  their                  homes.   Brommer  is  an  investment adviser registered                  with   the  Commission.

In particular, the Complaint alleges the following:             -  Carlisle,  Sitra, Sitra Enterprises,  JAFLC  and  Brommer                each  had  an  agreement  with  Great  White  Marine  and                Recreation,  Inc.  (Great  White  or  the company), a                company whose stock is quoted on the OTC  Bulletin  Board                Service,   to  provide  investor  relations  and  other                promotional   services.   Under  these  agreements,  each                defendant published  and circulated favorable promotional                information about Great White in exchange for Great White                stock and/or money.                          -  From approximately February  1998 through September 1998,                all three defendants prepared  reports  and news releases                that  spoke  glowingly  about Great White and  encouraged                investors  to  purchase  the   company\s  stock,  without                disclosing  their  compensation  arrangement  with  Great                White.                          -  The defendants published this information on the Internet                and in newsletters and circulated  it  in  glossy folders                sent  to  investors  who  responded to telephone  numbers                listed   on  the  company\s  Internet   website   or   in                promotional materials.                          -  All three  defendants  also  took advantage of the market                interest  their promotional efforts  created  by  selling                Great White  stock  into  the  market  contrary  to their                recommendations  to  buy the same stock.  This fraudulent                practice  is  known  as scalping.   Carlisle,  Sitra  and                Brommer received stock  proceeds  totaling  approximately                $573,896, $66,416 and $42,650, respectively.                          -  Carlisle  shared her proceeds with Great White  and  also                deposited shares in Canadian brokerage accounts.                           -  Each defendant  failed to disclose their receipt of stock                from Great White  and  their  intention to sell the stock                contrary  to  their  buy recommendations/favorable  press                releases.

The  Complaint  also  charges             Brommer with  antifraud  violations found in Sections 206(1)             and 206(2) of the Investment  Advisers  Act  of  1940, based             upon  these  same  activities.  Finally, the Complaint  also             charges  that  each  defendant   violated  the  anti-touting             provisions contained in Section 17(b) of the Securities Act.             The  Complaint  seeks  a permanent injunction  against  each             defendant, as well as an  accounting, disgorgement and civil             penalties."

LITIGATION RELEASE NO.   15950 /October 27, 1998             SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION v. STARWOOD MEDIA GROUP,             INC., and JACK MARKS a/k/a JACOB MESTECHKIN, 98 Civ. 7659             (RO) (S.D.N.Y.)                  The Commission sued a New York public-relations firm             and its owner for disseminating information about stocks on             their website, Stock-Line.com, without fully and accurately             disclosing that the featured companies had paid for the             touts.  Jack Marks, formerly named Jacob Mestechkin, heads             Starwood Media Group, a small firm in lower Manhattan.             Starwood also publishes a monthly print version of the             internet site, Wall Street Reporter, which is distributed             free of charge.  The Commission\s complaint  alleges that             Starwood\s publications do not accurately describes the             compensation arrangements with featured companies, as             follows.  At least three of the featured companies have paid             consideration to Starwood Media, in cash, stock, or options,             exceeding $10,000 in value.   The three companies are a             start-up motorcycle manufacturer, American Quantum Cycles,             Inc.; a golf-course developer, Golf Ventures, Inc.; and a             technology personnel firm, Infocall Communications Corp.             The stocks of all three companies trade on the Over-the-             Counter bulletin board.                  Stock-Line\s disclosure, buried in a mislabeled             linkage, understates the amount of compensation received for             the touts, and fails to disclose Starwood\s receipt of             potentially valuable options.  The disclosure in the Wall             Street Reporter is also misleading in stating the featured             companies either have purchased or may purchase investor             relations services, when all companies have paid to appear             in the journal.  According to the Commission\s complaint,             Marks was on notice of the disclosure requirements, and             persisted in his unlawful conduct even after consulting an             attorney on the legal basis for a competitor\s disclosure of             specific amounts of stocks and options from featured             companies.  The Commission is seeking permanent injunctive             relief and penalties based on the alleged violations of             Section 17(b) of the Securities Act.                  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the             Complaint, defendants Marks and Starwood have consented to             the entry of an order permanently enjoining them from             violations of Section 17(b) and requiring them to pay a             civil penalty of $15,000."
15951,1998,,"b         SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION v. GEORGE SCHLIEBEN,         Civil Action No. 98CV-5689 (E.D. Pa.)         LITIGATION RELEASE NO. 15951 / October 27, 1998             The Securities and Exchange Commission announced         that, on October 27, 1998, it filed a complaint in the         United States District Court for the Eastern District         of Pennsylvania against George Schlieben, of Yardley,         Pennsylvania.  The complaint alleges that Schlieben,         the sole editor and publisher of an online newsletter         called Global Penny Stocks (GPS), failed to disclose         the amount of compensation he received from issuers,         either directly or indirectly, for recommending their         stocks, in violation of Section 17(b) of the Securities         Act of 1933 (Securities Act), the anti-touting         provision.  Based on these violations, the Commission         seeks a permanent injunction and civil penalties         against Schlieben.             The complaint alleges that since approximately         September 1996, Schlieben has posted at least 29         editions of the GPS newsletter, each containing a self-         described Special Research Report (Report).  Each         of these Reports, which are nothing more than paid         advertisements, are available for free on Schlieben\s         website located at www.pennystock.com.  In each of the         Reports, Schlieben writes favorably about a particular         penny stock company and recommends the purchase of the         stock.  As compensation for these favorable reports and         recommendations, Schlieben is paid a fee directly from         the issuer or from an investment relations company         acting on behalf of the issuer.  In each of the         Reports, Schlieben discloses in small type that he         receives a fee from the issuer or investor relations         firm to write the Report.  However, although Schlieben         charges from  $2,250 to $5,150 for each Report, and has         received to date total compensation of approximately         $105,500, he failed to disclose in his newsletters the         amount of compensation paid to him by or on behalf of         the issuers whose stock he recommended, as required by         Section 17(b) of the Securities Act."

SWITZER, INTERNATIONAL ALLIANCE TRADING, INC., and SUN             PACIFIC CAPITAL GROUP, INC., Civil Action No. 98-             8698JFL(MCX)(West. Div.)(C.D. Cal. October 27, 1998).                         SEC SUES PROMOTERS WHO TOUTED STOCK                   ON THE INTERNET AND IN NEWSPAPER ADVERTISEMENTS                   In a case that illustrates the migration of illegally             conducted stock touting from traditional print media to the             internet, the Securities and Exchange Commission today             announced that it had filed a civil injunctive action             against four southern California defendants involved in             promoting the stock of microcap issuers.  The complaint             alleges that the defendants -- Brian M. Volmer, John R.             Switzer, International Alliance Trading, Inc.             (International Alliance), and Sun Pacific Capital Group,             Inc. (Sun Pacific) -- accepted stock and cash payments             from the issuers in exchange for favorable and purportedly             independent reviews published in three newspaper             advertisements and, later, on the internet website             Investors Edge.                  The Commission\s complaint, filed in the United States             District Court for the Central District of California,             alleges that Volmer, through his company, International             Alliance, wrote and placed a newspaper advertisement touting             the stock of Cetacean Industries, Inc., a company that             claimed to be engaged in diamond exploration and mining in             Brazil.  Crafted to appear as an independent research             report, the advertisement appeared in Investor\s Business             Daily on October 17, 20 and 24, 1997.  The complaint alleges             that the advertisement failed to disclose that International             Alliance had received options to buy Cetacean shares in             exchange for promoting its stock, in violation of  Section             17(b) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act).             That provision of the Securities Act requires that anyone             giving publicity to a security in return for compensation             from an issuer or underwriter must disclose the receipt and             amount of that compensation.                  In addition, the complaint alleges that, in two             versions of the advertisement, Volmer and International             Alliance knowingly or recklessly misrepresented that             Cetacean\s stock had been the subject of a buy             recommendation issued by a prominent, New York-based             investment management firm, when, in fact, that firm had             neither issued a buy recommendation for Cetacean nor             authorized the use of its name in the advertisement.  The             complaint also alleges that Volmer and International             Alliance knowingly or recklessly misrepresented that the             issuer had acquired the mineral and mining rights to a             certain Brazilian property, which was described as             containing a minimum of two million carats and yielding             minimum revenues of $40 million.  The complaint further             alleges that, acting contrary to their simultaneous buy             recommendation to public investors, Volmer and International             Alliance sold the shares they had received as compensation             from Cetacean, profiting in excess of $64,000.  As a result,             the complaint alleges that Volmer and International Alliance             violated the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities             laws, specifically Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, and             Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and             Rule 10b-5 thereunder.                  The Commission\s complaint also alleges that Volmer,             Switzer and Sun Pacific violated Section 17(b) of the             Securities Act in connection with an on-line research report             posted on Investors Edge, an internet website that Volmer             and his company, Sun Pacific, began operating this year.             Prepared by Volmer and Switzer, Investors Edge has posted             purported research reports touting the stocks of several             microcap issuers, including Juina Mining Corporation, whose             principal assets are the Brazilian diamond operations             previously owned by Cetacean.  The complaint further alleges             that the Juina Mining report, which first was posted in or             about July of this year, failed adequately to disclose the             full extent of the compensation that the defendants had             received, directly and indirectly, from the issuer in             exchange for touting its stock.                  In its complaint, the Commission seeks an injunction             against the defendants to prevent further violations of the             federal securities laws, disgorgement of undisclosed             compensation, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.

Liberty Capital Group,             Inc. and Jason A. Greig, Civil Action No. C98-1515C (USDC             WA).                  On  October 27, 1998, the Securities and Exchange             Commission filed a complaint in the United States District             Court for the District of Washington against a Bellingham,             Washington publicist for distributing over the Internet and             through other means, information regarding certain microcap             companies without disclosing compensation received from             those companies.  The Commission\s complaint names Liberty             Capital Group, Inc. (Liberty) and Jason A. Greg (Greig),             the sole officer, director and shareholder of Liberty, as             defendants and alleges that Liberty and Greig violated             Section 17(b) of the Securities Act of 1933.                  The complaint alleges that from April 1996 until April             1998, Greig, through Liberty, published Jay Greig\s Liberty             Letter in which he provided general information on             approximately twenty companies quoted on the Nasdaq Smallcap             market, the Nasdaq Bulletin Board, and also traded on the             Canadian Exchanges.  During 1997, Greig developed a website             for Liberty and began publicizing on the website, as well as             through e-mails and postings on the Internet bulletin             boards, three of the companies featured in the newsletter,             as well as six other companies.  The complaint alleges that             Liberty, through Greig, entered into written or oral             agreements with several of the companies publicized on             Liberty\s website or in the newsletter, requiring the             companies to pay varying amounts of cash and/or securities             for these services.  The complaint alleges that Liberty and             Greig received cash and stock, both directly and indirectly             from at least seven of the companies, totaling nearly $1.2             million.                  The complaint alleges that although the newsletter             disclosed that Liberty received compensation from issuers             for publicizing their stocks, it failed to disclose the             existence of the agreements between Liberty and certain of             the publicized companies, or the various amounts of             compensation.  The complaint also alleges that until very             recently, Liberty only made a vague, general disclosure on             its website about the receipt of compensation, and also             failed to disclose the existence of the agreements and any             specifics on past or agreed upon compensation."

(Princeton)  with          having  violated  the  federal securities laws in connection with          their  touting  of  the  stocks  of  seven  different  companies.          Simultaneous  with  the  filing  of  the  complaint,  Savage  and          Princeton  consented, without  admitting  or  denying  the  SECs          allegations,  to the entry of a permanent injunction and to pay a          civil penalty of $40,000.               The SECs  complaint alleges that Savage, who is Princetons          president, received  compensation  in  the form of stock or stock          options  from  five  companies  in  exchange  for  touting  those          companies or their securities.  The SECs  complaint also alleges          that in violation of Section 17(b) of the Securities  Act of 1933          (Securities  Act),  Savage and Princeton failed to disclose  that          receipt of compensation  in  the newsletters and daily reports in          which Savage and Princeton  touted  those  stocks  and which they          disseminated through the mail, by fax, and over the Internet.               In  addition,  the  SECs complaint alleges that Savage  and          Princeton made material misrepresentations  concerning the stocks          of two other companies.  According to the SECs  complaint, while          Savage  owned shares of those two companies stocks,  Savage  and          Princeton made baseless predictions about the likely future price          of those  stocks  and  also  made  misrepresentations  about  the          financial condition of one of the companies.               Savage  and Princeton consented to the relief the SEC sought          in  its  complaint,   without  admitting  or  denying  the  SECs          allegations.  Specifically,  Savage  and Princeton consented to a          permanent injunction against future violations  of Sections 17(a)          and  17(b)  of  the  Securities  Act  and  Section 10(b)  of  the          Securities  Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The Commission filed suit in federal court in New York             yesterday against  the host of a radio infomercial show, Ed             Taxin.  Taxin also publishes an investment newsletter on his             website, Taxin.com.  Taxin\s show, The Financial Hour,             airs on six stations across the country, including New York,             and is broadcast from Taxin\s Shrewsbury, New Jersey             residence.   The Commission charged Taxin and the Taxin             Network with promoting stocks on the Financial Hour and his             newsletter, Investors Chronicle, without disclosing that he             is compensated for the touts, as follows.  The Taxin Network             (owned by Taxin\s wife, Joanne Pagano) has agreements with             numerous small-cap companies, including Envoy Communications             Group, Inc., PTC Group, Inc., Sungold Gaming International             Inc., Telepad Corp., VentureTech, Inc., and Wolf Industries,             Inc.  These companies or their agents have paid the Taxin             Network at least $200,000 in cash or stock for promotional             services, including exposure on the Financial Hour and in             the Investors Chronicle.  On the Financial Hour, Taxin             introduces a series of guests, including promoters from             investor-relations firms and officers of the companies.             Taxin joins with his guests in their rosy predictions for             the companies they represent, mixing in Wall Street patter             to convey the impression of objective financial reporting.             Taxin introduces the promoters as Wall Street notables and             stock-pickers, disguising their relationship with the             companies they represent.                  The compensation received by the Taxin Network is not             adequately disclosed on the radio show or in the newsletter.             The only disclosure on the radio show is generally that the             guests (or some of the guests) have paid a fee to appear on             the show or that Taxin owns shares in some of the companies             discussed.

LITIGATION RELEASE NO.  15956 / October 27, 1998             SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION v. STOCKSTOWATCH.COM             INC., ET AL., Civil Action No. 98-2198-CIV  T-26B (M.D. Fl.             Tampa Division)             SEC CHARGES INTERNET STOCK TOUTER WITH SECURITIES FRAUD                   The  Securities  and Exchange Commission (Commission)             announced  today  that it filed a Complaint  in  the  United             States   District   Court   in   Tampa,   Florida,   against             Stockstowatch.com Inc. (STW), and its president, Steven A.             King (King).  STW is  an  Internet  stock  touting service             operated from King\s home in Sarasota Florida, which claimed             at   one  time  to  have  over  200,000  subscribers.    The             Commission\s  Complaint  charges STW and King with violating             the  antitouting and antifraud  provisions  of  the  federal             securities  laws by touting and scalping the securities of             five  microcap  companies.   Scalping  is  the  practice  of             recommending  the  purchase  of  a  security  to the general             public while selling the stock at the same time.                  In particular, the Complaint alleges the following:             -    From  October  1997  until  at  least  July  1998,  the                  defendants  fraudulently touted the stocks of at  least                  five publicly-traded microcap companies in e-mails sent                  to STW subscribers  and  in  profiles  posted  on STW\s                  Internet website.             -    In exchange for recommending that their subscribers and                  readers  buy  the stock of the profiled companies,  the                  defendants received shares of stock in each company.             -    The defendants  never  informed  their  subscribers  or                  website   readers   that   they   received   shares  as                  compensation for touting the stocks in each company.             -    With  respect to almost every stock touted by STW,  the                  price and/or  volume  of  the  profiled company\s stock                  sharply  increased  shortly  following   the   STW  buy                  recommendation.             -    STW and King took advantage of the market interest they                  created  by  selling  into  the  inflated  market large                  amounts of stock they had received as compensation  for                  their  promotional  services.   The  total  profit  the                  defendants  received from their stock sales in the five                  companies exceeds $1 million.             -    STW and King  failed to disclose to their readers their                  intention  to  sell   the   stock   contrary  to  their                  recommendations to buy the same stock  made  on the STW                  website  and  in e-mails.  This fraudulent practice  is                  known as scalping.                  As  part  of  the   alleged   fraudulent  conduct,  the             Complaint further alleges that STW and  King  scalped  the             securities of the following microcap companies:             Surgical Safety Products             -    On   April   21,   1998,   the  defendants  sent  their                  subscribers a very positive  profile of Surgical Safety                  Products (SURG), a Florida based  medical  firm.  The                  profile stated, among other things, that the defendants                  believed  that  SURG  will  be  a $20 stock within  18                  months.             -    Just  prior  to  the  dissemination  of  the  STW  SURG                  recommendation, SURG stock closed at $0.96.   Two  days                  later,  the  price  of  SURG stock surged to its yearly                  high of $3.13, an increase  of 200%, and the defendants                  immediately began selling SURG shares they had received                  from the company for a profit.   By  July  6, 1998, the                  defendants had sold 123,360 shares of SURG stock  for a                  total profit of $573,753.             -    The defendants did not disclose that they were selling                  SURG stock at the same time they were recommending that                  their subscribers and readers buy the stock.             Midland, Inc.             -    On May 23, 1998, the defendants profiled Midland, Inc.,                  a  Texas based company, which claimed to own the patent                  rights  to  a machine that purportedly produced a fuel-                  blending  additive   that  dramatically  increased  the                  octane rating for gasoline.   The  profile  sent to STW                  subscribers  stated,  among other things, that  Midland                  can become a $75 stock,  based  on  its  ability  to                  generate long term growth and exit for the investor.             -    During  the  first  trading  day  after the profile was                  disseminated, the price of Midland stock increased from                  $1.03  to  as high as $2.63, before closing  at  $1.44.                  The trading  volume  during  that  day  was 1.5 million                  shares, an increase of over 100% from the previous day.             -    Immediately  after  the  release  of  the profile,  the                  defendants  began  selling  undisclosed Midland  shares                  they received from the company  for  the  profile.   By                  June  11,  1998,  the  defendants  sold 152,000 Midland                  shares for a profit of $172,000.             -    The defendants did not diclose that they were selling                  Midland stock at the same time they were recommending                  that their subscribers and readers buy the stock             -    On June 16, 1998, Midland announced  that its president                  had  resigned  amid  fraud  charges  and  that  it  was                  canceling   its   acquisition   of  the  company  which                  purportedly  owned  the  patents to  the  fuel-blending                  additive machine.                  The defendants\ practice of scalping is alleged to have             violated the antifraud provisions found in Section 17 (a) of             the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities  Act)  and  Section             10(b)  of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, and  Rule             10b-5 thereunder.   Additionally,  STW and King\s failure to             disclose  the  receipt  of  shares  in  the  companies  they             promoted  as compensation, is alleged to have  violated  the             antitouting  provisions  contained  in  Section 17(b) of the             Securities Act.  The Complaint seeks a permanent  injunction             against STW and King, as well as an accounting, disgorgement             of  their  unjust  profits,  and  civil  penalties.

FOR FAILING TO          DISCLOSE ADEQUATELY PAYMENTS FROM ISSUERS FOR TOUTING STOCKS               The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that          on October 27, 1998 it filed a civil action in federal district          court against John D. Attalienti (Attalienti) and Barrow Street          Research, Inc. (Barrow Street) alleging that Barrow Street, a          newsletter advertising itself as an independent, impartial stock          analyst, failed to disclose fully that it routinely received          payments of cash and securities from issuers in exchange for          touting the issuers\ stocks on Barrow Street\s Internet web site.          Attalienti and Barrow Street promoted the stock of 10 different          publicly-traded companies on Barrow Street\s Internet web site          without fully disclosing the nature, terms and amounts of          compensation received from the advertised companies, in violation          of Section 17(b) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities          Act). The SEC also alleges that Attalienti and Barrow Street          distributed the Barrow Street recommendations to a network of          broker-dealers without full disclosure of the compensation          received from the issuers.               Without admitting or denying the allegations in the          Complaint, Attalienti and Barrow Street have consented to the          entry of Final Judgments (i) permanently enjoining them from          violating Section 17(b) of the Securities Act and (ii) ordering          Attalienti to pay a penalty of $25,000.               Section 17(b) of the Securities Act makes it illegal for any          person to distribute a publication recommending a security          without fully disclosing the nature, terms and amounts of          compensation received or to be received in connection with the          distribution of the publication.

Bruss,             Docket No. 98C6772 (U.S.D.C., N.D.Ill.)                  The Securities and Exchange Commission announced the             filing of a Complaint in the United States District Court             for the Northern District of Illinois, on October 27, 1998,             seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement, civil             penalties and other relief against The Future Superstock,             Inc. (FSS) and Jeffrey C. Bruss.                  The Complaint alleges that since the spring of 1996, an             Internet newsletter called The Future Superstock, which is             published by FSS and researched and written by Bruss, has             recommended to the newsletter\s more than 100,000             subscribers and to visitors to the newsletter\s web site             (www.futuresuperstock..com) the purchase of approximately 25             microcap stocks which were predicted to double or triple in             the next three to twelve months.  In most instances, the             prices of recommended securities increased for a short             period of time after a recommendation was made in The Future             Superstock, after which the prices of those stocks dropped             substantially.  It is alleged that in making these             recommendations FSS and Bruss have violated the federal             securities laws by failing to provide adequate disclosure in             a number of significant areas:  (1) for over two years             neither the newsletter nor the web site disclosed that Bruss             or FSS received compensation, in cash and stock, from nearly             every issuer profiled; (2) FSS and Bruss have failed to             disclose that in many instances they have sold stock in the             issuer shortly after the dissemination of a recommendation             in The Future Superstock caused its price to rise; (3) FSS             and Bruss have represented in the profiles that they             performed independent research and analysis in evaluating             the issuers profiled by the newsletter when, in fact,             little, if any, research was conducted in preparing the             profiles; and (4) the statements made in the profiles             regarding the success of past stock picks made in The Future             Superstock have been false and misleading.                  It is alleged that by engaging in such conduct FSS and             Bruss have violated Sections 17(a) and 17(b) of the             Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities             Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder."

Litigation Release No.  15959/ October 27, 1998             SEC Fines Internet Stock Promoter Responsible for Massive             Spam Campaign                  The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil             action in federal district court against Francis A. Tribble,             a stock promoter, and Sloane Fitzgerald, Inc., a public             relations firm which Tribble owns, alleging that Tribble and             Sloane Fitzgerald touted two microcap stocks over the             Internet without disclosing contractual arrangements with             the issuers of those stocks to pay stock and cash             compensation for those promotional efforts.  The Complaint             alleges that Tribble, through Sloane Fitzgerald, entered             into contractual agreements with Eventemp Corporation and             JT\s Restaurants, Inc. to promote their companies and             securities over the Internet and elsewhere for stock and             cash compensation.  According to the complaint, between             November 1997 and August 1998,  Tribble disseminated several             million Internet e-mails, known as spams; designed and             maintained several Internet websites; and distributed an             online investment newsletter, each of which recommended             investment in Eventemp or JT\s Restaurants common stock,             without making legally sufficient disclosure of Tribble\s             compensation arrangements with those issuers.  Without             admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint,             Tribble and Sloane Fitzgerald have consented to be enjoined             from violating Section 17(b) of the Securities Act of 1933,             and Tribble has consented to pay a civil penalty of $15,000.                  The Complaint alleges that Tribble sent out millions of             spams to Internet users touting the potential earning power             of Eventemp and JT\s Restaurants stock.  Many of the spams             purported to be from independent stock promoters such as             HotStock, Net-Vest, and Cyber-Stock, which were             actually only names Tribble invented.  Tribble\s spams also             referred readers to a variety of Internet websites which he             built, containing additional information about the companies             he was touting and recommendations to buy their stock.             Finally, in August 1998, Tribble wrote an online investment             newsletter touting JT\s Restaurants and distributed it over             the Internet to 200 subscribers whom he had solicited             through previous Internet e-mails and websites.                  In conducting this Internet promotional campaign, the             Complaint alleges, Tribble failed fully to disclose that he             had a vested interest in an increase in the price of the             stocks he was touting, or that he would be compensated by             the companies he was touting in cash or securities of those             companies.  Tribble\s activities violated Section 17(b) of             the Securities Act of 1933, which makes it unlawful for any             person to recommend stock for consideration, whether past or             prospective, without disclosing the fact, nature, and amount             of that consideration.

Koeltl entered a default judgment against          Shmmuel Emmanuel Abijah Quijano (Abijah) in a Commission action          involving the offer and attempt to sell forged and fictitious          securities.  The Commission alleged in a June 5, 1998 complaint          that Abijah and eight other defendants engaged in a scheme to          obtain money using fraudulent bank certificates in violation of          the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.               The Commission alleged in its complaint that Abijah, along          with eight other defendants, attempted to negotiate at least one          such fraudulent bank certificate purportedly represented as          issued by the Mitsubishi B.J. Bank (Mitsubishi Certificate).          The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd., the FBI, and the Federal          Reserve Bank all have confirmed that the certificate is not          genuine.  The Commission alleged that Abijah and the other          defendants were all part of the scheme, which would use the          Mitsubishi Certificate to generate millions of dollars in          payments for themselves, while invoking both humanitarian goals          and the names of official entities, ranging from the Federal          Reserve Bank to the United Nations Security Council, in an effort          to make their scheme appear legitimate.  The Commission also          alleged that some defendants possess at least one additional          fraudulent bank certificate which they intend to negotiate as          part of their scheme, which also involves trading programs          resembling classic prime bank schemes.               The final judgment ordered Abijah to pay a $75,000 penalty,          and permanently enjoined him from violating Section 10(b) of the          Securites Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and          Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.  Abijah had          previously consented to the entry of a preliminary injunction          against him on June 29, 1998.               The court\s order found that the penalty is appropriate          given the fraudulent conduct in this case and the significant          risk of substantial losses to other persons as a result of the          fraud.

Beagelman, 96 Civ. 3899 (DRH)(E.D.N.Y.) and a former             officer and director of Packaging Plus Services, Inc.             (Packaging Plus).  The final judgment permanently enjoins             Beagelman from future violations of the antifraud, corporate             reporting, books and records, and other provisions of the             Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act). The final             judgment also orders Beagelman to pay a civil penalty of             $40,000, payable over 18 months.  Beagelman consented to the             entry of the final judgment against him without admitting or             denying the allegations in the Commission\s Complaint.                  In this action, the Commission alleges, in pertinent             part, that during 1990 and 1991, Beagelman, together with             others, engaged in a fraudulent scheme to overstate the             assets, revenue and income of Packaging Plus on its books             and records and in reports filed with the Commission.  The             Commission also alleges that, in furtherance of this scheme,             Beagelman improperly recorded franchise fee revenue and             franchise fee receivables on Packaging Plus\s books and             records, and executed backdated and otherwise fraudulent             franchise agreements.  The Commission further alleges that             Beagelman made material misrepresentations and provided             materially false and misleading documents to a certified             public accountant in connection with the accountant\s audit             of certain Packaging Plus financial statements.  By engaging             in the foregoing conduct, Beagelman allegedly violated             Sections 10(b), 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act             and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2.

(Alcohol Sensors).  The          complaint alleges that Alcohol Sensors, a company that markets          automotive safety products whose securities are quoted in the          pink sheets and is traded on the OTC Bulletin Board, failed to          make available to the investing public current and accurate          information about its financial condition and results of          operation through the filing of periodic reports with the          Commission as required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934          (Exchange Act).  Specifically, the complaint alleges that          Alcohol Sensors has not filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for          the fiscal year ended December 31, 1997, its Quarterly Reports on          Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended March 31 and June 30,          1998 and two Notifications of Late Filing with respect to its          delinquent reports.  The Commission seeks to compel Alcohol          Sensors to file its delinquent periodic reports and enjoin          Alcohol Sensors from further violations of Section 13(a) of the          Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 12b-25, 13a-1 and 13a-13          thereunder.  Simultaneously with the filing of the Commission\s          complaint, Alcohol Sensors consented to the entry of a Final          Judgment granting the relief sought by the Commission and          admitted that it had not filed the periodic reports as described          above."
15964,1998,,"b                      SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION       Litigation Release No.  15964 / October 29, 1998       AMICUS  CURIAE  BRIEF  ADDRESSING ISSUES UNDER THE LEAD PLAINTIFF       PROVISIONS OF THE LITIGATION  REFORM  ACT:  LAPERRIERE  v.  VESTA       INSURANCE  GROUP,  INC.,  Civ.  Action  No.  98-AR-1407-S,  (N.D.       Ala.)(AND RELATED CASES).             On  September  24, 1998, in the above cases, the Securities       and Exchange Commission  filed an amicus curiae (or friend of the       court) brief which addresses  issues  under  the  lead  plaintiff       provisions  of  the  Private Securities Litigation Reform Act  of       1995.   The  brief is available  on  the  Commission\s  Web  site       (www.sec.gov).            The Commission  has long expressed the view that meritorious       private  actions under  the  federal  securities  laws  serve  an       important  role in compensating investors who have been harmed by       securities  law   violations   and,  as  the  Supreme  Court  has       repeatedly  recognized,  in supplementing  the  Commission\s  own       enforcement efforts.  See,  e.g., Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards,       Inc. v. Berner, 472 U.S. 299,  310 (1985).  This role for private       litigation  was  reaffirmed in the  legislative  history  of  the       Litigation Reform Act.            The Act\s lead  plaintiff  provisions  seek  to make private       litigation more effective for the protection of investors.       The  provisions  were  enacted  in order to ensure the  investors       receive the most effective representation  of  their interests in       securities class actions.  The Act presumes, subject to rebuttal,       that the most adequate representative of the class  will  be  the       person  with the largest financial interest in the relief sought       by the class.            The  objective  of the lead plaintiff provisions was to make       securities class actions  less lawyer driven by placing control       of the litigation in the hands  of a plaintiff who would have the       financial incentive to control the  conduct  of  counsel, and the       sophistication to do so.  Congress particularly sought to involve       as  lead plaintiff institutional investors who it believed  could       effectively control the litigation.             In  the Vesta Insurance Group cases the Commission took the       following positions:- The Commission urged  that  the court not appoint competing applicants  for the lead plaintiff position as co-lead plaintiffs.  The   Commission argued that the language of the Act indicates  that  only    a single lead plaintiff (which may consist of a group of cooperating   persons) should be appointed.  It  also  argued  that the purpose of   the lead plaintiff provisions  --  of ensuring investor control  of    the  litigation  --  would  be  undercut  if management of the   litigation were dispersed among competing persons.- The Commission argued that, in considering the application of a   cooperating group jointly seeking to be appointed lead plaintiff,   the Court generally should limit  the proposed lead plaintiff group to   a small number capable of most effectively  managing the litigation   and exercising control over counsel.  While the court  might  appoint   a larger group where special circumstances, such as pre-existing   relations among the members, exist, in general the court should appoint  a cooperating group of no more than five persons.             Finally,  the Commission\s brief observes that  even  if  a       plaintiff is not  selected  as lead plaintiff, and its counsel is       not selected as lead counsel,  the  court  can  and  should award       compensation to law firms that do work investigating and bringing       meritorious  securities  actions.   This  is, the brief observes,       consistent  with  Congress\  objective  to  encourage  thoroughly       researched and diligently drafted complaints."

Patterson, United States District Judge for the Southern District          of New York, entered Final Judgments of Permanent Injunction          against Gordon Cochrane and Fuad Dow in this insider trading case          on October 14 and October 19, 1998, respectively.  In its          complaint, the Commission alleged that Arjun Sekhri, then an          investment banker at Salomon Smith Barney Inc. in New York City,          tipped Dow, his former college roommate, with information about          six major corporate transactions before the transactions were          announced to the public.  Dow gave the information to Cochrane.          Cochrane and Dow bought common stock, call options, or both, in          the companies involved before the public announcements (LR-15691,          April 1, 1998).               The judgment against Cochrane orders him to disgorge trading          profits and prejudgment interest of approximately $684,000.  The          judgment against Dow orders him to disgorge trading profits of          approximately $469,000.  The judgments enjoin Cochrane and Dow          from violating Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities          Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder.  The          Commission did not seek penalties against Cochrane or Dow, and          waived disgorgement of additional profits from Dow, based on          their demonstrated inability to pay additional amounts.  Cochrane          and Dow consented to the entry of the judgments without admitting          or denying the Commissions allegations.Cochrane and Dow earlier          pled guilty to criminal charges involving the same conduct.

Sambrano,  Civil Action No. SA CV 98929 AHS (ANX) (C.D. Cal.)       The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) filed an  enforcement action in federal court today charging insider  trading by a former employee of Smith Micro  Software, Inc., an Orange County high tech firm.  The complaint  alleges that Steven A. Sambrano (Sambrano), age 35, of San  Clemente, California, used confidential corporate information in  buying stock in his then employer Smith Micro.       The Commissions complaint alleges that Sambrano, while  employed at Smith Micro, helped negotiate a software packaging  agreement between Smith Micro and Compaq Computer Corp. (Compaq).  Sambrano also received draft copies of the press release  announcing the agreement just days before it was issued on March  12, 1998.  The complaint further alleges that Sambrano used the  inside information concerning the Compaq agreement in purchasing  5,000 shares of Smith Micro stock the day before the  announcement.  Within hours of the March 12 press release  announcing the agreement, Sambrano sold his Smith Micro shares  and realized a profit of $10,625.

Judge Sim Lake, federal          district judge for the Southern District of Texas, granted the          Commissions request and entered a temporary restraining order          and asset freeze on November 4 against Cammarano and Cammarano          and Associates, Inc.

According to the complaint,          Cammarano recently misrepresented to an elderly woman that her          $125,000 transfer of retirement funds into a CAI business account          would be used to invest in shares of Exxon and money market          instruments, and solicited $100,000 from another elderly customer          for the intended purpose of purchasing money market instruments.          In fact, neither of these investments were ever made.               The Commission seeks a Court order permanently enjoining          Cammarano and CAI from engaging in further violations of  Section          17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 10(b) and          15(a)(1)of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5          thereunder.

The  Commission          had  filed  its  suit  on September 29, 1997, seeking, as against          Burns,   injunctive  and  other   equitable   relief,   including          disgorgement, civil penalties and an officer and director bar.               The Commission  alleged in its complaint that Burns and VDS,          by  disseminating  false   information,  fraudulently  sold  $2.7          million worth of VDS stock to  citizens of Spain, in violation of          Section 17(a) of the Securities  Act  of  1933 (Securities Act)          and  Section  10(b)  of  the  Securities  Exchange  Act  of  1934          (Exchange  Act)  and  Rule  10b-5 thereunder.   The  Commission          further alleged that, as a control  person  of  VDS, Burns caused          VDS to fail to keep adequate books and records, in  violation  of          Section   13(b)(2)(A)   of  the  Exchange  Act,  and  in  certain          instances, to falsify its  books  and  records,  in  violation of          Section  13(b)(5)  of the Exchange Act and Rule13b2-1 thereunder,          filed or caused to be  filed with the Commission materially false          and misleading information,  in violation of Section 13(a) of the          Exchange  Act  and  Rules  12B-20,   13A-1,   13A-11  and  13A-13          thereunder, and made or caused to be made false statements to VDS          auditors,  in violation of Section 13(b)(5) of the  Exchange  Act          and  Rule  13b2-2  thereunder.   In  particular,  the  Commission          alleged in its  complaint  that  Burns  provided  a VDS Business          Profile   to   investors   which  overvalued  VDS\  assets   and          shareholder equity by at least  300%  and 150%, respectively, and          overvalued  service  contracts by at least  800%.   The  Business          Profile also misrepresented  the  use  of stock sale proceeds, as          well as Burns\ background and experience,  and failed to disclose          his  prior securities fraud conviction.  The  Commission  further          alleged  in its complaint that the Form 8-K Burns filed or caused          to be filed  with  the  Commission  misrepresented  the  value of          certain  VDS  property  and  Burns\  background,  and  failed  to          disclose  Burns\  criminal  conviction  as well as a $1.5 million          judgment against him.               The Final Judgment enjoins Burns from  future  violations of          the  antifraud provisions of the Securities Act and the  Exchange          Act, and  enjoins  Burns,  when  acting as a control person, from          causing   violations   of   the  Exchange   Act\s   recordkeeping          provisions, from making or causing to be made false statements to          auditors,  and  from filing or  causing  to  be  filed  with  the          Commission  false  reports.   In  addition,  the  Final  Judgment          permanently bars  Burns  from acting as an officer or director of          any public issuer, and orders  Burns  to  pay  a  $100,000  civil          penalty,   disgorgement   in   the   amount  of  $2,700,000,  and          prejudgment interest in the amount of $1,063,960."
15969,1998,,"b                   UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION          LITIGATION RELEASE NO.  15969 / NOVEMBER 6, 1998          SECURITIES  AND  EXCHANGE COMMISSION v. First Americans Bank Ltd.          et al., Civil Action No. Civ. 98-0645 R (USDC WD Okla.)               The Commission  announced that on November 3, 1998, the U.S.          Attorneys Office in Oklahoma  City, Oklahoma obtained a 30-count          indictment alleging that Ronald G. Sparks and Owen K. Stephenson,          two California residents, raised  in  excess  of  $  7 million by          fraudulently claiming to operate an unregulated, sovereign Indian          Bank  on  Apache tribal land in Oklahoma.  Sparks and Stephenson,          whose fraudulent scheme was halted earlier this year by a federal          court acting  upon a motion filed by the Commission, were charged          by  the  grand jury  with  conspiracy,   mail  fraud,  and  money          laundering.               In  May   1998,   the   Commission   obtained  an  emergency          restraining order halting the sale of securities  of  the  Native          American Free Trade Association (NAFTA), an Oklahoma entity,  its          officers,  Stephenson  and  Sparks,  and others, based upon their          dissemination, through press releases and on an Internet site, of          false  statements.  Among other representations,  the  defendants          claimed  that  NAFTA  was  operating  an FDIC-insured bank called          First  Americans  Bank  Ltd.  (FAB)  on  Apache  tribal  land  in          Anadarko, Oklahoma.  The Commissions complaint  alleged that the          Apache tribe never authorized NAFTA to operate a bank  as claimed          and  that  Sparks  and  Stephenson  had  failed  to  disclose  to          prospective investors past enforcement actions taken against them          by  federal  criminal  authorities  and  banking  and  securities          regulators.  The Commission also obtained an order freezing funds          of  Sparks,  Stephenson,  NAFTA,  FAB  and their affiliates.   In          excess of $ 2 million in investor and depositor have been frozen.               The indictment returned on November 3, 1998 in Oklahoma City          charges Sparks and Stephenson with obtaining  in  excess  of  $ 7          million  from  customers  in the form of purported investments or          deposits in the nonexistent  bank.   The  indictment alleges that          Sparks and Stephenson diverted this money to their own use.               The Commissions case, which involves  alleged violations of          the antifraud provisions, Section 17(a) of the  Securities Act of          1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934          and  Rule  10b-5  thereunder  by Sparks, Stephenson,  NAFTA,  and          affiliated entities, has been stayed  by a federal district court          in  Oklahoma City, Oklahoma pending resolution  of  the  criminal          action against Sparks and Stephenson.  During the stay, the asset          freeze  obtained by the Commission will remain in effect by order          of the Court.

Litigation Release No.  15974  /  November 10, 1998          SEC v. United Communications, Ltd., et. al,          (Civil Action No. 95-0400 (JR)) (USDC/DC)               The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that          on November 3, 1998, The Honorable James Robertson, United States          District Judge for the District of Columbia, entered a Final          Judgment of Permanent Injunction and Other Equitable Relief          against defendants Rodney J. Bonvicino and PX Marketing, Inc.          The Final Judgment, which was entered on consent, permanently          enjoins these defendants from future violations of Section 17(a)          of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of  the          Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, and orders          Bonvicino to disgorge $600,000, plus prejudgment interest.  It          further provides that Bonvicino shall satisfy the disgorgement          through liquidation of his Keogh Plan, with any disgorgement          amount above the proceeds from the Keogh Plan waived based on          Bonvicinos demonstrated inability to pay.               The Commissions Complaint, filed February 27, 1995, alleged          that,  along  with  twelve  other  defendants,  Bonvicino  and PX          offered  and  sold  unregistered  securities of limited liability          companies  purportedly  organized  to   develop   wireless  cable          television systems.  The Complaint further alleged that defendant          committed  securities  fraud  by  orchestrating the use  of  high          pressure  sales  tactics  by telemarketing  sales  organizations,          which misrepresented and omitted  material  facts  concerning the          risks and rewards of the ventures.  With the entry of  the  Final          Judgment  against  Bonvicino  and  PX, the case has been resolved          against  all  defendants.   There has been  one  distribution  to          investors from the disgorgement  fund  previously  established in          the case.  On receipt of Bonvicinos disgorgement and,  upon  the          approval of the Court, a final distribution will be made.               For further information, see Litigation Release No. 14424."

BENEFUND, INC., and VERNON          R. TWYMAN, JR. , Civil Action No. 97-CV-366-E(J), USDC, ND/OK               Vernon R. Twyman, Jr., (Twyman) the former chief executive          officer of BeneFund, Inc., consented to entry of an order of          permanent injunction and other equitable relief in federal          district court, Tulsa, Oklahoma, on November 4, 1998.  The order,          which permanently enjoins Twyman from future violations of the          securities registration, antifraud, and reporting provisions of          the federal securities laws, originates from charges made in a          complaint filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission          (Commission) that Twyman and BeneFund engaged in a fraudulent          scheme to promote and distribute the securities of BeneFund, a          Section 12(g) reporting company whose common stock was quoted on          the NASDAQ Bulletin Board Service and in the pink sheets.               The Court\s order also bars Twyman from serving as an          officer or director of any company that has a class of securities          registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act          of 1934 (Exchange Act), or that is required to file reports          pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act,  Additionally, the          order requires Twyman to disgorge $277,000, plus prejudgment          interest, an amount reflecting the ill-gotten gains to Twyman          from the unlawful activities alleged in the Commission\s          complaint.   Based on Twyman\s demonstrated financial inability          to pay, however, payment of the disgorgement amount was waived          and the Court did not impose a civil penalty on Twyman.               The Commission\s complaint, filed on April 18, 1997, alleged          that Twyman and others, in connection with sales of $2 million in          BeneFund S-8 stock and a BeneFund private placement, and in press          releases and Commission filings, made false and misleading          statements concerning the use of investor funds, the value of          BeneFund\s assets and the future marketability of BeneFund stock.          The complaint also alleged that Twyman orchestrated the public          sale and distribution of S-8 stock in violation of the securities          registration provisions.                         The Complaint charged Twyman with violations of Sections 5(a),          5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 10(b),          13(a) and 13(b) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-          1, 13a-11 and 13a-13, thereunder."

Tenn.)                  The  Securities and Exchange Commission announced today             that  the  Honorable  Julia  Smith  Gibbons,  United  States             District Judge, issued final judgments against Austria Trust             Company,  Ltd.   (Austria   Trust),   Bobby   Lee  Rodgers             (Rodgers)   and   Glen  Moyer  (Moyer),  of  Germantown,             Tennessee and City (U.K.)  Ltd. (CityUK), a United Kingdom             entity. The final judgments as to Austria Trust, Rodgers and             Moyer permanently enjoin them  from violating Sections 5(a),             5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities  Act  of  1933  and Section             10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule  10b-5             thereunder,  set  disgorgement  but waive payment and do not             impose   civil   penalties   based   on   those   defendants             demonstrated  inability  to  pay. The final judgment  as  to             relief defendant CityUK requires  CityUK  to  disgorge $1.67             million to the registry of the Court. The defendants and the             relief  defendant  consented to the final judgments  without             admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint.                  The  Commission\s  complaint,  filed  April  23,  1998,             alleged that  Austria  Trust, Rodgers and Moyer violated the             registration  and  antifraud   provisions  by  selling  $2.7             million of securities and promising  exorbitant returns from             a prime bank note trading program. The  complaint  alleged             that  the  trading  program  did not exist. Relief defendant             CityUK was hired by the defendants to recover the funds from             the entity which purportedly operated  the  trading program.             The complaint alleged that CityUK was unjustly  enriched  by             its holding of $2.5 million of the funds."

MURPHY          Civil Action No. CV 97-2719 JMI (CWx) (C.D. Cal.)               The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission)          announced that on September 29, 1998, the Honorable Terry J.          Hatter, Chief United States District Judge, entered a final          judgment against Stephen J. Murphy (Murphy) permanently          enjoining him from violating the antifraud provisions of the          federal securities laws.  The final judgment also sets          disgorgement of Murphy\s ill-gotten gains at $377,500 and pre-          judgment interest thereon at $48,551 but waives payment of these          amounts, and does not impose civil penalties, based upon Murphy\s          demonstrated inability to pay.               In its Complaint, the Commission alleges that Murphy offered          and sold limited partnership interests through a Los Angeles          company doing business as ATM Global, Inc..  The Commission          alleges that, in offering and selling the limited partnership          interests to investors, Murphy misrepresented his identity by          using the aliases Jack Davis, Gregg Davis and Mike Fox.          Furthermore, Murphy failed to disclose the entry of, and the          terms of, a 1994 Final Judgment entered against him in an earlier          Commission action enjoining him from future fraud and          registration violations of the federal securities laws.

In that case, the          Commission alleged that Murphy fraudulently offered and sold          investments in real estate ventures.  Murphy also failed to          disclose that, in 1994, the Commission had revoked his          registration as an investment adviser and barred him from the          securities industry.  Murphy further failed to disclose that          another company he owned and managed, American Capital          Investments, Inc., was placed into receivership.               The final judgment enjoins Murphy from future violations of          Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the          Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.          Murphy consented to the entry of the final judgment without          admitting or denying the Commission\s allegations."

Hahn Truong, Hieu Truong,          Hen Truong, Nina Vinh, Mike Pirbazari and Christopher Nguyen,          Civil Action No. C98-21137SW (N.D. Cal.)               The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) filed          an enforcement action in the federal district court in San Jose          charging six defendants with insider trading in the securities of          Molecular Dynamics, Inc. (Molecular), a high-tech firm located          in Sunnyvale, California.  The Commission alleges that Hahn          Truong (Hahn), age 36, of San Jose, California, used          confidential corporate information in selling shares in his then-          employer, Molecular, and tipped others with the information who          then sold and/or sold short additional Molecular shares.  The          defendants\ and another tippee\s ill-gotten gains collectively          totaled $429,136.               Also named in the Commission\s action are:  Hieu Truong          (Hieu), age 43, residing in San Jose, California; Hen Truong          (Hen), age 38, whose last known address is in San Jose,          California; Nina Vinh (Nina), age 35, residing in Milpitas,          California; Mike Pirbazari (Pirbazari), age 52, residing in Los          Angeles, California; and Christopher Nguyen (Nguyen), age 35,          residing in Cupertino, California.               The Commission\s complaint alleges that while employed as          the manager of the software engineering group at Molecular, Hahn          obtained material, nonpublic information concerning Molecular\s          anticipated poor financial results for the first quarter of 1994.          Three weeks before Molecular publicly announced the information          on April 6, 1994, Hahn used the information to sell all of his          Molecular stock (33,729 shares) and tipped his brothers Hieu and          Hen, and his friend Nguyen, each of whom sold all of his          Molecular shares and sold short additional shares.  Collectively,          these tippees sold 28,300 Molecular shares and sold short 33,800          Molecular shares.  The complaint further alleges that Hahn lent          money to Hen to fund his short sales and received half of Hen\s          short selling profits and that Hahn lent Nguyen $15,000 to short          sell Molecular stock.               The Commission\s complaint further alleges that Hieu, in          addition to trading on his own behalf, tipped his sister-in-law          Nina, who sold all of her 3,000 Molecular shares and sold short          1,500 shares; Nina tipped her sister and her friend Pirbazari,          each of whom sold all of her/his Molecular shares (815 and 1,000          shares respectively).               When Molecular publicly announced that its quarterly results          would be lower than expected, its stock price dropped from $10 to          $6.125, a 38.8% decline.  By using the material, nonpublic          information to trade Molecular shares before the public          announcement, the defendants and Nina\s sister collectively          avoided losses totaling $294,151 and made short selling profits          of $134,985.               The Commission charged the defendants with violations of          Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act)          and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934          (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Commission\s          complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement plus          prejudgment interest thereon, and civil penalties against all of          the defendants."

Litigation Release No. 15979/November 18, 1998             SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION v. ANTHONY GIANNINOTO AND             EILEEN LAINE, 98 Civ. 5207 (MTB)(D.N.J.)                  The Commission announced that it filed today a second             Complaint in federal court in Newark, New Jersey charging             two additional people in connection with a Ponzi scheme             through which more than 1700 investors were defrauded of             over $100 million. In its first Complaint, filed in March             1997, the Commission charged First Interregional Equity             Corporation (FIEC),  First Interregional Advisors             Corporation (FIAC) and Richard Goettlich, the president of             FIEC and FIAC, with securities fraud in connection with the             offer and sale of securities in the form of assignments of             equipment leases.  Named in the Complaint filed today are:                  Anthony Gianninoto, a 50 year old resident of             Tewksbury, New Jersey, who, during the time period of the             events alleged in the Complaint, was FIEC\s controller and             financial operations principal and FIAC\s vice president,             secretary and treasurer; and                  Eileen Laine, a 46 year old resident of Millburn, New             Jersey, who, during the time period of the events alleged in             the Complaint, was the data processing manager at FIEC and             worked at FIAC in a similar capacity.                  The Complaint alleges that Anthony Gianninoto and             Eileen Laine were major participants in the fraud in which             FIAC, FIEC and their principals sold to investors all right,             title and interest in equipment leases that had already been             sold or were going to be sold to other investors.  The             Complaint further alleges that, in conjunction with others             at FIAC, Anthony Gianninoto planned the multiple sale of             lease assignments, supervised the creation and dissemination             of materially false documents that were sent to investors             and coordinated the financial aspects of the fraud to ensure             that it would go undetected.  The Complaint alleges that             Eileen Laine falsified FIEC\s internal books and records,             created and disseminated to investors materially false and             misleading documents, and diverted money that had been             provided by investors to purchase lease assignments.  From             in or about 1992 through March of 1997, FIEC and FIAC sold             nearly $300 million from the sale of lease assignments             investors--a sum that exceeded by more than $100 million the             value of those securities that FIAC and FIEC had to sell.                  The Complaint also alleges that Anthony Gianninoto and             Eileen Laine committed securities fraud in connection with a             second scheme in which investor bonds were misappropriated             in order to generate money to fund the lavish life styles of             FIEC and FIAC principals and employees, including Gianninoto             and Laine.  The Commission alleges that over $20 million in             bonds were misappropriated from the accounts of FIEC             customers and that, in an effort to perpetuate this fraud,             Anthony Gianninoto and Eileen Laine kept track of the             misappropriated bonds and diverted illegal proceeds in a             manner that led investors to think that the bonds were still             in their accounts and that they were receiving their monthly             interest payments.  In addition, the Complaint alleges that             Anthony Gianninoto and Eileen Laine created and disseminated             to investors materially false documents, including customer             account statements, and illegally altered the books and             records of FIEC and FIAC.                  As a result of the foregoing, the Commission alleges             that Anthony Gianninoto and Eileen Laine violated Section             17(a) of the Securities Act of 1993, 15 U.S.C. 77q(a),             Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15             U.S.C. 78j(b) and Rule 10b-5, 17 C.F.R. 240.10b-5.  The             Commission further alleges that pursuant to Section 20(f) of             the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78t(f), Anthony Gianninoto and             Eileen Laine are liable for aiding and abetting certain             books and records violations under Section 17(a) of the             Exchange Act and Rules 17a-3 and 17a-11, thereunder.  The             Commission seeks a Final Judgment against Anthony Gianninoto             and Eileen Laine: (i) enjoining them from future violations             of the above-cited provisions; (ii) directing a verified             accounting; (iii) requiring the disgorgement of all of their             ill-gotten gains, plus pre-judgment interest; and (iv)             assessing civil penalties against them.                  The litigation is pending as to all defendants.                  For more information see Litigation Release No. 15276."

The Court granted the             Commission\s request for an order freezing the defendants\             assets.  Additionally, the Court ordered all defendants to             account for investor monies and ordered the appointment of a             receiver to take control of the assets of the defendants for             the benefit of investors.

(Winterhawk), IGW             Trust (IGW), Carolyn Don Hicks (Hicks) and Carl LaDane             Weaver (Weaver), raised $14 million by telling investors             that these programs were successful, that their funds were             completely secured by guarantees issued by banks or             insurance companies, and that the investments would generate             returns between 6% and 18% per month.   In fact, according             to the complaint, the trading programs did not exist, there             were no such guarantees, and these defendants used most of             the investor funds for their own benefit and the benefit of             the relief defendants, Howe Financial Trust (Howe) and             Treds Financial Trust (Treds), and for payments to other             investors (ponzi payments).                  The Commission has also requested a preliminary             injunction against FRG, Hix, Coulter, Roberts, MVP, FMCI,             Funders, Parr, Smith, McKinney, Fortune, Cord, Winterhawk,             IGW, Hicks and Weaver from future violations of Sections             5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and             Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and             Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Court has not yet scheduled a             hearing on the Commission\s motion for preliminary             injunction.   The Commission, in its complaint, ultimately             seeks permanent injunctions against these defendants from             future violations, as well as disgorgement of all unlawfully             obtained profits from them and the relief defendants, with             prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against each             defendant.                  The Commission also wishes to acknowledge the valuable             assistance of  the Texas State Securities Board, as well as             the U.S. Attorney\s Office and the FBI in the Southern             District of Texas in Houston."

In its amended complaint, the Commission identified certain          defendants previously described as one or more unknown          purchasers in the original complaint, added insider trading          claims against additional defendants, and identified additional          trades in its insider trading claims against existing defendants.               In addition to Euro Security Fund and Coim, the original          defendants in this action now identified in the amended complaint          included Ron Sleegers, a vice president for ABB in Zurich,          Switzerland, and International Structures Consulting, B.V., a          Dutch company Sleegers controls;  Giovanni Piacitelli, an Italian          national who is a registered representative at Schroder & Co.,          Inc.\s offices in Grenolier and Geneva, Switzerland, and who          handled the Elsag Bailey trades by Euro Security Fund, Coim and          Pictet & Cie; Pierre Bottinelli, who is Piacitelli\s supervisor          at Schroder; Franck Hakkert, H.J.M. De Boer, C.J. Broekema and          E.H. Van Geenen, all of whom are residents of the Netherlands          with direct or indirect ties to Elsag Bailey employees; and a          Mrs. A. Verkaik, also a resident of the Netherlands.               In its amended complaint, the Commission named as additional          defendants Mario Merello and Fabrizzio Pessina, both officers of          Euro Security Fund, Francesco Marotta, a principal of Coim,          Meindert Panagiotis Hakkert and Hendrik Marinus Bouwmeester, both          Elsag Bailey employees, and Hans P. Romanesko, a former Elsag          Bailey employee.               The Commission\s amended complaint expanded its insider          trading claims against Sleegers and Euro Security Fund to include          additional trades beginning on September 8, 1998, and added          insider trading claims against another ABB employee, Urs Heller,          and his wife.  These additional trades increased to approximately          $7.4 million the total of allegedly illegal insider trading          profits.               On November 2, 1998, the Hon. Denise L. Cote of the U.S.          District Court for the Southern District of New York, held an          evidentiary hearing on in this case and concluded that the          Commission made a substantial showing that it was likely to          succeed on its insider trading claims.  On November 10, 1998, the          Court entered an Order for a Preliminary Injunction and Asset          Freeze preliminarily enjoining certain defendants from future          violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and          Rule 10b-5 thereunder and continuing with limited modifications          the October 19, 1998, freeze on some $6.6 million of the          defendants\ assets until a final adjudication on the merits.          (See LR-15942, October 20, 1998.)               The Court entered the Order against defendants Euro Security          Fund and Coim S.A., against C.J. Broekema, H.J.M. De Boer, F.          Hakkert, E.H. van Geenen, and Mrs. A. Verkaik, and against one or          more other purchasers through Banca Privata Solari & Blum, Banque          Cantonale Vaudoise, and ABN Amro Bank, N.V., who were still          unidentified at the time of the hearing.  The Court allowed these          defendants ten days to apply for reconsideration on the grounds          that they did not receive sufficient notice to allow for an          appearance at the preliminary injunction hearing.               The Court also signed orders on joint stipulations as to          defendants Ron Sleegers and International Structures Consulting          B.V., Pictet & Cie-Geneva and Giovanni Piacitelli, continuing its          October 19, 1998, Temporary Restraining Order with certain          limited modifications as to discovery deadlines and as to the          sale of the Elsag Bailey securities identified in the          Commission\s complaint.  The stipulated orders remain in effect          until otherwise ordered by the Court.  The stipulated orders and          the Order for a Preliminary Injunction and Asset Freeze expressly          allow the defendants to dispose of their Elsag Bailey stock or          options provided the proceeds of any such sales are retained          subject to the Court\s asset freeze.

C-97-3566-CW, FILED SEPTEMBER 30, 1997)                  The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission)             today announced that on November 13, 1998, the Honorable             Claudia Wilken, United States District Judge for the             Northern District of California, Oakland Division, in the             case of S.E.C. v. Francis X. Wazeter, III, et. al., (C-97-             3566-CW), entered a final judgment of permanent injunction             and other equitable relief against Francis X. Wazeter, III             (Wazeter) of Cary, North Carolina, for his role in a multi-             million dollar scheme involving the fraudulent misstatement             of the financial statements and accounts of International             Research and Development Corp. (IRDC), a Mattawan, Michigan             company.  During the relevant period, IRDCs common stock             was traded on NASDAQ, and it filed periodic reports with the             Commission.                  The Complaint in S.E.C. v. Francis X. Wazeter, III, et.             al. alleged that from at least June 1993 through at least             September 1994, Wazeter, the president of IRDC and Carme,             Inc. (Carme), a Novato, California company and former             subsidiary of IRDC, directed Carmes general manager, chief             financial officer and sales manager to engage in a scheme to             defraud investors in IRDC common stock by booking millions             of dollars in fictitious sales to various customers of             Carme, thereby materially overstating Carmes accounts             receivable, sales and earnings.  In addition, the scheme             resulted in the inclusion of these figures in IRDCs             consolidated financial statements causing IRDC to materially             overstate its accounts receivable and revenue by a total of             more than $3.5 million and its net earnings and earnings per             share by 50% to 1800% in IRDCs Forms 10-Q dated June 30,             1993, September 30, 1993, March 31, 1994, June 30, 1994 and             September 30, 1994 and its Form 10-K for the year ending             December 31, 1993, filed with the Commission.  According to             the Complaint, IRDCs inflated revenue and earnings figures             were also included in press releases issued to the public,             resulting in a fraud on the market for IRDC common stock.             The Complaint also alleged that Wazeter attempted to prevent             detection of his scheme by, among other things, directing             others to create false documents and lying to IRDCs             independent auditor.                  Wazeter, pursuant to his consent, was permanently             enjoined from future violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a),             13(b)(2) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of             1934, and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, 13b2-1 and             13b2-2 promulgated thereunder.  Wazeter was also permanently             and unconditionally prohibited from acting as an officer or             director of any issuer with a class of securities registered             pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act or any issuer             required to file reports pursuant to Section 15(d) of the             Exchange Act.  The court did not order civil penalties             against Wazeter based on his demonstrated inability to pay."
15983,1998,,"b                  UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION          LITIGATION RELEASE NO.   15983 /  November 19, 1998          Securities and Exchange Commission v. Golden Eagle International,          Inc., Ronald A. Knittle, Mary A. Erickson, Gregory G. Vernon,          Timberline Consultants, Inc., and Terry C. Turner,          Civil Action No. 98-Z-1020 (D. Colo.)               On November 17, 1998, the Securities and Exchange Commission          filed an amended complaint adding new fraud charges against          Golden Eagle International, Inc., and naming Terry C. Turner, its          current president, as a defendant.  The new fraud charges are          that Golden Eagle and Turner fraudulently claimed earlier this          year that the company had found staggering gold reserves on its          property in Bolivia.  Golden Eagle is based in Denver and Turner          resides in Salt Lake City and La Paz, Bolivia.               The amended complaint alleges that Turner caused Golden          Eagle to issue a press release on May 22, 1998, fraudulently          claiming that the company\s Bolivian property contained over 6          million ounces in proven reserves of gold.  According to the          amended complaint, Golden Eagle and Turner made these claims          without reading a copy of a geologic report upon which the          reserve claims purportedly were based.  The amended complaint          further alleges that Golden Eagle and Turner lacked a reasonable          basis for additional claims in the May 22 press release that the          Bolivian property contained huge amounts of additional inferred          [and] indicated resources.  Finally, the amended complaint          asserts that the fraudulent statements led to dramatic jumps in          the price and volume for Golden Eagle stock, and that the price          has declined after September 25, 1998, when Golden Eagle publicly          admitted that it lacked sufficient basis for the reserve claims.               The original complaint charged Golden Eagle, its former          president, its former treasurer/secretary and a promoter with,          among other things, having made false and misleading statements          during 1994 and 1995 pertaining to Golden Eagle\s efforts to          operate a mining business in the United States (See Litigation          Release 15733 issued May 7, 1998).  Further, the Commission          previously suspended trading in Golden Eagle\s securities based          upon concerns about the accuracy and adequacy of the information          regarding  the Bolivian gold (See Securities Exchange Act Release          No. 40104 issued June 19, 1998).               In addition to the relief sought in the original complaint,          the amended complaint seeks injunctive relief and civil penalties          against Turner for violations of the antifraud provisions of the          federal securities laws: Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of          1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,  and          Rule 10b-5.  The amended complaint also eliminates Paul B. Vernon          as a defendant because of his prior settlement of all charges          (See Litigation Release 15862 issued August 28, 1998)."

The   Commission   announced   today   that  it  obtained  a          preliminary injunction against defendants Eagle  Vision  Holdings          Inc.,  Wayne L. Nattrass, both located in the Seattle, Washington          area, and  Westminster Trading Trust, located in Richmond, Texas,          prohibiting  the  fraudulent  sale  of  interests  in  prime bank          instrument  trading  programs  which  falsely  offered guaranteed          returns exceeding 200 percent per month, claimed  to be sponsored          by the Federal Reserve Bank and the International Monetary  Fund,          and were represented to be guaranteed against risk of loss by the          top   twenty-five  world  banks.    The  preliminary  injunction,          entered  November  18  1998  by  Judge  Clarence A. Brimmer (D.C.          Wyoming), included an order freezing the assets of the defendants          and requiring the repatriation of assets.               The Court had previously issued a preliminary injunction and          asset  freeze  against  defendants  Scott B.  Walker  and  Equity          Management Services, both of Afton, Wyoming, and Scott L. Simpson          and Zappa International Corporation,  located in Richmond, Texas.          The amended complaint alleges that from  September  1996  to  the          present,  the defendants raised approximately $15 million from at          least 100 investors  through  a  fraudulent  prime bank scheme in          which they guaranteed high rate of return and falsely represented          that the investors\ principal was fully secured by a top European          Bank  and  that  the  programs  were implemented through  traders          licensed by either the International Monetary Fund or the Federal          Reserve  Bank.   The  Commission  alleges  that  the  prime  bank          instruments  offered  by  the  defendants   do  not  exist.   The          Commission alleged that the defendants failed to disclose the use          of investor funds to pay solicitation fees to others who referred          the  investor and to make Ponzi payments to  earlier  investors          who sought  the  return  of  their  investment.   The  Commission          alleged  that through their false and misleading statements,  the          defendants violated the anti-fraud provisions of Section 17(a) of          the Securities  Act  of  1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities          and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder."

Bethea,  the  former  head  of  Stephens  Inc.\s Public            Finance  Department,  for  giving  secret  payments  to            certain  Florida  public  officials  in  exchange   for            municipal securities business.                 The Complaint, filed in the Northern District of            Florida, alleges the following:   While serving as head            of the Public Finance Department of Stephens, Bethea            authorized secret payments to one Florida public            official (Terry Busbee of the Escambia County Utilities            Authority) and facilitated the secret compensation of            another (Larry O\Dell of Osceola County), for the            purpose of obtaining or retaining municipal securities            business for Stephens.  Bethea\s failure to disclose            the arrangements, the payments, and the actual and            potential conflicts of interest they created, violated            the antifraud provisions as well as fair dealing and            gratuities rules of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking            Board.   Bethea also defrauded the issuer and            purchasers of a 1992 Walton County, Florida bond issue            by failing to disclose-in the face of a duty to do            so-Stephens\ compensation of a consultant and an            employee of another underwriting firm, in violation of            the same provisions.   In addition, Bethea:  endorsed            the conferral of an undisclosed favor upon a third            Florida public official; enlisted third parties to            serve as conduits for campaign contributions; and            created false and misleading books and records at            Stephens to cover up the illicit payments, in further            violation of fair-dealing rules.                 Simultaneous with the filing of the Complaint, and            without  admitting or denying the allegations contained            in the Complaint, Bethea agreed to the entry of a final            judgment  of   permanent   injunction   barring  future            violations  of  Section  17(a)  of the Securities  Act,            Sections 10(b) and 15B(c)(1) of the  Exchange  Act  and            Rule  10b-5  thereunder,  and MSRB rules G-17 and G-20;            and ordering him  to pay a  civil  penalty  of $30,000.            As  part of his settlement with the Commission,  Bethea            has agreed  to  the entry of a Commission order barring            him from the securities business.

Also today, the United States Attorney for the            Northern District of Florida (USAO) announced a civil            settlement with Stephens, and the Commission instituted            and settled an administrative proceeding against            Stephens.  Both the USAO\s civil settlement, and the            Commission\s administrative settlement, are based on            some of the same conduct alleged in the Commission\s            Complaint against Bethea.  As part of the USAO\s civil            settlement, Stephens has agreed to forfeit to the            Department of Justice $2.25 million in revenues of its            Public Finance Department, to make payments to three            Florida issuers in the aggregate amount of $886,672.16,            to refrain from conducting  municipal securities            business in Florida for five years; and to refrain            indefinitely and throughout the United States from            utilizing consultants within the meaning of MSRB rule            G-38.

Without admitting or denying the          allegations of the Commission\s Complaint, Setteducate          consented to be permanently enjoined from violating Section          17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), and          Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934          (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5.               The Commission\s Complaint alleged that Setteducate          fraudulently obtained at least $200,000 in a prime bank          securities scheme.  Setteducate pleaded guilty to wire fraud          in connection with the transactions alleged in the          Commission\s Complaint.  On May 5, 1998, Setteducate was          sentenced to two years probation and ordered to pay $300,000          in restitution.               The Commission alleged that Setteducate violated the          antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section          17(a) of the Securities Act, and Section 10(b) of the Exchange          Act and Rule 10b-5.  The Commission sought a permanent injunction          against future violations of those antifraud provisions,          disgorgement of Setteducate\s ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment          interest, and civil penalties.  Setteducate was not required to          pay disgorgement in this case because he had already been ordered          to make restitution as part of his criminal sentence.  Civil          penalties were not imposed because of Setteducate\s demonstrated          inability to pay them.

Neihart and          Synvion Corporation, Defendants. Civil Action File No. 1:98-CV-          3341-WBH    (N.D.Ga. November 25, 1998)               The   Securities   and  Exchange  Commission  (Commission)          announced today that on November  23,  1998, it filed a civil law          suit with application for a temporary restraining order and other          emergency  relief  against  Ronnie  R.  Neihart  (Neihart)  and          Synvion  Corporation  (Synvion).   The complaint  alleges  that          defendants Neihart and Synvion engaged  in fraud in the offer and          sale  of unregistered securities in the form  of  Synvion  common          stock  using   misrepresentations   and   omissions  of  fact  to          investors.  On November 25, 1998, Judge Willis  B.  Hunt  of  the          United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia          entered a temporary  restraining order against the two defendants          and directed that their assets be frozen and that they provide an          accounting.                  The  Commission\s  complaint  alleges  that  Neihart  and          Synvion  effected   the   scheme  by  falsely  representing  that          Synvion\s  stock  would  be  quoted   on  NASDAQ,  touting  false          representations  that  the  company\s  primary  assets  of  ETA10          supercomputers  had a value of $20 million,  misrepresenting  the          existence of contracts  between  Synvion and various corporations          when no such contracts existed and  misrepresenting  that Synvion          had a stock lease agreement with Prudential.  The complaint  also          asserts that the defendants mislead investors as to the status of          a  1996  North  Carolina  cease and desist order and that Neihart          used investor funds for personal items.  It further contends that          Neihart and Synvion sold 11 million shares of Synvion stock to 70          investors in six states since  July  1997,  and  that  since 1985          Neihart and Synvion (and its corporate predecessors) sold over 60          million  shares  of  unregistered  stock  to  approximately 1,500          investors in 36 states.                 The complaint seeks preliminary and permanent  injunctions          against  the  defendants  to  prevent  their future violations of          Sections  5(a),  5(c)  and 17(a) of the Securities  Act  of  1933          (Securities Act) and Sections 10(b) and 13(a) of the Securities          Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange  Act) and Rules 10b-5, 13a-1 and          13a-13  thereunder.   The complaint  also  seeks  an  accounting,          disgorgement and prejudgment interest from the two defendants, as          well as civil penalties from defendant Neihart."

LITIGATION RELEASE NO.   15988   /  November 30, 1998             SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION v. SHARP CAPITAL, INC.,             ET AL.  Civil Action No. 3-98-CV2792-G             SEC CHARGES INVESTMENT ADVISER WITH SECURITIES FRAUD             On November 25,1998, a Dallas-area registered investment             adviser and its president consented to a preliminary             injunction, asset freeze and the appointment of a             Special Master in a civil fraud action brought by the             Commission.  The adviser and its president lost as much             as $80 million of client funds in unauthorized, highly             leveraged investments in speculative securities,             including Russian debt instruments.             The Commission\s complaint names Sharp Capital, Inc.             (Sharp), an investment adviser registered with the             Commission, and its president, Mauricio Gutierrez             (Gutierrez) as defendants.  The Complaint also names             Emerging Markets Capital Advisors, Ltd. (EMCA), a             Bahamian  corporation, as a relief defendant.  The             Commission\s Complaint charges Sharp and Gutierrez with             violating the antifraud provisions of the federal             securities laws. In particular, the Complaint alleges             the following:                          \x07  Since April 1997, Sharp and Gutierrez                              raised $82 million from at least 130                             advisory clients in Mexico.                                  \x07  Sharp and Gutierrez promised to invest                             the funds of these clients only in                             conservative investments such as                            Eurobonds, Euro CDs and money markets,                             and misled clients by advising that                              specific instruments issued by well-                            known companies had been purchased for                             their accounts.  Sharp and Gutierrez                              also sent clients confirmations and                            monthly portfolio statements on Sharp                              letterhead which falsely reflected the                              purchases and sales of these instruments,                              together with interest earned in the                            account.                                      \x07  In reality, very little client money was                             so invested.  Instead, Sharp and Gutierrez                              pooled their funds in EMCA, an entity for                             which Sharp provided investment advisory                            services, and used these funds to make highly                             leveraged purchases of securities through the                             use of repurchase agreements with various                             broker-dealers.                                      \x07  EMCA\s portfolio was invested in volatile                             emerging markets, including Russia, Venezuela                              and Brazil. In August 1998, at least 75% of                             the fund was invested in Russian Ruble-denominated                             debt instruments, whose value plummeted when the                             Ruble collapsed in mid-August 1998. As a result,                             much of the money of Sharp\s clients was                            lost, and what remains is in illiquid investments.                  The  Complaint  charges  that   Sharp   and   Gutierrez             violated the antifraud provisions found in Section 17(a)  of             the  Securities  Act  of  1933  (Securities Act) and Section             10(b) of the Securities and Exchange  Act  of 1934, and Rule             10b-5 thereunder, as well as Section 206 of  the  Investment             Advisers  Act  of  1940,   based upon these same activities.             The Complaint seeks a permanent injunction against Sharp and             Gutierrez,  seeks  a  freeze  of   the   assets   of  ,  and             disgorgement from, Sharp and EMCA.  The complaint also seeks             an  accounting  by  Sharp,   civil penalties from Sharp  and             Gutierrez and the appointment  of  a  Special Master to take             possession of Sharp\s assets and EMCA\s portfolio.                  The   Commission   would   like   to  acknowledge   the             outstanding  assistance  of  the State Securities  Board  of             Texas,  who  worked  closely  with  the  Commission  in  its             investigation.  Their assistance  is  yet another example of             the effective coordination by the State Securities Board and             the Commission in their joint efforts to  police  securities             fraud."
15989,1998,,"b          UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION          LITIGATION RELEASE NO.  15989  /  December 1, 1998          SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION v. TWO-THIRDS INTERNATIONAL          INC., PETER J. ZACCAGNINO III, JOHN L. KLEIN a/k/a JOHN KLEIN          LOFFREDO, MERRILL H. KLEIN AND STERLING INTERNATIONAL BAHAMAS          LTD., No. 98-1324-Civ. ORL-18A (USDC M.D. Fla./Orlando Division)               The Commission announced today that it obtained a federal          court order prohibiting the fraudulent sale and valuation of          historical bonds, including bonds issued in the 19th century by          now defunct railroads and allegedly backed by gold.  According to          the Commission\s complaint, these bonds are worthless as          investments, having value only as historical memorabilia, but          have been offered and sold to investors at prices up to $330,000          each.  The emergency restraining order, issued December 1, by          Judge G. Kendall Sharp, prohibits Two-Thirds International, Inc.          (TTI) and its president, Peter J. Zaccagnino III, of Kissimee,          Florida, from offering and selling the bonds as investment          quality instruments.  The order also prohibits TTI and Zaccagnino          from fraudulently offering to place the bonds in a prime bank-          type trading program.  Additionally, the order prohibits Sterling          International Bahamas Ltd., and its officers, John L. Klein (J.          Klein) and Merrill H. Klein (M. Klein), both of Miami,          Florida, from preparing and disseminating fraudulent          authentication and valuation documents relating to the historical          bonds.   Judge Sharp\s order also freezes the assets of TTI,          Zaccagnino, J. Klein and Sterling and requires them to provide an          accounting of investor monies received.               The Commission\s complaint alleges that the defendants          violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws          from late 1997 through at least June 1998 in offering, selling,          authenticating and valuing the bonds.  Zaccagnino and TTI raised          approximately $4.8 million through the sale of virtually          worthless historical bonds to scores of investors.  According to          the complaint, Zaccagnino and TTI sold historical bonds at prices          ranging from $14,000 to $330,000 each, falsely representing that          the bonds were worth up to $908 million each.  The complaint          further alleged that Zaccagnino falsely claimed that he and TTI          could place the bonds in a fictitious prime bank-type trading          program, purportedly approved by the Federal Reserve Board, that          would generate exorbitant rates of return.  Judge Sharp\s order          also freezes the assets of two relief defendants, Best Systems,          Inc. and Wonder Glass Products, Inc., which received a total of          more than $1.5 million in investor proceeds from the fraud.               The complaint includes allegations that J. Klein, M. Klein,          and Sterling prepared and issued documents falsely authenticating          and valuing a variety of historical bonds, including bonds held          by, or for the benefit of, Zaccagnino\s investors.  These          valuations falsely represented that the historical railroad bonds          remained backed by gold and that the bonds were worth between          $492,000 and $10.8 billion each.  Also J. Klein and M. Klein          misrepresented their qualifications as appraisers as well as the          nature of the process used to authenticate the bonds prior to          valuation.  For their services, J. Klein, M. Klein and Sterling          were paid $1,500 per valuation and received a total of          approximately $400,000 between April and October 1998.               This is the fourth civil injunctive action filed by the          Commission\s Central Regional Office to halt the fraudulent sales          of historical bonds of United States railroads and other          entities.

Various law enforcement agencies worked closely with the          Commission in obtaining emergency relief in this matter.

SEC FILES CASE AGAINST COMPLIANCE OFFICER AND OTHERS             FOR INSIDER TRADING INVOLVING THE SECURITIES OF 13 COMPANIES                  The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a             complaint in the United States District Court for the             Southern District of New York against Marisa Baridis,             Jeffrey Streich, Keith Youngswick a/k/a Keith Young, and             Tina Eichenholz, all of whom reside in the New York area.             The Complaint alleges insider trading by the defendants in             advance of public announcements concerning the securities of             thirteen publicly traded companies.  According to the             Complaint, Baridis, a former employee in the compliance             departments of two Wall Street investment firms, Smith             Barney, Inc., and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co., had             access to material nonpublic information concerning the             firms clients, and she sold the information to Streich, a             former registered representative, and Mitchell Y. Sher (Sher             was the subject of an earlier enforcement action).  Streich,             in turn, tipped others, including Eichenholz and Youngswick.             The named defendants, except for Streich, have consented,             without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations,             to settlements of this matter.                  More specifically, the Complaint alleges that:                  *  Beginning in the summer of 1996, and continuing             until October 1997, Baridis gave tips to Streich with             respect to thirteen companies: Coram Healthcare, Inc.;             Pacific Rehabilitation & Sports Medicine, Inc.; Owen             Healthcare, Inc.; Health Images, Inc.; Capsure Holdings             Corp.; Starsight Telecast, Inc.; American Medical Response,             Inc.; OnTrak Systems, Inc.; Ocean Energy Inc.; Integon             Corp.; Reading & Bates Corp.; Rohr Inc.; and Georgia-Pacific             Corp.  The tips typically included information about             proposed acquisitions and other material events Baridis             learned of during the course of her employment, including             the name and/or stock symbol of the issuer whose securities             he should purchase, the corporate event, and the anticipated             public announcement date;                   * Based on those tips, Streich, directly or through             accounts he controlled, purchased securities of eleven             companies.  In his personal accounts, Streich realized             trading profits of $205,247, and in the accounts he             controlled, he realized profits of $183,981.  Of his illegal             profits, he gave Baridis about $20,000 to $25,000 in cash;                  * Streich also tipped at least ten persons, including             Eichenholz and Youngswick, a former registered             representative.   Streich passed on information to             Eichenholz that he received from Baridis concerning the             securities of nine companies, and he passed on information             to Youngswick that he received from Baridis concerning the             securities of eight companies.  Eichenholz tipped another             person, and Youngswick also tipped certain family members             and friends, who then purchased certain of the securities;                  *  Streich, Eichenholz and Youngswick, and each of             their direct and indirect tippees, realized total profits of             at least $1.55 million; and                  *  Streich also engaged in a free-riding scheme             pursuant to which he purchased stock without paying for it             and without enough cash to buy it on margin.                  Simultaneous with the filing of the Complaint,             defendants Baridis, Youngswick and Eichenholz, without             admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint,             consented to the entry of Final Judgments permanently             enjoining them from violating  Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of             the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder, and             ordering them to disgorge illegal trading profits of             $534,627, $340,796, and $299,556, respectively, plus             prejudgment interest.  Based on their demonstrated inability             to pay, disgorgement was waived.  As an additional part of             the settlement,  Baridis and Youngswick have consented to             the entry of a  Commission Order barring  them from             association with any broker, dealer, municipal securities             dealer, investment adviser or investment company.   The case             remains pending against Streich.                  In related criminal cases, Baridis earlier pleaded             guilty in United States District Court for the Southern             District of New York to two counts of conspiracy and             securities fraud, Eichenholz pleaded guilty in New York             State Supreme Court to state charges of insider trading, and             Youngswick pleaded guilty in New York State Supreme Court to             criminal possession of stolen property.  Streich pleaded             guilty in New York State Supreme Court to unrelated charges.             The four defendants are awaiting sentencing.                  The Commission acknowledges the assistance provided by             the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, the             District Attorney for New York County, the New York Stock             Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, and the Pacific             Exchange, Inc.

LITIG., No. 98-3404 (AJL) (D.N.J.)          On December 4, 1998, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed an     amicus curiae (or friend of the court) brief in the United States District     Court for the District of New Jersey in In re Milestone Scientific     Securities Litigation.  The brief, which was filed in response to a request     by the court for the Commissions views, addresses the issue whether, and     under what circumstances, it is appropriate to approve the appointment of     multiple lead counsel under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of     1995.  The brief is available on the Commissions Web site (www.sec.gov).          The Commission takes the position that courts generally should defer     to lead plaintiffs choice of counsel and that except in very unusual     circumstances, courts should not force a lead plaintiff to retain counsel     it has not selected itself.  The Commission believes, however, that     particular problems may arise from multiple counsel arrangements, and     accordingly that the courts should actively exercise their discretion to     review proposals for such arrangements.  Although appointment of multiple     counsel may be appropriate in circumstances where a single firm lacks the     resources or expertise to manage the litigation, appointment of multiple     counsel can raise significant concerns.  These include impairment of the     lead plaintiffs ability to manage the litigation and supervise counsel     effectively, duplication of effort, lack of coordination among counsel,     delay of the litigation, and increase in attorneys fees.  The presumptive     lead plaintiff should provide the court with full information about the     structure and intended functioning of the proposed counsel group and                              ======END OF PAGE 1======\x0c     efforts it has made to avoid the potential problems with multiple counsel.          The Commission argues that multiple counsel may be justified where the     firms provide resources, skill, experience, or expertise that are necessary     to manage the litigation effectively for the class.  But the court should     not rely on, or give weight to, generic asserted benefits of assuring input     from more rather than fewer class members or lawyers or avoiding disputes     among competing lead plaintiff movants and among their counsel.     The Commission also argues that another important consideration in     evaluating the proposal is the possibility of a conflict of interest     involving one or more of the chosen counsel.  If the circumstances justify     particular confidence in the lead plaintiffs independence and ability to     make choices, then deference to those choices would be appropriate.  Where,     however, it appears that the prospective lead plaintiff has not played an     active, effective role in choosing counsel or that the relationship between     the plaintiff and one or more of its chosen law firms is based on factors     other than the merits of the firms, then greater scrutiny is warranted.     Finally, the Commission argues that the court should place appropriate     conditions on the appointment of multiple counsel and indicate a     willingness to revisit the issue.                              ======END OF PAGE 2======\x0c"
15992,1998,,"b                  UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION          Litigation Release No.  15992 / December  4, 1998          SEC v. Jason S. Wall, 97 Civ. 6526 (JSR) (S.D.N.Y.)               The Commission announced today that Jason S. Wall has          consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining          him from committing securities fraud.  The final judgment has          been submitted for approval to the United States District Court          for the Southern District of New York.               The action was commenced on September 4, 1997, when the          Commission filed a Complaint alleging that Wall had obtained over          $200,000 from a then ongoing fraudulent offering of bogus          securities.  According to the Complaint, Wall -- who held himself          out to investors as a securities broker with Rothschild Global          Investments, Inc. -- offered and sold supposed private          placements in well-known companies and promised investors a          return of twenty-five to thirty-five percent in eight weeks.  The          Complaint alleged that Wall was not employed by Rothschild during          the relevant period, never had access to the so-called private          placements and, in fact, never invested the money as he          represented he would do.  The Commission charged Wall with          violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and          Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule          10b-5 thereunder.  Wall consented to the entry of the final          judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the          Complaint.               In connection with the conduct charged in the Commission\s          Complaint, Wall also was convicted of one criminal count of          securities fraud on May 19, 1998.  He was ordered to pay          restitution in the amount of $425,154, and is currently serving a          thirty-month prison sentence at the Allenwood Federal Prison Camp          in Montgomery, Pennsylvania.

15993,1998,,"b                   UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION       Litigation Release No.   15993 / December 4, 1998       SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION v. THE BROWNSTONE GROUP, et       al., U.S.D.C., S.D.N.Y.           The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission)       announced that it filed a complaint on December 3, 1998, in       the United States District Court, Southern District of New       York, against The Brownstone Group a/k/a Brownstone       Holdings, Inc., (Brownstone Holdings), Brownstone Capital       Corp.(Brownstone Capital), Blackstone Entertainment Group       and Gregory G. Cooper (Cooper).  In its Complaint the       Commission alleges, among other things, that defendants are       engaging in fraudulent sales of Brownstone Holdings and       engaged in fraudulent sales of Blackstone Entertainment       stock, and are misusing the proceeds of those sales for       personal expenses and other improper purposes, including for       payments to and on behalf of Selene Alverio and Blackstone       Unisex, the relief defendants.           The Commission in its application asks the court to       temporarily and preliminarily enjoin the defendants from       committing the violations alleged in the Complaint, freeze       the defendants\ and the relief defendants\ assets, direct       each of the defendants and relief defendants to provide an       accounting, appoint a temporary receiver for the corporate       defendants, permit expedited discovery and prohibit the       destruction of documents.           The defendants named in the Complaint filed today in the       United States District Court for the Southern District of       New York, are:       Brownstone Group a/k/a Brownstone Holdings, Inc., a Nevada       corporation headquartered in New York City;       Brownstone Capital Corp., an Illinois corporation       headquartered in New York City which has been registered       with the Commission as a broker-dealer pursuant to Section       15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange       Act), since 1983;       Blackstone Entertainment Group, a Delaware corporation; and       Gregory G. Cooper, 31 years old, who lives in Yonkers, New       York and is the Chairman of each of the three Defendant       companies.           Named as relief defendants are:       Blackstone Unisex, a beauty salon in Bronx, New York that is       a d/b/a name registered to Cooper; and       Selene Alverio, Cooper\s purported live-in girlfriend.           The Complaint and the Commission\s other filings in       support of the emergency relief allege as follows:       Brownstone Capital and Cooper are currently engaging in a       fraudulent solicitation of investors by selling them shares       in a purported private placement offering for Brownstone       Holdings.  Earlier private placement solicitations, for       Brownstone Holdings and for Blackstone Entertainment,       commencing in March and October 1997, respectively, were       fraudulent as well.           In each offering, a material portion of the proceeds of       the solicitations have not been used as represented in the       private placement memoranda.  Instead of using the proceeds       raised from the three private placement offerings to develop       the businesses of Brownstone Capital and Blackstone       Entertainment, a substantial portion of the proceeds raised       have been used to fund other of Cooper\s businesses or his       personal living expenses.  Some of these proceeds were paid       on behalf of Blackstone Unisex, a hair salon controlled by       Cooper, and to and on behalf of Selene Alverio, his       girlfriend.  Based upon a review of the bank records, it       appears that approximately $195,000 of the proceeds were       used to pay personal expenses, there were an additional       approximately $150,000 in automatic teller machine       withdrawals or debit card purchases, and approximately       $55,000 was paid on behalf of Blackstone Unisex.  Cooper       directed registered representatives at Brownstone Capital to       solicit investors to purchase Brownstone Holdings and       Blackstone Entertainment stock.  Certain of these registered       representatives told investors that the stock of the       companies being sold through the private placements would       soon go public and would double or triple in value in a       short period of time when they knew or were reckless in not       knowing that these representations were untrue.           In addition to the interim relief requested, the       Complaint seeks a permanent injunction against defendants       from violating the antifraud provisions in Sections 17(a) of       the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section       10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; against       Brownstone Holdings and Brownstone Capital from violating       the registration provisions of Section 5(a) and 5(c) of the       Securities Act; and against Brownstone Capital, along with       Cooper and Brownstone Holdings as control persons, from       violating the antifraud and books and records provisions       applicable to broker-dealers, Sections 15(c), 17(a) and       17(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 10b-3, 15c1-2, 15c1-5       and 17a-4(j) thereunder.  The Complaint also seeks to bar       Gregory Cooper from acting as an officer or director of any       issuer that has a class of securities registered under       Section 12 of the Exchange Act.  Finally, the Complaint       seeks a final judgment ordering defendants and relief       defendants to disgorge their ill-gotten gains, together with       all prejudgment interest, and ordering defendants to pay       civil money penalties.           The litigation is pending."

The final judgment also sets          disgorgement of Pirbazari\s ill-gotten gains, plus prejudgment          interest, at $6,194.62 and imposes a civil penalty of $5,125.00.               The Commission\s complaint, filed on November 16, 1998,          alleges that Hahn Truong used confidential corporate information          in selling shares in his then-employer, Molecular Dynamics, Inc.          (Molecular), and tipped his brothers Hieu Truong (Hieu) and          Hen Truong, and his friend Christopher Nguyen, each of whom sold          all of his Molecular shares and sold short additional Molecular          shares.  The Commission\s complaint further alleges that Hieu in          turn tipped his sister-in-law, Nina Vinh (Nina), who sold all          of her Molecular shares, sold short additional Molecular shares          and tipped her sister and her friend, Pirbazari, each of whom          sold all of her/his Molecular shares.  The defendants and Nina\s          sister avoided losses totaling $294,151 and made short selling          profits of $134,985.               The final judgment enjoins Pirbazari from future violations          of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b)          of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and          Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Pirbazari consented to the entry of the          final judgment without admitting or denying the Commission\s          allegations.                    "

Hunt of the United States  District  Court  for  the  Northern          District  of  Georgia  entered an order against Ronnie R. Neihart          (Neihart)  and Synvion  Corporation  (Synvion)  preliminarily          enjoining them  from further violations of the federal securities          laws.  The  Commission\s   complaint  which  sought  a  temporary          restraining  order  and  other   emergency  relief  alleged  that          defendants Neihart and Synvion engaged  in fraud in the offer and          sale  of unregistered securities in the form  of  Synvion  common          stock  using   misrepresentations   and   omissions  of  fact  to          investors.                 The Commission\s complaint alleges,  and  the Court found,          that   Neihart   and  Synvion  effected  the  scheme  by  falsely          representing that  Synvion\s  stock  would  be  quoted on NASDAQ,          touting false representations that the company\s  primary  assets          of   ETA10   supercomputers   had   a   value   of  $20  million,          misrepresenting  the existence of contracts between  Synvion  and          various  corporations   when   no   such  contracts  existed  and          misrepresenting  that Synvion had a stock  lease  agreement  with          Prudential.  The complaint  also  asserts,  and  the Court found,          that the defendants mislead investors as to the status  of a 1996          North  Carolina  cease  and  desist  order  and that Neihart used          investor  funds for personal items.  The Court  also  found  that          Neihart and Synvion sold 11 million shares of Synvion stock to 70          investors in  six  states  since  July  1997, and that since 1985          Neihart and Synvion (and its corporate predecessors) sold over 60          million  shares  of  unregistered  stock  to approximately  1,500          investors in 36 states.                 The  complaint  seeks  permanent injunctions  against  the          defendants to prevent their future  violations  of Sections 5(a),          5(c)  and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities  Act)          and Sections  10(b)  and  13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of          1934  (Exchange  Act)  and  Rules   10b-5,   13a-1  and  13a-13          thereunder.

(World Syndicators).          The settlements were reached in connection with two related          actions filed by the Commission.  The Commission filed the first          complaint on December 22, 1997, charging Davis, a Las Vegas,          Nevada based penny stock promoter, and World Syndicators, an          entity through which Davis conducted his business, with          manipulating the market for the securities of three separate          microcap companies: Systems of Excellence, Inc. (SOE); Combined          Companies International Corp. (CCIC); and Bio-Tech Industries,          Inc. (Bio-Tech) (formerly Twenty First Century Health, Inc.).          SEC v. Davis, et al.  The Commission filed the second complaint          on September 24, 1998, charging, among others, Loretta Davis, the          former president of Bio-Tech, with manipulating the market for          the securities of Bio-Tech.  SEC v. Bio-Tech, et al.               Davis consented to the entry of a permanent injunction          prohibiting him from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of          the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Sections 10(b),          13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 13(b)(5) of the Securities          Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20,          13a-1, 13a-13, and 13b2-1 thereunder.  World Syndicators          consented to the entry of a permanent injunction prohibiting it          from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities          Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.          Loretta Davis consented to the entry of a permanent injunction          prohibiting her from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities          Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.          Each of the settling defendants settled without admitting or          denying the allegations in the Commission\s complaints.               As part of the settlements, Davis and Loretta Davis also          consented to orders permanently barring each from acting as an          officer or director of a public company.  In addition, the          settlements require that Davis disgorge $1,540,599, that World          Syndicators disgorge $878,027 jointly and severally with Davis,          and that Loretta Davis disgorge $662,572 jointly and severally          with Davis.  These amounts represent the total illegal profits          derived from the conduct alleged in the complaints.  The          settlements further provide that except for surrendering certain          assets to the Court-appointed Receiver, payment of the          disgorgement amounts by the settling defendants is waived in          light of their demonstrated inability to pay based on the sworn          representations in their statements of financial condition.          Davis also agreed to the surrender, into a criminal forfeiture          suspense account, of approximately $143,000 is cash that was          frozen in a related SEC action, and the proceeds of a residence          that he is obligated to sell.  The settlements also require that          Davis, World Syndicators, and Loretta Davis cooperate with the          Commission and the Court-appointed Receiver to, among other          things, effect the surrender of all the proceeds of the frauds          that are held by any other person.  As an additional part of the          settlement, Davis consented to the entry of a Commission Order          barring him from participating in the offering of penny stock.               As previously announced, on December 22, 1997, Davis pled          guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and          bank fraud, and one count of money laundering, in the United          States District Court for the District of Nevada.  Davis\ plea          was in connection with, among other things, a securities fraud          scheme involving the manipulation of CCIC.  See Lit. Rel. 15600          (December 22, 1997).  Davis is currently awaiting sentencing.               The Commission previously has made several announcements          concerning these matters.  See Lit. Rel 15900 (September 24,          1998); Lit. Rel. 15600 (December 22, 1997); Lit. Rel. 15571          (November 25, 1997); (Lit. Rel. 15490 (September 12, 1997); Lit.

Md., Greebelt          Div.) (filed          December 9, 1998)          SEC Files Complaint Against Former Director And His Uncle For          Insider Trading Prior To Bank Merger; Settles With Defendants For          $23,632               On December 9, 1998, the Commission filed a civil complaint          in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland          alleging that Dudley Dworken, a former director of Allegiance          Banc Corporation (Allegiance), tipped his uncle, Myron Dworken,          who traded in Allegiance and Myron then tipped his wife who also          traded in Allegiance, prior to the company\s April 22, 1996          public announcement that it had entered into a definitive          agreement for F&M National Corporation (F&M) to acquire          Allegiance through a stock swap.               The Commission\s complaint alleges that on April 16, 1996,          six days before the public announcement, Dudley Dworken, an          Allegiance director who had been apprised of the confidential          merger negotiations, engaged in a nineteen-minute telephone          conversation with his uncle, Myron Dworken.  During that          telephone call, Myron asked Dudley whether Allegiance was an          acquisition target, and Dudley provided Myron with material,          nonpublic information concerning the merger in breach of Dudley\s          fiduciary duty to Allegiance.  Within minutes of concluding that          call, Myron telephoned his brokers and purchased 1500 shares of          Allegiance common stock in two brokerage accounts, 1,000 shares          of which he sold one year later.  As a result of his purchases,          Myron Dworken earned $4,312 in profits.               The Commission\s complaint further alleges that immediately          after Myron and Dudley\s nineteen-minute telephone call, Myron          also telephoned his wife.  During the call, Myron shared with his          wife the material, nonpublic information acquired from Dudley,          and recommended that she purchase Allegiance stock.  The next          day, April 17, 1996, Myron\s wife purchased 1000 shares of          Allegiance common stock, which she still holds.  As a result of          her purchase, Myron\s wife earned $3,000 in profits.               The Commission\s complaint seeks a permanent injunction          against Dudley and Myron Dworken for violations of the antifraud          provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange          Act), disgorgement of illicit profits, and civil penalties          pursuant to the Insider Trading Sanctions Act, Section 21A of the          Exchange Act (ITSA).  Simultaneously with the filing of the          Commission\s complaint, Dudley Dworken consented, without          admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, to the          entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from          violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5          thereunder, and ordering him to pay a $7,312 ITSA penalty          (representing a penalty on the illicit profits of Myron Dworken          and Myron\s wife).  Also simultaneously with the filing of the          Commission\s complaint, Myron Dworken consented, without          admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, to the          entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from          violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5          thereunder, and ordering him to pay $16,320, which comprises          $7,312 in disgorgement of his and his wife\s illicit profits,          $1,696 in prejudment interest thereon, and a $7,312 ITSA penalty.

Tauber, Docket             No. 2:98CV-0884B (U.S.D.C., D.Ut.)                  The Securities and Exchange Commission announced the             filing of a Complaint in the United States District Court             for the District of Utah, on December 11, 1998, seeking a             temporary restraining order, an asset freeze and other             relief against WARPnet Holdings, LLC and Kevin A. Tauber             based on allegations that WARPnet, ostensibly a provider of             advance Internet technology, and Tauber sold interests in             WARPnet by falsely claiming the company had agreements to             provide Internet services for the Church of Jesus Christ of             Latter-day Saints, the Salt Lake Organizing Committee for             the Olympic Winter Games of 2002, the Western Governors             University and the Rolling Stones rock band.  The complaint             also alleges Tauber told investors he was a personal friend             of Michael O. Leavitt, Governor of Utah, and Gordon B.             Hinkley, President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-             day Saints; neither Governor Leavitt nor President Hinkley             recalls having heard of Tauber.                  The Complaint alleges that since the summer of 1998,             WARPnet, a Missouri limited liability company, and Tauber,             originally a resident of Columbia, Missouri, but currently             living in a Salt Lake City hotel, have sold units in WARPnet             to investors in Utah and California by telling potential             investors that they would receive a percentage of the             profits to be realized by WARPnet from its services             contracts with the above-mentioned and other entities and             that WARPnet would repurchase any interests after one year             at a profit to the investor of $2 per unit.                  It is alleged that by engaging in such conduct WARPnet             and Tauber have violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act             of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Act of 1934 and             Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

16000,1998,,"b          UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION          LITIGATION RELEASE NO.  16000 /  December 14, 1998          SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION v. TWO-THIRDS INTERNATIONAL          INC., PETER J. ZACCAGNINO III, JOHN L. KLEIN a/k/a JOHN KLEIN          LOFFREDO, MERRILL H. KLEIN AND STERLING INTERNATIONAL BAHAMAS          LTD., No. 98-1324-Civ. ORL-18A (USDC M.D. Fla./Orlando Division)               The Commission announced today that the U.S. District Court          for the Middle District of Clorida issued a preliminary          injunction in a pending action involving the fraudulent sale and          valuation of historical bonds, including bonds issued in the 19th          century by now defunct railroads and allegedly backed by gold.          Following a hearing, Judge G. Kendall Sharp entered the          preliminary injunction, including an asset freeze, on December          14, 1998 against Two-Thirds International, Inc. (TTI) and its          president, Peter J. Zaccagnino III, of Kissimee, Florida, and          Sterling International Bahamas Ltd. (Sterling), and its          officers, John L. Klein (J. Klein) and Merrill H. Klein (M.          Klein) of Miami, Florida.  The order, which continues the          Court\s temporary restraining order entered on December 1, 1998,          prohibits TTI and Zaccagnino from offering and selling the bonds          as investment quality instruments or offering to place the bonds          in  prime bank-type trading programs.  Additionally, the order          prohibits J. Klein, M. Klein  and Sterling from preparing and          disseminating fraudulent authentication and valuation documents          relating to the historical bonds.               The order entered by Judge Sharp contains preliminary          findings, including that  Zaccagnino and TTI represented to          investors that the historical bonds at issue had value as          investments and could be placed in  prime bank-type trading          programs, purportedly approved by the Federal Reserve Board, that          would generate exorbitant rates of return.  The order also found          that M. Klein, J. Klein and Sterling issued valuations stating          that individual historical bonds were worth between $492,000 and          $10.8 billion.   The order also found that, in fact, the bonds          had value only as historical memorabilia and the prime bank          trading programs touted by Zaccagnino and TTI were fictitious.          The Court concluded that the Commission established a prima facie          case that TTI, Zaccagnino, J. Klein, M. Klein and Sterling,          through their false and misleading statements, violated Section          10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5          thereunder and/or Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.               The Commission\s complaint alleged that Zaccagnino and TTI          raised approximately $4.8 million through the sale of  the  bonds          to scores of investor at prices up to $330,000 each, and that          Zaccagnino and TTI falsely represented that the bonds were worth          up to $908 million each.  The complaint included allegations that          J. Klein and M. Klein misrepresented their qualifications as          appraisers as well as the nature of the process used to          authenticate the bonds prior to valuation, and that, for their          services, J. Klein, M. Klein and Sterling were paid $1,500 per          valuation and received a total of approximately $400,000 between          April and October 1998.               In the preliminary injunction, Judge Sharp continued the          asset freeze and other provisions of the previously issued          temporary restraining order as to the two named relief          defendants, Best Systems, Inc. and Wonder Glass Products, Inc.          The Commission\s complaint alleged that the two entities received          a total of more than $1.5 million in investor proceeds from the          fraud.               This is the fourth civil injunctive action filed by the          Commission\s Central Regional Office to halt the fraudulent sales          of historical bonds of United States railroads and other          entities.

Ahlstrom, U.S.          District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Civil Action          No. 98-1775-A               The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced the          filing of a settled complaint for insider trading in the          securities of BDM International, Inc. against Rex G. Ahlstrom of          Reston, Virginia.  BDM was a defense and information technology          company, headquartered in McLean, Virginia.  The complaint, filed          with the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of          Virginia, alleges that Ahlstrom purchased BDM stock after          learning indirectly of confidential information relating to a          tender offer for BDM from his neighbor, a senior executive at          BDM.  Ahlstroms trading resulted in illicit profits of $16,315          and violated Section 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934          and Rule 14e-3 thereunder.               According to the complaint, in November 1997, the wife of          the senior BDM executive telephoned Ahlstroms wife and requested          child care assistance because she was ill.  In this conversation,          the senior BDM executives wife disclosed to Ahlstroms wife that          the senior BDM executive could not assist with child care because          BDM was being sold.  Ahlstroms wife relayed this information to          Ahlstrom and, after confirming on the Internet that the          information was not yet public, Ahlstrom purchased 2,000 shares          of BDM stock.  At that time, Ahlstrom knew that his neighbor was          responsible for merger and acquisition activity at BDM.  After          the November 21, 1997, announcement by BDM that it had agreed to          be acquired in a tender offer by TRW, Inc., Ahlstrom sold his BDM          shares for a profit of $16,315.               Prior to the filing of the action, Ahlstrom consented,          without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, to          entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from          violations of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14e-3          thereunder, and ordering Ahlstrom to pay disgorgement of $16,315,          prejudgment interest of $1,171, and a penalty of $16,315 under          the Insider Trading and Securities Fraud Enforcement Act, for a          total payment of $33,801.               The Commission wishes to acknowledge the cooperation of          NASD Regulation, Inc. in this matter.  The Commissions          investigation into trading of BDM securities is continuing."

The Court also ordered Cleveland to pay restitution in the amount of           $2,510,001.                The  criminal charge against Cleveland was based on the same           activities alleged in a civil action filed by the Commission in United           States District Court, Houston, Texas, on May 22, 1996. The           Commissions complaint alleges that Cleveland, individually, and doing           business as Central Texas Securities, took in at least $4.8 million           from his customers to purchase municipal securities at below market           prices, but never purchased the bonds for the investors. In fact, the           complaint alleges, Cleveland used funds received from new investors to           pay off previous customers, and used falsified confirmations and           account statements to conceal his misuse and misappropriation of           customers funds. The Court entered a preliminary injunction against           Cleveland on June 17, 1996."

The Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday filed             an enforcement action in the Eastern District of Missouri             charging eight individuals with perpetrating a financial             fraud at Oliver Transportation, Inc. (OTI), a now defunct             trucking company formerly headquartered in Mexico, Missouri.                  The complaint alleges that:  From the time OTI went             public in 1993 until it ceased operations in August 1995,             OTI\s senior management and other employees unlawfully             inflated OTI\s financial results by fabricating phony             customer orders, and in turn accounts receivable, for             trucking services.  As a result of the recording of phony             receivables, OTI\s financial statements and other             disclosures in its June 1993 registration statement and             subsequent periodic reports filed with the Commission             contained materially false and misleading information.  By             the time the fraud was uncovered in August 1995, nearly half             of OTI\s reported receivables were based on phony customer             orders.                  As to the roles played by each of the defendants, the             complaint alleges, among other things, that:                  \x07    John F. Pete Oliver (OTI\s founder and chairman)                       devised and initiated the fraud to obtain funds                       under a bank loan secured by the company\s                       accounts receivable.  In addition, Oliver sold                       32,000 shares of OTI common stock, receiving                       proceeds of In total, Oliver sold 32,000 OTI                       shares for $129,869, and Meador$129,869, when he                       knew that OTI\s financial statements and periodic                       reports contained materially false and misleading                       information.                  \x07    Willard A. Tony Meador (OTI\s president until                       October 1994) directed the entry of the phony                       customer orders into OTI\s books and records.                       While aware that OTI\s financial statements and                       other disclosures were materially false and                       misleading, Meador also sold 100,500 OTI shares,                       receiving proceeds of $288,637.                  \x07    Wayne M.

Roberts                       (controller), both certified public accountants,                       knowingly reported the phony accounts receivable                       in OTI\s financial statements included in periodic                       filings with the Commission.                  In addition to civil money penalties, the complaint             seeks to permanently enjoin the defendants from violating             the antifraud, books and records, and internal accounting             control provisions of the federal securities laws.  The             Commission also requested that the court order Oliver and             Meador to disgorge their ill-gotten gains from their insider             trading and permanently bar each from serving as an officer             or director of any public company.                  Simultaneously with the filing of the complaint,             without admitting or denying the complaint\s allegations,             Oliver, Sampson, Gehringer, Roberts, and Gross each agreed             to settle the charges against them by consenting to final             judgments.  The final judgments against Oliver and Sampson             prohibit each from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities             Act of 1933, and Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the             Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, and             13b2-2 thereunder.  The judgment against Oliver also bars             him from serving as an officer or director of a public             company under Section 21(d)(2) of the Exchange Act.  The             judgment against Gehringer prohibits him from violating             Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Sections 10(b) and             13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1             thereunder.  Gross and Roberts consented to judgments             enjoining them from violating Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of             the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2             thereunder.  As part of their settlements, Gross and Roberts             have agreed to the entry of Commission orders barring each             from appearing or practicing before the Commission as             accountants.                  The Commission agreed not to seek imposition of civil             money penalties against the settling defendants based on             their demonstrated inability to pay.  For the same reason,             the Commission also agreed to waive the payment of             disgorgement by Oliver.                  The charges filed against Meador, McNabb-Meador, and             Jacobi are pending before the court.             "

SCOTT ALEXANDER          GRYSKIEWICZ, a/k/a SCOTT ALEXANDER and d/b/a PRIVATE AUTO          PLACEMENT, and AMERICAN SECURITIES INC. 98 Civ. 7688          (E.D.N.Y.)(NG)                The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission)          announced that it filed a complaint on December 15, 1998, in the          United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York          charging an unregistered broker with fraudulently offering and          selling unregistered securities. To stop the ongoing violations,          the Commission applied for emergency relief, including a          temporary restraining order against future violations, and an          order freezing the assets of the defendant and a company that he          controls that has been named as a relief defendant.  Without          admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint: (1) the          defendant consented to the entry of an order preliminarily          enjoining the defendant from violating the antifraud and broker          registration provisions; and (2) the defendant and the relief          defendant consented to a temporary freeze of their assets, which          will continue until such time as the Court schedules and holds a          hearing in approximately 30 days to determine whether the asset          freezes should remain in place throughout this action.          Named in the Complaint as a defendant is:               Scott Alexander Gryskiewicz, 27 years old, who resides in               Nutley, New Jersey. Gryskiewicz also has the d.b.a. name of               Private Auto Placement.          Named in the Complaint as a relief defendant is:               American Securities, Inc. (American (NJ)), a New Jersey               corporation that was incorporated by Gryskiewicz on or about               May 28, 1998.  American (NJ)\s principal office is in Lodi,               New Jersey (Lodi Office).  Gryskiewicz controls American               (NJ).          The Complaint alleges that:               Since approximately May 1998, Gryskiewicz has been               unlawfully acting as an unregistered broker, directly and               through the Lodi Office.  Through boiler room sales               practices, including cold-calling and false promises of               quick profits, Gryskiewicz and others in the Lodi Office               have raised more than $500,000 from approximately 71               investors who purchased unregistered securities issued by               Pan American Securities, Inc. (Pan American).  Gryskiewicz               and others under his supervision in the Lodi Office have               defrauded Pan American investors by making one or more of               the following materially false claims:  a) Pan American was               about to make an initial public offering (IPO);  b) the               offered Pan American securities are freely tradable, when in               fact they are restricted; and c) the offered Pan American               securities could be sold for a substantial profit after the               purported IPO.               Gryskiewicz and others in the Lodi Office have recently               embarked on another fraudulent offering of unregistered               securities issued by a purported company named               Freetrade.com, Inc. (Freetrade).  Among other things,               Gryskiewicz is disseminating a private placement memorandum               (Freetrade PPM) that falsely represents that the offered               Freetrade securities are immediately tradable, when in               fact, they are restricted.          By engaging in the foregoing conduct, Gryskiewicz allegedly has          been violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and          Sections 10(b), 15(a)(1) and 15(c)(1) of the Securities Exchange          Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-3, 10b-5 and 15c1-2.  The Complaint          seeks: (i) preliminary and permanent injunctions against          Gryskiewicz; (ii) civil penalties against Gryskiewicz; (iii)          disgorgement of ill-gotten gains by Gryskiewicz and American          (NJ); (iv) asset freezes against Gryskiewicz and American (NJ);          (v) accountings by both Gryskiewicz and American (NJ) to quantify          ill-gotten gains received by each; and (vi) other equitable          relief.

On December 11, 1998,             Judge Kimball had issued a temporary restraining order and             an asset freeze against the defendants.                  The Commissions Complaint had alleged that WARPnet,             ostensibly a provider of advanced Internet technology, and             Tauber sold interests in WARPnet by falsely claiming the             company had agreements to provide Internet services for the             Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the Salt Lake             Organizing Committee for the Olympic Winter Games of 2002,             the Western Governors University, the Rolling Stones rock             band and singer Garth Brooks.  The Complaint also alleges             Tauber told investors he was a personal friend of Michael O.             Leavitt, Governor of Utah, and Gordon B. Hinckley, President             of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.                  The Complaint alleges that since the summer of 1998,             WARPnet, a Missouri limited liability company, and Tauber             have sold units in WARPnet by telling potential investors             that they would receive a percentage of the profits to be             realized by WARPnet from its services contracts with the             above-mentioned and other entities and that WARPnet would             repurchase any interests after one year at a profit to the             investor of $2 per unit.  It is alleged that by engaging in             such conduct WARPnet and Tauber have violated Section 17(a)             of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the             Securities Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder."

FOR FINANCIAL FRAUD INVOLVINGEARNINGS MANIPULATIONSecurities and Exchange Commission v. W.R. Grace & Co., CivilAction No. 98-8942 CIV Hurley  (S.D. Florida, filed December 22,1998)   The Securities and Exchange Commission today sued W.R. Grace& Co. for financial fraud, including manipulation of its reportedquarterly and annual earnings.  The complaint, filed in federalcourt in Florida\x92s Southern District, seeks an injunction andcivil penalties.   The Complaint alleges that W.R. Grace & Co. (Grace), basedin Boca Raton, Florida, violated the antifraud, reporting, andbooks and records provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of1934.  All of the allegations in the Complaint arise out ofevents that occurred while Grace owned National Medical Care,Inc. (NMC) which was located in Waltham, Massachusetts.   The Complaint alleges that Grace, through members of seniormanagement of Grace and NMC, falsely reported results ofoperations for Grace and its Health Care Group segment for fiscalyears 1991 through 1995.  The Complaint further alleges that,from 1991 through 1995, Grace deferred reporting income earned byNMC, the primary component of the Health Care Group, primarily tosmooth the earnings of the Health Care Group.  According to theComplaint, Grace deferred reporting income by increasing orestablishing reserves not in conformity with generally acceptedaccounting principles.  The Complaint further alleges that Graceused the reserves to manipulate its reported quarterly and annualearnings of the Health Care Group and of Grace.      The Complaint alleges that these excess reserves wereprimarily used for profit planning purposes, i.e., to bring theHealth Care Group\x92s quarterly reported results of operations inline with Grace\x92s targets.  The Complaint further alleges thatGrace also released some of the excess reserves to increaseGrace\x92s earnings per share.  According to the Complaint, whenGrace reversed the excess reserves from its reported financialstatements in the fourth quarter of 1995, it improperly nettedthe excess reserves with other charges and adjustments andmisleadingly described the reversal as a change in accountingestimate.   The  SEC\x92s  complaint  further alleges that for fiscal years1991  through 1995, Grace filed  false  and  misleading  periodicreports  with  the  SEC  that  incorporated  the  effects  of itsdeferred  reporting  of  NMC  income.   In  addition,  the  SEC\x92scomplaint  alleges  that  Grace disseminated false and misleadingstatements  to  the investing  public  in  the  course  of  pressreleases and discussions  with  analysts  that  incorporated  theeffects  of  its  deferred  reporting  of  NMC income.  The SEC\x92scomplaint  alleges  that  Grace,  through its senior  management,failed  to  disclose  to  the  investing   public   that  it  wasmanipulating its earnings.   In  1997,  the SEC ordered that Grace cease and desist  fromcommitting or causing any violations and any future violations ofSections 13(a) and  14(a)  of  the  Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1,14a-3, and 14a-9 thereunder.   The  SEC\x92s complaint charges that  Grace  violated  Sections10(b), 13(a),  and  13(b)(2) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5,12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder."

In an earlier Order of October 27, 1998, Judge Downesdirected that computer equipment seized from the defendants bedonated to the Pasadena, California Unified School District withthe condition that the property be used in schools within thedistrict. The October 27, 1998, Order also provided that variousmiscellaneous property seized from the defendants be given to theSalvation Army in Pasadena, California.   Judge Downes distributed the equipment and cash as set forthabove after finding that because there were approximately twothousand defrauded investors in this matter, it was not practicalto attempt to make any distribution to individual investors.   On August 14, 1998 Judge Downes entered an order requiringthe defendants First Zurich National USA, LLC (First Zurich),Compunomics  139, Inc. ( Compunomics ), and Douglas PaulCatchings (Catchings) to jointly and severally disgorge$4,370,425 plus prejudgment and postjudgment interest to bedetermined later. The Order also requires defendant Cathings topay a civil penalty of $100,000. To date the Commission has notlocated sufficient funds or property to make any distribution toinvestors.   Previously Judge Downes had entered temporary restrainingorders, permanent injunctions, an asset freeze, and appointed aSpecial Officer to take possession of the property of thedefendants. Judge Downes has also issued a warrant for the arrestof defendant Catchings based on the Court\s finding him to be incontempt of various orders. That arrest warrant remains in effectand Catchings has not as of this date been located.   The Commission alleged that First Zurich, a Wyoming limitedliability company and  Compunomics, a Belizean corporation basedin Pasadena, California and the corporate parent of First Zurich,and Douglas Paul Catchings, controlling person of Compunomics andFirst Zurich fraudulently raised more than $4 million fromapproximately 2,000 investors through the sale of stock inCompunomics and First Zurich. Defendants had falsely claimed thatthey were operating a bank, when, the Commission has alleged, nobank in fact existed. This was an affinity fraud largelytargeting African-Americans.

16012,1998,,"b                          SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION                                BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS          LITIGATION RELEASE NO. 16012 / December 30, 1998          SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION V. TODD J. LOSCOLA, CPI          INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, INC. AND CPA ADVISORS NETWORK, INC (United          States District Court for the District of Rhode Island, Civil          Action 98-610L (December 29, 1998)               The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on          December 29, 1998, Judge Ernest Torres of the federal district          court in Rhode Island ordered emergency relief against Todd          LaScola, CPI Investment Management, Inc. (CPI) an investment          adviser, and CPA Network Advisors, Inc. (CPA) a brokerage firm,          for engaging in a series of unauthorized transactions exposing          both advisory clients and brokerage customers to large losses and          for engaging in misappropriation of advisory client funds.          LaScola, a resident of Warwick, Rhode Island is a principal and a          co-owner of CPA and is the sole owner of CPI. The Complaint          alleges that, through CPA and CPI, LaScola has defrauded dozens          of brokerage customers and advisory clients by diverting more          than $6 million from their brokerage accounts in order to repay          another client. Specifically, the Complaint alleges that LaScola          diverted the funds in order to repay the International          Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) for his illegal          purchase in their account of nearly $6 million of highly          speculative and illiquid promissory notes. Judge Torres          temporarily restrained LaScola, CPI  and CPA from engaging in          further fraudulent conduct, froze the assets of LaScola and CPI          and appointed a Temporary Receiver for CPI.               The Complaint alleges that when the IBEW learned about the          investment in the notes in November 1998, it demanded that          LaScola immediately sell the notes or it would file a lawsuit          against him. LaScola could not find buyers for these illiquid          notes in part because some of them were in default.  LaScola          through CPA and CPI caused brokerage customers and advisory          clients to purchase approximately $2 million of the notes without          their knowledge or consent. The Complaint further alleges that in          order to cover the $4 million balance, LaScola transferred $4          million of customers\x92 or clients\x92 funds to the IBEW and          misrepresented to those individuals that they had been issued the          notes, when in fact no notes have been issued in their names. The          Complaint alleges that in order to facilitate the return of the          IBEW money, LaScola, using a CPA computer system, converted          several of his advisory clients\x92 as well as several brokerage          customers\x92 cash accounts into margin accounts without their          permission and obtained large margin loans. Due to the improper          margin loans, investors are at risk of losing several million          dollars.  When questioned concerning the transactions, LaScola          falsely told the customers and clients that the purchases were          made in error.               The Complaint alleges that LaScola also misappropriated          $200,000 from an advisory client, and diverted another $127,000          from one client to another to hide the fact that he had          previously dissipated the account to repay the IBEW.               The Commission alleges that all of the defendants violated          Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the          Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and          alleges that LaScola and CPI violated Sections 206(1) and (2) of          the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  In addition to the relief          already granted, the Complaint seeks a permanent injunction,          disgorgement and civil penalties.               The Commission would like to acknowledge the cooperation and          assistance of the Rhode Island State Department of Business          Regulation, Securities Division in the investigation of this          matter.  On December 24, 1998, in separate actions, the          Department temporarily suspended the state licenses LaScola, CPI          and CPA. The investigation into this matter continues.

16013,1998,,"b                          SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION                                   Washington, D.C.          LITIGATION RELEASE NO.    16013 / December 30, 1998          SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION v. ROBERT FALBO, THERESA          BILLINGS FALBO, LORRE MEADE, ANTHONY CAPRICUSO, MICHAEL NARDINO,          MARK MUENSTER AND ERIC MUENSTER, No. 92-CIV-6836-PKL (S.D.N.Y.)                                SEC OBTAINS FINAL JUDGMENTS                         CONCLUDING PILLSBURY INSIDER TRADING CASE               The Securities and Exchange Commission has obtained final          judgments against the remaining defendants in its insider trading          case arising from the 1988 tender offer by Grand Metropolitan PLC          for The Pillsbury Company.  In accordance with a decision by U.S.          District Judge Peter K. Leisure in August 1998 that granted in          substantial part the Commission\x92s motion for summary judgment          against defendants Robert Falbo and Lorre Meade, the Court has          .entered a final judgment that enjoins Falbo from violating          Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934          and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder, and that orders both Falbo          and Meade to disgorge their illicit trading profits and pay civil          penalties. Specifically, Falbo was ordered to disgorge $136,000          plus prejudgment interest and to pay a civil penalty of $50,000,          while Meade was ordered to disgorge $34,125 plus prejudgment          interest and to pay a civil penalty of $5,000.  The Commission          did not press the only claim not resolved on summary judgment for          an additional $22,316.14 in insider trading profits by Robert          Falbo.               Simultaneously, the Court entered a final judgment on          consent against defendant Theresa B. Falbo, Robert Falbo\x92s wife.          Without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commission\x92s          complaint, Theresa Falbo agreed to a final judgment that enjoins          her from violating Exchange Act Sections 10(b) and 14(e) and          Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3, and that orders her to disgorge          $158,316.14 in illicit trading profits realized through her          husband, plus prejudgment interest.  Based on her demonstrated          inability to pay, all but $15,000 of the disgorgement obligation          was waived and no civil monetary penalties were imposed against          her.               The Commission\x92s complaint, filed on September 16, 1992,          alleged that the defendants violated Exchange Act Sections 10(b)          and 14(e) and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder by purchasing          Pillsbury common stock and call options before Grand Met\x92s tender          offer was publicly announced and while possessing material          nonpublic information about it.  Earlier this year, the          Commission obtained judgments by settlement against the four          other defendants in the case:  Eric Muenster, his brother Mark          Muenster, Anthony Capricuso,  and Michael Nardino. See Litigation          Release No. 15773 (June 9, 1998) and Litigation Rel. No. 15885,          (Sept. 17, 1998).               The final judgments entered against Robert Falbo, Lorre          Meade, and Theresa Falbo conclude the litigation against all          defendants."
