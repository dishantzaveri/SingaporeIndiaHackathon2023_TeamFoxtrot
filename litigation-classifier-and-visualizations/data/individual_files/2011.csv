21797,2011,[<h3>SEC CHARGES FORMER OFFICERS OF STERLING FINANCIAL CORP. SUBSIDIARY FOR CONDUCTING FINANCIAL FRAUD</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that, on January 6, 2011, it filed a civil action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania against Joseph M. Braas, of Lititz, Pennsylvania, and Michael J. Schlager, of Lancaster, Pennsylvania.  The Commission’s complaint alleges that Braas and Schlager, two senior officers at Equipment Finance, LLC (“EFI”), formerly a commercial lender to the soft pulp logging industry and wholly-owned subsidiary of Sterling Financial Corp. (“Sterling”), conducted a financial fraud that lasted over five years.  Sterling was a publicly traded bank holding company based in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.  Without admitting or denying the Commission’s allegations, Braas and Schlager have agreed to settle the matter.  The settlements are pending final approval by the court., The Commission’s complaint alleges that, from at least February 2002 until April 2007, Braas, EFI’s Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, and Schlager, EFI’s Executive Vice President, orchestrated a pervasive and wide-ranging scheme using fraudulent underwriting and reporting practices to hide mounting losses and defaults within EFI’s commercial loan portfolio from Sterling’s senior management and auditors., The Commission further alleges that Braas and Schlager were able to subvert virtually every aspect of EFI’s loan process and internal controls.  They created fictitious loans for the purpose of making monthly payments on delinquent loans, altered loan documents to hide delinquent and fictitious loans, granted excessive deferrals and resets of delinquent loans to make them appear current, reassigned loan payments to unrelated accounts to fund payments on delinquent loans, and used aliases for borrowers to circumvent EFI’s maximum lending limitations.  They also deceived Sterling’s internal and independent auditors through fraudulent accounting entries, false collateral descriptions and appraisals, fabricated UCC filings, and by recruiting vendors to assist in the circumvention of loan confirmation procedures., As alleged in the complaint, Braas and Schlager caused EFI to report false financial information to Sterling which, in turn, from 2002 through 2006, filed quarterly and annual reports with the Commission containing materially false and misleading financial statements.  As a result of the fraud, Sterling ultimately charged off $281 million of EFI finance receivables, which represented a large majority of EFI’s loan portfolio, and approximately 13 percent of Sterling’s total loan portfolio during the period of the fraud., Braas and Schlager have consented to the entry of orders permanently enjoining them from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933; Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder; and aiding  and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.  The orders will bar Braas and Schlager from serving as officers or directors of a public reporting company.  Braas will also be ordered to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $1,489,024, and Schlager ordered to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $1,121,302.  In view of each defendant’s agreement to pay restitution in conjunction with his guilty plea in a related criminal case filed by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania [USA v. Braas, et al., Crim. No. 10-cr-00753-PD (E.D. Pa.

Through its two principals – CEO Ezat Rahimi of Elk Grove, Calif., and vice president Ian Lamphere of Lawrenceville, Vt. – Gendarme sold more than 15 billion shares of at least a dozen companies, netting illicit profits of more than $1.6 million.  , According to the SEC’s complaint, filed today in federal district court in Sacramento, Gendarme began entering into agreements with penny stock issuers in early 2008.  The agreements gave Gendarme the right to purchase stock at 30 to 50 percent discounts to the market price.  The SEC alleges that, in an effort to avoid the registration and disclosure obligations of the federal securities laws, Gendarme falsely represented to issuers that it was purchasing shares for “investment purposes only.”  Contrary to those representations, Gendarme quickly dumped most of these shares on the public markets, profiting by more than $1.6 million from its unregistered stock distributions.  , The SEC also alleges that Gendarme’s outside attorney — Cassandra Armento of Greenwich, N.Y. — violated the securities laws by issuing more than 50 false legal opinion letters in support of Gendarme’s activities.  Armento repeatedly informed stock transfer agents that Gendarme was not an “underwriter” and thus had no intent to sell the stock.  Thus, shares could be obtained by Gendarme without trading restrictions.  However, the SEC alleges Armento made no inquiry into whether Gendarme intended to resell the stock, and was aware of information showing that it was likely that Gendarme was dumping the stock into the market. , In its federal court action, the SEC alleges Gendarme, Rahimi, Lamphere, and Armento violated Sections 5(a) and (c) of the Securities Act of 1933.  Against Gendarme, Rahimi, and Lamphere, the SEC seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, monetary penalties, and an order barring them from participating in an offering of penny stock.

Teo, Sr. (Teo), a former director of Cirrus Logic, Inc., which had been negotiating to take over C-Cube, misappropriated material, non-public information about the contemplated acquisition of C-Cube and subsequently tipped Sacks about the potential deal. The complaint further alleges that Sacks purchased C-Cube shares prior to the March 26, 2001 public announcement of C-Cubes acquisition by another company and that Sacks shortly thereafter sold those shares at a profit of $115,155. In addition to insider trading in C-Cube by Teo and Sacks, the complaint also alleges: (i) insider trading in the stock of Musicland Stores Corporation based on material, non-public information Teo provided to several other defendants regarding Musiclands acquisition by Best Buy Corporation in December 2000; and (ii) the filing of false and misleading Schedules 13D and other filings regarding the Musicland holdings of Teo and the MAAA Trust, a trust for Teos children., Between 2004 and 2007, the Court entered consent judgments against the tippee defendants charged with insider trading in Musicland stock, and in 2010, entered a consent judgment against Teo with respect to his charged insider trading in Musicland and C-Cube stock.

Kowalewski (Kowalewski) and SJK Investment Management, LLC (SJK), a registered investment adviser, with violations of the federal securities laws for defrauding investors in two hedge funds managed by SJK., The Commissions Complaint alleges that, beginning in the summer of 2009, SJK and Kowalewski, the firms CEO, raised a total of $65 million for two hedge funds, the SJK Absolute Return Fund, LLC, and the SJK Absolute Return Fund, Ltd. (collectively, the Absolute Return Funds) and represented to investors that: (1) substantially all of the monies invested in the Absolute Return Funds would be invested in unaffiliated underlying hedge funds pursuing complex investment strategies, (2) no single underlying fund would be allocated more than 15% of the Absolute Return Funds monies, and (3) as compensation for its services, SJK would receive no more than a 1% annual asset management fee and a 10% profits incentive fee.

The complaint charges Trivium with insider trading as well.  The SEC further alleges that Polycom senior executive Sunil Bhalla and Shammara Hussain, an employee at investor relations consulting firm Market Street Partners that did work for Google, tipped the inside information that enabled the insider trading by Feinblatt and Yokuty on behalf of Trivium’s hedge funds for illicit profits of more than $15 million.

The financial statements, and the firm’s audit report, were included in the registration statement and subsequent amendments.

The audit reports issued by Drogin falsely stated that an audit had been performed in accordance with applicable auditing standards and provided a reasonable basis for an unqualified report.

21805,2011,[<h3>SEC CHARGES KIMON DAIFOTIS AND RANDALL MERK FOR DEFRAUDING INVESTORS IN THE SCHWAB YIELDPLUS FUND</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Kimon Daifotis and Randall Merk with fraud and other securities law violations in a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.  Daifotis is the former lead portfolio manager for the Schwab YieldPlus Fund and was the Chief Investment Officer for Fixed Income for Charles Schwab Investment Management (CSIM).  Randall Merk is an Executive Vice President at Charles Schwab &amp; Co., Inc. (CS&amp;Co.), and formerly was President of CSIM and a trustee of the YieldPlus and other Schwab funds., In its complaint, the Commission alleges that Daifotis and Merk committed fraud and other securities law violations in connection with the offer, sale, and management of the YieldPlus Fund.  YieldPlus is an ultra-short bond fund that, at its peak in 2007, had $13.5 billion in assets and over 200,000 accounts, making it the largest ultra-short bond fund in the category.  The fund suffered a significant decline during the credit crisis of 2007-2008 and saw its assets fall from $13.5 billion to $1.8 billion during an eight-month period due to redemptions and declining asset values., According to the complaint, Merk and Daifotis misled investors about the risks of investing in the YieldPlus Fund.  For example, they described the fund as a cash equivalent or alternative that had only slightly higher risk than a money market fund in marketing and other communications.  The statements were misleading because the fund was riskier than money market funds, and Merk and Daifotis failed to inform investors adequately about the differences between YieldPlus and money market funds.  For example, the maturity and credit quality of the YieldPlus Fund’s securities were significantly different than those of a money market fund., The complaint further alleges that, in mid-2007, the YieldPlus Fund’s NAV began to decline and many investors redeemed their holdings.  Unlike a money market fund, few of the fund’s assets were scheduled to mature within the next several months.  As a result, the fund had to sell assets in a depressed market to raise cash.  While the YieldPlus Fund’s NAV declined, Merk, and Daifotis held conference calls, issued written materials, and had other communications with investors that contained a number of material misstatements and omissions concerning the fund.  For example, in two conference calls, Daifotis made false and misleading statements that the fund’s was experiencing “very, very, very slight” and “minimal” investor redemptions.  In fact, Daifotis knew or was reckless in not knowing that YieldPlus had experienced more than $1.2 billion in redemptions during the two weeks prior to the calls, which caused YieldPlus to sell over $2.1 billion of its securities.  Similarly, Merk authored, reviewed and approved misleading statements about the fund, such as a false claim that the fund had a “short maturity structure” that “mitigated much of the price erosion” experienced by its peers. , The complaint also charges Daifotis with aiding and abetting the YieldPlus Fund’s deviation from its concentration policy by directing the Fund’s investment of more than 25% of fund assets in private-issuer mortgage-backed securities (MBS).  Mutual funds and other registered investment companies are required to state certain investment policies in their SEC filings, including a policy regarding concentration of investments.  Once established, a fund may not deviate from its concentration policy without shareholder approval.  Schwab’s bond funds, including the YieldPlus Fund and the Total Bond Market Fund, had a policy of not concentrating more than 25% of assets in any one industry, including private-issuer MBS.  The complaint alleges that the funds violated this policy, and the Investment Company Act, when Daifotis directed the investment of approximately 50% of the assets of the YieldPlus Fund and more than 25% of the Total Bond Fund’s assets in private-issuer MBS without obtaining shareholder approval., The complaint also charges Merk with aiding and abetting violations of anti-fraud provisions of the Investment Advisers Act.  The complaint alleges that Merk approved other Schwab funds’ redemptions of their investments in YieldPlus at a time when Merk knew or was reckless in not knowing that a portfolio manager for those funds had received material, nonpublic information about the YieldPlus Fund without the authorization of the YieldPlus Fund’s board of trustees., In its complaint, the SEC alleges that:, In a related proceeding, the SEC issued a settled administrative order, and filed a settled district court complaint, against CSIM, CS&amp;Co. and Schwab Investments., See Also:,  ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr21805.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

While the YieldPlus Fund’s NAV declined, CSIM and CS&amp;Co. held conference calls, issued written materials, and had other communications with investors that contained a number of material misstatements and omissions concerning the fund.  , The Commission also found that CSIM and CS&amp;Co. did not have policies and procedures reasonably designed, given the nature of their businesses, to prevent the misuse of material, nonpublic information about the fund.  For example, they did not have specific policies and procedures governing redemptions by portfolio managers who advised Schwab funds of funds, and did not have appropriate information barriers concerning nonpublic and potentially material information about the fund.  As a result, several Schwab-related funds and individuals were free to redeem their own investments in YieldPlus during the fund’s decline.  , Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission’s complaints, CSIM and CS&amp;Co. agreed to pay a total of $118,944,996, including $52,327,149 in disgorgement of fees by CSIM, a $52,327,149 penalty against CSIM, a $5,000,000 penalty against CS&amp;Co., and pre-judgment interest of $9,290,698.  CSIM’s disgorgement may be deemed satisfied, up to a maximum of $26,944,996, for payments made within the next 60 days to settle related investigations by FINRA or state securities regulators.  The Commission seeks to have payments placed in a Fair Fund for distribution to harmed investors, and the related recoveries by other regulators, such as FINRA, may be contributed to the Fair Fund.  The payments and any Fair Fund are subject to approval by the United States District Court for the Northern District of California., The Commission today also instituted related cease-and-desist proceedings against CSIM, CS&amp;Co. and Schwab Investments for the same conduct.  In connection with these proceedings, CSIM, CS&amp;Co. and Schwab Investments consented to a Commission order requiring them to cease and desist from committing or causing future violations of the federal securities laws.  The Commission order also requires them to comply with certain undertakings, including correction of all disclosures regarding the funds’ concentration policy.  In addition, the Commission censured CSIM and CS&amp;Co., and required them to retain an independent consultant to review and make recommendations about their policies and procedures to prevent the misuse of material, nonpublic information.  , In its complaint, the Commission alleges and, in its related order, found that:, The Commission acknowledges the assistance of FINRA.,  ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr21806.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Phillip Macdonald, Martin Gollan, and Michael Goodman</i>, Civil Action No. 09-CV-5352 (HB) (S.D.N.Y. filed June 10, 2009). The Commissions Complaint in that action alleges that Macdonald, a Canadian attorney, engaged in insider trading in the securities of certain companies ahead of public announcements of business combinations. The Complaint alleges that between January and June 2005, the wife of Macdonalds co-defendant, Michael Goodman, learned the identities of those companies in the course of her employment as an administrative assistant with Merrill Lynch Canada, Inc. Goodmans wife sometimes mentioned the information to Goodman, expecting that he would keep it confidential. Goodman instead misappropriated the information by, among other things, recommending stocks to his business associate, Macdonald. On the basis of the information, Macdonald then purchased securities ahead of business combination announcements. (Goodman and Gollan previously consented to the entry of Final Judgments against them in the Commissions action.), Macdonald consented to the entry of the Final Judgment against him, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions Complaint, except as to jurisdiction. The Final Judgment against Macdonald permanently enjoins him from further violations of Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b 5 and 14e-3 thereunder and orders him to pay disgorgement of $810,000., See also Litigation Releases No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21079.htm>21079</a> (June 10, 2009) and No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2010/lr21376.htm>21376</a> (Jan. 12, 2010).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr21807.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

From March 2008 until July 2008, the companies raised approximately $2.9 million through offerings of their securities to investors for the purported purpose of funding oil and gas exploration and drilling projects.  According to the SECs complaint, the private placement memoranda for the offerings misrepresented the use of the offering proceeds and failed to disclose that 49% to 74% of investors funds were paid as commissions to offering sales agents.  The private placement memoranda further stated without any reasonable basis that investors could earn annual returns ranging from 14% to 141%.  Ultimately, the companies used only about $534,000 of the $2.9 million raised from investors for oil drilling and never found any oil, The SEC alleges that Roger A. Kimmel, Jr., and Harry Nyce, and the boiler room managers Michel-Jean Geraud, Robert Rossi, and Joseph Valko drafted, reviewed or distributed the private placement memorandum given to investors.  The SEC further alleges that Geraud, Rossi, and Valko conducted the offerings through multiple sales offices and knew that their sales agents and the offering materials were not advising investors about the sales commissions of 49% to 74%.  Morgan Petitti performed escrow functions for the offering and, among other things, distributed commissions to the sales agents that were inconsistent with the private placement memoranda, which she typed.  , The SECs complaint, which was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, charges Petroleum Unlimited, Petroleum Unlimited II, Kimmel, Nyce, Geraud, Rossi, and Valko with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SECs complaint further charges Geraud, Rossi, and Valko with violating Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act.  The complaint also charges Petitti with violating Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act.  Petroleum Unlimited, Petroleum Unlimited II, Kimmel, Nyce, and Petitti have agreed to settle the SECs charges without admitting or denying the allegations.  Petroleum Unlimited, Petroleum Unlimited II, and Kimmel, have consented to permanent injunctions and will pay disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  Nyce consented to a permanent injunction, and will pay $242,339 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and a $65,000 civil money penalty.  Petitti consented to a permanent injunction and will pay a $25,000 civil money penalty., The SEC also today announced the issuance of an Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Notice of Hearing against Geraud based on his criminal convictions by the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida for one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud (United States v. Michael Geraud, Case No.10-cr-80070 (S.D. Fla.)) and one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States in an income tax evasion scheme (United States v. Michael Geraud, Case No. 10-cr-60091 (S.D. Fla.)).  The count of criminal information in Case No.10-cr-80070 alleged, among other things, that Geraud, in connection with the offer and sale of Petroleum Unlimiteds securities, defrauded investors and obtained money and property by, among other things, misrepresenting the companys use of offering proceeds, and failing to disclose exorbitant sales commissions. , A hearing will be held by an administrative law judge to determine whether the allegations contained in the Order are true, to provide the Respondent an opportunity to dispute these allegations, and to determine what, if any, remedial sanctions are appropriate and in the public interest. The Order requires the Administrative Law Judge to issue an initial decision no later than 210 days from the date of service of this Order, pursuant to Rule 360(a)(2) of the Commissions Rules of Practice. , The SECs case was investigated by Jorge L.

(NIC) which manages government websites, its former CEO Jeffery Fraser, current CEO Harry Herington, former CFO Eric Bur, and current CFO Stephen Kovzan with failing to disclose more than $1.18 million in perquisites to Fraser from at least 2002 to 2007., The Commission alleges that NIC filed false and misleading proxy statements, annual reports and registration statements that failed to disclose Frasers perquisites and falsely represented he worked virtually for free from 2002 until 2005, and continued to materially understate the perquisites Fraser received in 2006 and 2007. The Commission also alleges that NICs related party transactions disclosures for 2002 through 2005 were misleading in failing to disclose its payment of $1 million to fly and operate planes for Fraser., NIC, Fraser, Herington and Bur agreed to settle the Commissions charges without admitting or denying the allegations against them. The Commissions litigation continues against Kovzan., The Commissions complaints, filed in federal court in the District of Kansas, contain the following additional allegations:, Frasers undisclosed perquisites included over $4,000 per month to live in a ski lodge in Wyoming; monthly cash payments for purported rent for a Kansas house owned by an entity Fraser set up and controlled; vacations for Fraser, his girlfriend and his family; Frasers flight training, hunting, spa, skiing and health club expenses; computers and electronics for Fraser and his family; a leased Lexus SUV; costs for Fraser to commute by private aircraft from his home in Wyoming to his office at NICs Kansas headquarters; and other day-to-day living expenses such as groceries, liquor, tobacco, nutritional supplements, and clothing., Fraser, who did not have a personal credit card, routinely charged living expenses on NIC credit cards and submitted expense vouchers falsely claiming personal items were business related in order to have NIC pay for these personal expenses. Fraser also sought reimbursement for certain expenses he had not incurred., Kovzan, then Chief Accounting Officer, authorized NICs payment of Frasers personal expenses, circumvented NICs internal controls and policies that required the CEO to document the business purpose for his expenses and knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that Frasers expenses were falsely characterized as business expenses in NICs books and records. Kovzan prepared, reviewed and/or signed NICs proxy statements, annual reports, and registration statements that materially underreported Frasers compensation and Kovzan made false representations to NICs independent auditors., Bur permitted NIC to pay the expenses that Fraser submitted on his expense vouchers even though he was informed that Fraser was not submitting the required documentation. A finance department employee raised concerns to Bur that some of Frasers expenses were not business related. Bur was aware of the Commissions rules requiring the disclosure of executive perquisites, yet he reviewed, signed, and/or certified NICs public filings that failed to disclose Frasers perquisites., Herington, then Chief Operating Officer, was informed of problems with Frasers expense reporting and failed to adequately address them. Herington received information showing that NIC was paying for some of Frasers personal expenses, yet he reviewed and/or signed NICs public filings that failed to disclose Frasers perquisites., NIC failed to correct Frasers expense reporting problems even after a finance department employee warned in 2006 of the risk of possible income tax fraud charges, a whistleblower had complained to NIC and the company learned of the Commissions investigation of this matter in mid-2007. The majority of Frasers perquisites were not repaid or disclosed, and NIC continued to make misleading public filings. NIC failed to disclose to investors in public filings that an internal review concluded Fraser had intentionally misclassified his expenses., NIC agreed to settle the Commissions charges by paying a $500,000 civil penalty and hiring an independent consultant to recommend, if appropriate, improvements to policies, procedures, controls, and training relating to payment of expenses, handling of whistleblower complaints, and related party transactions.

McCullough, Jr. (“McCullough”), CytoCore’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, alleging that they engaged in violative conduct relating to trading in CytoCore stock and Burns’ compensation.  , According to the complaint, from 2003 to 2008, Burns employed fraudulent schemes to profit from CytoCore stock transactions and received hundreds of thousands of dollars in improper compensation and benefits from CytoCore as an unregistered broker.  In February 2008, Burns allegedly caused CytoCore to issue a press release touting Burns’ investment in CytoCore stock, and then secretly sold shares immediately following the announcement.  According to the complaint, Burns’ secret selling also constituted insider trading because Burns was in possession of material, nonpublic information about an ongoing CytoCore private stock offering.  , The complaint further alleges that, from 2003 to 2008, Burns improperly received transaction-based compensation as an unregistered broker soliciting investors in CytoCore stock.  CytoCore and McCullough allegedly aided and abetted Burns by engaging him to act as a broker for the Company.  The complaint also alleges that Burns submitted false claims for commissions purportedly earned by a friend for soliciting CytoCore investors, and his friend, in turn, remitted those commission payments to Burns.  Burns also allegedly submitted to CytoCore false claims for expense reimbursements relating to his investor solicitations., The complaint further alleges that Burns and McCullough violated insider reporting requirements.  Burns allegedly publicly disclosed only his purchases, never his sales, of CytoCore stock, and he arranged for the secret sale of CytoCore stock through a friend to further conceal his selling.  McCullough allegedly failed to report more than 100 CytoCore stock transactions, and both Burns and McCullough allegedly misreported their stock holdings in disclosure forms and in CytoCore’s proxy statements., The Commission’s complaint alleges that Burns violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”), Sections 10(b), 14(a), 15(a), and 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), and Rules 10b-5, 14a-9, and 16a-3 thereunder.

The Commission alleges that these Defendants fraudulently induced clients to invest tens of millions of dollars in a purported investment program in order to receive over $8 million in commissions and fees from 2007 through 2009.  Defendants deliberately overstated the value and liquidity of client holdings in the Strategy, by misrepresenting and concealing critical information about the way they were supposedly executing it.  Although Defendants informed clients repeatedly that they were executing open-market transactions on the clients’ behalf, the vast majority of transactions, however, were not executed on the open market. Most simply consisted of trades between advisory client accounts controlled by Defendants at inflated prices made up by Nadel himself.  Defendants thus created the false impression that there was a liquid market for these securities and that the market prices for the securities were consistent with the inflated values that Defendants reported to their clients.  , The complaint alleges that the Defendants violated the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically Defendants Nadel, WDNC and RIA violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; Defendant WDNC violated and Defendant Nadel aided and abetted violations of 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-10 and 17a-4 thereunder; Defendants Nadel and RIA violated Sections 206(1), (2) and (3) and 207 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”); Defendant RIA violated and Defendant Nadel aided and abetted violations of Sections 204 of the Advisers Act and Rule 204(2)-(a)(3) thereunder. , The SEC’s case was investigated by Alison T.

Hancher told different investors at least four inconsistent lies about how their money would be invested and promised them outsized returns of 50% after Scott Contracting became a public company.  In reality, Hancher and Commerce Street simply misappropriated the money they raised for Scott Contracting to pay personal and business expenses.  , In a separate scheme between December 2007 and February 2008, the complaint alleges that Hancher directed Whelan and others to place at least 18 manipulative matched orders for more than 60,000 shares of LMWW Holdings, Inc., a company controlled by Hancher, in order to prop up its stock price and increase its trading volume.  According to the complaint, Whelan personally placed at least two of these matched orders in a brokerage account in the name of his company, Grace Holdings, Inc.  , Finally, the Commission’s complaint alleges that in a third scheme between September 2008 and January 2010, Hancher abused his position as a director and audit committee member at Cycle Country Accessories Corporation, an Iowa manufacturer of accessories for all-terrain vehicles and golf carts, to convince the company to give the Defendants $620,000 under the guise of taking the company private through a stock buyback.  Instead of using the funds as promised, however, the complaint alleges that Hancher and Whelan purchased just a small amount of Cycle Country stock and misappropriated $507,500 and $16,187, respectively.

The Commission also charged Joseph Radcliffe with illegal insider trading., The Commissions complaint, which was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, alleges that Michael Radcliffe was a Director of Image and the Chief Operating Officer of its operating subsidiary, and he signed the companys financial reports. Joseph Radcliffe, who held himself out as a consultant for the company, actually controlled the operations of the company. According to the Commissions complaint, in 2004 and 2005, Joseph and Michael Radcliffe engaged in a scheme in which they created fictitious sales of company merchandise, which were recorded in the company books and records as revenue. The Radcliffes used false invoices and other documentation to disguise the fact that the sales were phony. The Commission further alleges that the revenue reported from the fictitious sales was included in the companys financial reports, which were disseminated to the public and filed with the Commission. In 2004, Image reported about $6.1 million in revenue. For the first quarter of 2005, Image reported about $464,502 in revenue. About 92 percent of that reported revenue in 2004 and 2005 was fabricated by Joseph and Michael Radcliffe. In addition, Joseph Radcliffe sold shares of the Company at prices inflated by the fraud while in possession of material, nonpublic information regarding the Companys true financial performance and without registering the sales as required by the securities laws. The Radcliffes obtained a total of at least $965,000 from the financial fraud and illegal stock sales.

21816,2011,"[<h3>Securities and Exchange Commission Files Fraud Charges Against Former MediCor CEO, Chairman and COO </h3>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Theodore Robert Maloney (Maloney), the former chief executive officer of MediCor, Ltd. (MediCor), with fraud and other misconduct for concealing the true and precarious source of MediCors funding from investors and the companys auditor. The Commission simultaneously filed related settled civil actions against Donald K. McGhan, MediCors founder and former Chairman (Don McGhan), and Jimmy J. McGhan, the companys former chief operating officer (Jim McGhan)., The SEC complaints, filed in the Nevada District Court, allege that from 2004 through 2006, MediCor filed false and misleading annual reports, quarterly reports and proxy statements that falsely stated that the company was substantially funded by Don McGhan or one of his affiliates, when in fact a significant source of MediCors funding was money illegally transferred from Southwest Exchange Corp. (Southwest). Southwest was a private company that held deposits for taxpayers seeking to defer capital gains taxes on like-kind exchanges of property. According to the SECs complaint, Maloney and Don McGhan concealed the illegal transfer of Southwest funds by creating a paper trail designed to hide the true source of MediCors financing; Maloney and the McGhans also concealed information regarding the true source of MediCors funding from MediCors auditor. Maloney was the person primarily responsible for preparing MediCors misleading public filings; Maloney, Don McGhan and Jim McGhan each signed the filings. The complaint further alleges that by the end of 2006, Don McGhan, with Maloneys help and Jim McGhans knowledge, had transferred over $54 million out of Southwest for MediCors benefit. Southwest collapsed in January 2007, owing approximately $97 million to its clients. MediCor declared bankruptcy in June 2007., The SEC is charging Maloney with violating Sections 10(b), 13(b)(5) and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 13b2-2 and 14a-9, and with aiding and abetting MediCors violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13-13. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, civil penalty and a permanent officer and director bar against Maloney., Don McGhan and Jim McGhan each has agreed to settle to charges of violating Sections 10(b) and 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5 and 14a-9, and with aiding and abetting MediCors violations of Sections 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1.

21818,2011,[<h3>SEC CHARGES OFFSHORE COMPANY WITH MASSIVE LIFE SETTLEMENT BONDING FRAUD</h3>],"[The Commission today filed an enforcement action against Provident Capital Indemnity, Ltd. (PCI), its president Minor Vargas Calvo (Vargas), and its purported outside auditor, Jorge L. Castillo (Castillo) seeking to halt a massive, ongoing fraud by PCI, an offshore company located in Costa Rica that provides financial guarantee bonds on life settlements and claims to protect investors interests in life insurance policies by promising to pay the death benefit if the insured lives beyond his or her estimated life expectancy. According to the complaint, from at least 2004 through March 2010, PCI issued approximately 197 bonds backstopping numerous bonded offerings of investments in life insurance policies with a face value of more than $670 million., According to the complaint, the PCI bonds were a material component of numerous third-party life settlement offerings in the United States and abroad. Without a bond, a life settlement investment is illiquid and open-ended because the investments pay-out date and return are dependent upon the date of the insureds death. PCIs bonds offered a fixed maturity date for the investments because PCIs bond obligated PCI to pay investors (directly or indirectly through the life settlement issuer) the face value of the underlying insurance policy by a date certain if the insured lived past his life expectancy date., The complaint alleges that the defendants misrepresented PCIs ability to satisfy its obligations under its bonds by making material misrepresentations about:, whether PCIs financial statements had been audited,, the assets that backed PCIs bonds;, PCIs credit rating; and, the availability of reinsurance to cover claims on PCIs bonds., Specifically, since at least 2003, PCI, Vargas and Castillo represented to life settlement issuers, and in turn, the investing public, that Castillo had audited PCIs financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting standards. Contrary to their representations, however, the complaint alleges that Castillo never conducted an audit of PCI and instead issued clean audit reports at Vargass bidding, thereby supporting the illusion that PCI had materially larger assets and greater financial wherewithal to support its obligations under the life settlement bonds. According to the complaint, PCIs audited financial statements reflect what appears to be a fictitious Long Term Asset that has comprised some 70% to 80% of PCIs total reported assets from at least 2003 to the present., The complaint alleges that PCIs audited financial statements were provided to Dun &amp; Bradstreet (D&amp;B), which issued PCI a favorable rating of 5 A/S, based exclusively on PCIs reported net worth. PCI then misleadingly represented in its marketing materials that D&amp;Bs rating is a reflection of successful customer satisfaction and the ability to maintain one of the insurance industrys lowest loss ratios. According to the complaint, PCI and Vargas also have represented that PCI was backed by a bouquet of reputable reinsurers that would backstop PCIs obligations under its life settlement bonds when, in fact, PCI had no reinsurance coverage., The Commission charged the defendants with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) [15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)], Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)], and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5 [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5] and alternatively charged Castillo with aiding and abetting PCIs and Vargass violations of Securities Act Section 17(a) and Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5. The Commission also named Desarrollos Comerciales Ronim S.A., PCIs managing general agent, as a relief defendant., The Office of Investor Education and Advocacy issued an update to its Investor Alert on life settlement investments.

21819,2011,[<h3>SEC CHARGES ARIZONA-BASED HEALTH FOOD COMPANY AND FORMER EXECUTIVES WITH ACCOUNTING FRAUD</h3>],"[On January 13, 2011, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged NutraCea, three former executives, and two former accounting personnel for engaging in a fraudulent accounting scheme to inflate NutraCeas product sales revenues., The SEC alleges that NutraCea overstated its sales revenues for the second and third quarters of its fiscal year 2007 and fiscal year 2007 by booking false sales and engaging in improper revenue recognition practices. Through misstated financial statements, NutraCea disguised its true operating results in the second and third quarter of 2007 and fiscal year 2007., The SEC charged NutraCeas former chief executive officer, Bradley D. Edson, former chief financial officer, Todd C. Crow, and former senior vice president and secretary, Margie Adelman, for their roles in the fraudulent accounting scheme. The SEC also charged former controller, Joanne D. Kline, and former director of financial services, Scott Wilkinson, for their roles in the improper accounting., NutraCea, an Arizona-based company that manufactures and sells health food products, agreed to settle the SECs charges. Edson agreed to pay a $100,000 penalty, reimburse NutraCea $350,000 in bonuses he received in 2008, and agreed to a permanent officer and director bar to settle the SECs charges against him. Adelman, Kline, and Wilkinson also agreed to settle the SECs charges. , The SECs complaint, filed in federal district court in Arizona, alleges that NutraCea, Edson, Crow, and Adelman falsified NutraCeas sales revenues in 2007, and Kline and Wilkinson engaged in improper accounting by recording these false revenues. NutraCea booked $2.6 million in false sales to Bi-Coastal Pharmaceutical Corp. in the second quarter of 2007, resulting in overstated product sales revenue of as much as 35% in the second quarter of 2007. , According to the SECs complaint, Edson instructed Bi-Coastals president to falsify his familys financial statements to reflect a higher net worth in order to support the false sales to Bi-Coastal. In reality, Bi-Coastals down payment for the $2.6 million sale came from NutraCeas former COO. When Kline tried to discuss with Crow in 2007 her discovery that the $1 million deposit for the Bi-Coastal sale came from a loan from the former COO to Bi-Coastal in order to justify NutraCeas recognition of revenue from this sale, she says that Crow covered his ears and said, No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I dont want to hear it., The complaint also alleges that NutraCea improperly recorded revenue on a bill and hold transaction related to a $1.9 million sale of product to ITV Global, Inc. in the fourth quarter of 2007. As a result of the Bi-Coastal and ITV Global transactions alone, NutraCea overstated its product sales revenue by 36.8% for fiscal year end 2007. These false revenues caused NutraCea to misstate its operating loss by over 89% in the second quarter 2007, over 17.6% in the third quarter 2007, and nearly 7% in fiscal year 2007., Without admitting or denying the SECs allegations, NutraCea, Edson, Adelman, Kline, and Wilkinson agreed to settle this matter on the following terms:, NutraCea consented to the entry of an order that permanently enjoins it from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder. , Edson consented to a final judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder, and for aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder. Edson also agreed to a permanent officer and director bar, to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, and to reimburse NutraCea, pursuant to the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, the $350,000 in bonuses he received in 2008. , Adelman consented to a final judgment permanently enjoining her from future violations of Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder, and for aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder. Adelman further consented to a five year officer and director bar., Kline and Wilkinson both consented to final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder, and for aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder.

In a complaint unsealed late Thursday by the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, the SEC alleges that Zizhong (James) Fan, a manager at Seattle Genetics, told family member Zishen (Brandon) Fan about confidential positive trial results for the companys flagship cancer treatment. Zishen spent hundreds of thousands of dollars purchasing speculative stock options in the company as well as common stock, which skyrocketed in value when the news became public in late September 2010., According to the SECs complaint, the SEC staff contacted both Zizhong and Zishen last Thursday, January 13. Almost immediately after being contacted, Zishen attempted to wire several hundred thousand dollars to a bank in China while Zizhong informed his employer that he was leaving unexpectedly for China. The SEC thereafter filed an emergency enforcement action. On Wednesday, January 19, Judge Marsha J. Pechman of the Western District of Washington issued an order freezing brokerage and bank accounts containing the Seattle Genetics trading proceeds., The SECs alleges that Zizhong Fan, who lives in Bothell, Wash., was employed during 2010 as the manager of clinical programming at Seattle Genetics. He was involved in clinical trials for a development-stage product to be used in the treatment of Hodgkins lymphoma. As Zizhong Fan began learning information about the success of those trials, Zishen Fan, who lives in Chino Hills, Calif., began amassing large quantities of risky stock options that would allow him to profit from a rise in the companys stock price., The SECs complaint alleges that on Sept. 24, 2010 — the day that Zizhong attended a series of meetings to finalize the results for presentation to the companys senior executives — Zishen made his largest options purchase to date (over 50 percent of the options trades in the entire market), while also buying $150,000 in stock. The next business day — September 27 — Seattle Genetics reported the positive results to the public, and its stock price rose nearly 18 percent. According to the SEC, Zishen ultimately realized net trading profits of more than $803,000., The SECs complaint charges Zizhong Fan and Zishen Fan with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of illicit profits with prejudgment interest, and monetary penalties. The SEC also named another family member Junhua Fan, who resides in the Peoples Republic of China, as a relief defendant in the case. His brokerage account was used by Zishen to make many of the illegal trades, according to the SECs complaint., The SEC thanks the Options Regulatory Surveillance Authority for its assistance in this matter.

21822,2011,[<h3>SEC FILES SETTLED BRIBERY CHARGES AGAINST PAUL W. JENNINGS</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a settled enforcement action on January 24, 2011, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, charging Paul W. Jennings, a former officer at Innospec, Inc., with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) by approving bribes to government officials to obtain and retain business., The SECs complaint alleges that:, Innospec engaged in widespread bribery of foreign officials, some of which occurred and was approved by Jennings beginning in mid to late 2004 during his tenure as Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and continuing after he became Chief Executive Officer (CEO) in 2005., From 2000 to 2008, Innospec, a manufacturer and distributor of fuel additives and other specialty chemicals, routinely paid bribes to government officials in order to sell TEL, a fuel additive, which boosts the octane value of gasoline, to government owned refineries and oil companies in Iraq and Indonesia. Innospecs known bribery activities in Iraq began with its participation in the United Nations Oil for Food Program in 2001, and extended all the way until at least 2008. Innospec also paid bribes to government officials in Indonesia beginning as early as 2000, and continued until 2005, when Indonesias need for TEL ended. Beginning in mid to late 2004, Jennings, who held various senior roles at Innospec, actively participated in the bribery schemes in Iraq and Indonesia. In all, between 2000 and 2008, Innospec made illicit payments of approximately $6.3 million and promised an additional $2.8 million in illicit payments to Iraqi ministries and government officials as well as Indonesian government officials in exchange for contracts worth approximately $176 million.	, Jennings joined Innospec as the CFO in November 2002. Jennings learned of the longstanding practice of paying bribes to obtain TEL orders in mid to late 2004. In 2004, Jennings assumed the role of head of the TEL unit in addition to his role as CFO. In 2005, Jennings became the interim CEO and became the permanent CEO and President of Innospec in June 2005. Beginning in 2005, Jennings, along with other members of Innospecs management, approved bribery payments to officials at the Iraqi Ministry of Oil (MoO) in order to sell TEL to Iraq. Innospec used its agent in Iraq to funnel payments to Iraqi officials. Innospec made payments totaling approximately $1,610,327 and promised an additional $884,480 to MoO officials. For example, in an October 2005 e-mail copying Jennings, the agent said that Iraqi officials were demanding a 2% kickback and that [w]e are sharing most of our profits with Iraqi officials. Otherwise, our business will stop and we will lose the market. We have to change our strategy and do more compensation to get the rewards. The kickback and later payments were paid by increasing the agents commission, which Jennings approved. Jennings was aware of the scheme to pay an official at the Trade Bank of Iraq in exchange for a favorable exchange rate on letters of credit. Another scheme involved a bribe to ensure the failure of a field test of a competitor product. A confidential MoO report for the field trial test was shared with Jennings who was generally aware of the bribery. Bribes were also offered to secure a 2008 Long Term Purchase Agreement that would have caused approximately $850,000 to be shared with Iraqi officials. The agreement,however, did not go forward due to the investigation and ultimate discovery of widespread bribery by United States regulators., Innospec also paid bribes to Indonesian government officials from at least 2000 through 2005 in order to win contracts worth approximately $48,571,937 from state owned oil and gas companies in Indonesia. Jennings became aware of and approved payments beginning in mid to late 2004. Various euphemisms to refer to bribery were commonly used in e-mails and in discussions with Jennings and others at Innospec, including the Indonesian Way, the Lead Defense Fund, and TEL optimization. Bribery discussions were held on a flight in the U.S. and even discussed at Jennings performance review in 2005. In one bribery scheme with Pertamina, an Indonesian state owned oil and gas company, Innospec agreed, with approval by Jennings, to a one off payment of $300,000 to their Indonesian Agent with the understanding that it would be passed on to an Indonesian official., From 2004 to February 2009, Jennings signed annual certifications that were provided to auditors where he falsely stated that he had complied with Innospecs Code of Ethics incorporating the Companys Foreign Corrupt Practices Act policy. Jennings also signed annual and quarterly personal certifications pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 in which he made false certifications concerning the companys books and records and internal controls., Without admitting or denying the SECs allegations, Jennings has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating Sections 30A and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 13a-14, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder, and from aiding and abetting Innospecs violations of Exchange Act Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A) and13(b)(2)(B). Jennings will disgorge $116,092 plus prejudgment interest of $12,945, and pay a civil penalty of $100,000 that takes into consideration Jennings cooperation in this matter., The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Department of Justice, Fraud Section, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the United Kingdom Serious Fraud Office in this matter.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr21822.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Nacchio, 05-cr-00545 (D. Colorado); and prohibits him from acting as an officer or director of a public company. A civil penalty was not imposed against Nacchio by agreement of the parties in light of the criminal sanctions ordered in the related criminal case and because Nacchio agreed to waive all rights to appeal a criminal fine of $19 million imposed upon him in the related criminal case.

21827,2011,[<h3>SEC Charges Former Galleon Portfolio Manager in its Ongoing Investigation</h3>],"[On January 26, 2011, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that Adam Smith — a former portfolio manager of the Galleon Emerging Technology funds (f/k/a the Galleon Communications funds) engaged in insider trading in the securities of ATI Technologies, Inc.  The SEC alleges that Smith caused the Galleon funds he advised to purchase shares of ATI based on material non-public information concerning Advanced Micro Devices Inc.’s $5.4 billion takeover of ATI in July, 2006.  The trading generated over $1.3 million in illicit profits.  , According to the SEC’s complaint, Smith obtained material non-public information concerning the AMD/ATI transaction from an investment banking source that Smith had known for years.  This source, according to the SEC, provided Smith with the tip in order to win favors from Galleon such as securing investment banking work from, or obtaining future employment with, Galleon.  The complaint filed today relates to a pending enforcement action, <i>SEC v. Galleon Management, LP, et al.</i>, 09-CV-8811 (S.D.N.Y.)

The complaint seeks a final judgment permanently enjoining Smith from future violations of the above provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and ordering him to pay civil penalties., The SEC has now charged 28 defendants in its <i>Galleon</i>-related enforcement actions which have alleged widespread and repeated insider trading at numerous hedge funds including Galleon — a multi-billion dollar New York hedge fund complex founded and controlled by Raj Rajaratnam — and by other professional traders and corporate insiders in the securities of 14 companies generating illicit profits totaling over $70 million.  , In addition, since the <i>Galleon</i>-related cases were filed, the SEC has:, For further information, see Litigation Release Nos. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21255.htm>21255</a> (October 16, 2009), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21284.htm>21284</a> (November 5, 2009), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2010/lr21397.htm>21397</a> (January 29, 2010), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2010/lr21493.htm>21493</a> (April 20, 2010), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2010/lr21526.htm>21526</a> (May 17, 2010), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2010/lr21732.htm>21732</a> (November 8, 2010), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2010/lr21740.htm>21740</a> (November 15, 2010) and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr21802.htm>21802</a> (January 10, 2011).,  ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr21827.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

He then invested the money for his own benefit or for the benefit of the entities that he controlled, rather than for the benefit of the hedge fund investors. , According to the SECs complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut on January 14, 2011, Illarramendi is the majority owner of the Michael Kenwood Group LLC – a holding company for, among other entities, investment adviser Michael Kenwood Capital Management LLC.  Through this adviser entity, Illarramendi manages several hedge funds, including one that contains up to $540 million in assets.  The SEC’s complaint alleges that Illarramendi took at least $53 million in investor money out of this hedge fund without the knowledge or consent of the hedge fund’s investors, The SEC sought an asset freeze and other emergency relief because it alleged that Illarramendi was imminently planning to make additional investments using investor funds without the knowledge or consent of the investors.  Since the filing of the complaint, the Honorable Janet Bond Arterton, U.S. District Judge for the District of Connecticut, has held a series of hearings pertaining to the SEC’s request for an emergency relief against Illarramendi and Michael Kenwood Capital Management.

21829,2011,[<h3>SEC CHARGES NEW YORK INVESTMENT FIRMS AND SENIOR OFFICERS WITH FRAUD</h3>],"[On January 20, 2011, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged three affiliated New York-based investment firms and four former senior officers with fraud, misuse of client assets, and other securities laws violations involving their $66 million advisory business., The SEC alleges that the operations investment adviser William Landberg and president Kevin Kramer - through the firms West End Financial Advisors LLC (WEFA), West End Capital Management LLC (WECM), and Sentinel Investment Management Corporation - misled investors into believing that their money was in stable, safe investments designed to provide steady streams of income. However, in reality West End faced deepening financial problems stemming from Landbergs failed investment strategies. When starved for cash to meet obligations of the West End funds or for his personal needs, Landberg misused investor assets, fraudulently obtained more than $8.5 million from a bank, and used millions of dollars from an interest reserve account for unauthorized purposes., The SEC also charged West Ends chief financial officer Steven Gould and controller Janis Barsuk for their roles in the scheme., According to the SECs complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, the misconduct occurred from at least January 2008 to May 2009. The SEC alleges that Landberg used substantial amounts of fraudulently-obtained bank loans to make distributions to certain West End fund investors, thereby sustaining the illusion that West Ends investments were performing well. During the same period, Landberg also misappropriated at least $1.5 million for himself and his family. Landbergs wife Louise Crandall and their family partnership are named as relief defendants in the SECs complaint., The SEC further alleges that Gould and Barsuk knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that Landberg was defrauding a bank that provided loans to a West End fund by misusing funds in a related interest reserve account. Both officers nevertheless participated in the fraud by facilitating Landbergs misappropriations from that account. The SEC alleges that Gould conceived and used improper accounting methods to conceal aspects of the fraud, and he issued account statements to investors showing false investment returns. Barsuk facilitated Landbergs uses of investor money to cover his personal obligations. Similarly, Kramer knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that West End faced severe financial problems and had difficulty obtaining sufficient financing to sustain its investment strategy. Nevertheless, Kramer failed to disclose those material facts to investors as he continued to market the funds to new and existing investors through April 2009., The Complaint alleges that Landberg, Kramer, Gould, WEFA, WECM, and Sentinel violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. In addition, the complaint alleges that Landberg, WEFA, WECM, and Sentinel violated Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and that Landberg, WEFA, and WECM violated Section 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder. Kramer, Gould, and Barsuk are charged with aiding and abetting violations of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Advisers Act, and Sentinel is charged with aiding and abetting violations of Section 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder. Barsuk is also charged with aiding and abetting violations of the antifraud provisions of the Exchange Act. The Commission seeks permanent injunctive relief against each defendant and disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest against defendants and relief defendants.

Hernandez, of Downers Grove, Illinois, to serve 200 months in prison for conducting a fraudulent investment scheme that resulted in more than $6.4 million in losses to more than 250 investors. In addition, Judge Gettleman ordered Hernandez to pay more than $6.4 million in restitution to the victims of his fraud., The criminal case was filed on June 17, 2009 when the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Northern District of Illinois filed a criminal complaint against Hernandez charging him with one count of mail fraud. On July 8, 2009, the U.S. Attorneys Office filed a grand jury indictment against Hernandez charging him with 4 counts of mail fraud. In January 2010, Hernandez pled guilty to one count of mail fraud., On June 15, 2009, the Commission filed its own civil action against Hernandez for the same conduct. The Commission sought and obtained emergency relief, including an order restraining Hernandez from further violations of the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws and an order freezing Hernandezs assets and the assets of several relief defendants. The Commissions complaint alleged that between at least February 2008 and June 2009, Hernandez solicited investors to purchase guaranteed investment contracts by making false and misleading statements about his background, the existence of the company that issued the investments, the uses of investor proceeds and the safety of the investments. The complaint alleged that Hernandez, also doing business as NextStep Financial Services, Inc., sold the guaranteed investment contracts in person and through NextStep Financials website. Hernandez also claimed that he had an extensive background in banking and business, including having business and law degrees, and that NextStep Financial was a successful company that invested in payday advance stores. The complaint further alleges that Hernandez told investors that their investments were safe because they were covered by insurance. According to the Commissions complaint however, Hernandez never received the claimed degrees, his banking experience included a prior federal conviction for wire fraud and NextStep Financial was a defunct corporation with no financial services operations other than running this scheme. In addition, the complaint alleged that Hernandez never invested in the payday advance stores or purchased the insurance that covered investors funds and instead, Hernandez used the majority of the investors funds to pay existing investors their promised returns and diverted the remaining funds for his own benefit, for the benefit of his wife, and into his other business ventures, including several companies charged as relief defendants in the Commissions action. The Commission previously obtained judgments against Hernandezs companies charged in the complaint.

GEIGER CONCLUDES MARKET MANIPULATION CASES</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that a federal district court in Colorado has entered a final judgment, by consent, against Eugene C. Geiger of Parker, Colorado, in connection with two related stock manipulation schemes. The final judgment against Geiger, a former registered representative, was entered on January 28, 2011. It permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him pay disgorgement of $261,110 plus prejudgment interest thereon in the amount of $221,466 and civil monetary penalty of $220,000. Separately, Geiger also consented to an administrative order barring him from participating in any offering of penny stock and barring him from association with regulated entities engaged in various parts of the securities industry. The litigation originally was filed in federal district court in New York, in 2001, as two separate enforcement actions. In 2010, the cases against Geiger were transferred to the court in Colorado and consolidated for trial., In the Commissions consolidated case, the complaints allege that, between December 1999 and June 2000, Geiger knowingly participated in a scheme with others to manipulate the stock price and trading volume of Absolutefuture.com (AFTI) and Wamex Holdings, Inc. (WAMX). According to the complaints, AFTI and WAMX were penny stocks that traded over-the-counter. As a part of the scheme, Geiger, then a registered representative of a broker-dealer, purchased blocks of these stocks for a brokerage customer who, also, was a defendant in this litigation at then-prevailing market prices in exchange for a secret discount of 50% or higher through the privately-arranged transfer of additional shares from the seller at no cost. In addition, the complaints allege that Geiger further agreed to manipulate the trading volume of the stocks by interposing a straw market-maker into the market portion of the block transaction, which doubled the reported volume of the trades. The complaints also allege that, at the same time as he knowingly arranged these manipulative trades, Geiger sold his customers holdings back into the public markets at ever-increasing, manipulated prices, reaping millions of dollars in gains for his customer and hundreds of thousands of dollars in commissions for his brokerage firm and himself., The complaint in <i>SEC v. Absolutefuture.com, et al.</i> was filed in October 2001 and named 12 defendants and four relief defendants. The complaint in <i>SEC v. Wamex Holdings, Inc., et al.</i> also was filed in October 2001 and named 22 defendants and four relief defendants. The judgment against Geiger concludes the litigation. The cases against all other parties have been previously resolved., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaints, Geiger consented to the entry of a final judgment against him. The final judgment against Geiger enjoins him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and orders him to pay disgorgement of $261,110 plus prejudgment interest thereon in the amount of $221,466 and civil monetary penalty of $220,000., Geiger also consented to the entry of an administrative order barring him from association with any investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, transfer agent, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization and from participating in an offering of penny stock, including engaging in activities with a broker, dealer, or issuer for purposes of issuing, trading, or inducing or attempting to induce the purchase or sale of any penny stock.

21832,2011,[<h3>SEC CHARGES MAXWELL TECHNOLOGIES INC. FOR BRIBERY SCHEME IN CHINA — MAXWELL TO PAY OVER $6.3 MILLION IN DISGORGEMENT AND INTEREST</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it filed a settled civil action against Maxwell Technologies Inc. (Maxwell) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, charging the company with violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) for repeatedly paying bribes to government officials in China to obtain business from several Chinese state-owned entities., The SEC alleges that a Maxwell subsidiary paid over $2.5 million in bribes from 2002 through May 2009 for contracts that generated more than $15 million in revenues for Maxwell, a Delaware corporation headquartered in San Diego that manufactures energy storage and power delivery products. Maxwell has agreed to pay more than $6.3 million to settle the SECs charges., The complaint alleges that from 2002 through May 2009, Maxwell, through its wholly-owned Swiss subsidiary, Maxwell Technologies SA (Maxwell SA), paid over $2.5 million in bribes to officials at several Chinese state-owned entities through a third-party sales agent. The bribes, which were classified in invoices as either Extra Amount or Special Arrangement fees, were made to improperly influence decisions by foreign officials to assist Maxwell in obtaining and retaining sales contracts for high voltage capacitors produced by Maxwell SA. According to the complaint, a Maxwell SA executive approved sales contracts with the Chinese state-owned entities knowing that the purchase orders were inflated by 20% with the intention that the 20% be paid as bribes., According to the complaint, the illicit payments were made with the knowledge and tacit approval of certain former Maxwell officials. For example, the complaint alleges that former management at Maxwell knew of the bribery scheme in late 2002, when an employee indicated that a payment made in connection with a sale in China appeared to be a kick-back, pay-off, bribe, whatever you want to call it, . . . . in violation of US trade laws. A U.S.-based Maxwell executive replied that this is a well know[n] issue and he warned [n]o more emails please., The SEC alleges that Maxwell failed to devise and maintain an effective system of internal controls and improperly recorded the bribes on its books. As a result of this bribery scheme, Maxwell SA was awarded contracts that generated over $15 million in revenues and $5.6 million in profits for Maxwell. These sales and profits helped Maxwell offset losses that it incurred to develop new products now expected to become Maxwells future source of revenue growth. Maxwell accounted for the bribe payments as sales commission expenses in its financials. Maxwell made corrections in its Form 10-Q filing for the quarter ended March 31, 2009 to reclassify the kickbacks as a reduction in revenue., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SECs complaint, Maxwell consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins the company from future violations of Sections 30A, 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, orders the company to pay $5,654,576 in disgorgement, and $696,314 in prejudgment interest to be paid in two installments over one year. The order also requires the company to comply with certain undertakings regarding its FCPA compliance program. Maxwell cooperated in the investigation. In a related criminal proceeding, Maxwell has reached a settlement with the United States Department of Justice in which Maxwell has agreed to pay an $8 million criminal penalty in three installments over approximately two years., The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Department of Justices Criminal Division — Fraud Section, in its investigation, which is continuing.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr21832.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The SEC alleges that each scheme was primarily organized and devised by one or all of the following:, In a parallel criminal proceeding, the Department of Justice today unsealed an indictment against Berger, charging him with one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and wire fraud. Previously, in related criminal actions, Hui and Tribble pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud, mail fraud and to violate the CAN-SPAM Act, as well as to committing wire fraud and engaging in money laundering for their roles in the scheme to artificially inflate the prices of the securities of several companies, including China World Trade. Hui and Tribble were each sentenced to 51 months in prison for their actions., The SEC also charged the following corporate insiders for their participation in the pump-and-dump schemes and for engaging in a fraudulent scheme to conceal the sales of millions of shares of their companies securities:, The three companies charged are China Digital, Global Peopleline, and m-Wise., The SEC alleges that at various times between January 2005 and December 2007, each of the defendants engaged in one or more schemes to pump up the price and volume of the securities of one or more of the companies by paying for false spam e-mail campaigns., According to the SECs complaint, the false spam e-mails lured investors into the market and drove up demand in the stocks by, among other things, touting non-existent IPOs and acquisitions, presenting an unrealistic picture of the companies business prospects, providing baseless share price projections, or including false disclaimers. The defendants then dumped millions of shares of these securities into the hyped market through nominee brokerage accounts they opened with Berger, reaping millions of dollars in profits. All eight companies stocks were dually quoted on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board and Pink Sheets., The SECs complaint alleges that Tribble masterminded the pump-and-dump schemes with respect to five of the companies, and arranged for the spam e-mail campaigns for two other companies. Berger, a long-time friend of Tribble, played a central role in the schemes by arranging for the pump and dump of m-Wise and facilitating the sales of millions of shares in all eight companies through nominee brokerage accounts. John Hui and Bernard Chan also played key roles in the fraudulent schemes by finding U.S. public shell companies to use in bringing private Chinese companies public through reverse mergers.

According to the Commissions complaint, Scott Farah and his mortgage brokerage company, Financial Resources Mortgage, Inc. offered investors annual returns of 12% to 20% and falsely represented to investors that invested monies would be segregated and invested in the specific project that the investors had agreed to fund. The complaint alleged that Donald Dodge and his unlicensed loan servicing company, C L and M, Inc., serviced all loans brokered through Scott Farah and Financial Resources Mortgage, Inc. The complaint further alleged that the Defendants did not segregate investor money and used it for a variety of purposes not authorized by the offering documents, including paying returns to earlier investors, paying personal expenses, paying operating expenses of Financial Resources Mortgage, Inc. and C L and M, Inc., and donating money to the Center Harbor Christian Church, a church founded and owned by Scott Farahs father, and of which Scott Farah was treasurer., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, Farah, Dodge, Financial Resources Mortgage, Inc., and C L and M, Inc. consented to final judgments entered by the Court.

The SEC alleges that Curtis Peterson and Eric Maher solicited investors nationwide in late 2009 on behalf of Express International, LLC, a Pasadena-based entity managed by Peterson and his wife. Promising exorbitant returns of as much as 1000 percent per month, Peterson and Maher falsely told investors that their investments would be pooled to purchase international bank instruments that would then be “leased” to “top 25” international banks willing to pay substantial fees for the right to place the instruments on their balance sheets for a brief period of time., According to the SEC’s complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, Peterson and Maher were aided and abetted by Ronald White, a California-based attorney. White controlled the trust account into which investors were instructed to wire their monies. White then converted those funds into cashier’s checks payable to Peterson, thus allowing Peterson to dissipate investor funds for undisclosed purposes., The SEC alleges that about 20 percent of investor funds were wired to a bank in Hungary, but none of that money was ever used to purchase any international bank instruments.

The judgment includes more than $2.4 million in disgorgement of proceeds from illegal stock sales, nearly $900,000 in prejudgment interest and a $5,000 civil penalty.  This final remedies judgment follows the Court’s November 2009 order granting in part the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (“Commission”) motion for partial summary judgment against the defendants, finding that the defendants were liable for the unlawful sale of SpatiaLight stock and Olins’ subsequent failure to report those sales.  In March 2010, the Court denied the defendants’ motion for reconsideration of that ruling.   , The Commission’s complaint alleged that, in 2005, Olins and Argyle illegally sold over 400,000 shares of SpatiaLight stock, and that Olins failed to disclose those sales and also made misrepresentations about the stock in a SpatiaLight Form 8-K.  In finding the defendants liable for violations of Section 5, the Court found that Olins was an affiliate of SpatiaLight, and that the defendants were not eligible for an exemption from registering their sales under Exchange Act Section 4(1) because they were underwriters.  Moreover, the Court found that the defendants did not qualify for the Rule 144 safe harbor because they did not file notice of their sales, or hold the stock for the required length of time.  The Court specifically rejected defendants’ argument that they should not be deemed underwriters because they met some, but not all, of the Rule 144 requirements.  The Court further found that the amount of disgorgement should include all proceeds obtained from the unlawful sale of the securities, and refused the defendants’ request to offset the disgorgement amount in recognition of legitimate services provided by Olins to SpatiaLight.  The Court also ordered the full amount of prejudgment interest sought by the Commission because the defendants had use of their ill-gotten gains since the time of the illegal sales.     , In conduct unrelated to Olins’ illegal stock sales, the Commission also alleged in its complaint that Olins forged auditor consents on two sets of SpatiaLight registration statements in July 2005, and that he engaged in insider trading in August 2005 and February 2006.  In November 2009 and June 2010, Olins, without admitting or denying the Commission’s allegations, consented to judgments enjoining him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5.  In addition, Olins was enjoined from violating the books and records, internal controls and beneficial ownership reporting provisions of the securities laws, including Sections 13(a), 13(b), 13(b)(5), 13(d), 14(a) and 16(a) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-14, 13d-2(a), 14a-9 and 16a-3.  Finally, Olins also consented to a permanent officer and director bar and $180,000 civil penalty. , The Commission’s complaint also sought injunctive relief against SpatiaLight for violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b), 17(a), 13(a), 13(b) and 14(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 14a-9 thereunder.  The Court entered a default judgment against the company, now in bankruptcy, in July 2008.

Lawton and Crossroad Capital Management, LLC, the owner and investment adviser to hedge fund Paramount Partners, LP.  Lawton was ordered to pay disgorgement of $1,758,788 plus prejudgment interest and a civil penalty in the amount of $100,000.  Crossroad was ordered to pay disgorgement of $2,075,670 plus prejudgment interest and a civil penalty in the amount of $500,000.

The Commissions complaint alleged that Paramount was a hedge fund to which approximately 50 to 60 investors provided $9 million.  The complaint alleged that Lawton and Crossroad fraudulently misrepresented Paramounts assets and returns to investors.  The complaint further alleged that in January 2009, Defendants sent account statements to investors that reflected investments totaling about $17 million as of December 31, 2008.  In fact, Paramount allegedly had about $5.3 million of assets at that time and less than $2 million in January 2009., On February 25, 2009, the Defendants voluntarily consented to the entry of a Preliminary Injunctive Order and Asset Freeze.

McKeown and Ryan received millions of shares of touted companies through their two corporations, Downshire and Meadow Vista, as compensation for their touting.

Tyson de Mexico initially concealed the improper payments by putting the veterinarians’ wives on its payroll while they performed no services for the company.  The wives were later removed from the payroll and payments were then reflected in invoices submitted to Tyson de Mexico by one of the veterinarians for “services.”  Tyson de Mexico paid the veterinarians a total of $100,311.  It was not until two years after Tyson Foods’ officials first learned about the subsidiary’s illicit payments that its counsel instructed Tyson de Mexico to cease making the payments., The SEC alleges that in connection with these improper payments, Tyson Foods failed to keep accurate books and records and failed to implement a system of effective internal controls to prevent the salary payments to phantom employees and the payment of illicit invoices.  The improper payments were improperly recorded as legitimate expenses in Tyson de Mexico’s books and records and included in Tyson de Mexico’s reported financial results for fiscal years 2004, 2005 and 2006.  Tyson de Mexico’s financial results were, in turn, a component of Tyson Foods’ consolidated financial statements filed with the SEC for those years., Without admitting or denying the SEC’s allegations, Tyson Foods consented to the entry of a final judgment ordering disgorgement plus pre-judgment interest of more than $1.2 million and permanently enjoining it from violating the anti-bribery, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the FCPA, codified as Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Perry and former CFOs A. Scott Keys and S. Blair Abernathy participated in the filing of false and misleading disclosures about the financial stability of IndyMac and its main subsidiary, IndyMac Bank F.S.B.  The three executives regularly received internal reports about IndyMac’s deteriorating capital and liquidity positions in 2007 and 2008, but failed to ensure adequate disclosure of that information to investors as IndyMac sold millions of dollars in new stock., IndyMac Bank was a federally-chartered thrift institution regulated by the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) and headquartered in Pasadena, Calif.  The OTS closed the bank on July 11, 2008, and placed it under FDIC receivership.  IndyMac filed for bankruptcy protection later that month., According to the SEC’s complaints filed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, Perry and Keys defrauded new and existing IndyMac shareholders by making false and misleading statements about IndyMac’s financial condition in its 2007 annual report and in offering materials for the company’s sale of $100 million in new stock to investors.  In early February 2008, IndyMac projected that it would return to profitability and continue to pay preferred dividends in 2008 without having to raise new capital.  In late February 2008, Perry and Keys knew that contrary to the rosy projections released just two weeks earlier, IndyMac had begun raising new capital to protect IndyMac’s capital and liquidity positions.  Specifically, Perry and Keys regularly received information that IndyMac’s financial condition was rapidly deteriorating and authorized new stock sales as a result, yet they fraudulently failed to fully disclose IndyMac’s precarious financial condition in the 2007 annual report and the offering documents for the new stock sales.  , The SEC further alleges that Perry knew that rating downgrades in April 2008 on bonds held by IndyMac Bank had exacerbated its capital and liquidity positions to the extent that IndyMac had no choice but to suspend future preferred dividend payments by no later than May 2, 2008.  This material information was not disclosed in IndyMac’s ongoing stock offerings.  Perry also failed to disclose in various SEC filings or a May 2008 earnings conference call that IndyMac would not have been “well-capitalized” at the end of its first quarter without departing from its traditional method for risk-weighting subprime assets and backdating an $18 million capital contribution.  , According to the SEC’s complaint, Abernathy replaced Keys as IndyMac’s CFO in April 2008.  He similarly made false and misleading statements in the offering documents used in selling new IndyMac stock to investors despite regularly receiving internal reports about IndyMac’s deteriorating capital and liquidity positions.  , The SEC also alleges that in summer 2007 while serving as IndyMac’s executive vice president in charge of specialty lending, Abernathy made false and misleading statements about the quality of the loans in six IndyMac offerings of RMBS totaling $2.5 billion.  Abernathy received internal reports each month revealing that 12 to 18 percent of IndyMac’s loans contained misrepresentations regarding important loan and borrower characteristics.  However, the RMBS offering documents stated that nothing had come to IndyMac’s attention that any loan included in the offering contained a misrepresentation.  The SEC alleges that Abernathy failed to ensure that the quality of IndyMac’s loans was accurately disclosed and failed to disclose that information had come to IndyMac’s attention about loans containing misrepresentations. , Abernathy agreed to settle the SEC’s charges without admitting or denying the allegations.  He consented to the entry of an order that permanently restrains and enjoins him from violating Section 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act and requires him to pay a $100,000 penalty, $25,000 in disgorgement, and prejudgment interest of $1,592.26.  Abernathy also consented to the issuance of an administrative order pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the SEC’s Rules of Practice, suspending him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an accountant.  He has the right to apply for reinstatement after two years., The SEC’s complaint charges Perry and Keys with knowingly violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and aiding and abetting IndyMac’s violations of its periodic reporting requirements under Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 thereunder.  Perry also is charged with aiding and abetting IndyMac’s reporting violations under Exchange Act Rules 13a-11 and 13a-13.

As alleged in the complaint, Devlin had misappropriated the inside information from his wife who was employed by a public relations firm working on the deals., According to the complaint, Glover, an investment adviser and one of Devlin’s clients, traded on Devlin’s tips about five deals.  The complaint alleges that Devlin also tipped his trading partner, Bowers, about three upcoming acquisitions.  As alleged in the complaint, Bowers then tipped his client, Faulhaber, who was affiliated with a registered broker-dealer.  Faulhaber traded in three deals, and kicked back cash to Bowers.  The complaint further charges Holzer, Devlin’s friend and a former tax associate in the New York City office of an international law firm, with trading on Devlin’s tips in at least three deals.  According to the complaint, Devlin and Holzer also agreed that Holzer would arrange for the purchase of shares for Devlin’s benefit so Devlin could profit from the nonpublic information but evade scrutiny.  , Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Glover, Bowers, Faulhaber and Holzer settled the Commission’s insider trading charges.

21856,2011,[<h3>SEC CHARGES MONROE L. BEACHY IN $33 MILLION OFFERING FRAUD THAT TARGETED AMISH</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on February 15, 2011, it filed a civil injunction action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio charging Monroe L. Beachy with conducting an unregistered and fraudulent offering of securities that raised more than $33 million. The SEC alleges that Beachy, a 77-year-old Amish man from Sugarcreek, Ohio, targeted his fellow Amish as investors in his fraudulent offering., The SEC’s complaint alleges that from as early as 1986 through June 2010, Beachy, doing business as A&amp;M Investments, raised at least $33 million from more than 2,600 investors through the offer and sale of investment contracts. The vast majority of Beachy’s investors were Amish. Beachy enticed investors by promising interest rates that were greater than banks were offering at the time. Many of Beachy’s investors treated their investment accounts with Beachy like money market accounts, from which they could withdraw their money at any time. Beachy told his investors that their money would be used to purchase risk-free U.S. government securities, which would generate returns for the investors. In reality, Beachy used the money to make speculative investments in high yield (junk) bonds, mutual funds, and stocks., The complaint further alleges that Beachy suffered significant losses in investor principal, which Beachy hid from his investors. Beachy mailed his investors monthly account statements showing fabricated rates of return and exaggerated account balances. As of June 2010, Beachy’s investors believed, based on the fraudulent monthly statements Beachy had sent them, that they had approximately $33 million invested with Beachy. In reality, less than $18 million of investor money remained. Beachy filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy on June 30, 2010, and his assets are currently under the control of a Chapter 7 bankruptcy trustee appointed by the bankruptcy court., The SEC’s complaint charges Beachy with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Beachy has agreed to settle the SEC’s charges without admitting or denying the allegations. Beachy has consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC’s proposed judgment does not impose a civil penalty based on Beachy’s financial condition., The settlement is subject to the approval of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr21856.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

21858,2011,[<h3>SEC CHARGES FORMER PATENT AGENT AND HIS BROTHER IN INSIDER TRADING SCHEME</h3>],"[On February 15, 2011, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed an amended complaint charging a San Diego-based patent agent and his brother with illegally tipping inside information regarding two biotechnology companies, as part of a larger insider trading scheme. According to the amended complaint, Aaron J. Scalia, a former patent agent for Sequenom, Inc., tipped material, non-public information regarding Sequenom and another biotechnology company, to his brother Stephen J. Scalia. Stephen Scalia then tipped his fraternity brother, Brett A. Cohen, who, in turn, tipped his uncle, David V. Myers. Myers traded on the illegally obtained inside information, garnering more than $600,000 in illicit profits, and provided Stephen Scalia with $14,000 in cash kickbacks., The SEC filed its initial charges in the case in December 2010 against Cohen and Myers. In its amended complaint filed yesterday in federal court in San Diego, the SEC charged the Scalia brothers. In a parallel criminal proceeding, on February 15, 2011, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of California filed criminal charges against the Scalia brothers., According to the SEC’s amended complaint, Aaron Scalia learned about two corporate events involving Sequenom prior to the public release of the information:, , , The SEC’s amended complaint alleges that Aaron Scalia conducted intellectual property due diligence with respect to the EXAS transaction, and that he was the patent agent assigned to Sequenom’s Down syndrome test., The amended complaint further alleges that Aaron Scalia tipped material, non-public information about the EXAS transaction to his brother, Stephen Scalia, who relayed it to his fraternity brother Cohen. For example, Stephen Scalia sent Cohen an e-mail asking, <i>“[a]ny word related to Blu H@rsesh0e? La Jolla says the times are ripe.”</i> The movie <i>Wall Street</i> uses the phrase, “Blue Horseshoe loves Anacot Steel,” as a code for insider trading. “La Jolla” references the fact that Aaron Scalia lived and worked near La Jolla, Calif., The SEC alleges that after at least a dozen phone calls among the scheme’s four participants in the succeeding days, Myers made his first-ever purchase of EXAS securities, buying 15,000 shares. It was the first stock purchase in Myers’s brokerage account since at least January 2007. Myers later purchased an additional 20,000 shares of EXAS stock before Sequenom publicly announced after the markets closed on Jan. 9, 2009, that it planned to acquire EXAS. EXAS stock rose 50 percent by the close of the markets on January 10 on increased trading volume of 466 percent. During the next few weeks, Myers sold nearly all of his EXAS stock for illegal profits of more than $34,000, and then sent a cash kickback of $4,000 to Cohen, who delivered it to Stephen Scalia as payment for the EXAS stock tip., The SEC’s amended complaint alleges that Aaron Scalia also tipped his brother ahead of Sequenom’s announcement that investors could no longer rely on previously disclosed data related to its Down syndrome test. The announcement caused Sequenom’s stock price to drop by more than 75 percent in one day. Stephen Scalia tipped Cohen just prior to the company’s announcement, and Cohen immediately tipped Myers through a series of communications, including a call he placed from a pay phone near his workplace. Myers quickly purchased risky Sequenom put options just minutes before the markets closed on April 29, 2009. The next morning, Myers sold his entire Sequenom position for illegal profits of more than $570,000. Approximately one month later, Myers personally delivered $10,000 in cash to Stephen Scalia as payment for the Sequenom tip., The SEC’s amended complaint charges all four defendants with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC is seeking permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of illicit profits with prejudgment interest, and financial penalties against all four defendants., The SEC thanks the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of California and the Federal Bureau of Investigation for their cooperation and assistance in this matter.

While there, Ni is alleged to have overheard his sister taking phone calls during which she used words such as “due diligence file,” “potential buyer” and “merger structure.” Ni then began purchasing Bare stock and call options, ultimately spending almost $165,000 over the next month acquiring securities in his and his father’s brokerage accounts.

His son, Peter Kohler, as the representative of Kohler’s heirs, subsequently consented to be substituted for his father as a defendant in the pending action. Neither Peter Kohler nor relief defendant Dermendjiev were charged with federal securities law violations. The Final Judgments order the Defendants collectively to pay disgorgement of $374,655. The Defendants and Relief Defendant consented to the entry of Final Judgments against them, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission’s First Amended Complaint, except as to jurisdiction., In its First Amended Complaint, filed on June 8, 2009, the Commission alleged that Kohler, a Swiss national, purchased out-of-the-money call options in CNS in his personal account and in an account in the name of Swiss Real Estate, a company controlled by Kohler, based on material non-public information relating to the companys potential acquisition. The Commission also alleged that Kohler purchased call option contracts on CNS stock for Dermendjievs account just prior to announcement of the acquisition of CNS and sold these options immediately after announcement of the CNS acquisition. The First Amended Complaint named Dermendjiev, a Bulgarian national, as a relief defendant., The First Amended Complaint superseded the Commissions original complaint in this action, which was filed on an emergency basis against purchasers of CNS call options whose identities were not, at that time, known to the Commission. <i>See Securities and Exchange Commission v.

The SEC alleges that Narwal funded and controlled the entire fraudulent campaign. He directed Beck, Hill, and Downs to hype the stock by telling investors that Pax Clean Energy would be the “next Google” and its price would rise to $100 per share by the end of the year. The SEC contends that by April 2009, the defendants successfully pumped the stock price to an all-time high of $11.24 per share. During this time, and without disclosing to investors, Narwal and Del Mar Corporate Communications repeatedly sold Pax Clean Energy shares — the very securities they were recommending investors to buy – reaping proceeds of almost $455,000 and $140,000, respectively., The SEC’s complaint charges all four defendants with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Defendant Ricci simultaneously offered to settle with the Commission in a consent submitted for the Court’s consideration.  , According to the complaint, CO2 Tech Ltd. was a sham company without significant assets or operations whose stock prices were quoted in the Pink Sheets.

21865,2011,[<h3>SEC CHARGES SECURITIES PROFESSIONALS AND TRADERS IN INTERNATIONAL HEDGE FUND PORTFOLIO PUMPING SCHEME</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission charged two securities professionals, a hedge fund trader, and two firms involved in a scheme that manipulated several U.S. microcap stocks and generated more than $63 million in illicit proceeds through stock sales, commissions and sales credits., The SEC alleges that Florian Homm of Spain and Todd M. Ficeto of Malibu, Calif., conducted the scheme through their Beverly Hills, Calif.-based broker-dealer Hunter World Markets Inc. (HWM) with the assistance of Homm’s close associate Colin Heatherington, a trader who lives in Canada. They brought microcap companies public through reverse mergers and manipulated upwards the stock prices of these thinly-traded stocks before selling their shares at inflated prices to eight offshore hedge funds controlled by Homm. Their manipulation of the stock prices allowed Homm to materially overstate by at least $440 million the hedge funds’ performance and net asset values (NAVs) in a fraudulent practice known as “portfolio pumping.”, The SEC additionally brought administrative proceedings against HWM’s trader and chief compliance officer, who each agreed to settle the SEC’s charges against them., According to the SEC’s complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, Homm along with Ficeto and Heatherington conducted the scheme from September 2005 to September 2007. Homm misused the assets of the hedge funds to allow him, Ficeto, Heatherington and HWM to manipulate upward the prices of the U.S. microcap stocks in which the hedge funds held a position. They used a number of classic manipulative techniques such as placing matched orders, placing orders that marked the close or otherwise set the closing price for the day, and conducting wash sales. This manipulation enabled Ficeto, Homm and Heatherington to generate enormous profits through Ficeto’s and Homm’s co-ownership of HWM and their sale of the microcap stock shares to the hedge funds at inflated prices. Ficeto garnered further illicit profits through his control of Hunter Advisors, LLC, which directed the investment activities of a “fund of funds” that also participated in the stock manipulation., The SEC’s complaint alleges that the principal traders at HWM and the London-based hedge funds manager Absolute Capital Management Holdings Limited (ACMH) exchanged hundreds of instant messages (IMs) that were recorded on a secret, alternate messaging system that allowed them to communicate freely without fear that their scheme would be detected by the SEC. As reflected in those secret IM messages, ACMH’s trader (typically Heatherington) under Homm’s direction would instruct Ficeto or HWM’s trader (Tony Ahn) acting under Ficeto’s direction to place matched orders, transactions that marked the close, or wash sales for the purpose of artificially raising or stabilizing the microcap stock prices., The SEC’s complaint charges Ficeto, Homm, Heatherington, and HWM with violating, or aiding and abetting violations of, Sections 10(b) and 15(c)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers Act), and additionally charges Ficeto with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Hunter Advisors with violating Section 206(1) and (2) of the Advisers Act. The SEC’s complaint also charges HWM and Ficeto with recordkeeping violations of Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 17a-4(b)(4) and 17a-8 (HWM only) thereunder.

Wilde and Matrix Holdings LLC, an entity he controls, with orchestrating two fraudulent “high yield” or “prime bank” investment schemes that defrauded investors out of more than $11 million. Wilde is the CEO of Riptide Worldwide, Inc. (“Riptide”), a public company that is quoted on the OTC Market Group Inc.’s OTC Pink quotation service. The SEC alleges that Wilde started the fraudulent schemes when Riptide began experiencing financial difficulties. The SEC also charged Steven E. Woods, Mark A. Gelazela, and entities they control, for participating in the larger of the two schemes, and Bruce H. Haglund, a California-based attorney, for aiding in that scheme., According to the SEC’s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, the first scheme began in April 2008 when Wilde obtained a U.S. Treasury bond with a market value of nearly $5 million from an investor. He secured the investment by knowingly making false and misleading promises of outsized returns from what he claimed was a “private placement program.” Using a credit line obtained with the investor’s bond, Wilde promised to acquire a $100 million financial instrument and to pay the investor $12 million within 5 days as well as a prorated share of proceeds from the private placement program. Wilde also guaranteed the return of the bond if the $12 million payment was not made on time. Wilde (through Matrix) then used the bond to secure a line of credit that he drew down to pay personal expenses, to pay investors, creditors and debt holders of Riptide, and to make failed attempts to acquire fictitious prime bank instruments or to invest in high yield programs. Wilde’s bank closed the credit line after he attempted to deposit a fraudulent financial instrument into the account. After the bond serving as collateral for the credit line was sold, Wilde transferred about $2.1 million to another bank account and exhausted the rest of the investor’s funds. Wilde strung along the investor, continuing to misrepresent the status and whereabouts of the investment, the SEC alleges., The SEC further claims that, beginning in October 2009, Wilde concocted another fraudulent scheme with Woods and Gelazela in the form of a “bank guarantee funding” program using the services of Haglund as escrow attorney. Between October 2009 and mid-March 2010, Woods and Gelazela signed contracts with 24 investors who sent over $6.3 million to Haglund’s trust account. Gelazela raised more than $5 million and Woods raised more than $1 million. The investment contracts stated that a “bank guarantee” with a denomination of at least $100 million would be leased “for the purpose of Private Placement Program enhancements” and fifteen percent of the credit line value would be paid weekly to the investor for a term of 40 weeks. Wilde, Gelazela and Woods later sought to pacify investors with additional misstatements as the scheme unraveled in 2010., According to the SEC, Haglund knowingly and substantially aided and abetted the fraud perpetrated by Wilde, Woods and Gelazela. Haglund controlled the trust account into which investors were instructed to wire their funds. Haglund then wired those funds out of the account according to instructions from Wilde, thus allowing Wilde to utilize funds for undisclosed purposes. Wilde transferred millions of dollars to bank accounts controlled by Gelazela, Woods, Haglund, Wilde and Wilde’s wife. Haglund pocketed nearly $500,000 in “legal services” fees for making wire transfers, payments that were not disclosed to investors. Haglund also knowingly made, and Wilde knowingly authorized, Ponzi-like payments to old investors using new investor deposits., The SEC alleges that Wilde never successfully acquired or leased a single legitimate financial instrument and exhausted all $6.3 million of the investors’ funds, much of which was taken by the defendants in the form of undisclosed fees., None of the defendants charged in the SEC’s enforcement action has ever registered with the SEC<b> </b>to sell securities., The SEC’s complaint alleges that Wilde, Woods, Gelazela and entities they controlled violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; that Woods and Gelazela also violated Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act; and that Haglund aided and abetted the other defendants’ violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. The SEC seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest thereon, financial penalties, and accountings, against each defendant, as well as officer and director bars against Wilde and Haglund., The SEC’s complaint also names Wilde’s wife, Maureen Wilde, Shillelagh Capital Corporation (an entity Wilde controls), and IBalance LLC (an entity partially owned by Gelazela) as relief defendants.

The judgment requires Finbar to disgorge ill-gotten gains of $9,492,744.95 plus prejudgment interest of $2,853,986.55 within ten days of the filing of the receiver’s final accounting in this action.  Pursuant to a plan of distribution to be submitted by the receiver and approved by the Court, Finbar shall disgorge all of the funds and assets of the receivership estate, if any, less Court-approved fees and expenses of the receiver.  On May 11, 2010, the Court entered a judgment of permanent injunction and other relief against Tringham.  The judgment enjoins Tringham from violating the antifraud and the broker-dealer registration provisions of the federal securities laws, and specifies that Tringham shall pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest thereon, and a civil penalty in amounts set by the Court upon motion of the Commission.  Tringham consented to the entry of the permanent injunction without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission’s complaint., The Commission’s complaint alleged that Finbar and Tringham were operating as an unregistered broker-dealer and engaged in a variety of conduct which operated as a fraud and deceit on investors.

Goldfarb of Larkspur, Calif., and his company Baystar Capital Management LLC (BCM) instead diverted the cash to other entities he controlled, ultimately funding a real estate venture and a San Francisco record company. Goldfarb also comingled investor funds in a bank account which he used to pay for unauthorized personal expenses including entertainment and charitable donations., According to the SEC’s complaint filed in federal district court in San Francisco, Goldfarb and BCM were able to carry out their fraud in part because the investment was maintained in a “side pocket” into which investors in the hedge fund – Baystar Capital II, L.P. – had limited visibility. A side pocket is a type of account that hedge funds use to separate particular investments that are typically illiquid from the remainder of the investments in the fund. Goldfarb’s side pocket investment became profitable in 2006, but he diverted the proceeds for other uses rather than paying the fund’s investors. None of his transactions were authorized by the fund’s partnership agreement or offering documents., According to the SEC’s complaint, Goldfarb and BCM concealed the fraud for several years by providing investors with false account statements showing no gains had been realized in the side pocket. This falsely indicated that the side pocket investment had not yet distributed any profits to the fund, and investors were unable to determine that they were entitled to distributions. Generally, investors can only withdraw their side pocket investments once the underlying position has been sold or liquidated. This helps ensure fairness by limiting the ability of an early-redeeming investor to withdraw a disproportionate share of the fund’s liquid assets., The SEC also alleges that Goldfarb also took steps to conceal the side pocket profits from the fund’s third party administrator. For example, he directed money to the bank account of an entity that no longer existed., Without admitting or denying the SEC’s allegations, Goldfarb and BCM consented to permanent injunctions against violations of Section 206(1), (2) and (4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and to pay disgorgement of $12,112,416 and prejudgment interest of $1,967,371, which will be distributed to the fund’s investors.

The Commission alleges that, after misappropriating confidential information from his employer regarding a pending merger agreement involving NASDAQ-listed Cambridge Display Technology, Inc. (“Cambridge”), Seib purchased Cambridge stock and call options, ultimately reaping profits in excess of $71,000., The Commission’s complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, alleges that between April and July 2007, Seib purchased 20 call options and 10,514 shares of Cambridge stock prior to a public announcement on July 31, 2007, that Cambridge would be acquired by Sumitomo Chemical Company, Ltd.  According to the complaint, at the time of Seib’s illegal trades, Seib’s boss was the principal of an unregistered investment adviser, as well as an outside director of Cambridge.  The Complaint alleges that Seib had access to, and viewed, confidential merger-related e-mails received by his boss, and that Seib first purchased Cambridge stock and call options on the date that Cambridge and Sumitoma entered into a confidentiality agreement.  The complaint further alleges that Seib’s subsequent purchases of Cambridge stock, in four different accounts, coincided with significant events in the merger negotiations and/or e-mails that his boss received regarding the merger., In its complaint, the Commission charges Seib with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The Commission seeks a permanent injunction against future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as disgorgement of Seib’s ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest and a monetary penalty.

Kobayashi, who worked in UBS’s Walnut Creek, Calif., office, created a pooled investment fund to invest in life insurance policies. But he wound up stealing much of the money to support his extravagant lifestyle. Kobayashi concealed his fraud by liquidating his customers’ securities and funneling the money back to the fund and its investors., In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California today filed criminal charges against Kobayashi arising from some of the same alleged misconduct., According to the SEC complaint filed today in federal district court in Oakland, Kobayashi established Life Settlement Partners LLC (LSP), a fund that invested in life settlement policies. He raised several million dollars from his UBS customers for the fund. Beginning in early 2006, Kobayashi used LSP’s bank accounts as his personal piggy bank, spending at least $1.4 million in investor funds on expensive cars, prostitutes, and large gambling debts., The SEC alleges that in an attempt to repay LSP and its investors before they discovered his theft, Kobayashi induced several of his other UBS customers to liquidate securities in their UBS accounts and transfer the proceeds of those sales to entities that he controlled. In this manner, he stole an additional $1.9 million from these investors., Kobayashi, who lives in Livermore, Calif., agreed to settle the SEC’s charges against him without admitting or denying the allegations.

Ga.)</h3>]","[On March 3, 2011, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed an action against Ian J. McCarthy, the President and Chief Executive Officer of Beazer Homes USA, Inc., an Atlanta, Georgia-based homebuilder, seeking to recover bonuses and other incentive-based and equity-based compensation and stock sale profits received while the Company was committing accounting fraud. , The Commission’s enforcement action charges McCarthy, of Atlanta, Georgia, with violations of Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Section 304 requires reimbursement by chief executive officers and chief financial officers of certain compensation and stock sale profits they earned while their companies were in material non-compliance with financial reporting requirements due to misconduct, as well as profits from stock sales during that same period. According to the SECs complaint against McCarthy, Beazer was required to prepare accounting restatements for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 and the first three quarters of fiscal 2006 due to its fraudulent misconduct.  This misconduct consisted of a manipulation of Beazer’s land development and house cost-to-complete accounts to increase income, and the improper recording of certain model home financing transactions as sales, again to increase Beazer’s income.  McCarthy was not charged with the underlying misconduct or alleged to have otherwise violated the federal securities laws.  , Without admitting or denying the Commission’s allegations, McCarthy agreed to reimburse Beazer $6,479,281 in cash, 40,103 restricted stock units (or its equivalent), and 78,763 shares of restricted stock (or its equivalent). This reimbursement represents McCarthy’s entire fiscal year 2006 incentive bonus ($5,706,949 in cash and 40,103 in restricted stock units), $772,332 in stock sale profits, and 78,763 shares of restricted stock granted in 2006.  The settlement with McCarthy is subject to court approval.   , This is the third enforcement action in the SECs investigation into Beazer’s accounting misconduct. In September 2008, the Commission issued an Order that instituted cease-and-desist proceedings and found that in certain periods between 2000 and 2007, Beazer fraudulently misstated its financial statements for the purpose of improperly managing its quarterly and annual earnings. Specifically, the Order stated that the Company managed its earnings during the period through the use of improper land inventory and housing accruals or reserves, and, beginning in fiscal 2006, improperly recognized income from certain model home financing transactions. Beazer consented to the issuance of the Order without admitting or denying any of the findings.  In July 2009, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action against Michael T. Rand, Beazer’s former Chief Accounting Officer, for conducting the fraudulent earnings management scheme and for misleading Beazer’s outside auditors and internal Beazer accountants in order to conceal his wrongdoing.

During the SEC’s investigation in December 2010 and January 2011, Illarramendi attempted to hide the fact that his hedge funds were missing assets by providing the SEC staff with a false letter from an accountant in Venezuela that purported to verify the existence of approximately $275 million in assets held by one of the funds. Those assets do not exist., According to the SEC’s amended complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut, Illarramendi is the majority owner of the Michael Kenwood Group LLC – a holding company for investment adviser Michael Kenwood Capital Management LLC among other entities. Through this adviser entity, Illarramendi manages several hedge funds, including one that purportedly held up to $540 million in assets. The SEC’s complaint alleges that due to Illarramendi’s misappropriation and his Ponzi activity, the funds hold assets worth substantially less than that amount., Since the filing of the original complaint on Jan. 14, 2011, the Honorable Janet Bond Arterton, U.S. District Judge for the District of Connecticut, entered an order on Jan. 28, 2011, freezing the assets of Illarramendi and his firm. On Feb. 3, 2011, Judge Arterton appointed John J. Carney of Baker Hostetler LLP as the receiver in the case., The SEC’s complaint charges Illarramendi and Michael Kenwood Capital Management, LLC, with violating Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.

According to the Complaint, Radius and DiGiorgio represented to Ginnie Mae, and to investors in 15 separate prospectuses, that the residential loans underlying the securities were, or would be, insured by the Federal Housing Administration (“FHA”) as required to receive Ginnie-Mae’s guarantee., The SEC alleges that Radius and DiGiorgio’s representations about the insurability of the underlying loans were false and misleading as the vast majority, more than 100 of the 154 underlying loans, were not, and could not, be FHA insured. According to the Complaint, Radius never even applied for FHA insurance for most of the uninsured loans and failed to submit the up-front mortgage insurance premiums it had collected from borrowers at closing to the FHA which were required for the loans to be insured. Even if Radius and DiGiorgio had applied for FHA insurance and properly submitted the mortgage insurance premiums, the uninsured loans could not have been insured because the borrowers failed to meet FHA’s debt-to-income, credit history, employment history, and other underwriting requirements., The SEC alleges that many of the mortgages backing Radius’ securities quickly fell into default. In October 2006, Radius correspondingly defaulted on its pass-through payments to the investors holding the mortgage-backed securities. As a result, Ginnie Mae was required to pay investors the remaining principal balance on each uninsured loan that was in default, thereby incurring several million dollars in losses. In addition, investors holding the Radius securities lost interest income due to the unexpectedly high rate of prepayment of principal (by Ginnie Mae) as the Radius loans fell into default., The SEC’s complaint charges Radius and DiGiorgio with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.

Dawson purportedly operated Dawson Trading as a pooled investment vehicle to invest in securities including, stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies, and options for family and friends. The SEC alleges that Dawson used Dawson Trading to perpetrate a fraudulent offering scheme through which he raised approximately $3.8 million. The SEC further alleges that Dawson, after misappropriating confidential information from a family member regarding a pending acquisition of SPSS Inc. by International Business Machines Corporation (“IBM”)¸ caused Dawson Trading to purchase call options of SPSS, reaping profits of $437,770., The complaint alleges that from October 2004 through December 2009, Dawson used Dawson Trading to perpetrate a fraudulent offering scheme through which he raised approximately $3.8 million from 31 investors. Dawson offered investors promissory notes which purportedly provided a guaranteed interest rate, generally 5% compounded quarterly, plus a certain percentage of profits made with the investor’s funds. Contrary to the representations Dawson made to investors, instead of investing the $3.8 million in safe investments, Dawson misappropriated approximately $2.1 million of investors’ monies for his own personal expenses and purposes, and lost approximately $945,000 from trading securities. Despite having never invested the funds or losing the funds that were invested, Dawson provided false quarterly account statements to investors which showed significant returns. In addition, when investors redeemed their investments, Dawson, in the nature of a Ponzi scheme, paid them with other investors’ funds based upon the inflated returns reflected in the previously issued false account statements., The SEC’s complaint further alleges that between June 4, 2009 and July 22, 2009, Dawson caused Dawson Trading to purchase call options of SPSS in advance of a July 28, 2009 announcement of an acquisition of SPSS by IBM, after learning from a family member and close friend and neighbor of a then-current officer of SPSS, that SPSS would be acquired by IBM. The family member and the officer routinely shared confidences regarding personal and business matters, including information concerning the pending acquisition of SPSS. Dawson began purchasing SPSS call options shortly after the family member sought financial advice from Dawson as to whether the family member could do anything with the confidential information he had learned from the officer., The SEC’s complaint charges Dawson with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.

The Commission’s amended complaint, filed on December 11, 2008, alleged that for fiscal year 2000 and the first two quarters of fiscal year 2001, StarMedia’s books and records, and its filings with the Commission, misstated the quality and amount of the company’s revenue.

Parrish, and his company, IV Capital, solicited investors for his “Trading Program” and promised returns of at least 60% per year. The Commission alleges that investors received monthly payments which Parrish told them were profits from successful trading. However, the majority of funds that came into IV Capital bank accounts were from new investors, not from any actual profit-generating activity. The complaint alleges that Parrish, who had no other employment or legitimate source of income, funded his personal life at the expense of investors, misappropriating at least $780,000 for his personal benefit., According to the complaint, Parrish told investors in the Trading Program that their money would be held safely in an escrow account, and that the IV Capital traders would use the value of that account, but not the actual funds, to obtain leveraged funds to purchase and sell bank notes. According to Parrish, the trading was profitable enough that he was able to guarantee returns of five percent per month – or 60% per year – to investors. Parrish claimed that he had successfully run the Trading Program since 1996, generated profits every single month of that time, and that he had $22 million under management., Parrish is a recidivist who was a named defendant in a previous SEC action. In April 2005 the SEC brought an action against Parrish for his involvement in a Prime Bank Scheme, <i>SEC v. Larry Michael Parrish, et al.</i>, 05 Civ. 1031 (D. Md., filed April 14, 2005).

Ginder, a defendant in a civil injunctive action filed by the Commission in August 2006. The Commissions Complaint charged that Ginder, 47, of New Fairfield, Connecticut, was a registered representatives associated with broker-dealer Prudential Securities, Inc., who defrauded mutual fund companies and the funds shareholders in order to place market timing trades at mutual funds that were trying to detect and block such trading. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions Complaint, Ginder consented to the entry of a final judgment enjoining him from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $300,000., The Commissions Complaint alleged that, from at least January 2001 until September 2003, certain mutual fund companies tried to detect and block market timing activity. The Complaint alleged that Ginder defrauded mutual fund companies by hiding his and his hedge fund customers identities through the use of multiple customer account numbers and broker identification numbers. The Complaint alleged that, among other deceptive practices, when mutual funds succeeded in identifying and attempted to block Ginders trading activity under one customer account or broker identification number, Ginder often simply switched to a different customer account for the same customer or a different broker identification number and continued placing market timing trades., The final judgment imposed a permanent injunction prohibiting Ginder from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Custable, Jr. from November 2001 until March 2003, when the SEC brought an emergency enforcement action and obtained a TRO shutting it down. Judgments in this case have previously been entered against 14 defendants and three relief defendants. Heesch, Calkins, Nordling and Widen were the last four named defendants remaining in the SEC’s lawsuit., The Commission’s complaint alleged that Custable and at least 17 others violated various registration, antifraud and reporting provisions of the federal securities laws through the use of unregistered and fraudulent penny stock offerings. The complaint alleged that Custable accomplished this by obtaining and dumping massive quantities of improperly registered or unregistered shares of stock of at least seven different penny stock companies on the general public, generating net proceeds to Custable of at least $4.3 million. The complaint alleged that Custable obtained stock through fraudulent Form S-8 registrations (normally intended to provide for the issuance of stock as compensation to employees and consultants), fraudulent manipulations of Rule 144(k) holding requirements for resales of restricted stock. The complaint alleged that the penny stock companies received substantial financing from Custable in exchange for providing these massive blocks of unregistered or improperly registered stock that Custable dumped on the market through various nominee accounts held in the names of persons or entities he employed or controlled., Heesch, Calkins and Nordling were CEOs of three of the penny stock companies involved in the fraudulent scheme. The complaint alleged that each of them engaged in fraudulent conduct in furtherance of the scheme, including knowingly or recklessly entering into sham consulting agreements, signing fraudulent Form S-8 registration statements, and providing false declarations concerning past compensation purportedly owed by their companies in order to justify the issuance of large blocks of stock and to manipulate the Rule 144(k) holding requirements for the issuances so that the transfer agents for these issuers would remove restrictive legends on the shares, allowing Custable to then freely trade them. Widen was an employee of Custable during the scheme. The complaint alleged that he violated the registration provisions of the federal securities laws by signing bogus consulting agreements and opening nominee accounts for Custable, enabling Custable to conceal his involvement in the scheme., The judgments against Heesch, Calkins and Nordling, which were entered with their consent and without their admitting or denying the Commission’s allegations: (i) permanently enjoin them from future violations of the antifraud and registration provisions contained in Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and at Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; (ii) bar them from ever serving as an officer or director of a public company; and (iii) prohibit them from ever again participating in an offering of penny stock. The judgment against Nordling further orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains in the amount of $44,000, plus an additional $25,570 of prejudgment interest. The Court found Calkins liable for disgorgement in the amount of $150,000, plus prejudgment interest of $94,360, but waived payment of these amounts and did not impose a civil penalty based on his sworn Statement of Financial Condition. Based on Heesch’s sworn Statements of Financial Condition, the Court did not impose a civil penalty against him either. The judgment against Widen, also entered with his consent and without his admitting or denying the SEC’s allegations, permanently enjoins him from future violations of the registrations provisions contained in Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act, bars him from participating in any penny stock offering, and orders him to pay a first tier civil penalty of $6,500., In a related criminal proceeding, Custable has pled guilty to various federal charges arising conduct in the scheme, and on June 9, 2009 was sentenced to a prison term of 21 years.,  Calkins and Nordling pled guilty to securities fraud; both were sentenced to 5 years probation., For further information, see <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18057.htm>LR-18057</a> (March 31, 2003), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2010/lr21423.htm>LR-21423</a> (February 23, 2010), and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2010/lr21492.htm>LR-21492</a> (April 19, 2010).<a name=P10_5026></a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr21884.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Juno, Verzili and Rodriguez looted approximately $1.8 million of assets from a hedge fund they manage, misusing it to pay Juno’s operating costs related to payroll, rent, travel, meals, and entertainment. They issued promissory notes to conceal a substantial portion of their misappropriation. Juno, Verzili and Rodriguez also misrepresented the amount of capital that some Juno partners had invested in one of its funds, claiming they had invested millions of dollars when they actually had invested nothing in the funds., According to the SEC’s complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Juno sold securities in client brokerage and commodity accounts and directed 41 separate transfers of cash to Juno’s bank account, claiming falsely that the transfers were reimbursements for expenses Juno had incurred on behalf of the client fund. Verzili and Rodriguez later fabricated and issued nine promissory notes to make it appear that the client fund had invested the money in Juno. But they concealed the so-called investment from the independent directors of the client fund., The SEC’s complaint further alleges that Juno, Verzili and Rodriguez marketed investments in the Juno-advised fund and failed to disclose Juno’s precarious financial condition to investors. They also failed to disclose that Juno owed a client fund a minimum of $1.2 million, which represented the proceeds of the promissory notes. While offering and selling securities in the client fund, Juno repeatedly inflated and misrepresented the amount of assets that Juno managed and claimed at one point that Juno had as much as $200 million under management. Verzili also represented falsely to investors that Juno’s partners had up to $3 million of their own capital invested in a client fund. Juno’s partners had never actually invested any of their own money., The SEC alleges that Juno filed false Forms ADV with the SEC in order to avoid deregistration with the Commission, claiming in those filings that Juno managed $40 million more than it actually did. Verzili and Rodriguez also caused Juno to provide a number of false filings to the SEC that failed to disclose that Juno had engaged in principal transactions with its client and had custody of client assets., The SEC’s complaint alleges violations by Juno, Verzili and Rodriguez of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 203A, 206(1), 206(2), 206(4) and 207 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rules 206(4)-2, 206(4)-4 and 206(4)-8 thereunder.

Durham, chairman James F. Cochran and chief financial officer Rick D. Snow, deceived investors while selling them interest-bearing certificates.  Fair Finance had previously operated for decades as a privately-held consumer finance company.  But under the guise of loans, Durham and Cochran schemed to divert investor proceeds to themselves and others, as well as struggling and unprofitable entities that they controlled.  Durham and Cochran further misused investor funds to buy classic cars and other luxury items to enhance their own lavish lifestyles.  , In a parallel criminal proceeding the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Indiana unsealed criminal charges against Durham, Cochran and Snow for the same alleged misconduct. , As alleged in the complaint, Fair Finance historically raised funds by selling interest-bearing certificates to investors and using the proceeds to purchase and service discounted consumer finance contracts.  Following the 2002 purchase, Durham and Cochran funneled millions of dollars to themselves and their related companies.  By November 2009, Durham, Cochran and their related businesses owed Fair Finance more than $200 million, which accounted for approximately 90 percent of Fair Finance’s total loan portfolio.  , The Commission alleges that Durham and Cochran knew that neither they nor their related companies had the earnings, collateral or other resources to ensure repayment on the purported loans.  As CFO, Snow knew or was reckless in not knowing that neither Durham and Cochran nor their entities could repay the funds they took from Fair Finance.  Nonetheless, they continued to raise hundreds of millions of dollars from investors by using false and misleading financial statements and other information contained in the offering circulars to deceive investors about Fair Finance’s true financial condition.  Ultimately, Durham, Cochran and their related companies never repaid these loans, and they used new investor proceeds to repay earlier investors in the nature of a Ponzi scheme.  , The Commission further alleges that Durham and Cochran also distributed large amounts of money to family members and friends, and misused investor funds to afford mortgages for multiple homes, a $3 million private jet, a $6 million yacht, and classic and exotic cars worth more than $7 million.  They also diverted investor money to cover hundreds of thousands of dollars in gambling and travel expenses, credit card bills, and country club dues, and to pay for elaborate parties and other forms of entertainment., The Commission’s complaint charges Durham, Cochran and Snow with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The accountant is also charged with tipping a business associate about the potential sale of First Morris. Both defendants have agreed to settle the Commission’s charges and to pay a total of $188,699 in disgorgement and civil penalties., The Commission’s complaint alleges as follows: Defendant <b>Kim Ann Deskovick</b>, age 55, was a director of First Morris during the relevant period. From June through September of 2006, Deskovick received confidential information concerning First Morris’s efforts to be acquired by another bank and the status of those merger negotiations. In breach of her fiduciary duty as a director, Deskovick tipped a close friend that First Morris was for sale and periodically updated her friend on the status of First Morris’s merger negotiations. Deskovick’s friend then tipped defendant <b>Brian S. Haig</b>, age 45, a friend and business associate. Deskovick’s friend told Haig that the friend had learned from Deskovick that First Morris was for sale and recommended that Haig buy First Morris securities. Based on the tip from Deskovick’s friend, Haig purchased 4,000 shares of First Morris stock in September 2006. Haig also tipped a friend and business associate, now deceased, about the pending sale of First Morris and the source of the information. Based on Haig’s tip, Haig’s friend purchased 800 shares of First Morris stock in September 2006. On October 16, 2006, First Morris and Provident Financial Services, Inc. announced the execution of a merger agreement, and the price of First Morris stock increased by approximately 14% that day. Haig sold his entire First Morris position on the day of the announcement for a profit of $56,797, and his friend sold his entire First Morris position on the following day for a profit of $11,480., The complaint charges Deskovick and Haig with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5. Simultaneous with the filing of the complaint, Deskovick and Haig each consented, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, to the entry of final judgments: (1) permanently enjoining them from violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5; (2) ordering Haig to disgorge $68,277, the full amount of the First Morris trading profits made by Haig and the person he tipped, and to pay prejudgment interest of $18,007 on that amount; (3) ordering Deskovick to pay a civil penalty of $68,277; (4) ordering Haig to pay a civil penalty of $34,138; and (5) barring Deskovick from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. In determining the amount of the penalty sought from Haig, the Commission considered the significant cooperation he provided in connection with this matter, including providing information about others that assisted the Commission in bringing additional charges.

Specifically, the Commission’s complaint alleges that from at least January 2007 through August 16, 2010, the Defendants engaged in a fraudulent high-interest promissory note program to fund St. Anselm’s operations., The Commission’s complaint specifically alleges that defendants Zakroff, Wells, and Palmer, all of whom reside in Colorado, and Etkind, who resides in New Mexico, solicited investors in New Mexico, Colorado, and other states and offered high annual investment returns ranging from 18-36%.  The complaint also alleges that as of September 30, 2010, St. Anselm owed approximately 200 investors a total of over $62 million in outstanding notes.  The complaint further alleges that the Defendants solicited investors by falsely representing and implying that St. Anselm was profitable and able to pay investors both from the recurring revenue from oil and gas production and from the larger, but less frequent, sales of asset packages.  The complaint also alleges that the Defendants failed to disclose to investors St. Anselm’s true financial condition and that St. Anselm depended on the proceeds of new promissory note sales to service its debt.

21892,2011,[<h3>SEC CHARGES THREE FIRMS AND FOUR INDIVIDUALS IN LOS ANGELES-BASED BOILER ROOM OPERATION</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged three firms and four individuals involved in a boiler room scheme operating out of Los Angeles that defrauded investors who they persuaded to buy purportedly profitable trading systems., The SEC alleges that representatives of Spyglass Equity Systems Inc. cold-called investors and made false and misleading statements to help raise more than $2.15 million from nearly 200 investors nationwide for two related investment companies – Flatiron Capital Partners LLC (FCP) and Flatiron Systems LLC (FS). However, only a little more than half of that money was actually used for the advertised trading purposes, and much of the trading that did occur failed to use the purported trading systems. FCP and FS wound up losing about $1 million in investor funds. The managing member of the two firms – David E. Howard II – misused almost $500,000 of investor money for unauthorized business expenses as well as personal expenses including travel, entertainment, and gifts for his girlfriend., Along with FCP, FS and Howard, Spyglass and its owners – Richard L. Carter, Preston L. Sjoblom and Tyson D. Elliott – also are charged with fraud in connection with the unregistered securities offerings., According to the SEC’s complaint filed in federal court in the Central District of California, Howard conspired with Spyglass to sell the securities, and Spyglass earned an estimated $1 million in the deal. The trading systems pitched to investors by Spyglass representatives could only be used if the investor also funded a brokerage account at FCP. However, FCP was not a broker-dealer and thus could not offer brokerage services to customers., The SEC alleges that Spyglass representatives falsely touted a successful performance history and level of automation of the trading systems, and misled investors to believe that FCP had a positive reputation and solid affiliations in the brokerage industry. To seal the deal, Spyglass offered investors a money-back guarantee if the system did not generate a profit within the first 180 days of trading. However it was only after an investor paid Spyglass a license fee of about $6,000 that Spyglass put the investor in contact with Flatiron, ostensibly to open a brokerage account., The SEC’s complaint alleges that Howard and FCP provided each investor with instructions on how to fund their “account” with FCP, but included in the instruction packet a copy of the FCP Operating Agreement that indicated the investor was actually purchasing a membership interest in FCP. Many of the investors recruited by Spyglass were elderly and unsophisticated investors who did not understand that they were purchasing a security interest in FCP., According to the SEC’s complaint, FCP pooled investor funds so Howard and others could trade the funds using various trading techniques. When the trading was not successful and it became clear that Spyglass would have to pay refunds to its clients, Howard provided Spyglass with another trading system and organized FS to purportedly operate the new system. Using false and misleading claims of prior success of this new trading system and Spyglass’s relationship with FS and Howard, FCP investors were persuaded to transfer their investments from FCP to FS. Under the direction of Sjoblom and Carter, Spyglass then began selling the FS trading system to new investors using a sales pitch similar to the one it used to sell the FCP. Investors were again misled to believe they would be opening brokerage accounts, this time with FS.

In reality, according to the SEC, the firms’ officers used most of the money to make unsecured and undocumented loans to entities that the officers themselves controlled, which were suffering mounting losses and protracted delays on Silicon Valley real estate development projects. Meanwhile, as the enterprise collapsed, investors continued receiving monthly statements showing steady growth in the value of their portfolios., The SEC’s complaint, filed today in federal district court in San Francisco, names as defendants founder James S. Ward and Edward G. Locker (both of Ohio) and David S. Lee, Richard F. Tipton and David C. Lin (all Silicon Valley residents). The complaint alleges that JSW and JWA, through these individual officers, breached their fiduciary duties by misusing investors’ money to benefit the officers rather than the funds. The SEC also alleges that the officers concealed millions of dollars in losses from Blue Chip and Shoreline investors by sending fraudulent account statements claiming that the Funds were earning more than 10% in annual profits, until the scheme collapsed in November 2008 and the officers finally revealed to investors that nearly all of the Blue Chip and Shoreline loans were unsecured. The SEC also alleges that Ward and Locker together took $900,000 of investor money to purchase homes for themselves., The SEC’s complaint charges JSW, Ward, Lee, Locker, Tipton and Lin with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also charges JSW with violating Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers Act) and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder, and charges Ward, Lee, Locker, Tipton and Lin with aiding and abetting violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder. The SEC seeks injunctive relief and disgorgement of ill-gotten gains against JSW, Ward, Lee, Locker, Tipton and Lin, as well as monetary penalties against the five officers.

(“BAE”)., According to the Commission’s complaint, during December 2007, Wiener was an executive at BAE and, in the course of his employment, learned material, nonpublic information regarding BAE’s plan to acquire MTC. Although he was not directly involved in the acquisition of MTC by BAE, prior to the public announcement he had regular contact with other BAE employees who were involved in highly confidential preparations for the acquisition. On December 7, 2007, Wiener participated in a staff meeting during which the proposed acquisition of MTC was discussed under its code name, “Project Mira.” The Commission alleges that Wiener actively participated in the discussion and shared detailed information concerning the target’s business, including its aircraft integration capabilities and specific contract bidding opportunities, which showed that he knew “Mira” referred to MTC. Approximately thirty minutes after the scheduled end of the staff meeting, Wiener placed an order to purchase 10,000 shares of MTC in his personal brokerage account.

Konaxis’s customer made her investments with funds she obtained through the September 11<sup>th</sup> Victim Compensation Fund., According to the Commission’s complaint, Konaxis excessively traded his customer’s funds while knowingly or recklessly disregarding her interests. The Commission alleges that Konaxis earned approximately $550,000 over approximately two years in commissions on his customer’s accounts. During this period, the Commission alleges that the value of his customer’s accounts decreased from approximately $3.7 million to approximately $1.6 million, much of which was due to Konaxis’s investments and the resulting commissions paid to Konaxis., In particular, the SEC’s complaint alleges that Konaxis violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder., Konaxis has consented to a partial judgment pursuant to which he will be enjoined from future violations of the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act and Exchange Act, and barred from participating in any offering of penny stock.

21906,2011,[<h3>SEC BLOCKS ATTEMPT BY CONNECTICUT FUND MANAGER TO DIVERT FUNDS FROM PETTERS PONZI SCHEME VICTIMS</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced it has obtained an emergency court order to halt an attempt by a Connecticut-based fund manager to divert to himself and others settlement funds intended for U.S. victims of a Ponzi scheme operated by Minnesota businessman Thomas Petters., The SEC has charged Marlon M. Quan with facilitating the Petters fraud and funneling several hundred million dollars of investor money into the scheme. The SEC alleges that Quan and his firms (Stewardship Investment Advisors LLC and Acorn Capital Group LLC) invested hundreds of millions of hedge fund assets with Petters while pocketing more than $90 million in fees. They falsely assured investors that their money would be safeguarded by “lock box accounts” to protect them against defaults. When Petters was unable to make payments on investments held by the funds that Quan managed, Quan and his firms concealed Petters’s defaults from investors by concocting sham round trip transactions with Petters., In its emergency court action, the SEC alleges that Quan, despite a glaring conflict of interest, more recently negotiated an agreement to divert a settlement payment of approximately $14 million relating to a receivership and a bankruptcy of Petters’s entities. Although he purportedly negotiated on behalf of his U.S. fund investors, Quan’s U.S. victims would receive no money under this agreement., At the SEC’s request, the Honorable Ann D. Montgomery of the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota ordered that the money – paid into a firm affiliated with Quan’s Acorn Capital Group LLC – be placed into a segregated account and frozen until further order of the court. A hearing will be held on April 14 to determine the SEC’s request for additional emergency relief for investors., In the attempt blocked by the SEC, Quan had arranged for nearly $6 million of the settlement amount to be paid to a German bank, more than $7 million to be paid to a liquidator appointed by a Bermuda court for certain overseas fund investors, and approximately $862,500 to be directed to pay Quan’s lawyers and other expenses., The SEC <a href=/news/press/2009/2009-156.htm target=_top>previously charged Petters and Illinois-based fund manager Gregory M. Bell</a> with fraud, and <a href=/news/press/2010/2010-195.htm target=_top>filed additional charges against Florida-based hedge fund managers Bruce F. Prévost and David W. Harrold</a> for facilitating the Petters Ponzi scheme., According to the SEC’s complaint, Petters sold promissory notes to feeder funds like those controlled by Quan and his firms. Petters used some of the note proceeds to pay returns to earlier investors, diverting the rest of the cash to his own purposes. Petters had promised investors that their money would be used to finance the purchase of vast amounts of consumer electronics by vendors who then re-sold the merchandise to such retailers as Wal-Mart and Costco. In reality, this “purchase order inventory financing” business was merely a Ponzi scheme. There were no inventory transactions., The SEC alleges that Quan and his firms funneled money into the Petters Ponzi scheme beginning as early as 2001 and continuing through 2008. Quan, who lives in Greenwich, Conn., sold interests in his Stewardship Funds to individuals, charities, companies and other hedge funds. He falsely assured investors of several procedures that Acorn Capital Group purportedly undertook to protect the investors in his hedge funds. However, Quan and his firms implemented none of these safeguards., The SEC further alleges that Quan falsely assured existing and new investors that the Quan Hedge Funds were doing well when in reality Petters began defaulting on the investments they held. Instead of disclosing these defaults to his fund’s investors, Quan embarked on a series of convoluted transactions in which he exchanged $187 million with Petters Co. in “round trips” that created the false appearance that Petters was making his payments., The SEC’s complaint charges Quan and his firms with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206-4(8) thereunder. The SEC seeks entry of a court order of permanent injunction against Quan and his firms as well as an order of disgorgement, prejudgment interest and financial penalties.

21907,2011,[<h3>SEC CHARGES FDA CHEMIST WITH INSIDER TRADING AHEAD OF DRUG APPROVAL ANNOUNCEMENTS</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) chemist with insider trading on confidential information about upcoming announcements of FDA drug approval decisions, generating more than $3.6 million in illicit profits and avoided losses., The SEC alleges that Cheng Yi Liang illegally traded in advance of at least 27 public announcements about FDA drug approval decisions involving 19 publicly traded companies. Some announcements concerned the FDA’s approval of new drugs while others concerned negative FDA decisions. In each instance, he traded in the same direction as the announcement. Liang went to great lengths to conceal his insider trading. He traded in seven brokerage accounts, none of which were in his name. One belonged to his 84-year-old mother who lives in China., In a parallel action, criminal charges filed by the Department of Justice against Liang were unsealed today., According to the SEC’s complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland (Greenbelt Division), Liang works in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. Beginning as early as July 2006, Liang purchased shares for a profit before 19 positive announcements regarding FDA decisions, shorted stock for a profit before six negative announcements, and sold shares to avoid losses before two negative announcements., For example, the SEC alleges that Liang traded in advance of an FDA announcement approving Clinical Data’s application for the drug Viibryd. Liang accessed a confidential FDA database that contained critical documents and information about the FDA’s review of Clinical Data’s application, and then used that information to purchase more than 46,000 shares of Clinical Data at a cost of more than $700,000. After the markets closed on Friday, Jan. 21, 2011, the FDA issued a press release approving Viibryd. Clinical Data’s stock price rose by more than 67 percent the following Monday and Liang sold his entire Clinical Data position in less than 15 minutes for a profit of approximately $380,000., The SEC alleges that Liang used the trading profits for his own personal benefit. Checks totaling at least $1.2 million were written from the accounts he used for trading to a bank account in his name, to Liang or his wife directly, or to credit card companies to pay off balances in accounts in his or his wife’s name. Nearly $65,000 worth of checks were written from the brokerage accounts to car dealerships to purchase vehicles later registered to Liang and his wife., The SEC’s complaint alleges that Liang violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction against future violations, disgorgement of unlawful trading profits and losses avoided plus prejudgment interest, and a financial penalty. The SEC’s complaint names Liang’s wife Yi Zhuge and the account holders for the seven trading accounts he used – Liang’s mother Hui Juan Chen, his son Andrew Liang, Shuhua Zhu, Zhongshan Chen, and Honami Toda – as relief defendants for the purpose of recovering ill-gotten funds to which they have no legitimate claim. Criminal charges by the Department of Justice against Andrew Liang were unsealed today in the District of Maryland., The SEC thanks the Department of Justice’s Criminal Fraud Section, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Maryland for their ongoing assistance in this matter.

21910,2011,[<h3>SEC CHARGES SOUTH FLORIDA MAN AND WOMAN IN $30 MILLION PONZI SCHEME</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged two South Florida residents for conducting a $30 million Ponzi scheme with funds primarily raised by offering and selling unregistered investment contracts and promissory notes to hundreds of investors nationwide from 2005 until the summer of 2007., The SEC alleges that James Clements and Zeina Smidi of Plantation, Florida, through the companies they jointly controlled: MRT, LLC; MRT Holdings, LTD; and Maximum Return Transaction, LLC, collectively “MRT”; operated a Ponzi scheme that offered investors guaranteed monthly returns as high as 11%. From 2005 until the end of 2006, MRT, Clements and Smidi told investors that MRT used investor proceeds to trade foreign currencies and touted MRT’s investment success to draw in new investors. The SEC’s complaint further alleges that MRT and Clements used certain investors who agreed to be “account managers” to solicit hundreds of investors through informal gatherings and word of mouth., According to the SEC’s complaint, Clements explained that from the foreign currency trading profits, MRT would pay a small percentage of each investor’s returns to the investors’ account manager, pay each investor their promised rate of return, and keep any excess profits. Clements and account managers referred investors to Smidi who provided investors information on how to effect their investment in MRT and where to wire funds., The SEC alleges in its complaint that in June 2007, Clements told MRT’s account managers that MRT would no longer be trading foreign currencies. Clements and Smidi instead claimed in a letter to investors they wanted MRT’s money working with the best Swiss banks and advisors and further advised investors they could choose to roll over their existing investment and make future ones into a fixed rate account with a one-year holding period that earned up to 25% annually or a high-yield savings account that earned up to 15% annually but allowed monthly withdrawals., The SEC alleges that MRT’s claims were baseless and fraudulent and in reality, Clements and Smidi actually operated a Ponzi scheme with investors’ monies. MRT never traded more than a fraction of what it collected from investors and overall, lost approximately $65,000 trading in foreign currencies. Further, the SEC alleges that MRT never directly deposited investor funds with a Swiss bank and that the returns MRT paid to investors came from subsequent investor deposits., The SEC also alleges that in addition to misleading investors about MRT’s use of investor funds, Clements and Smidi also siphoned approximately $3 million of MRT investor monies to their personal bank accounts. They additionally paid out approximately $3 million for travel, expenses, and luxury items., The SEC’s complaint charges Clements with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC’s complaint charges Smidi with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

BRIDWELL</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida entered a final judgment against Aerokinetic Energy Corporation and its president, Randolph E. Bridwell. The final judgment imposes disgorgement of ill-gotten proceeds, jointly and severally, in the amount of $555,000, plus prejudgment interest in the amount of $59,571.09. Additionally, Aerokinetic and Bridwell were ordered to pay civil penalties of $250,000 and $130,000, respectively., Previously, the Commission filed an emergency action to halt Aerokinetic and Bridwell from ongoing fraud involving the sale of its common stock. Acting on the Commission’s request for emergency relief, Judge James D. Whittemore issued a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze over Aerokinetic’s bank account, and other relief against the defendants., The Commission’s complaint alleged that Aerokinetic and Bridwell violated Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that from at least September 2006 through July 2008, the defendants raised at least $535,000 from 24 investors nationwide (and sought to raise an additional $575,000) by conducting a fraudulent offering of unregistered securities in the form of common stock. Aerokinetic, a Sarasota company purportedly in the business of researching, developing, and marketing alternative power technologies and other innovative products, claimed to have developed new energy technologies, including a power generation station capable of creating electrical energy at a fraction of the cost of conventional or nuclear means, without generating any pollution. Defendants told investors and potential investors that they projected millions of dollars of sales revenue within Aerokinetic’s first years of operations and billions of dollars shortly thereafter., In reality, Aerokinetic had no patents, license agreements, contracts, suppliers, customers, sales, revenue, or market share and its purported energy technologies and products were, at best, in the early development stage and, therefore, its predictions of imminent financial success and financial projections lacked any reasonable basis in fact. Moreover, contrary to defendants’ assurances that they would use investor funds to research and develop Aerokinetic’s products, the complaint alleged that Bridwell misappropriated investors’ funds to pay his personal expenses, with approximately $230,000 in investor funds unaccounted for., For additional information, see <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20655.htm target=_top>LR-20655</a> (July 28, 2008).<a name=P8_2972></a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr21911.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Platt, United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, adopted, in full, a Magistrate Judge’s previously-issued Report and Recommendation against Neurotech Development Corporation’s (“Neurotech”) sole officers, the father-son management team of Bernard Artz (chairman, chief executive officer and chief financial officer) and Lawrence Artz (vice president).  Pursuant to the March 23 Order, Bernard Artz must pay a total of over $173,000 and Lawrence Artz must pay a total of over $141,000 in disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties., The Commission originally filed its action against Neurotech, Bernard Artz and Lawrence Artz in October 2004.  The complaint alleged that, between at least 1999 and 2003, Neurotech falsely claimed in Commission filings and press releases that it had: (i) sold and built prefabricated hospitals in China and Indonesia, and (ii) entered into billions of dollars of overseas construction contracts.  The Commission’s complaint also alleged that the company made false public statements about possessing certain fraudulent “bank guarantees” it could purportedly use to finance the building of hospitals.  The Commission also alleged that Bernard Artz and Lawrence Artz contemporaneously sold the company’s common stock into the market for illicit gains., In April 2010, Neurotech reached a settlement with the Commission and Bernard Artz and Lawrence Artz agreed to partial settlements with the Commission.  Bernard and Lawrence Artz consented to entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder (antifraud provisions), Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act (failure to make change of beneficial ownership filings), and aiding and abetting Neurotech’s violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder (reporting provisions).  In addition, Bernard Artz consented to an injunction from violating Exchange Act Rule 13a-14 (false certification of Commission filings).  Both individual defendants also consented to five-year officer and director and penny stock bars, and left disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties to be decided by the Court.  Neurotech settled the matter by consenting to the entry of a final judgment providing for a permanent injunction from violating Sections 10(b) and 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.  , Thereafter, the court considered the issue of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties as to Bernard Artz and Lawrence Artz.  The Order issued on March 23, 2011, adopting a recommendation by a Magistrate Judge, requires Bernard Artz to disgorge $131,414, plus prejudgment interest of $32,017.42, and pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  Similarly, Lawrence Artz must disgorge $57,129.73, plus prejudgment interest of $79,846.92, and pay a civil penalty of $5,000.  The Magistrate Judge stated that the recommended civil penalties were “third tier” penalties and that he considered the defendants’ financial conditions in his decision to not recommend higher penalty amounts.  Under the Exchange Act, a “third tier” penalty is one where the violation involved fraud, deceit, manipulation, or deliberate or reckless disregard of a regulatory requirement, and such violation directly or indirectly resulted in substantial losses or created a significant risk of substantial losses to other persons.  , For further information, please see Litigation Release Numbers <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18952.htm target=_top>18952</a> (October 29, 2004) [filing of complaint]; <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18236.htm target=_top>18236</a> (July 18, 2003) [subpoena enforcement action against Lawrence Artz]; <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18159.htm target=_top>18159</a> (May 28, 2003) [subpoena enforcement action against Bernard Artz].<a name=P8_4303></a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr21912.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The judgment permanently enjoins Joseph J. Monterosso and Luis Vargas from violations of the antifraud and other securities law provisions. The Court ordered that a magistrate judge would determine the amount of disgorgement and penalties that the defendants would pay., The Commission brought civil actions against Monterosso and Vargas in connection with GlobeTel Communications Corp., now Sanswire Corp.

Sanswire Corp. and three former executives, including the two sentenced to prison, previously consented to the entry of judgments against them in the Commission’s action., The Commission’s complaint against Monterosso and Vargas alleged that they created hundreds of false invoices that made it appear that GlobeTels three wholly-owned subsidiaries, Centerline Communications, LLC (Centerline), Volta Communications, LLC (Volta), and Lonestar Communications, LLC (Lonestar) bought and sold telecom minutes with other wholesale telecom companies. The complaint alleged that, in reality, there were no transactions under the program that GlobeTel executives described as the off-net revenue program.

Although Satyam’s shares primarily traded on the Indian markets, its American depository shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange during the relevant period., According to the SEC’s complaint, shortly after the fraud came to light in January 2009, the India government seized control of the company by dissolving Satyam’s Board of Directors and appointing new government-nominated directors; removed former top managers of the company; and oversaw a bidding process to select a new controlling shareholder in Satyam. In addition, Indian authorities filed criminal charges against several former officials., In addition to the actions taken by the Indian authorities, Satyam, whose new leadership cooperated with the SEC’s investigation, has agreed to pay a $10 million penalty to settle the SEC’s charges, require specific training of officers and employees concerning securities laws and accounting principles, and improve its internal audit functions. In addition, it agreed to hire an independent consultant to evaluate the internal controls Satyam is putting in place., According to the SEC’s complaint, Satyam’s former senior managers engineered a scheme that created more than 6,000 phony invoices to be used in Satyam’s general ledger and financial statements. Satyam employees created bogus bank statements to reflect payment of the sham invoices. This resulted in more than $1 billion in fictitious cash and cash-related balances, representing half the company’s total assets., The SEC alleges that when the fraud was finally revealed, Satyam’s then-Chairman, B. Ramalinga Raju, declared that maintaining Satyam’s inflated revenues and profits “was like riding a tiger, not knowing how to get off without being eaten.”, Raju and other former senior and mid-level Satyam executives, as well as two lead engagement partners from Satyam’s former external audit firm, are defendants in a criminal trial now underway in India., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC’s complaint, Satyam agreed to a permanent injunction against future violations of the periodic reporting provisions of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20 13a-1 and 13a-16.

Pursuant to the final judgments, Judge Sargus ordered HedgeLender to disgorge $1,719,567 with prejudgment interest of $347,741, for a total of $2,067,308; Stafford to disgorge $356,085 with prejudgment interest of $76,332, for a total of $432,417; and Wahler to disgorge $298,065 with prejudgment interest of $60,081, for a total of $358,146. Judge Sargus also imposed a third tier civil penalty of $1,065,417 against HedgeLender and second tier civil penalties of $50,000 each against Stafford and Wahler., On September 30, 2009, the Commission filed a complaint against HedgeLender, a stock-based loan broker located in Philadelphia, and its two principals, Stafford and Wahler, alleging that they made material misrepresentations to clients in connection with a fraudulent scheme operated by the Spillans through One Equity. Specifically, the complaint alleged that from February 2006 through at least November 2007, HedgeLender—through its website and affiliates—marketed One Equity’s stock-based loan program and referred clients to One Equity in exchange for commissions on successful transactions. One Equity was not, however, a legitimate lender. Rather, the Spillans, through One Equity, induced borrowers to transfer ownership of publicly traded stock to them as collateral for purported non-recourse loans based on a false promise to return the shares upon repayment. In fact, the Spillans generally liquidated the shares before funding the loans and failed to maintain adequate cash reserves necessary to repurchase and return the shares to borrowers. The Spillans used the money to pay expenses, including over $1 million in salaries and benefits to themselves., According to the complaint, HedgeLender, Stafford, and Wahler misrepresented to potential clients that it had certified One Equity’s stock-based loan programs, vetted the professional reputations of those who administered the programs, and ensured the security of borrowers’ shares. In reality, Stafford, a resident of Gaithersburg, Maryland, and Wahler, a resident of Philadelphia, conducted minimal due diligence and failed to investigate “red flags” that cast doubt on One Equity’s ability to administer and fund its stock-based loans. Adequate due diligence would have revealed that One Equity had no funding source and that the Spillans had never run a legitimate stock-based lending enterprise. The complaint further alleges that from February 2006 through at least November 2007, HedgeLender referred approximately 54 borrowers to One Equity and received approximately $1.7 million in commission payments., For more information, see Litigation Release Nos. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2010/lr21757.htm target=_top>21757</a> (November 24, 2010), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2010/lr21385.htm target=_top>21385</a> (January 20, 2010), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21234.htm target=_top>21234</a> (October 1, 2009), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20716a.htm target=_top>20716A</a> (September 15, 2008), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20643.htm target=_top>20643</a> (July 14, 2008), and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20652.htm>20652</a> (July 22, 2008).<a name=P7_3911></a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr21918.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The Commission’s complaint alleges that, from year-end 2004 through the first quarter of 2008, Fox misled the investing public by fraudulently inflating the revenue and omitting major liabilities of Powder River in Commission filings and by making other false and misleading public disclosures. Specifically, the complaint alleges that from year-end 2004, Powder River conveyed working interests in oil and gas leases to investors in Asia for over $43 million. The complaint further alleges that because Powder River promised full repayment of the working interest investors’ initial investment, with a 9% guaranteed annual return of principal, these transactions were, in reality, loans. Powder River, with Fox as its chairman, CEO and CFO, improperly recognized the loan proceeds as revenues that were incorporated in Powder River’s quarterly and annual public filings with the Commission., The complaint further alleges that Fox was responsible for Powder River’s improper recording of oil and gas reserves on properties that the company did not own and inflation of the company’s net realizable value of those reserves., The Commission’s complaint further alleges that, by mid-2007, Powder River made undisclosed, Ponzi-style payments of incoming working interest conveyance proceeds from new investors to fulfill its ongoing minimum guaranteed payment obligations to prior investors.

Mayer Amsel is a securities fraud recidivist., The Commission’s motion for summary judgment argued that from 2004 through at least 2006, the Amsels, in concert with several others and through their individual actions, artificially inflated the volume of market activity for, and in turn the price of, East Delta stock, and illegally sold East Delta shares that they received at little or no cost. The Commission’s summary judgment motion further argued that the Amsels together collected illegal profits of $1,322,703 from their manipulative conduct., The summary judgment opinion grants the following relief: (1) a permanent injunction prohibiting both Amsels from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; (2) a permanent injunction prohibiting both Amsels from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act); (3) a permanent injunction prohibiting David Amsel from violating Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder; and (4) a permanent injunction prohibiting both Amsels from participating in an offering of penny stock, absent an explicit release from the Commission. The opinion reserved judgment on the issue of the Amsels’ liability for violations of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act (together, Section 5), the question of whether to impose an officer and director bar against David Amsel, and what the appropriate judgment amount should be with respect to disgorgement, civil penalties, and prejudgment interest.

(HGSI) based on a tip he received unlawfully from a medical researcher overseeing the drug trial. HGSI’s stock fell 44 percent after it publicly announced negative results from the trial of Albumin Interferon Alfa 2-a (Albuferon), and the hedge funds avoided at least $30 million in losses., The SEC <a href=/news/press/2010/2010-209.htm target=_top>previously charged the medical researcher</a> – Dr. Yves M. Benhamou – who illegally tipped Skowron with the non-public information and received envelopes of cash in return according to the SEC’s amended complaint filed today in federal court in Manhattan to additionally charge Skowron. The hedge funds, which have been charged as relief defendants in the SEC’s amended complaint, have agreed to pay back $33 million in ill-gotten gains., In a parallel action today, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York announced criminal charges against Skowron., According to the SEC’s amended complaint, Benhamou served on the Steering Committee overseeing HGSI’s trial for Albuferon, a potential drug to treat Hepatitis C. While serving on the Steering Committee, Benhamou provided consulting services to Skowron through an expert networking firm. But over time, he and Skowron developed a friendship. By April 2007, many of their communications were independent of the expert networking firm. Benhamou tipped Skowron with material, non-public information about the trial as he learned of negative developments that occurred during Phase 3 of the trial., The SEC alleges that Skowron acted on confidential information he received from Benhamou prior to the public announcement and ordered the sale of the entire position in HGSI stock – approximately six million shares held by the six health-care related funds that Skowron co-managed. These sales occurred during the six-week period prior to HGSI’s public announcement. Skowron caused the hedge funds to sell two million shares in a block trade just before the markets closed Jan. 22, 2008. Changes to the trial resulting from the negative developments were announced publicly on Jan. 23, 2008. When HGSI’s share price dropped 44 percent by the end of the day, the hedge funds avoided losses of at least $30 million., According to the SEC’s amended complaint, Skowron gave Benhamou an envelope of containing 5,000 Euros while they were attending a medical conference in Barcelona, Spain in April 2007. The cash was in appreciation for Benhamou’s work as a consultant. In February 2008, after the illegal HGSI trades were completed, Skowron asked Benhamou to lie about his communications with Skowron, which he did. In late February 2008, Skowron met Benhamou in Boston and attempted to hand him a bag containing cash in appreciation for his tips on the Albuferon trial and his continued silence. Benhamou refused the cash. However, while attending a medical conference in Milan, Italy in April 2008, Skowron gave Benhamou another envelope containing $10,000 to $20,000 in cash that Benhamou accepted., The SEC charged Skowron and Benhamou with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of any ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and financial penalties against them., Simultaneous with the filing of the SEC’s amended complaint, the six hedge funds named as relief defendants agreed to settle with the Commission and pay disgorgement of $29,017,156.00 plus prejudgment interest of $4,003,669.00 without admitting or denying the allegations.

The SEC also charged two sales agents with illegally offering to sell company securities without being registered with the SEC as broker-dealers. , The SEC alleges that Inofin executives Michael Cuomo of Plymouth, Mass., Kevin Mann of Marshfield, Mass., and Melissa George of Duxbury, Mass., illegally raised at least $110 million from hundreds of investors in 25 states and the District of Columbia through the sale of unregistered notes.  Investors in the notes were told that Inofin would use the money for the sole purpose of funding subprime auto loans.  As part of the pitch, Inofin and its executives told investors that they could expect to receive returns of 9 to 15 percent because Inofin loaned investor money to its subprime borrowers at an average rate of 20 percent.  But unbeknownst to investors, and starting in 2004, approximately one-third of investor money raised was instead used by Cuomo and Mann to open four used car dealerships and begin multiple real estate property developments for their own benefit. , Inofin is not registered with the SEC to offer securities to investors., According to the SEC’s complaint filed in federal court in Boston, Inofin and the executives materially misrepresented Inofin’s financial performance beginning as early as 2006 and continuing through 2011.  Inofin had a negative net worth and a progressively deteriorating financial condition caused not only by the failure of Inofin’s undisclosed business activities, but also by management’s decisions in 2007, 2008, and 2009 to sell some of its auto loan portfolio at a substantial discount to solve ever-increasing cash shortages that Inofin concealed from investors.  Nonetheless, Inofin and its principal officers continued to offer and sell Inofin securities while knowingly or recklessly misrepresenting to investors that Inofin was a profitable business and sound investment. , The SEC further alleges that beginning in 2006 and continuing to April 2010, Inofin’s executives defrauded investors while maintaining Inofin’s license to do business as a motor vehicle sales finance company by preparing and submitting materially false financial statements to its licensing authority, the Massachusetts Division of Banks.  The SEC’s complaint charges Cuomo, Mann, and George with violating the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws, and seeks civil injunctions, the return of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and financial penalties.    , The SEC’s charges against the two sales agents — David Affeldt and Thomas K. (Kevin) Keough — allege that they promoted the offering and sale of Inofin’s unregistered securities.  They were unjustly enriched with more than $500,000 in referral fees between 2004 and 2009.  Affeldt and Keough are charged with selling the unregistered Inofin securities and failing to register with the SEC as a broker-dealer, and the SEC seeks civil injunctions, the return of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and financial penalties.  Keough’s wife Nancy Keough is named in the complaint as a relief defendant for the purposes of recovering proceeds she received as a result of the violations., The Commission’s complaint alleges that Inofin, Cuomo, Mann, and George violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and that Kevin Keough, and David Affeldt violated Sections 5(a), and 5(c) of the Securities Act and Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act.  The Commission seeks the entry of a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus pre-judgment interest, and the imposition of civil monetary penalties against Inofin, Cuomo, Mann, George, Kevin Keough, and David Affeldt.  Keough’s wife Nancy Keough is named in the complaint as a relief defendant for the purposes of recovering proceeds she received as a result of the violations., The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts William F. Galvin, who today filed charges against Inofin, Cuomo, Mann, George, Affeldt, Kevin Keough, and Nancy Keough based on the same conduct.  The SEC also appreciates the assistance of the Massachusetts Division of Banks, which previously took action requiring Inofin to surrender its license to operate as a subprime auto lender in Massachusetts.,  ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr21929.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

These charges resulted from Elkinson’s operation of a scheme by which he defrauded more than 100 victims of millions of dollars.  Elkinson was indicted on February 17, 2010.  The indictment charged that Elkinson obtained funds from his victims by falsely representing that he would use the funds to finance the manufacture of uniforms and hats for state government agencies when in fact he used the funds for his own personal purposes and to repay amounts to other victims.  He is currently scheduled to be sentenced before U.S. District Joseph L. Tauro on July 21, 2011., The Commission previously filed a related civil enforcement action against Elkinson on January 7, 2010 and obtained a default judgment against him on June 9, 2010.  In the Commission’s action, the court permanently enjoined Elkinson from future violations of the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws and ordered him to pay over $29 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest and civil penalties.  On January 7, 2010, at the Commission’s request, the court had issued an order freezing Elkinson’s assets. , The Commission alleged in its complaint that Elkinson operated a Ponzi scheme that defrauded at least 130 investors from multiple states of approximately $28 million.  The complaint further alleged that since at least 1997, Elkinson offered and sold unregistered securities in the form of promissory notes.  According to the complaint, Elkinson falsely told investors that he was in the business of brokering contracts on behalf of a Japanese firm that manufactured uniforms (such as police uniforms and prison uniforms) to be sold to large purchasers such as state and local governments (and even the U.S. Olympic Committee) and that investors’ money would be used to help finance specific uniform contracts.  The investors received promissory notes signed by Elkinson, with terms that generally required payment within 300 to 330 days and with an interest rate that ranged from 9% to 13%.  According to the complaint, however, Elkinson had no relationship with a Japanese uniform manufacturer, and there were no contracts to purchase uniforms.  The Commission alleged that, while some investors did receive payments of principal and interest, those payments were made using funds obtained from other investors, and Elkinson was able to keep the scheme going as long as most of the investors kept rolling over their investments.  In reality, according to the complaint, Elkinson used most of the investors’ money for his own personal purposes, including gambling.   , For further information, please see <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2010/lr21364.htm>Litigation Release No. 21364</a> (January 8, 2010) [Order obtaining preliminary injunction, asset freeze, and other relief as to Elkinson] and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2010/lr21553.htm>Litigation Release No. 21553</a> [$29 million judgment entered against Elkinson].,  ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr21931.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Skaltsounis. The Complaint alleges that Skaltsounis devised and orchestrated an offering fraud and Ponzi scheme by offering and selling more than $7.7 million in AIC promissory notes and stock. Also named in the Complaint are AIC’s subsidiary, Community Bankers Securities, LLC (“CB Securities”), a broker-dealer, along with associated stockbrokers John B. Guyette, of Greeley, Colorado, and John R. Graves, of Pensacola, Florida, who was also an investment adviser., The Complaint alleges that, from at least January 2006 through November 2009, Skaltsounis, directly and through registered representatives associated with CB Securities, including Guyette and Graves, fraudulently offered and sold AIC promissory notes and stock to at least 74 investors in at least 14 states, many of whom were elderly, unsophisticated brokerage customers of CB Securities. Skaltsounis, Guyette, and Graves misrepresented and omitted material information to investors relating to, among other things, the safety and risk associated with the investments, the rates of return on the investments, and how AIC would use the proceeds of the investments., The Complaint also alleges that AIC promised to pay interest and dividends ranging from 9 to 12.5 percent on the promissory notes and stock knowing that it did not have the ability to pay those returns. AIC and its subsidiaries were never profitable. AIC earned <i>de minimis</i> revenue and its subsidiaries did not earn sufficient revenue to meet its expenses. Skaltsounis used the money raised from new investors to pay back principal and returns to existing investors in the nature of a Ponzi scheme. By early December 2009, Skaltsounis’ scheme collapsed when he could no longer solicit investments and recruit new investors to pay back existing investors., The Commission seeks permanent injunctions and civil penalties against Skaltsounis, AIC, CB Securities, Guyette, and Graves for violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

In October 2010, the Commission amended its Complaint in its previously-filed action against unknown purchasers of DRS and American Power Conversion Corp. (“APCC”) call options to name these defendants, in addition to two others who have previously settled with the Commission.  Ronzoni, Busardo, and their related entities have agreed to settle the Commission’s charges by, among other things, paying approximately $1.46 million in disgorgement and penalties. , In its October 2010 Amended Complaint, the Commission alleges that Ronzoni, Busardò, Tatus, and A-Round purchased DRS call options that were out-of-the-money and set to expire in the near term while in possession of material, nonpublic information concerning the acquisition of DRS.  According to the Amended Complaint, the settling defendants purchased the DRS call options in advance of a May 8, 2008 Wall Street Journal article reporting advanced merger negotiations between Finmeccanica S.p.A. and DRS, and confirmation by DRS the same day that it was engaged in talks regarding a potential strategic transaction.   On May 5 and 6, 2008, Ronzoni purchased a total of 340 DRS call options; on May 7, 2008, Ronzoni also purchased, through Tatus, 800 DRS call options; and, on May 7, 2008, Busardò through A-Round purchased a total of 130 DRS call options.  Following the May 8th Wall Street Journal article, Ronzoni made a profit of $156,400, Tatus made a profit of $695,459.97, and Busardò, through A-Round, made a profit of $115,840 after liquidating their DRS call option stakes.   , Under the terms of the proposed settlement, Ronzoni, Busardò, Tatus, and A-Round would consent, without admitting or denying the allegations of the Amended Complaint, to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering them to be jointly and severally liable for the payment of $967,699.97 in disgorgement, $8,689 in prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $483,849.99.

The SEC further alleges that the Defendants represented to potential investors that Commodities Online purchased commodities only after arranging for a buyer and a seller. Defendants claimed that Commodities Online made money based on the price spread and told investors they would “earn 5% or more per month without price speculation.” Commodities Online sold participation units in such contracts and claimed to have invested at least $24 million raised from investors. Commodities Online also claimed to have raised at least $2.4 million from investors who invested in membership units in Commodities Online. Neither the participation units nor the membership units were registered with the Commission., In its Complaint, the Commission alleges that Defendants made numerous material misrepresentations in connection with the offering and sale of the participation units and membership units.

Instead, according to the Complaint, Commodities Online dissipated investor funds by sending millions of dollars to companies controlled by its co-founder and former managing member and to one of its vice presidents. Further, Commodities Online held itself out as providing a viable, profitable investment vehicle to prospective investors, but, the Commission alleges, in reality it did not earn any net profits from entities it dealt with in connection with the purported commodities contracts. In addition, Commodities Online failed to disclose to prospective investors that its co-founder and former managing member is a convicted felon and failed to disclose that a vice president pled guilty to federal bank fraud and other felonies and is currently serving a term of supervised release., The SEC’s Complaint charges Commodities Online and Commodities Management with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The SEC alleges that the defendants defrauded investors in a $10 million boiler room scheme., The SEC alleges that mUrgent, chief executive officer Boris Bugarski, chief financial officer Walter Bugarski, and chief operating officer Aleks Bugarski operated a boiler room at the company to sell mUrgent stock.  Boiler room employees cold-called investors, used high pressure sales tactics, and misrepresented to investors that mUrgent had a prospering business and would imminently conduct an initial public offering (IPO).  The SEC also alleges that mUrgent and the Bugarskis falsely told investors that stock sale proceeds would not be used to pay cash salaries to the Bugarskis., According to the SEC’s complaint, mUrgent and the Bugarskis conducted two unregistered securities offerings beginning in 2008 that raised nearly $10 million from at least 130 investors nationwide.  The Bugarskis misused investor money to fund more than $1.3 million in cash salary and bonuses for themselves. They also established a separate “slush fund” of more than $500,000, and used investor funds to pay for luxury cars and other personal expenses., The SEC seeks permanent injunctions against mUrgent and the Bugarskis for violations of the antifraud, offering registration, and broker registration provisions of the federal securities laws, disgorgement, civil penalties, and an order prohibiting the Bugarskis from serving as officers or directors of any public company., As alleged in the SEC’s complaint, the defendants violated Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 15(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.,  ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr21944.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The SEC alleges that China Voice’s co-founder and his two associates are operating an $8.6 million Ponzi scheme and misusing its proceeds, in part, to help fund the company’s operations., The SEC alleges that David Ronald Allen, who also was China Voice’s chief financial officer, and his associates Alex Dowlatshahi and Christopher Mills promised investors in a series of offerings of limited partnerships that they would earn returns of at least 25 percent on their investments. Investors were falsely told that their money would be loaned to companies with a demonstrated track record and large profit margins. Instead, Allen and his cohorts used investor funds to pay back investors in earlier partnerships and funneled investor money to China Voice and a complicated web of other companies that Allen controls. Allen and his associates also siphoned investor money to enrich themselves and family members., In order to maintain the scheme, Allen and his associates have increased the pace and size of the offerings to obtain a steady stream of proceeds from defrauded investors. They are planning or have begun to solicit funds from investors in at least two more limited partnerships in the ongoing fraud. The court order obtained late yesterday freezes the assets of Allen and several others in addition to China Voice. The court also temporarily enjoined these defendants from participating in the offering of securities like those used to perpetrate the fraudulent scheme as alleged by the SEC., In addition to the Ponzi scheme, the SEC’s complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas (Dallas Division) charges China Voice, its former chairman and CEO William F. Burbank IV, and Allen, for a series of fraudulent company statements about its financial condition and business prospects. Among other things, the SEC alleges that China Voice greatly overstated the value of certain business relationships and misled investors by failing to disclose significant loans from related parties needed to fund its operations., The SEC also alleges that beginning in at least September 2006, China Voice overstated its business in China by claiming to provide telephone and other communications software in China on a much more extensive basis than it actually did. Company press releases and public filings extensively publicized contracts signed by Chinese subsidiaries to provide services to the government and other entities in China, which would provide high levels of projected revenue to the company. But the company recanted in audited financial statements in June 2008, when it disclosed that the majority of the company’s revenue came from its U.S. subsidiaries. Nevertheless, China Voice and its stock promotion campaigns continued to tout purported Chinese contracts., The SEC’s complaint additionally charges two China Voice shareholders, Gerald Patera and Ilya Drapkin, for helping Allen finance stock promotion campaigns to pump up the company’s stock price. These campaigns included a blast fax campaign orchestrated by Robert Wilson, who also is charged in the SEC’s complaint. The spam faxes were sent to thousands of people at once and contained false and misleading statements about China Voice and who was paying for the faxes. At the same time they were spending more than a million dollars on stock promotion, Patera and Drapkin dumped millions of shares of the company into the market., The SEC’s complaint charges Allen, Dowlatshahi, Mills, and various related companies, Development Capital Associates Joint Venture, Lucrative Enterprises, Corp., Silver Summit Holdings, LLC, Sleeping Bear, LLC, Synergetic Solutions LLC, and Townhome Communities Corp., with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a temporary restraining order, preliminary and permanent injunctions, disgorgement of unlawful proceeds plus prejudgment interest, and a financial penalty.

(USA) Inc. Three of the four executives illegally tipped family members or friends. The ring of eight traders together purchased $578,000 of Steel Technologies stock in the month prior to the public announcement of the acquisition and made $320,000 in illegal profits., The SEC alleges that Patrick Carroll tipped his son James Carroll, and Calcutt tipped his brother Christopher Calcutt. David Stitt tipped his friend John Monroe, who then tipped another friend Stephen Somers., According to the SEC’s complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky, Patrick and Tad Carroll are brothers of Michael Carroll, who is the president and chief operating officer of Steel Technologies. Patrick traded after Michael introduced him to Mitsui representatives who were touring the Steel Technologies facility where Patrick worked. Patrick tipped his son James, who then purchased his own Steel Technologies stock shortly before the acquisition was publicly announced. Tad bought more than $84,000 of Steel Technologies stock approximately one week before the public announcement following his own communications with Michael., The SEC alleges that before getting inside information about the forthcoming acquisition, Calcutt liquidated nearly all of his company stock. However after he went on a hunting trip with Michael Carroll, Calcutt soon started aggressively buying Steel Technologies stock at higher prices. He also tipped his brother Christopher Calcutt, who then sold all of his shares in another company for a loss and used that money to buy Steel Technologies stock on margin to increase his illicit gains., According to the SEC’s complaint, Stitt, Monroe and Somers have known each other since childhood. Stitt learned about the forthcoming acquisition on the Friday before the public announcement and immediately purchased Steel Technologies stock that same day. Over the weekend, Stitt told Monroe about the forthcoming acquisition. On Monday, Monroe passed the inside information to Somers. That same day, Monroe told his broker to immediately open a new account so he could buy Steel Technologies stock. Somers also immediately traded based on the inside information. During the SEC’s investigation, Stitt and Monroe contradicted each other’s testimony about their communications and advance knowledge of the acquisition., The SEC’s complaint charges the eight defendants with securities fraud in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Specifically, the Complaint alleges:, On March 19, 2011, Weintraub, on behalf of Sterling Global, emailed a written tender offer to Kodak for all its “outstanding stock” at a total price of approximately $1.3 billion in cash. On March 29, 2011, Weintraub emailed substantially the same letter to AMR offering to purchase all AMR’s “outstanding stock” for approximately $3.25 billion in cash. These offer prices represented almost a 50% premium over each companys then current stock price., In an effort to generate publicity, Weintraub emailed the purported tender offers to media outlets and financial investment research firms. In published media interviews, Weintraub boasted that he has 15 years experience buying distressed companies, that banks had agreed to finance the acquisitions, and that letters of credit could be readily provided., Weintraub’s statements created the impression that Sterling Globals tender offers were legitimate and that the deals were capable of being completed; however, completion of either deal was impossible —Weintraub knew that neither he nor Sterling Global had any assets and that there were no agreements in place to finance the purported acquisitions., Weintraub and Sterling Global also omitted to disclose the following material information about their backgrounds:, In a 2002 SEC enforcement action, SEC v.

21956,2011,[<h3>SEC Charges UBS with Fraudulent Bidding Practices Involving Investment of Municipal Bond Proceeds</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged UBS Financial Services Inc. (UBS) with fraudulently rigging at least 100 municipal bond reinvestment transactions in 36 states and generating millions of dollars in ill-gotten gains., To settle the SEC’s charges, UBS has agreed to pay $47.2 million that will be returned to the affected municipalities. UBS and its affiliates also agreed to pay $113 million to settle parallel charges brought by other federal and state authorities., When investors purchase municipal securities, the municipalities generally temporarily invest the proceeds of the sales in reinvestment products before the money is used for the intended purposes. Under relevant IRS regulations, the proceeds of tax-exempt municipal securities must generally be invested at fair market value. The most common way of establishing fair market value is through a competitive bidding process in which bidding agents search for the appropriate investment vehicle for a municipality., The SEC alleges that during 2000 to 2004, UBS’s fraudulent practices and misrepresentations undermined the competitive bidding process and affected the prices that municipalities paid for the reinvestment products being bid on by the provider of the products. Its fraudulent conduct at the time also jeopardized the tax-exempt status of billions of dollars in municipal securities because the supposed competitive bidding process that establishes the fair market value of the investment was corrupted. The business unit involved in this misconduct closed in 2008 and its employees are no longer with the company., According to the SEC’s complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, UBS played various roles in these tainted transactions. UBS illicitly won bids as a provider of reinvestment products, and also rigged bids for the benefit of other providers while acting as a bidding agent on behalf of municipalities. UBS at times additionally facilitated the payment of improper undisclosed amounts to other bidding agents. In each instance, UBS made fraudulent, misrepresentations or omissions, thereby deceiving municipalities and their agents. As bidding agent UBS steered business through a variety of mechanisms to favored bidders acting as providers of reinvestment products. In some cases, UBS gave a favored provider information on competing bids in a practice known as “last looks.” In other instances, UBS deliberately obtained off-market ”courtesy” bids or arranged “set-ups” by obtaining purposefully non-competitive bids from others so that the favored provider would win the business. UBS also transmitted improper, undisclosed payments to favored bidding agents through interest rate swaps. In addition, UBS was favored to win bids with last looks and set-ups as a provider of reinvestment products., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC’s complaint, UBS has consented to the entry of a final judgment enjoining it from future violations of Section 15(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. UBS has agreed to pay a penalty of $32.5 million and disgorgement of $9,606,543 with prejudgment interest of $5,100,637. The settlement is subject to court approval., In a related enforcement action, the SEC barred former UBS officer Mark Zaino from associating with any broker, dealer or investment adviser, based upon his guilty plea last year in a criminal case charging him with two counts of conspiracy and one count of wire fraud for engaging in misconduct in the competitive bidding process involving the investment of proceeds of tax-exempt municipal bonds. The Commission recognizes Zaino’s cooperation in the SEC’s investigation as well as investigations conducted by other law enforcement agencies., This is the SEC’s second settlement with a major bank in an ongoing investigation into corruption in the municipal reinvestment industry. In December 2010, the SEC charged Banc of America Securities LLC (BAS) with securities fraud for similar conduct. In that matter, BAS agreed to pay more than $36 million in disgorgement and interest to settle the SEC’s charges, and paid an additional $101 million to other federal and state authorities for its misconduct., The SEC’s investigation was conducted by Deputy Chief Mark R. Zehner and Assistant Municipal Securities Counsel Denise D. Colliers, who are members of the Municipal Securities and Public Pensions Unit in the Philadelphia Regional Office. The SEC’s investigation is continuing., The SEC thanks the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation for their cooperation and assistance in this matter. The SEC is bringing this enforcement action in coordination with the Department of Justice, Internal Revenue Service and 25 State Attorneys General. [SEC v.

The Complaint alleges that in SEC filings and other public statements for year-end 2007 and the first and second quarters of 2008, senior executives at the Brooke companies misrepresented, among other things, the number of Brooke Capital franchisees and their financial health, the deterioration of Aleritas’ corresponding loan portfolio, and the increasingly dire liquidity and financial condition of the Brooke companies., According to the SEC’s Complaint filed in federal court in Kansas, Brooke Capital’s former management inflated the number of franchise locations by including failed and abandoned locations in totals. They also concealed the nature and extent of Brooke Capital’s financial assistance to its franchisees, which included making franchise loan payments on behalf of struggling franchisees. Aleritas’ former management hid the company’s inability to repurchase millions of dollars of short-term loans sold to its network of regional lenders. They also sold or pledged the same loans as collateral to more than one lender, and improperly diverted payments from borrowers for the company’s operating expenses. Aleritas’ former management also concealed the rapid deterioration of the company’s loan portfolio by falsifying loan performance reports to lenders, understating loan loss reserves, and by failing to write-down its residual interests in securitization and credit facility assets., The SEC’s Complaint charges the following former Brooke executives:, , , , , , , As alleged in the Commission’s Complaint, each of the defendants violated Sections 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder, and aided and abetted violations by Brooke Corporation, Brooke Capital, and/or Aleritas of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-13 thereunder.

These settlements are subject to approval by the Court. Each of the defendants consented to be permanently enjoined from violating or aiding and abetting all of the provisions that the Commission alleges they violated, and to officer and director bars. Lowry also consented to pay a $175,000 civil penalty and disgorgement of $214,500, with prejudgment interest of $24,004.91, Hess consented to pay a $250,000 civil penalty, and Vrbas consented to pay a $130,000 civil penalty.

Butler of Bermuda Dunes, Calif., The SEC alleges that from January 2009 to March 2011, Butler raised approximately $3.3 million from at least 17 investors who were mostly senior citizens living in or around Indio, Calif. He operated out of his home and dazzled investors with his multiple computer screens and a purported proprietary trading program that he claimed to use in his day trading business. Butler promised exorbitant returns to investors through investments in his hedge fund, but instead stole $1.6 million and lost the other half of investor funds in his securities trading., The SEC’s complaint alleges that Butler sent falsified account statements to investors in order to conceal his fraud, and grossly inflated the hedge fund balances. According to one statement, the fund balance was $8.9 million compared to the true balance of merely $22. The SEC further alleges that Butler lied that he was a graduate of MIT and he concealed from investors his Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing in 1998. Despite investor requests, Butler has failed to return their money and instead continues to solicit new funds and lull existing investors into believing that repayments are forthcoming., The Honorable Margaret Morrow, United States District Judge, granted the SEC’s application for emergency relief and froze the defendants’ assets.

Goble liable for committing fraud and aiding and abetting his clearing firm’s violations of the Customer Protection Rule and books and records provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in SEC v. North American Clearing, Inc., et al., Case No. 6:08-cv-829-Orl-35KRS (M.D. Fla., May 28, 2008). North American Clearing, Inc., was a broker-dealer that acted as the clearing firm for approximately 40 correspondent firms and more than 10,000 customer accounts. Goble, a former FINRA board member, was the founder, sole owner, and a director of North American., Following a five-day bench trial, the judge found “it clear from the evidence of record, that North American had financial problems and Defendant Goble and North American’s executives made a substantial effort to conceal it.” Specifically, the judge found Goble acted with the “highest degree of scienter” in directing North American to falsely record a $5 million money market purchase, which artificially lowered the firm’s reserve requirement under the Customer Protection Rule and allowed North American to improperly withdraw more than $3 million from its Exclusive Benefit of Customers (EBOC) Account. The Court further found this “sham” transaction constituted fraud on the market., As a result, the Court permanently enjoined Goble from violating Sections 10(b), 15(c)(3), and 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 15c3-3, and 17a-3 thereunder. Additionally, on its own initiative, the Court enjoined Goble from attempting to secure any securities licenses or otherwise attempting to engage in the securities business. The Court also ordered him to pay a reduced civil penalty amount of $7,500 based, in part, on her consideration that Goble’s firm had been liquidated in a Securities Investor Protection Corporation bankruptcy proceeding., The Commission commenced this action by filing its complaint on May 27, 2008, against North American Clearing, Inc., Goble, its president Bruce Blatman and its former financial and operations principal Timothy Ward. The other defendants previously settled the Commission’s charges against them by consenting, without admitting or denying the Commission’s allegations, to permanent injunctions.

Kobayashi issued a temporary restraining order on May 9 requiring the firm to produce the firm’s books and records for examination and providing additional equitable relief., The SEC alleges that Jupiter Group Capital Advisors LLC and Rick Cho falsely reported that the advisory firm managed $153 million in 38 investor accounts.  The false statements were made on Jupiter Group’s Form ADV filing – the public form used by investment advisers to register with the SEC or state securities authorities.  When SEC staff sought to conduct an examination of Jupiter Group after the filing was made, Cho initially failed to respond and then later claimed that the filing referred to estimated future assets and stated that Jupiter Group has no client accounts., According to the SEC’s complaint, Cho  refused to provide any evidence for his claim that the assets identified on Jupiter Group’s March 2010 Form ADV filing with the SEC belong to an unrelated business venture.  He also failed to explain why the document originally filed in October 2009 was amended to show an increased number of clients and assets under management, when in reality there weren’t any client accounts.  The SEC alleges that Jupiter Group did not manage $25 million or more of client assets for any reporting period, and therefore was not eligible for SEC registration.  In addition, from December 2010 to the present, Jupiter Group and Cho have refused to submit to an examination.    , The SEC alleges that Jupiter Group violated Sections 203A, 204, and 207 of the Investment Advisers Act, and that Cho violated Section 207 of the Advisers Act and aided and abetted Jupiter Group’s violations of Sections 203A and 204 of the Advisers Act.

The Commission’s complaint alleges that the company’s material financial misstatements were primarily caused by the fraudulent conduct of Scullin who prepared and caused false manual journal entries to be entered into the company’s general ledger.  Scullin’s misconduct occurred against a backdrop of Michael Baker’s failure to maintain adequate internal controls over its former energy business segment’s books, records and accounts.  <br/>As alleged in the Commission’s complaint, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2006 and continuing through the first three quarters of 2007, Scullin made unsupportable manual journal entries that resulted in the material overstatement of the company’s pre-tax income by 13% for the fourth quarter of 2006, and by 100%, 33% and 28% for the first three quarters of 2007.  <br/>The Commission also charged Dennis Higgins, a former operations manager in Michael Baker’s energy segment, with insider trading.  The Commission’s complaint alleges that Higgins sold all of his Michael Baker stock in his 401(k) account and terminated his ongoing 401(k) investments in the company upon learning of the material misstatements, and prior to the company’s February 22, 2008 public announcement that it would restate its prior financial results.    , Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Michael Baker consented to a permanent injunction against future violations of the reporting, books and records and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws, including Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder; Scullin consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him against violations of the antifraud, books and records and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws, including Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder and aiding and abetting violations of the reporting, books and records and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws, including Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder, and ordering him to pay a $35,000 civil penalty.  , Additionally, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Dennis Higgins consented to a permanent injunction against violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, including Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering disgorgement of $16,929.75 and prejudgment interest of $2,035.17, representing his losses avoided on account of his insider trading, and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $16,929.75., In a related action, the Commission today also instituted a settled administrative proceeding against Michael Higgins, Scullin’s former supervisor and the former Chief Financial Officer of Michael Baker’s energy segment.  The Commission’s findings include that: (1) as the former Chief Financial Officer of Michael Baker Corporation’s energy business segment, Michael Higgins regularly approved month-end manual journal entries that had been posted by Scullin, but did not review the supporting documentation for the manual journal entries as part of his approval process; and (2) certain of these manual journal entries were not in accordance with GAAP, resulting in the Company’s material overstatements of revenue and net income in its financial statements contained in the Form 10-K for its fiscal year 2006 (filed March 16, 2007) and in the Forms 10-Q for the first three quarters of its fiscal year 2007 (filed May 8, 2007, August 7, 2007, and November 5, 2007, respectively).

Thor has agreed to be permanently enjoined and to pay a $1 million civil penalty for violating a 1999 Commission cease-and-desist Order prohibiting violations of the books and records and internal controls provisions. <i>In the Matter of Thor Industries, Inc.</i>, Exchange Act Release No. 42021 (Oct. 18, 1999). The SEC also charged Mark C. Schwartzhoff, a former Vice President of Finance at Thor’s Dutchmen Manufacturing, Inc. subsidiary, with securities fraud and other violations. Schwartzhoff has agreed to be permanently enjoined, to be permanently barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and to be permanently suspended from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant. Schwartzhoff also agreed to pay disgorgement of $394,830, which shall be deemed satisfied by the entry of a restitution order against Schwartzhoff in a parallel criminal case., The SEC’s complaint alleges that from approximately December 2002 to January 2007, while serving as the senior financial officer of Dutchmen, one of Thor’s principal operating subsidiaries, Schwartzhoff engaged in a fraudulent accounting scheme to understate Dutchmen’s cost of goods sold in order to avoid recognizing inventory costs that were not reflected in Dutchmen’s financial accounting system. Instead of properly recording increased cost of goods sold, Schwartzhoff concealed the costs in various balance sheet accounts by making baseless manual journal entries to falsify the financial statements and other records he provided to Thor. To cover-up his false entries, the complaint alleges that Schwartzhoff created false supporting documentation and false account reconciliations. Schwartzhoff also submitted false documents and information to Thor’s external auditor., As alleged in the complaint, Schwartzhoff’s fraud overstated Dutchmen’s pre-tax income by nearly $27 million from fiscal year 2003 to the second quarter of fiscal 2007, and allowed him to obtain nearly $300,000 in ill-gotten bonuses. In June 2007, Thor filed restated financial statements for fiscal years 2004 to 2006, each of the quarters of fiscal 2005 and 2006, and the first quarter of fiscal 2007, reducing its pre-tax income by approximately $26 million in the aggregate., The SEC’s complaint further alleges that Thor failed to maintain accurate books and records and adequate internal accounting controls in violation of a 1999 Commission cease-and-desist Order. The Order directed Thor to cease and desist from committing future books and records and internal controls violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), based on similar misconduct and internal control deficiencies that occurred over four years at a different Thor subsidiary., The complaint alleges that Thor’s failure to implement adequate internal controls after the 1999 Order provided Schwartzhoff the opportunity to commit his fraud without detection. In particular, Thor failed to adequately implement and verify certain key segregation of duties within accounting and financial functions at Dutchmen, which allowed Schwartzhoff to have unfettered access rights to Dutchmen’s accounting system, the ability to create, enter and approve manual journal entries, and the ability to create and approve account reconciliations. As a result, Schwartzhoff was able to make fraudulent journal entries in various accounts and to disguise these entries through account reconciliations and supporting documents that he falsified. In addition, as alleged in the complaint, Thor failed adequately to monitor and verify account reconciliations and account information that Schwartzhoff submitted in reporting Dutchmen’s financial results. Thor also failed to implement an effective internal audit function for Dutchmen., As the SEC’s complaint alleges, after Schwartzhoffs fraud came to light, Thor concluded that the internal control failures at Dutchmen constituted a material weakness in Thor’s internal controls over financial reporting. Thor also determined that similar lack of segregation of duties existed in varying degrees at each of its subsidiaries.

Barriger with fraud in connection with two upstate New York real estate funds he managed – the Gaffken &amp; Barriger Fund, LLC (the G&amp;B Fund or the Fund), and Campus Capital Corp. (Campus).  According to the complaint, the G&amp;B Fund raised approximately $20 million from January 1998 until March 2008, and Campus raised approximately $12 million from October 2001 until July 2008.  The Commission charged Barriger with defrauding the funds and their investors and prospective investors to whom he offered and sold interests in these funds., The SEC’s complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that from at least July 2006 until March 5, 2008, when he froze the Fund and disclosed to investors its true financial condition, Barriger defrauded investors and prospective investors in the G&amp;B Fund by misrepresenting that the Fund was a relatively safe and liquid investment that paid a minimum “Preferred Return” of 8% per year.  The complaint further alleges that Barriger made these misrepresentations knowing, or recklessly disregarding, that the Fund’s actual performance did not justify these performance claims, and without disclosing information about the Fund’s true performance and financial condition – which rapidly deteriorated in 2007 and early 2008 as Barriger continued to raise money from new and existing investors.   , The complaint also alleges that Barriger defrauded the G&amp;B Fund itself by (a) allocating the Preferred Return to investors when the Fund did not have sufficient income to justify the allocation; and (b) by, when the Fund lacked the income to support those allocations and payments causing the Fund to pay cash distributions of the Preferred Returns to those Fund investors who requested them, and to redeem investors at values reflecting the purported accrued 8% per year Preferred Return., Finally, the complaint alleges that Barriger defrauded Campus and its prospective investors by causing Campus to inject a total of nearly $2.5 million into the G&amp;B Fund between August 2007 and April 2008 at a time when the G&amp;B Fund was in distress, and by raising money for Campus without disclosing to investors his use of Campus’s assets to prop up the ailing G&amp;B Fund. The complaint also alleges that Barriger caused Campus to engage in other transactions that personally benefitted Barriger, none of which he disclosed to prospective Campus investors., The complaint alleges that Barriger violated Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940., In its complaint, the SEC seeks a final judgment permanently enjoining Barriger from future violations of the foregoing provisions and ordering him to pay civil penalties and disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest., The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York.  ,  ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr21968.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

LeBoeuf, through his company New Castle, raised $540,000 from nine investors, ostensibly to purchase various types of interests in oil and gas projects run by third parties. As Alleged in the complaint, LeBoeuf made misrepresentations to investors regarding the use of investor funds, the anticipated monthly returns and prior regulatory actions brought against him. LeBoeuf failed to properly manage the funds entrusted to him by investors and only applied about 30% of the total funds raised to the intended purpose.

Highview was added as a defendant to a case the SEC previously filed in January 2011, and three hedge funds managed by Highview were named as relief defendants because, according to the SEC’s charges, they are in possession of funds tainted by the Ponzi scheme. After a hearing, the Honorable Janet Bond Arterton, U.S. District Judge for the District of Connecticut, entered a consented-to order on May 13, 2011 temporarily freezing the assets of Highview and the three hedge funds it advises. A hearing on the SEC’s motion for a preliminary injunction is set for May 23, 2011., The SEC <a href=/news/press/2011/2011-30.htm target=_top>previously charged Francisco Illarramendi and his unregistered investment advisory firm MK Capital Management LLC</a><a name=P5_1492></a> on January 14, 2011, and obtained an asset freeze against them, alleging that they had misappropriated at least $53 million in investor assets. The SEC subsequently amended that complaint on March 7, 2011, to allege that Illarramendi and MK Capital Management misappropriated investor assets and misused two hedge funds they manage for Ponzi-like activity in which they used new investor money to pay off earlier investors. Since the filing of the original complaint on January 14, 2011, Judge Arterton entered an order on January 28, 2011, freezing the assets of Illarramendi, MK Capital Management and several affiliated entities. On February 3, 2011, Judge Arterton appointed John J. Carney of Baker Hostetler LLP as the receiver in the case., On May 10, 2011, the SEC filed a second amended complaint adding Highview as a defendant, and charging that Illarramendi conducted his alleged fraud while he was a partial owner of Highview, a Commission-registered investment adviser, and that he used the two advisory firms (Highview and MK Capital Management) in tandem to conduct the scheme. In particular, the second amended complaint alleges, among other things, that Highview Point Partners, acting through Illarramendi, misappropriated money from the three hedge funds it advised: Highview Point Master Fund, Ltd., Highview Point Offshore, Ltd., and Highview Point LP. The second amended complaint alleges that Illarramendi hid the misappropriation in the Highview hedge funds by misappropriating money from different hedge funds managed by MK Capital Management. According to the second amended complaint, this acted as a fraud on both sets of clients, in that Illarramendi used money from one set of investors to repay earlier investors., The SEC’s second amended complaint charges Illarramendi, Highview Point Partners, LLC, and Michael Kenwood Capital Management, LLC, with violating Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder, and also charges Highview Point Partners, LLC with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also names the following entities as relief defendants, alleging that they received investor funds to which they have no right: Highview Point Master Fund, Ltd., Highview Point Offshore, Ltd., and Highview Point LP, Michael Kenwood Asset Management LLC, Michael Kenwood Energy and Infrastructure LLC, and MKEI Solar LP. In addition to preliminary emergency relief, the SEC’s complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and penalties from the defendants, and disgorgement plus prejudgment interest from the relief defendants., On March 7, 2011, Illarramendi pled guilty to several criminal counts in a parallel criminal action brought by the United States Attorney for the District of Connecticut relating to the same misconduct as well as for obstruction of justice for deliberately misleading the SEC staff during its investigation. On May 4, 2011, Juan Carlos Guillen Zerpa, a Venezuelan accountant associated with Illarramendi, pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to obstruct the SEC’s investigation for his role in creating false documents purporting to verify the existence of hedge fund assets during the SEC’s investigation., The SEC’s investigation is ongoing.

Clement hyped the profit potential by falsely promising returns of 1 to 2 percent per month to investors in his hedge funds (The Edgefund, LP and The Edge Fund Ltd., LP).  He falsely claimed that the risk potential was limited because of his purported 5 percent stop-loss rule, and he falsely assured investors that they could request a return of their investments at any time upon written request.

The court will hold a hearing on May 16, 2011, on the SEC’s motion for a preliminary injunction., The SEC alleges that in order to conceal his fraud, Clement sent fabricated account statements to at least one investor that reflected an inflated fund balance of $8.2 million.  In fact, the hedge fund accounts at that time were not even funded.  Beginning March 29, 2011, Clement began telling investors that an SEC investigation had impacted his ability to communicate with them, frozen his bank accounts, and blocked his securities trading activities.

Unbeknownst to the relative, Haim surreptitiously listened to the relative’s private telephone conversations about the potential transactions, and read confidential documents, which referenced the transactions. By trading on the material nonpublic information he heard and saw, Haim allegedly breached his duty of trust and confidence that he owed to the relative., The Commission’s complaint alleges that between April 2006 and March 2007, Haim, a New Jersey resident and self-employed technology consultant, purchased securities in advance of merger and acquisition announcements based on material nonpublic information in Intergraph Corporation, Metasolv, Inc., Open Solutions Inc., Aeroflex Incorporated, and MapInfo Corporation in brokerage accounts he owned or controlled. According to the complaint, Haim knew that the relative owed a duty of confidentiality to his employer and his employer’s clients. Despite knowing that the relative could not, and did not, share nonpublic information with him, Haim misappropriated such information and used it for his own benefit. As a result of his trading, Haim generated $30,126 in illegal profits., Without admitting or denying the SEC’s allegations, Haim agreed to settle the charges against him.

From at least January 2000 to October 2006, Johnson worked in NASDAQ’s Corporate Client Group (CCG).  He then transferred to the Market Intelligence Desk, a specialized department within the CCG that provides issuers with general market updates, overviews of their company’s sector, and commentary regarding the factors influencing day-to-day trading activity in their stocks.  , The SEC alleges that, through his positions in the CCG and Market Intelligence Desk, Johnson had frequent and significant interactions with senior executives of NASDAQ-listed issuers, including CEOs, CFOs, and investor relations officers at his assigned companies.  In those interactions, company executives routinely shared confidential information with Johnson regarding impending public announcements that could affect the price of their stocks.  The executives who shared nonpublic information with Johnson did so based on the understanding that it would be kept confidential and that Johnson could not use the information for his personal benefit., According to the SEC’s complaint, Johnson unlawfully traded in advance of nine announcements of material nonpublic information involving NASDAQ-listed companies from August 2006 to July 2009.  Johnson took advantage of both favorable and unfavorable information that was entrusted to him in confidence by NASDAQ and its listed companies, shorting stocks on several occasions and establishing long positions in other instances.  The complaint also states that Johnson often placed the trades directly from his work computer through an online brokerage account in his wife’s name.

The indictment alleges that Moskop obtained by fraud approximately $2,400,000 from 25 victims. According to the indictment, Moskops victims included his relatives, individuals referred by trusted friends and attorneys, a local Veterans of Foreign War Post, and long-time customers of his insurance business. The criminal case is being prosecuted in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois., The criminal charges against Moskop are related to the conduct underlying the SECs civil action against Moskop and his company, Financial Services Moskop &amp; Associates.

This trading platform or trading facility purportedly involved transactions among international banks that would generate substantial return on a recurring basis. Specifically, Rothenberg represented that the trading platform would produce returns in excess of 300% every fourteen days. Rothenberg and Four Five also represented to investors, both orally and in writing, that the majority of their funds would remain at all times in Rothenberg’s attorney trust account, and that all funds invested, along with the profits, would be returned to the investors at the conclusion of the trades. Rothenberg further represented to the investors that the investment was risk-free because their funds would remain in his attorney trust account. Contrary to Defendants’ representations, a risk-free trading process providing the returns promised by Defendants does not exist. Moreover, contrary to Rothenberg’s representations that investor funds would remain in his attorney trust account, Rothenberg began disbursing investor funds within days of receipt of those funds.

(the “Unknown Purchasers”). The Commission filed a complaint alleging that the Unknown Purchasers engaged in illegal insider trading in the days preceding the June 1, 2011 announcement that Schneider Electric S.A., a French company, and Telvent, a company based in Madrid, Spain, had entered into an agreement under which Schneider would offer to acquire all of the outstanding common stock of Telvent at a price of $40 per share, a 16% premium over the previous day’s closing price. The Commission’s complaint alleges that the Unknown Purchasers, through their insider trading, violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, the disgorgement of all illegal profits, and the imposition of civil money penalties., The Commission’s complaint alleges that between April 29, 2011 and May 27, 2011, the Unknown Purchasers bought 1,200 Telvent call option contracts through an account at Pershing LLC. About two-thirds of the call option contracts were purchased within five calendar days (or two trading days) before the acquisition announcement and comprised as much as 52% of the volume of that series of call options that day. The price of the call options held by the Unknown Purchasers rose dramatically. In one instance, the price of the options increased by about 480%. The complaint alleges that, as a result, the Unknown Purchasers realized total profits of approximately $475,000 from the sale of the call options., In addition to freezing the assets relating to the trading, the Temporary Restraining Order requires the Unknown Purchasers to identify themselves, imposes an expedited discovery schedule, and prohibits the defendants from destroying documents.<a name=P6_2333></a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr21991.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The Commission also received additional relief it sought, including an order freezing the assets of multiple defendants and relief defendants., The Commission filed an emergency action on April 28, 2011, alleging that China Voice’s co-founder and former Chief Financial Officer, David Ronald Allen, with the assistance of two associates, Alex Dowlatshahi and Christopher Mills, and numerous related entities, launched what became an ongoing fraud that sought to raise at least $8.6 million from investors across the country. The Commission alleged that, contrary to what investors were told, proceeds were used to pay back earlier investors; to make payments to Allen, Dowlatshahi, and Mills; and to make payments to Allen-affiliated business, including China Voice., On June 5, the Honorable Judge Reed O’Connor, United States District Judge, entered a preliminary injunction, which, along with freezing the assets of multiple defendants and relief defendants, prevents the defendants from violating certain provisions of the securities laws, orders the preservation of documents, and requires the defendants to provide an accounting to determine the disposition of investor funds., The SEC’s complaint charges Allen, Dowlatshahi, Mills, and various related companies with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The Commissions action was filed on December 8, 2010 and was initially styled Securities and Exchange Commission v. One or More Unknown Purchasers of Securities of Wimm-Bill-Dann Foods OJSC. The Commissions complaint alleged that certain unknown purchasers engaged in illegal insider trading in the American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) of Wimm-Bill-Dann Foods OJSC (WBD), a Russian corporation that manufactures and sells dairy and fruit juice products, ahead of a December 2, 2010, announcement that PepsiCo, Inc. intended to acquire a 66 percent interest in WBD.

Meyer, of Coppell, Texas, and Mark Meyer &amp; Associates, Inc. (MMAI), Meyers business. The final judgment: (1) enjoined Meyer and MMAI from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 10b-10 promulgated thereunder, and enjoined Meyer from aiding and abetting violations of Rule 10b-10 of the Exchange Act; (2) ordered Meyer and MMAI to pay disgorgement in the amount of $1,162,729.13 plus prejudgment interest of $565,204.12, for a total of $1,727,933.25; and (3) ordered Meyer to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $120,000, and MMAI to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $600,000. , The SECs complaint in this matter charges that Michael E. Kelly and 25 other defendants, including Meyer and MMAI, participated in a massive fraud on U.S. investors that involved the offer and sale of securities in the form of Universal Leases. Universal Lease investments were structured as timeshares in several hotels in Cancun, Mexico, coupled with a pre-arranged rental agreement that promised investors a high, fixed rate of return. The SECs complaint alleges that from 1999 until 2005, Kelly and others, including Meyer and MMAI, raised at least $428 million through the Universal Lease scheme from investors throughout the United States, with more than $136 million of the funds invested coming from IRA accounts. The SEC further alleges that a nationwide network of unregistered salespeople who sold the Universal Leases, including Meyer and MMAI, collected undisclosed commissions totaling more than $72 million. The SEC also alleges that Kelly and others ran the scheme from Cancun, Mexico, through a number of foreign entities in Mexico and Panama. According to the SECs complaint, Kelly and others told investors that Universal Leases would generate guaranteed income through the leasing of investor timeshares by a large, independent leasing agent. In fact, the complaint alleges, the leasing agent was a small Panamanian travel agency controlled by Kelly, and for most of the scheme, its payments to investors came from accounts funded by money raised from new investors. Further, the complaint alleges that Kelly and the other defendants, including Meyer and MMAI, failed to disclose key facts about the Universal Lease investment, including the risks of the investment and that Kelly was paying commissions as high as 27% to the selling brokers. The SECs action against the remaining defendants is pending. , For further information, see Litigation Release Nos. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20267.htm>20267</a> (Sept. 5, 2007), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20573.htm>20573</a> (May 14, 2008) , <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20578.htm>20578</a> (May 15, 2008), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20579.htm>20579</a> (May 15, 2008), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20664.htm>20664</a> (July 31, 2008), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20679.htm>20679</a> (August 12, 2008), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20708.htm>20708</a> (Sept. 9, 2008); <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20709.htm>20709</a> (Sept. 9, 2008), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20799.htm>20799</a> (November 6, 2008), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21003.htm>21003</a> (April 15, 2009), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2010/lr21481.htm>21481</a> (April 8, 2010); <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2010/lr21583.htm>21583</a> (June 29, 2010); <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2010/lr21620.htm>21620</a> (August 6, 2010), and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2010/lr21793.htm>21793</a> (December 23, 2010); [SEC v.

(Rick) Powell, former chairman of the board of First Cash Financial Services, Inc. (“First Cash”), with illegal insider trading.  The SEC’s Complaint, filed in United States District Court for the Western District of Texas (Waco Division), alleges that in early March 2008 Powell, while he was serving as the chairman of the board of First Cash, learned material, non-public information about the commencement of a company share buyback.  , According to the Complaint, on November 6, 2007, the company had announced that it had authorized a buyback of up to 1 million First Cash shares.  That announcement did not disclose when the authority would be exercised or even whether management would actually exercise the authority.  The SEC alleges that Powell, through his position as chairman of First Cash’s board of directors, later learned, among other things, that First Cash had decided to actually exercise its repurchase authority and was set to begin the repurchase.  , According to the Complaint, Powell, armed with this material, non-public information, called his broker on March 11, the same day that First Cash entered into an agreement with JP Morgan Securities to facilitate the repurchase and the day before First Cash began repurchasing its shares.  He instructed the broker to buy 100,000 First Cash shares.  According to the SEC’s Complaint, Powell insisted that the purchase needed to be made that day.  , As alleged in the Complaint, Powell’s pre-buyback purchases caused First Cash to overpay $36,000 for its own securities between March 12 and March 14, 2008.  In addition, the SEC alleges that, as a result of the share price increase following disclosure that the buyback had commenced, Powell profited in the amount of $124,000 from his illegal purchase.  , Powell is alleged to have repeatedly tried to hide his trading from First Cash and its shareholders.  For example, the Complaint alleges that he misled another board member when he was warned against purchasing in advance of the buyback, and later he misled First Cash’s chief executive officer when he asked about the trade.  In addition, after his broker warned him that Commission rules required him to file a Form 4 disclosing his trade, he refused to do so and delayed filing his Form 4 until April 30, 2009, over thirteen months after it was required by Commission rules and only after he knew the Commission was investigating his trades.  , The SEC’s complaint alleges that, as a result of his conduct, Powell violated Sections 10(b) and 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 16a-3 thereunder.  The Commission seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of illicit profits with prejudgment interest, a monetary penalty, and an order barring Powell from serving as an officer or director of a public company., The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Texas and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. ,  ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr21996.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The Commission alleges that, from 2008 until May 2010, Germany and his companies raised more than $600,000 through the sale of promissory notes and interests in two Mississippi oil and gas projects.  Among other things, the Commission contends that Germany falsely claimed that certain wells were “producing” when he knew they were not, and that, instead of using offering proceeds for oil and gas related expenditures, as represented to investors, Germany diverted these funds to personal expenses., The Commission’s complaint alleges that Germany violated the Sections 5(a) and (c) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The Commission agreed to forego its claims for disgorgement and civil penalties in light of the judgment against Earls in a parallel criminal case in which he was sentenced to over 10 years in prison and ordered to pay nearly $22 million in restitution., The Commission’s complaint alleged that from June 1998 through August 2002, Earls misappropriated approximately $13.8 million from investors who believed they were giving Earls money to purchase preferred stock and warrants from U.S. Technologies, Inc.

The complaint alleged that Earls falsely told investors in USV Partners that the entity was created solely to purchase and hold UST stock and warrants, and that he would not take any management fees. According to the complaint, Earls lured more than one hundred investors into giving him more than $20 million to purchase UST stock and warrants through USV Partners. As alleged in the complaint, although UST badly needed the capital infusion, only a portion of the $20 million received from USV Partners investors was used to purchase UST stock and warrants. The complaint alleged that Earls misappropriated $13.8 million of investors’ money by paying himself $4.7 million in management fees and $9.1 million that he falsely classified as “Legal and Accounting” expenses., The final judgment against Earls: (i) permanently enjoins him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act; Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder; and from aiding and abetting violations of Exchange Act Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder; and (ii) bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for a period of 20 years., In a parallel criminal action, <i>U.S. v.

The Court found that Smart and his company violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, and ordered defendants to pay $4.7 million in disgorgement and civil penalties., The SEC filed this action against the defendants on March 11, 2009, alleging that Smart and his company had engaged in a Ponzi-like scheme in the offer and sale of promissory notes and other securities. The complaint alleged that Smart falsely represented to investors, including senior citizens, that he was providing a conservative, liquid investment opportunity. Instead, according to the complaint, Smart was misappropriating investor funds for his own personal use, investing in illiquid and ill-fated real estate ventures, and using proceeds from new investors to make payments to earlier investors., On the day this action was filed, the Court granted the SEC’s motion for a temporary restraining order, asset freeze, and other preliminary relief. Subsequently, on August 21, 2009, the Court granted the SEC’s motion for a preliminary injunction against the defendants., After completion of discovery in this case, the parties moved for summary judgment. In granting the SEC’s motion for summary judgment and entering final judgment, the Court found that Smart and his company misappropriated over $2.05 million from investors through a “systematic program of deception and fraud.” The Court found that Smart targeted elderly investors and that he falsely represented that he would place investor funds in safe, principal guaranteed investments. Instead, the Court found, Smart used investor money to pay personal expenses, to invest in risky real estate ventures and hard money loans, and to pay purported “dividends” to other investors., The Court’s final judgment against Smart and Smart Assets permanently enjoins the defendants from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, and orders defendants to pay $2,059,077 in disgorgement, $597,426 in prejudgment interest, and a $2,059,077 civil penalty., For further information regarding this case, see Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr20946.htm target=_top>20946</a> (March 12, 2009).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr22001.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

(TBW), which was once the nations largest non-depository mortgage lender, with orchestrating a large-scale securities fraud scheme and attempting to scam the U.S. Treasurys Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP)., On February 24, 2011, the SEC charged Desiree E. Brown, TBW’s former treasurer, with aiding and abetting Farkas’ securities fraud and TARP related schemes., On March 2, 2011, the SEC charged Catherine L. Kissick, a former vice president at Colonial Bank and the head of its mortgage warehouse lending division (MWLD) with being an active participant in Farkas’ securities fraud scheme., On March 16, 2011, the SEC charged Teresa A. Kelly, a former operations supervisor at Colonial Bank’s MWLD with being an active participant in Farkas and Kissick’s securities fraud scheme., In the comprehensive scheme, the SEC alleged that Farkas, Kissick, Brown and Kelly (collectively, Defendants) conspired together to sell more than $1.5 billion worth of fabricated or impaired mortgage loans and securities from TBW to Colonial Bank. Those loans and securities were falsely reported to the investing public as high-quality, liquid assets. Farkas and Brown were also responsible for a bogus equity investment that caused Colonial Bank to misrepresent that it had satisfied a prerequisite necessary to qualify for TARP funds. When Colonial Banks parent company — The Colonial BancGroup, Inc. — issued a press release announcing it had obtained preliminary approval to receive $550 million in TARP funds, its stock price jumped 54 percent in the remaining two hours of trading, representing its largest one-day price increase since 1983., According to the SECs complaints, each filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Defendants executed the fraudulent scheme from March 2002 until August 2009, when TBW — a privately-held company headquartered in Ocala, Florida — filed for bankruptcy. TBW was the largest customer of Colonial Banks MWLD. Because TBW generally did not have sufficient capital to internally fund the mortgage loans it originated, it relied on financing arrangements primarily through Colonial Banks MWLD to fund such mortgage loans., According to the SECs complaints, TBW began to experience liquidity problems and overdrew its then-limited warehouse line of credit with Colonial Bank by approximately $15 million each day. The SEC alleges that Farkas pressured Kissick and Kelly to assist in concealing TBWs overdraws through a pattern of kiting whereby certain debits to TBWs warehouse line of credit were not entered until after credits due to the warehouse line of credit for the following day were entered. As this kiting activity increased in scope, TBW was overdrawing its accounts with Colonial Bank by approximately $150 million per day., The SEC alleges that in order to conceal this initial fraudulent conduct, Defendants jointly devised a plan for TBW to create and submit fictitious loan information to Colonial Bank. Defendants also directed the creation of fictitious mortgage-backed securities assembled from the fraudulent loans. By the end of 2007, the scheme consisted of approximately $500 million in fake residential mortgage loans and approximately $1 billion in severely impaired residential mortgage loans and securities. As a direct result of Defendants misconduct, these fictitious and impaired loans were misrepresented as high-quality assets on Colonial BancGroups financial statements., The SEC alleges that in addition to causing Colonial BancGroup to misrepresent its assets, Farkas and Brown caused BancGroup to misstate publicly that it had obtained commitments for a $300 million capital infusion, which would qualify Colonial Bank for TARP funding. Farkas falsely told BancGroup that a foreign-held investment bank had committed to financing TBWs equity investment in Colonial Bank. Farkas also issued a press release on behalf of TBW announcing that TBW had secured the necessary financing for BancGroup. Contrary to his representations to BancGroup and to the investing public, Farkas never secured financing or sufficient investors to fund the capital infusion. When BancGroup and TBW later mutually announced the termination of their stock purchase agreement, essentially signaling the end of Colonial Banks pursuit of TARP funds, BancGroups stock declined 20 percent., The SECs complaint against Farkas charges him with violations of the antifraud, reporting, books and records and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws, including Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder and aiding and abetting violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13 thereunder. The SEC is seeking permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and financial penalties against Farkas. The SEC also seeks an officer-and-director bar against Farkas as well as an equitable order prohibiting him from serving in a senior management or control position at any mortgage-related company or other financial institution and from holding any position involving financial reporting or disclosure at a public company. On November 5, 2010, at the request of Farkas, the court stayed the SEC’s action against him pending resolution of the criminal case filed against him in the same district by the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia., The SEC’s complaint against Kissick charges her with violations of the antifraud, reporting, books and records and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws. Without admitting or denying the SEC’s allegations, Kissick consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining her from violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder, and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13 thereunder. Kissick also consented to an order barring her from acting as an officer or director of any public company that has securities registered with the SEC pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act. Kissick also consented to an order prohibiting her from serving in a senior management or control position at any mortgage-related company or other financial institution or from holding any position involving financial reporting or disclosure at a public company. The proposed preliminary settlement, under which the SEC’s requests for financial penalties against Kissick would remain pending, is subject to court approval., The SECs complaint against Brown charges her with violations of the antifraud, reporting, books and records and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws. Without admitting or denying the SECs allegations, Brown consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining her from violation of Rule 13b2-1 of the Exchange Act and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13 thereunder. The proposed preliminary settlement, under which the SECs requests for financial penalties against Brown would remain pending, is subject to court approval., The SEC’s complaint against Kelly charges her with violations of the antifraud, reporting, books and records and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws. Without admitting or denying the SECs allegations, Brown consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining her from violation of Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder, and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13 thereunder. The preliminary settlement, under which the SECs requests for financial penalties against Brown remain pending, was entered by the court on May 4, 2011., The SECs investigation is ongoing.

The SEC’s amended complaint charges China Voice, Allen, and William F. Burbank IV (China Voice’s former chairman and CEO) with reconstituting former subsidiaries of China Voice at Voice One Corp. without informing China Voice investors., On April 28, 2011, the SEC filed a complaint in federal court in Texas, alleging that Allen, Burbank, and China Voice engaged in a series of false and misleading statements and material omissions to investors about China Voice’s financial condition. Today’s complaint alleges that this fraudulent behavior extended to renaming two China Voice subsidiaries and reconstituting them at Voice One and that Allen and Burbank are now involved in running Voice One., Also as alleged in the SEC’s original complaint, Allen, with the assistance of two associates, launched what became an ongoing fraud that sought to raise at least $8.6 million from investors, telling them that their funds would be used to make loans to profitable businesses with demonstrated track records. The Commission alleged that contrary to what investors were told, proceeds were used to pay back earlier investors; to make payments to Allen and his associates; and to make payments to Allen-affiliated businesses, including China Voice. Today’s amended complaint alleges that Allen also used investor funds to make payments to Voice One, contradicting the disclosures made to investors.

Morgan Securities to Pay $153.6 Million to Settle SEC Charges of Misleading Investors in CDO Tied to U.S. Housing Market<br/><br/> Harmed Investors Getting their Money Back, Firm to Pay Penalty and Change Practices </h3>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) today charged J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (f/k/a J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.) (J.P. Morgan Securities) for misleading investors in connection with a synthetic collateralized debt obligation (CDO) J.P. Morgan Securities structured and marketed. This synthetic CDO, Squared CDO 2007-1 (Squared), was tied to the performance of residential mortgages and was structured and marketed in early 2007 when the United States housing market was beginning to show signs of distress. The SEC also brought charges against an investment advisory firm who participated in the transaction., According to the SECs complaint against J.P. Morgan Securities, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, the investment portfolio for Squared consisted primarily of credit default swaps (CDS) referencing other CDO securities whose value was tied to the U.S. residential housing market. The SEC alleges that the marketing materials for Squared all represented that its investment portfolio was selected by GSCP (NJ) L.P. (GSC), a registered investment adviser with experience analyzing credit risk in CDOs. Undisclosed in the marketing materials and unknown to investors, the Magnetar Capital LLC hedge fund, which was poised to benefit if the CDOs defaulted, played a significant role in selecting which CDOs should make up the portfolio. While participating in the selection of the investment portfolio, Magnetar shorted a substantial portion of the assets it helped to select by entering into CDS to buy protection on them. The CDO securities Magnetar shorted had a notional value of approximately $600 million, representing over half of Squared’s investment portfolio.,  J.P. Morgan Securities sold approximately $150 million of the so-called “mezzanine” tranches of Squared’s liabilities -- representing the riskiest notes of the deal after the equity -- to a group of approximately 15 institutional investors (Mezzanine Investors). The Mezzanine Investors included a faith-based not-for-profit membership organization headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota (Thrivent Financial for Lutherans), a company that provides insurance and retirement products based in Topeka, Kansas (Security Benefit Corporation) and financial institutions located in East Asia (Tokyo Star Bank, Far Glory Life Insurance Company Ltd., Taiwan Life Insurance Company Ltd., and East Asia Asset Management Ltd.). The Mezzanine Investors lost virtually all of their principal., Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC’s complaint, J.P. Morgan Securities agreed to settle by consenting to the entry of a final judgment that provides for a permanent injunction from Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933, and payment of $18.6 million in disgorgement, $2 million in prejudgment interest and a $133 million penalty, for a total of $153.6 million. Of that amount, $125,869,721 will be returned to the mezzanine investors through a Fair Fund distribution and $27,730,279 will be paid to the U.S. Treasury. The settlement also requires remedial action by J.P. Morgan in its review and approval of offerings of certain mortgage securities. J.P. Morgan’s consent notes that it voluntarily made payments totaling $56,761,214 to certain investors in a transaction known as Tahoma CDO I. The settlement is subject to Court approval., In a separate complaint also filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, the SEC brought charges against Edward S. Steffelin, the GSC employee who was in charge of the team responsible for selecting the portfolio for Squared. Steffelin, among other things, permitted Magnetar to select and short collateral and reviewed and edited the term sheet and pitch book before those materials were provided to investors. Also undisclosed in the marketing materials and unbeknownst to investors, Steffelin was seeking employment with Magnetar during the relevant period., The SEC’s complaint charges Steffelin with violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act and Section 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The Commission seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement of profits, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against Steffelin. Separately, the SEC authorized the institution of administrative proceedings against GSC pursuant to which it consented to the entry of an order requiring GSC to cease and desist from committing or causing violations or future violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act and Sections 204 and 206(2) of the Advisers Act and Rule 204-2 thereunder.

Ilovici, of Avon, Connecticut, in connection with a scheme to defraud investors. The Commission’s Complaint alleges that, since at least 2008, Ilovici made material misrepresentations in raising over $1 million in investment funds from at least two elderly Connecticut women who lived alone, had little or no family, and had health problems. Instead of investing these funds on their behalf as he promised, Ilovici transferred the investor funds to his personal bank and brokerage accounts where he either lost the funds in risky securities or foreign currency exchange trading or spent the funds on personal expenses, including mortgage and credit card payments, travel, and home improvements, all without the knowledge or authorization of his investors., The Commission’s complaint alleges that Ilovici’s conduct violates Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also names Ilovici’s wife, Diana Ilovici, as a Relief Defendant. The Honorable Warren W. Eginton issued a temporary restraining order, prohibiting Ilovici from directly or indirectly continuing to violate the foregoing statutory provisions, and an order freezing Ilovici’s assets, as well as certain assets of his wife that are believed to be derived from the proceeds of Ilovici’s fraudulent scheme. The Court’s order further provides that Ilovici is prohibited from soliciting or accepting additional investor funds and from altering or destroying any relevant documents, and the order also requires Ilovici to provide an accounting of his assets and his use of investor funds. The Court’s order also permits the Commission to conduct expedited discovery and provides other relief.

Jensen and former chief financial officer Thomas C. Tekulve, Jr. improperly recognized revenue to disguise the company’s true financial performance in its 2006 and 2007 quarterly and annual reports. The SEC also alleges that Jensen sold and donated his own Basin Water shares before the company’s true financial condition was revealed, reaping millions of dollars in trading profits and tax benefits. Basin Water built, sold, and leased water treatment systems that cleaned contaminated groundwater., The SEC’s complaint, filed June 24, 2011, alleges that Jensen and Tekulve improperly included revenue from six sales transactions in Basin Water’s financial reports filed with the Commission. The SEC alleges that, depending upon the transaction, the sale was not final; did not have the customer’s required acceptance of the system; allowed the customer to pay nothing until the customer resold the system, even though there was no resale; did not provide enough assurance that the customer would pay for the system; or where the company had not shipped the system. The SEC alleges that as a result Basin Water overstated its 2006 revenues by 13% and its 2007 revenues by 74% and overstated its quarterly 2006 and 2007 revenues by 10% to 161%. The SEC further alleges that, before the company’s true financial condition was revealed, Jensen sold or donated approximately 1.9 million Basin Water shares for over $9.1 million in trading profits and tax deductions., In February 2009, Basin Water restated its financial results. In July 2009, the Rancho Cucamonga, Calif.-based company declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy and is now defunct., The SEC’s complaint charges Jensen and Tekulve with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, 13b2-1, and against Tekulve only, 13b2-2 thereunder.

Highview was added as a defendant on May 10, 2011 to a case the SEC previously filed in January 2011 against Illarramendi and his unregistered investment advisory firm MK Capital Management, LLC. The SEC also named three hedge funds managed by Highview and several entities affiliated with MK Capital Management as relief defendants because, according to the SEC’s charges, they are in possession of funds tainted by the Ponzi scheme. After an evidentiary hearing, the Honorable Janet Bond Arterton, U.S. District Judge for the District of Connecticut, entered an order on June 16, 2011 freezing the assets of three hedge funds advised by Highview, and ordered that all assets of the hedge funds, including $230 million held in offshore accounts, be immediately repatriated to the United States. Judge Arterton also ordered, with the consent of Highview, that Highview be placed under the control of John J. Carney of Baker Hostetler LLP, who was previously appointed as receiver in the case. Judge Arterton had previously frozen the assets of Illarramendi, Highview, MK Capital Management and several affiliated entities. , The SEC’s second amended complaint charges Illarramendi, Highview, and Michael Kenwood Capital Management with violating Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder, and also charges Highview with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

22016,2011,"[<h3>Court Enters Final Judgment Against Georgia Resident William K. Boston, Jr., Texas Resident Warren T. Chambers And Their Business, Century Estate Planning, Inc.</h3>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that on June 22, 2011, Judge Elaine Bucklo of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois entered a final judgment against William K. Boston, Jr., of Canton, Georgia, Warren T. Chambers, of Leander, Texas, and Century Estate Planning, Inc. (Century Estate), their business.  The final judgment: (1) enjoined Boston, Chambers and Century Estate from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 10b-10 promulgated thereunder, and enjoined Boston and Chambers from aiding and abetting violations of Rule 10b-10 of the Exchange Act; (2) ordered Boston, Chambers and Century Estate to pay disgorgement in the amount of $1,347,601.44 plus prejudgment interest of $617,269.01, for a total of $1,964,870.45; and (3) ordered Boston and Chambers to each pay a civil penalty of $120,000,and Century Estate to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $600,000.    , The SEC’s complaint in this matter charges that Michael E. Kelly and 25 other defendants, including Boston, Chambers and Century Estate, participated in a massive fraud on U.S. investors that involved the offer and sale of securities in the form of Universal Leases.  Universal Lease investments were structured as timeshares in several hotels in Cancun, Mexico, coupled with a pre-arranged rental agreement that promised investors a high, fixed rate of return.  The SEC’s complaint alleges that from 1999 until 2005, Kelly and others, including Boston, Chambers and Century Estate, raised at least $428 million through the Universal Lease scheme from investors throughout the United States, with more than $136 million of the funds invested coming from IRA accounts.  The SEC further alleges that a nationwide network of unregistered salespeople who sold the Universal Leases, including Boston, Chambers and Century Estate, collected undisclosed commissions totaling more than $72 million.  The SEC also alleges that Kelly and others ran the scheme from Cancun, Mexico, through a number of foreign entities in Mexico and Panama.  According to the SECs complaint, Kelly and others told investors that Universal Leases would generate guaranteed income through the leasing of investor timeshares by a large, independent leasing agent.  In fact, the complaint alleges, the leasing agent was a small Panamanian travel agency controlled by Kelly, and for most of the scheme, its payments to investors came from accounts funded by money raised from new investors.  Further, the complaint alleges that Kelly and the other defendants, including Boston, Chambers and Century Estate, failed to disclose key facts about the Universal Lease investment, including the risks of the investment and that Kelly was paying commissions as high as 27% to the selling brokers.  The SEC’s action against the remaining defendants is pending.  , For further information, see Litigation Release Nos. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20267.htm>20267</a> (Sept. 5, 2007), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20573.htm>20573</a> (May 14, 2008) , <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20578.htm>20578</a> (May 15, 2008), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20579.htm>20579</a> (May 15, 2008), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20664.htm>20664</a> (July 31, 2008), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20679.htm>20679</a> (August 12, 2008), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20708.htm>20708</a> (Sept. 9, 2008); <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20709.htm>20709</a> (Sept. 9, 2008), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20799.htm>20799</a> (November 6, 2008), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21003.htm>21003</a> (April 15, 2009), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2010/lr21481.htm>21481</a> (April 8, 2010); <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2010/lr21583.htm>21583</a> (June 29, 2010); <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2010/lr21620.htm>21620</a> (August 6, 2010), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2010/lr21793.htm>21793</a> (December 23, 2010), and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr21944.htm>21994</a> (June 8, 2011); [<i>SEC v.

In addition, the Court barred Meyer from participating in any penny stock offering and from serving as an officer or director of any reporting company. Meyer consented to the entry of the Final Judgment without admitting or denying any of the allegations of the Commission’s Complaint. , In its Complaint, the SEC charged that Meyer violated the registration provisions of the federal securities laws when he sold shares of RECOV Energy Corporation between April and November 2005. According to the Complaint, RECOV issued these shares to Meyer after he and defendant Victoria Chen entered into a contract to buy a controlling interest in RECOV from RECOV’s principal, defendant Richard Verdiramo, and his father, defendant Vincent L. Verdiramo. The Complaint alleges that shortly after receiving the RECOV shares, Meyer began selling them on the open market. The SEC charged that Meyer violated Section 5(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 because his sales of RECOV shares were not registered with the SEC or subject to any exemptions from the registration provisions. The Final Judgment orders Meyer to disgorge his ill-gotten gains from these violations, which totaled approximately $48,000, and to pay a $48,000 penalty for these claims., The SEC also charged Meyer with insider trading based on his sales of RECOV stock in August 2005. According to the Complaint, in October 2004, Meyer began working as a consultant for a private company that subsequently engaged in merger negotiations with RECOV. Meyer signed a confidentiality agreement in connection with his engagement as the private company’s consultant. The Complaint alleges that in July 2005, the private company’s principal told Meyer that he intended to terminate merger negotiations with RECOV. The Complaint alleges that Meyer sold RECOV shares after he learned of the principal’s intention to terminate merger negotiations and before the August 2005 public announcement that the parties had terminated merger negotiations. As a consequence of these trades, the Complaint alleges that Meyer avoided losses of $14,000. The SEC charged that the private company’s intention to terminate merger negotiations was material, non-public information, and that Meyer violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5 when he sold RECOV stock while in possession of that information without disclosing his intention to trade. The Final Judgment orders Meyer to disgorge the $14,000 of ill-gotten gains from these violations and to pay a $14,000 penalty for these claims., The Commission’s pending litigation against the other defendants in this matter is ongoing., For additional information, see Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2010/lr21447.htm target=_top>21447</a> (March 10, 2010). <a name=P8_3411></a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr22017.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Lazzara, United States District Judge for the Middle District of Florida, entered final judgments against two penny stock promoters, Robert M. Esposito and Gregory A. King, ordering them to pay $19,515,598 and $943,166, respectively, in disgorgement and civil penalties, in a fraudulent touting case the Commission filed on March 17, 2008.  SEC v. Esposito, et al., No. 08 CV 494 T26 (M.D. Fla.).  See Lit. Rel. No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20499.htm>20499</a>.  The Court had previously entered judgments against Esposito and King permanently enjoining them from violating the anti-fraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws, and barring them from participating in any future penny stock offering.  See Lit. Rel. No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2010/lr21449.htm>21449</a> (March 11, 2010).  , In this action, the Commission charged that Esposito, King, and others participated in a fraudulent touting scheme of the stock of Anscott Industries, Inc.  The complaint alleged that in April 2003, Esposito, a penny stock promoter, orchestrated a reverse merger between Anscott (then a private company) and Liquidix, Inc., a public shell company which, after the merger, changed its name to Anscott.  According to the complaint, Esposito received 4 million shares of Anscott stock from the company as compensation for arranging the reverse merger and for future stock promotion work.  The complaint further alleged that a fraudulent Form S-8 registration statement was filed with the Commission for the 4 million shares of Anscott issued to Esposito, which improperly enabled Esposito to sell these shares to the public during the fraudulent touting scheme., As alleged in the complaint, after the reverse merger and the issuance of shares to Esposito, Esposito paid King, another penny stock promoter with whom Esposito had worked previously, to prepare and disseminate materially false and misleading tout sheets promoting Anscott stock.  The Commission alleged that these tout sheets -- crafted to appear like independent investment newsletters and entitled the Wall Street Bulletin -- recommended Anscott as a strong buy, and were disseminated to the public through fax spamming from late May 2003 through July 2003.  , According to the complaint, these tout sheets, which King prepared, contained materially false and misleading representations about Anscotts products, business affiliations, and projected revenues.  The complaint further alleged that these tout sheets failed to disclose, among other information, that Esposito, who was paid by the company to promote Anscott stock, was paying King to prepare and disseminate these newsletters, and that Esposito was selling his Anscott stock during the touting scheme contrary to the Wall Street Bulletins strong buy recommendation and price targets. , During the touting campaign, the price of Anscotts stock rose from around $1.40 a share in mid-May 2003, to a high of $4.59 a share on July 11, 2003.  The complaint alleged that Esposito sold most of his Anscott stock to the public, realizing millions of dollars in illicit profits.  , The Courts final judgment against Esposito orders him to pay disgorgement of $7,691,135, prejudgment interest of $4,133,326, and third tier civil penalty of $7,691,135.  The judgment against Esposito also (a) permanently enjoins him from future violations of Sections 17(a), 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 13d-1 and 13d-2; and (b) permanently bars him from participating in any future penny stock offerings., The Courts final judgment against King orders him to pay disgorgement of $358,000, prejudgment interest of $227,166, and a third tier civil penalty of $358,000.  The judgment against King also (a) permanently enjoins him from future violations of Sections 17(b) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5; and (b) permanently bars him from participating in any future penny stock offerings.  , The Court previously entered final judgment against other defendants in this case, Anscott and its CEO, Jack R.

The SEC charged Plate, who was a registered representative and a proprietary trader at the broker-dealer Schottenfeld Group, LLC, during the relevant time period, with using inside information to trade ahead of an impending acquisition announcement.   , In its action, the SEC alleged that, in March 2007, Plate was tipped inside information that Kronos Inc. would be acquired in about a week for a substantial premium.  On the basis of the material non-public information he received, Plate traded in a Schottenfeld account he managed.  , To settle the SECs charges, Plate consented to the entry of a judgment that: (i) permanently enjoins him from violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and (ii) orders him to pay disgorgement of $43,876.37, plus prejudgment interest of $9,415.54.  The judgment further provides that the Court later will determine issues relating to a civil penalty.  Plate previously pled guilty to charges of securities fraud and conspiracy to commit securities fraud in a related criminal case, <em>United States v.

Jenkins, its founder and sole owner. The Commissions Complaint against Locke and Jenkins, filed in March 2009, alleged that they invented a billion-dollar client in order to gain credibility and attract legitimate investors.  The Complaint further alleged that Jenkins tried to perpetuate her scheme by lying to the Commission staff about the existence of the invented client and furnishing the staff with bogus documents in 2008, including fake custodial statements that she created on her laptop.  The Court ordered that Locke and Jenkins will be jointly and severally liable for disgorgement of $1,781,520, representing advisory fees paid to them from 2007-2009, plus prejudgment interest of $110,956.  In addition, each defendant was ordered to pay a penalty of $1,781,520., According to the Complaint, filed on March 9, 2009, Jenkins repeatedly claimed that the so-called confidential client accounts that she invented and claimed to manage contained more than $1 billion in assets.  Even as Locke began to take on genuine clients in late 2006, the assets under management of its real clients never amounted to more than a very small portion of the billion-plus dollars that Jenkins claimed to manage.  From at least 2003 to 2009, falsehoods concerning the confidential accounts were made in brochures, meetings, submissions to online databases that prospective clients used to select money managers, and in SEC filings., The Honorable William E. Smith, United States District Judge in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island, issued an Opinion and Order on June 30, 2011, granting the Commissions motion for summary judgment against Jenkins and denying Jenkinss motion for summary judgment.  The Court had previously granted the Commissions motion for default judgment against Locke in March 2010.  The court entered final judgments against Jenkins and Locke on June 30, 2011.  The final judgments permanently enjoin Jenkins and Locke from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 207 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers Act).   The final judgment as to Locke also permanently enjoins it from violating Sections 204 and 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rules 204-2(a)(6), (8), (10), (15), and (16), as wells as 206(4)-1(a)(5) thereunder, and the final judgment as to Jenkins further permanently enjoins her from aiding and abetting violations of the same law sections.  The final judgment as to Locke further permanently enjoins it from violating Section 204A of the Advisers Act and Rule 204A-1 thereunder.

Instead of purchasing securities for investors as represented, the defendants misappropriated the investors’ funds and then provided false assurances to investors to cover up their fraud., According to the SEC’s complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Windham, Constantin, and Solomon misappropriated investor funds from an investment opportunity they had recommended to investors in Leeward Group, Inc., then a private company they told investors Windham was helping to take public. Constantin and Solomon raised more than $1.1 million for investments in Leeward and collected an additional $135,000 in fees purportedly for access to Windham investment opportunities or other related investment services. Constantin then transferred approximately $668,000 of the funds raised from investors to his personal bank account and to the account of Constantin Resource Group, Inc. (CRG), an entity he owned and controlled. Constantin used these funds to pay his personal and business expenses and to pay Solomon, among other things. Constantin also transferred $450,000 of investor funds to purchase Leeward securities in the name of Domestic Applications Corp. (DAC), an entity he controlled and in which none of the investors held any ownership interest. Constantin and Solomon then attempted to conceal their fraud and falsely reassure investors by fabricating phony promissory notes and Windham account statements that falsely showed that the investors had purchased Leeward securities., The SEC’s complaint charges Windham, Constantin, and Solomon with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and charges Constantin with liability as a control person for Windham’s Exchange Act violations and as an aider and abettor of Windham’s and Solomon’s Exchange Act violations.

22031,2011,[<h3>SEC Charges JPMS with Fraudulent Bidding Practices Involving Investment of Municipal Bond Proceeds</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (JPMS) with fraudulently rigging at least 93 municipal bond reinvestment transactions in 31 states, generating millions of dollars in ill-gotten gains., To settle the SEC’s fraud charges, JPMS agreed to pay approximately $51.2 million that will be returned to the affected municipalities or conduit borrowers. JPMS and its affiliates also agreed to pay $177 million to settle parallel charges brought by other federal and state authorities., Typically, when investors purchase municipal securities, the municipalities temporarily invest the proceeds of the sales in municipal reinvestment products until the money is used for the intended purposes. Under relevant Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regulations, the proceeds of tax-exempt municipal securities generally must be invested at fair market value. The most common way of establishing fair market value is through a competitive bidding process in which bidding agents search for the appropriate investment vehicle for a municipality., The SEC alleges that from 1997 through 2005, JPMS’s fraudulent practices, misrepresentations and omissions undermined the competitive bidding process, affected the prices that municipalities paid for reinvestment products, and deprived certain municipalities of a conclusive presumption that the reinvestment instruments had been purchased at fair market value. JPMS’s fraudulent conduct also jeopardized the tax-exempt status of billions of dollars in municipal securities because the supposed competitive bidding process that establishes the fair market value of the investment was corrupted. The employees involved in the alleged misconduct are no longer with the company., According to the SEC’s complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, JPMS, acting as the agent for its affiliated commercial bank, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., at times won bids because it obtained information from the bidding agents about competing bids, a practice known as “last looks.” In other instances, it won bids set up in advance for JPMS to win (set-ups) because the bidding agent deliberately obtained non-winning bids from other providers, and it facilitated bids rigged for others to win by deliberately submitting non-winning bids., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC’s complaint, JPMS has consented to the entry of a final judgment enjoining it from future violations of Section 15(c)(1)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and has agreed to pay a penalty of $32.5 million and disgorgement of $11,065,969 with prejudgment interest of $7,620,380. The settlement is subject to court approval., In a related enforcement action, the SEC barred former JPMS vice president and marketer James L. Hertz from association with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, transfer agent, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization, and from participating in any penny stock offering. This sanction is based on Hertz’s December 6, 2010 guilty plea to two counts of conspiracy and one count of wire fraud for engaging in misconduct in connection with the competitive bidding process involving the investment of proceeds of tax-exempt municipal bonds. The Commission recognizes Hertz’s cooperation in the SEC’s investigation and investigations conducted by other law enforcement agencies, This is the SEC’s third settlement with a financial institution stemming from its ongoing investigation into corruption in the municipal reinvestment industry. On December 7, 2010, the SEC charged Banc of America Securities LLC (BAS) with securities fraud for similar conduct. BAS agreed to pay more than $36 million in disgorgement and interest to settle the SEC’s charges, and paid an additional $101 million to other federal and state authorities for its misconduct. On May 4, 2011, the SEC charged UBS Financial Services Inc. (UBS) with securities fraud for fraudulently rigging bids as both a provider and a bidding agent. UBS agreed to pay $47.2 million in disgorgement, interest and civil penalties to settle the SEC’s charges and to pay $113 million to other federal and state authorities in connection with their parallel cases., Deputy Chief Mark R. Zehner and Assistant Municipal Securities Counsel Denise D. Colliers, who are members of the Municipal Securities and Public Pensions Unit in the Philadelphia Regional Office, conducted the SEC’s investigation into this matter., The SEC thanks the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation for their cooperation and assistance in this matter.

Vassallo, age 61, is a resident of La Jolla, California. , The indictment charges Vassallo with making false representations to an investor in connection with an investment in a wireless communication venture including failing to disclose that he had been sued by the Commission and that a permanent injunction and monetary judgment had been entered against him in the Commission’s action. <i>United States of America v.

The Court entered a Final Judgment of Permanent Injunction and Other Relief against Vassallo on August 24, 2005 that permanently enjoined him from violating the securities registration and antifraud provisions and ordered him to pay a total of $2,009,082 in disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and the costs and expenses of the permanent receiver for Presto. , The Commission filed an application for an order to show cause re civil contempt against Vassallo on September 21, 2010 which alleged that Vassallo violated the Final Judgment by offering and selling unregistered securities of wireless ventures and telecommunications companies, by committing fraud in connection with the offer and sale of those securities, and by failing to pay any of the monetary relief he was ordered to pay. The Court issued an order to show cause on September 24, 2010 why Vassallo should not be held in civil contempt of the Final Judgment.

Irwin (“Irwin”), a certified public accountant, and his consulting firm, Jacklin Associates, Inc. (“Jacklin”). The Commission alleges that, from at least February 1995 through December 2008, Irwin and Jacklin participated in a multi-million dollar Ponzi scheme orchestrated and run by Joseph S. Forte (“Forte”) through his limited partnership Joseph S. Forte, LP (“Forte LP”). In December 2008, Forte confessed to federal authorities that, for over a decade, he had been operating a Ponzi scheme in which he fraudulently obtained approximately $50 million from roughly 80 investors through the sale of securities in the form of limited partnership interests in Forte LP. Subsequent investigation of Forte’s confession has revealed over 100 investors who collectively invested over $75 million. Forte and Forte LP solicited investors by making misrepresentations regarding, among other things, use of invested funds, investment returns, and investor account balances. On January 7, 2009, the Commission and the United States Commodities Futures Trading Commission filed civil actions against Forte and Forte LP and successfully sought emergency relief that, among other things, froze their assets and enjoined further illegal conduct. <u>SEC v. Forte, et al.</u>, 09-CV-0063 (E.D. Pa.); <u>CFTC v. Forte</u>, 09-CV-0064 (E.D. Pa.). In parallel criminal proceedings, Forte pled guilty to charges of wire fraud, mail fraud, bank fraud and money laundering and was sentenced to 15 years in prison. <u>U.S. v. Forte</u>, 09-CR-304 (E.D. Pa.)., The Commission’s complaint against Irwin and Jacklin alleges that they participated in Forte’s scheme by soliciting investors for Forte LP. In doing so, Irwin relied exclusively on Forte’s misrepresentations about Forte LP’s stellar performance and, without performing any due diligence, passed along to investors through Jacklin materially false and misleading information about, among other things, Forte LP’s current value and growth, historical performance, rapid-trading strategy, and retention of an accountant. Irwin, through Jacklin, also performed back office and bookkeeping functions for Forte LP, including creating and issuing to investors false quarterly statements and tax documents prepared based on the false information provided by Forte. In communicating the fraudulent information to investors, Irwin disregarded red flags that should have alerted him that the information that he was passing on was false. Over the course of the fraud, Irwin, through Jacklin, received ill-gotten gains exceeding $5 million in purported fees and trading profits. , Irwin and Jacklin agreed to settle the Commission’s charges, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission’s complaint. Under the settlement, which is subject to the court’s approval, Irwin and Jacklin consented to a judgment permanently enjoining them from violating Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933. The judgment also orders the defendants to pay disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, and permits the Commission to ask the court to impose civil penalties, the amounts of which will be determined at a later date.

In its June 23, 2011 Order granting relief, the Court found, among other things, “the evidence presented at trial and on summary judgment demonstrates that Furman knowingly participated in and facilitated the alteration of the License Agreement, [engaged in] repeated violations of GAAP and the company’s revenue recognition policy, [participated in] the firing of [a whistle-blowing company employee] and [made] repeated misrepresentations to the auditors” which merited imposition of requested relief. The Court further concluded that “Furman played an essential and knowing role in the securities law violations at issue.”, The Court permanently enjoined Furman from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, the record-keeping and internal control provisions of Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder, the false statements to auditors provisions of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-2, and the officer certification provisions of Rule 13a-14 of the Exchange Act, and aiding and abetting violations of the issuer reporting provisions of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder.

From 2006 through 2009, the complaint alleges that Folin and Benchmark caused Safe Haven to pay over $1.7 million to Benchmark and Harvest under the guise of “development costs.” The complaint alleges that these “development costs” did not relate to any actual expenses incurred by Harvest or Benchmark in connection with the formation or offering of Safe Haven securities. Rather, the complaint alleges, the payments coincided with Harvest’s and Benchmark’s need for funds to pay previous investors, expenses and Folin’s salary. Moreover, the complaint alleges that Folin and Benchmark improperly amortized the development costs rather than expensing them as incurred in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) thereby causing the reported net asset values of the Safe Haven portfolio to be overstated on statements provided to advisory clients and investors., The complaint also alleges that Folin and Benchmark caused Safe Haven to make loans to Harvest and Benchmark in excess of $3.9 million. The complaint further alleges that Folin and Benchmark did not disclose these loans. Moreover, the complaint alleges that these loans violated several provisions of Safe Haven’s investment criteria including, among other things, that: (1) they were not supported by adequate collateral, (2) they violated the 5% net exposure requirement, and (3) they caused the portfolios to violate the “no leverage” provision. In addition, the complaint alleges that the financial statements provided by Folin and Benchmark to investors did not comply with GAAP. More specifically, the complaint alleges that the financial statements improperly valued the Safe Haven loans to Harvest and Benchmark at face value, rather than fair value or net realizable value. Finally, the complaint alleges that Folin and Benchmark failed to disclose to their advisory clients Benchmark’s dire financial situation and inability to sustain itself but for the monies it received under the guise of “development costs” and the loans from Safe Haven., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC’s complaint, Folin and Benchmark have consented to the entry of a final judgment enjoining them from future violations of Sections 17 of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, and Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder. Harvest has consented to the entry of a final judgment enjoining it from future violations of Sections 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Folin, Benchmark and Harvest have also consented to pay, jointly and severally, disgorgement of $8,706,620 plus prejudgment interest of $1,454,177. In addition, Folin has consented to pay a civil penalty of $150,000 and Harvest and Benchmark have consented to pay civil penalties of $750,000 each. The settlements are subject to court approval., Without admitting or denying the Commissions findings, Folin also consented to the issuance of an Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Section 203(f) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions which bars him from association with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, transfer agent, municipal advisor, or nationally recognized statistical ratings organization based upon the entry of the final judgment. Similarly, without admitting or denying the Commission’s findings, Benchmark consented to the issuance of an Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Section 203(e) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions which revokes its investment adviser registration based upon the entry of the final judgment.<a name=P10_6187></a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr22036.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"
22037,2011,"[<h3>SEC FILES SETTLED ANTI-BRIBERY, BOOKS AND RECORDS, AND INTERNAL CONTROLS CHARGES AGAINST ARMOR HOLDINGS, INC. </h3>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) today filed a settled civil enforcement action against Armor Holdings, Inc. (“Armor Holdings”), alleging violations of the anti-bribery, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”). Armor Holdings, a manufacturer of military and law enforcement safety equipment based in Jacksonville, Florida, agreed to pay a total of $5,690,744 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in order to resolve the Commission’s charges. In a related matter, Armor Holdings will pay a $10,290,000 fine to the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”)., According to the Commission’s complaint:, From 2001 to 2006, certain agents of Armor Holdings participated in a bribery scheme to help a U.K. subsidiary of Armor Holdings, Armor Products International, Ltd. (“API”), obtain contracts for the supply of body armor to be used in United Nations (“U.N.”) peacekeeping missions. These agents of Armor Holdings caused API to enter into a sham consulting agreement with a third-party intermediary for purportedly legitimate services in connection with the sale of goods to the U.N., In September 2001, the third-party intermediary instructed API to provide a signed, but otherwise blank, pricing sheet that the intermediary would complete after learning from a U.N. procurement official about non-public bids submitted by competitors for the contract. In October 2001, the U.N. awarded API a multi-year contract for the supply of body armor. In February 2003, an agent of Armor Holdings asked the third-party intermediary how API could win a renewal contract to sell body armor to the U.N. The intermediary responded that the same rules would apply to the 2003 tender as applied to the 2001 tender. In August 2003, API received another three-year contract from the U.N. In 2006, API received an additional one-year supply extension from the U.N. on the 2003 contract, without assistance from the third-party intermediary., By late 2006, API had made at least ninety-two payments to the intermediary, totaling approximately $222,750. Agents of Armor Holdings caused API to wire payments to the intermediary with the understanding that part of these payments would be offered to a U.N. official who could help steer business to API. From the 2001 and 2003 U.N. contracts, together with the extension granted in 2006, Armor Holdings derived gross revenues of approximately $7,121,237, and net profits of approximately $1,552,306., From 2001 through June 2007, a U.S. subsidiary of Armor Holdings, Armor Holdings Products, LLC (“AHP”), employed a separate accounting practice that disguised in the books and records of Armor Holdings approximately $4,371,278 in commissions paid to intermediaries who brokered the sale of goods to foreign governments. Despite internal and external admonitions that this practice violated U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, AHP failed to record commissions in at least 92 transactions through June 2007—resulting in approximately $4,371,278 of undisclosed commissions on the books and records of Armor Holdings., On July 31, 2007, after the conduct in the Commission’s complaint had occurred, Armor Holdings was acquired by BAE Systems, Inc.—an indirect wholly-owned U.S. subsidiary of Britain’s BAE Systems PLC. Accordingly, Armor Holdings is no longer an issuer of securities., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission’s complaint, Armor Holdings has consented to a court order permanently enjoining it from violating Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act; ordering it to pay disgorgement of $1,552,306, together with prejudgment interest of $458,438; imposing on it a civil penalty of $3,680,000; and ordering it to comply with certain undertakings regarding its FCPA compliance program. The proposed settlement is subject to court approval., Armor Holdings conducted a thorough internal investigation to determine the scope of the improper payments and cooperated with the Commission’s inquiry., The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Fraud Section of DOJ’s Criminal Division and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Chen, United States District Court Judge for the Northern District of California, entered judgments of permanent injunction against Defendants Robert C. Brown, Jr. and Trebor Company., The final judgment against Brown and Trebor Company enjoins them from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers of 1940 (“Advisers Act”)., On July 23, 2008, the Commission filed its complaint against the Defendants alleging that they violated the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws by, among other things, offering a variety of investment programs that falsely promised astronomical returns. One program promised, for example, to double investor money in eight months. The complaint also alleged that Brown raised more than $20 million. Instead of investing that money, however, Brown transferred millions of dollars to himself and spent the money on lavish personal expenses., On April 6, 2010, Brown pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud in a parallel criminal action brought by the United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of California. Later this year, Brown will be sentenced to prison and ordered to pay restitution to the victims of his fraud., In addition to the relief described above, Brown consented to the entry of an order, without admitting or denying any of the findings in the Order, except he admitted entry of the injunction and conviction, in a separate Commission administrative proceeding barring him permanently, pursuant to Section 203(f) of the Advisers Act, from associating with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, transfer agent, or nationally recognized statistical ratings organization., For more information on earlier actions in this case, see <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20653.htm target=_top>LR-20653</a> (July 23, 2008),  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr22038.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

(“TPG”) private equity associate Vinayak S. Gowrish to pay in excess of $112,000, consisting of $12,000 in disgorgement (with interest to be calculated thereon) and a $100,000 civil penalty, for his role in a serial insider trading ring. Judge Illston also issued a permanent injunction against Gowrish enjoining him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws (Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder). A federal jury on February 3, 2011 found Gowrish liable for illegally tipping material, nonpublic information that TPG was in negotiations to acquire three separate publicly traded companies: Sabre Holdings Corp. (“Sabre”), TXU Corp. (“TXU”), and Alliance Data Systems Corp. (“ADS”). , The Commission’s complaint alleged – and the jury found – that Gowrish, a former associate at multi-billion dollar private equity firm TPG, misappropriated material nonpublic information from his employer in connection with TPG’s negotiations to acquire Sabre, TXU, and ADS. Gowrish tipped the confidential acquisition information to his long-time friend, Adnan Zaman, a former investment banker at Lazard Frères &amp; Co. LLC. Zaman, in turn, tipped the information to their two friends, Pascal S. Vaghar and Sameer N. Khoury. On the basis of the information provided by Gowrish through Zaman, Vaghar and Khoury then traded Sabre, TXU, and ADS securities, realizing approximately $375,000 in illicit profits. The Commission’s complaint alleged that, in exchange for the confidential information, Vaghar provided cash kickbacks to both Gowrish and Zaman. The jury found that Gowrish violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. , Zaman, Vaghar, and Khoury previously consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Zaman and Vaghar were also enjoined from violations of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14e-3 thereunder.

Chief Executive Jeffery A. Lowrance, who had fled to Peru and was arrested there earlier this year, was arraigned today on criminal fraud charges in a 2010 indictment filed by the United States Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Illinois. In addition, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission filed fraud charges Thursday against Lowrance and First Capital., The SEC alleges that Lowrance raised approximately $21 million from investors in at least 26 states, including California, Oregon, Illinois and Utah by promising huge profits from a specialized foreign currency trading program.  In reality, First Capital conducted little foreign currency trading, lost money on the little trading that it conducted, and never engaged in any profitable business operations.  Lowrance targeted investors by purporting to share their Christian values and limited-government political views.  He solicited investors through, among other things, ads in his start-up newspaper <i>USA Tomorrow</i>, which he distributed at a September 2, 2008 political rally in Minneapolis, Minnesota.  , According to the SEC’s complaint, filed in federal district court in San Jose, California, Lowrance and First Capital promised investors a “predictable monthly income,” with monthly returns up to 7.15 percent through foreign currency trading.  Some investors were told their investment was guaranteed, and were given bogus letters of credit.  First Capital also published a spreadsheet purporting to show its multi-year history of profitable trades.  In fact, the trades were fictitious.  Instead of engaging in foreign currency trading as claimed, Lowrance and First Capital secretly diverted investor funds to pay fake returns to other, earlier investors, to pay Lowrance (despite his failure to earn a profit for the investors), and to fund his newspaper., Lowrance’s scheme began to unravel in June 2008 and Lowrance and First Capital had lost all of the investors’ money by September 2008.  Nevertheless, Lowrance solicited at least an additional $1 million from at least 36 investors between June 2008 and February 2009 by continuing to tout First Capital’s fictitious high returns, the SEC alleges., The Commission’s complaint alleges Lowrance and First Capital violated Sections Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and seeks disgorgement, penalties, and other relief.<a name=P12_3024></a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr22040.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Wildstein, a former Pitney Bowes, Inc. executive, with insider trading in the stock of MapInfo Corporation in advance of the March 15, 2007 public announcement that Pitney Bowes had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire MapInfo., According to the SECs complaint, Wildstein acquired material nonpublic information concerning the acquisition through his employment at Pitney Bowes.  In particular, as alleged in the complaint, in late February 2007, Wildstein learned that MapInfo was a potential target of Pitney Bowes and that executives of Pitney Bowes who were responsible for mergers and acquisitions had recently visited MapInfo.  On March 1 and March 2, 2007, based on this material nonpublic information, Wildstein purchased 8,000 shares of MapInfo common stock.  After the acquisition was publicly announced, Wildstein sold all 8,000 shares, realizing an unlawful profit of $51,177.   , Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Wildstein has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder, and requires him to pay a total of $114,848 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.

The Commission’s complaint alleges that, at the time the defendants purchased the shares, they are believed to have been in possession of material, non-public information about Lonza’s proposed acquisition of Arch Chemicals. , In filing its complaint in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, the Commission requested emergency relief, noting that because the defendants are foreign entities and placed their trades in overseas accounts, there was a substantial risk that, upon clearance at U.S. brokerage firms, the proceeds of the trades likely would be transferred overseas. , The Honorable P. Kevin Castel, acting as emergency judge, granted the Commission’s requested relief late in the day on July 15. Among other things, the court’s order froze certain assets of the defendants and ordered repatriation of all assets obtained from the trading described in the Commission’s complaint.

The SEC further alleged that Goffer tipped information about these acquisitions to Craig Drimal, a trader who worked out of the offices of Galleon, who tipped the information to Cardillo.  As alleged in the complaint, Cardillo then traded in the securities of 3Com and Axcan on behalf of a Galleon hedge fund., To settle the SEC’s charges, Cardillo consented to the entry of a judgment that: (i) permanently enjoins him from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and (ii) orders him to pay disgorgement of $58,520 plus $9,523 in prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $29,260.

The Metzes were the only remaining defendants in a pending offering fraud and market manipulation case.  , The Commission’s complaint, filed on April 17, 2007, alleged that the Metzes and others, including MaryAnn’s parents Gerald and Marie Levine, engaged in a fraudulent scheme to sell approximately $4.5 million worth of shares of Pink Sheet companies, primarily to investors in the United Kingdom, out of boiler rooms in Barcelona, Spain and Santa Ana, California, in violation of the federal securities laws.  The complaint also alleged that the Metzes participated in a related market manipulation scheme involving stock of the same Pink Sheet companies, including Nu Star.  , The Commission alleged that MaryAnn Metz, who was one of two officers and directors of Nu Star, participated in the offering fraud by:  (1) failing to disclose that the Levines, who were Nu Star’s majority shareholders, had previously been found liable for committing securities fraud; (2) failing to disclose that the president of Nu Star had been suspended from the practice of law for three years; and (3) failing to disclose to investors the excessive commissions that were paid to the boiler room sales force from the proceeds of the sale of Nu Star stock.

Koenig, the former Chief Financial Officer of Waste Management Corporation, ordering that he pay $2.5 million in <u>SEC v. James E. Koenig</u>, 02 C 2180 (N.D. Ill. filed Mar. 26, 2002). Koenig was ordered to make an upfront payment of $1.25 million and to pay the remaining $1.25 million in regular installments over the next two years. The Commission’s complaint alleged that beginning in 1992 and continuing into 1997, Koenig and others engaged in a systematic scheme to falsify and misrepresent Waste Management’s financial results with profits being overstated by $1.7 billion. In June 2006, after an 11-week trial, a jury returned a verdict in the Commission’s favor against Koenig on all 60 violations charged, including securities fraud, falsifying company books and records, making false statements in filings with the Commission, lying to auditors, and aiding and abetting the company’s violations. On December 21, 2007, following a two-day bench trial on remedies, the district court entered a Final Judgment against Koenig that permanently barred him from acting as an officer or director of a public company, and enjoined him from violating, or aiding and abetting violations of, Sections 10(b), 13(a), and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder; and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.

The Commission filed its action on July 15, 2011, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, and the court issued a temporary asset freeze that day against defendants Compania International Financiera S.A. (Compania”), Coudree Capital Gestion S.A. (“Coudree”), and Chartwell Asset Management Services (“Chartwell”).  The District Court has now entered orders continuing those asset freezes in specific amounts based on the size of the defendants’ profits plus potential penalty amounts.  The Court entered an asset freeze order by consent as to defendants Compania and Coudree on July 26, 2011, freezing approximately $14.7 million of their assets.  After a hearing as to defendant Chartwell on July 28, 2011, the court entered an order on July 29, 2011, freezing over $18 million of its assets., The Commission’s complaint was filed within days of the alleged insider trading.  According to the Commission’s filings, Compania and Coudree purchased more than 687,000 common shares of Arch Chemicals between July 5 and July 8, mostly in accounts based in London, England.  During the same time period, Chartwell purchased contracts for difference (“CFDs”) equivalent to 425,300 Arch Chemicals common shares through a brokerage account in London.  The Court noted in its opinion and order that CFDs constitute securities as defined by the federal securities laws.  Immediately after the acquisition announcement on July 11, the firms began selling the recently-purchased Arch Chemicals common stock and CFDs for millions of dollars in profits.  The Commission’s complaint alleges that, at the time the defendants purchased the securities, they are believed to have been in possession of material, non-public information about Lonza’s proposed acquisition of Arch Chemicals. , After a hearing on July 28, 2011, before the Honorable Denise L. Cote in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, the District Court on July 29, 2011, ordered an asset freeze against Chartwell in the amount of the trading profits ($4,651,995) plus a potential civil penalty of three times that amount ($13,955,985), totaling $18,607,980.  The Court further ordered Chartwell to repatriate all assets obtained from the activities described in the Complaint to the United States, and to refrain from destroying any potentially discoverable materials related to the Complaint. In the Court’s Opinion and Order issued on July 29, Judge Cote found that “the discovery collected by the [Commission] … reveals a pattern of trading [by Chartwell] in the context of a tip that is not just consistent with, but also suggestive of, insider trading,” and concluded that the relief sought by the Commission was thus warranted because “there is a likelihood that the [Commission] will succeed on the merits in establishing a 10(b) violation” by Chartwell., Previously, on July 26, 2011, the District Court issued an asset freeze order by consent as to defendants Compania and Coudree.  Those defendants have deposited $14,784,006 into a court-controlled bank account pending the outcome of the Commission’s action, including more than $7 million in trading profits, after agreeing to the entry of the asset freeze., The Commission’s complaint charges the defendants with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.  In addition to a preliminary injunction, asset freeze and other equitable relief, the complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of illegal trading profits plus prejudgment interest, and civil monetary penalties.

Marovitz, the spouse of former Playboy CEO Christie Hefner, with illegal insider trading in Playboy stock in advance of public news announcements., The SEC alleges that on five occasions between 2004 and 2009, Marovitz traded based on confidential information that he misappropriated from Hefner, who was the CEO of Playboy during most of the trades at issue. Marovitz bought and sold Playboy stock in his own brokerage accounts ahead of public news announcements despite instructions from his wife that he should not trade in shares of Playboy and a warning from the general counsel of Playboy about his buying or selling Playboy stock. In total, Marovitz gained profits and avoided losses of $100,952., According to the SECâs complaint, between 2004 and 2009 Marovitz misappropriated confidential, non-public information about Playboy from Hefner. Hefner made clear to Marovitz in 1998, both personally and through Playboyâs general counsel, that she expected him to keep any information he learned from her about Playboy confidential and not to trade based on this information. In November 2009, Marovitz learned about Iconixâs potential acquisition of Playboy and used that confidential information to buy Playboy stock in advance of a public announcement of a potential merger, which caused a 42% increase in Playboyâs stock price. When Iconix ended its efforts to acquire Playboy in December 2009, Marovitz sold Playboy stock before the news became public, resulting in a 10% decrease in Playboyâs stock price., The SEC also alleges that Marovitz also misused confidential information he misappropriated from Hefner about Playboyâs earnings announcements and stock offering to trade in Playboy. In May 2008, Marovitz sold Playboy stock the day before Playboyâs first quarter 2008 negative earnings announcement caused its stock price to decline by 9%. Similarly, in August 2004, Marovitz sold all of his Playboy stock the day before Playboy reported a second quarter loss resulting in an 18% drop in its stock price. And, in April 2004, Marovitz purchased Playboy stock before Playboy announced an offering of its Class B stock, which caused its stock price to increase by 8%., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, except as to jurisdiction, Marovitz has consented to entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Additionally, the final judgment bars Redekopp from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years pursuant to Section 21(d)(2) of the Exchange Act., On August 9, 2010, the Commission filed its complaint against Redekopp, who lives in Vancouver, B.C.  The complaint alleges that Redekopp, the former CFO of International Commercial Television Inc. (“ICTV”), turned millions of dollars of quarterly losses into profits by falsely accounting for ICTV’s sales of the Derma Wand, a skin care appliance that purports to reduce wrinkles and improve skin appearance.  Redekopp improperly recognized revenue before the Home Shopping Network had actually sold or delivered the product to viewers.  The complaint also alleges that Redekopp recorded “sales” of products that had not been shipped or that the customer was not obligated to pay for.  Redekopp’s fraudulent accounting resulted in ICTV adjusting net sales by more than $3.7 million over a five-quarter period in 2007 and 2008, negating all originally reported net income for those periods to restated net losses. , In addition to the relief described above, Redekopp consented to the entry of an order, without admitting or denying any of the findings in the Order, in a separate Commission administrative proceedings suspending him, pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the Commissions Rules of Practice, from appearing or practicing as an accountant before the Commission with the right to apply for reinstatement after three years., For more information on earlier actions in this case, see <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2010/lr21622.htm>LR-21622</a> (August 9, 2010) ,  ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr22060.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Because mutual banks are owned by their depositors, the depositors are given first priority in receiving the shares arising out of the conversions initial public offering.  The Commissions complaint alleges that Richetelli entered into illegal arrangements with six NHSB depositors (which were hidden from NHSB) pursuant to which he funded their purchase of shares of NewAlliance stock in exchange for 90% of the profits earned on the sales of such shares.  The complaint further alleges that Richetelli also illegally funded the purchase of additional shares of the stock using his mother’s NHSB account, retaining 100% of the profits derived from the sales of those shares.  The complaint further alleges that, through his scheme and at the expense of other NHSB bank depositors, Richetelli illegally obtained hundreds of thousands in proceeds from the sale of NewAlliance stock that had been purchased in the IPO.  , Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, Richetelli consented to the entry of the judgment enjoining him from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and ordering him to pay disgorgement of $854,945, representing ill-gotten gains he received as a result of the conduct alleged in the complaint, together with prejudgment interest thereon in the amount of $45,055, and a civil penalty of $100,000.

The SEC alleges that DeCinces and his associates made more than $1.7 million in illegal profits when Abbott Park, Ill.-based Abbott Laboratories Inc. announced its plan to purchase Advanced Medical Optics Inc. through a tender offer., The SEC alleges that DeCinces, who lives in Laguna Beach, Calif., received confidential information about the acquisition from a source at Santa Ana, Calif.-based Advanced Medical Optics.  DeCinces immediately began to purchase shares of Advanced Medical Optics in several brokerage accounts, buying more throughout the course of the impending transaction as he received updated information from his source.  During this time, DeCinces also illegally tipped three associates who traded on the confidential information – physical therapist Joseph J. Donohue, real estate lawyer Fred Scott Jackson, and businessman Roger A. Wittenbach., DeCinces agreed to pay $2.5 million to settle the SEC’s charges, and the three others also agreed to settlements., According to the SEC’s complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, DeCinces received the material, nonpublic information from an employee at Advanced Medical Optics.  DeCinces knew that his source was under a duty to keep the information confidential.  In the weeks preceding the public announcement, DeCinces bought Advanced Medical Optics stock on several occasions, eventually totaling at least 83,700 shares in several brokerage accounts he controlled.  Some of these accounts were in his grandchildren’s names.  On at least one occasion, DeCinces funded his purchase of shares by liquidating a diverse portfolio of 110 stocks.  When a public announcement was made by the companies on Jan. 12, 2009, the stock price for Advanced Medical Optics increased 143 percent, and DeCinces sold all of his shares for $1.2 million in profits., According to the SEC’s complaint, Donohue was DeCinces’s physical therapist at the time of the illegal trading.  He bought 5,000 shares of Advanced Medical Optics stock in December 2008 and January 2009 on the basis of confidential information received from DeCinces about the impending transaction.  Donohue made $75,570 when he sold the stock on the same day as the public announcement.  DeCinces later asked Donohue whether he had sold his stock and congratulated him., According to the SEC’s complaint, DeCinces and Jackson shared business and social interests.  During a Jan. 8, 2009, breakfast meeting, Jackson used his mobile handheld device to buy 8,500 shares of Advanced Medical Optics stock on the basis of the confidential information that DeCinces communicated to him.  Jackson bought additional shares later that day and again the next day, and following the public announcement sold all of his shares for a profit of $140,259., DeCinces and Wittenbach have been longtime friends, according to the SEC’s complaint.  After DeCinces tipped Wittenbach with confidential information about the impending transaction, Wittenbach bought 15,000 shares of Advanced Medical Optics stock on January 8.  He also called his sister and recommended that she buy 1,000 shares of the stock, which she did later that day.  On the same day of the public announcement, Wittenbach sold all of his shares for a profit of $201,692.  He again called his sister and told her to sell her stock, which she did for a profit of $13,214.  , Without admitting or denying the SEC’s allegations, DeCinces, Donohue, Jackson, and Wittenbach agreed to settle the charges against them by consenting to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder.  DeCinces agreed to pay disgorgement of $1,282,691, prejudgment interest of $19,311, and a penalty of $1,197,998 for a total of $2.5 million.  Donohue agreed to pay disgorgement of $75,570 and a penalty of $37,785 for a total of $113,355.

Clayton Peterson, who served on Mariner Energy, Inc.’s board of directors from 2006 through 2010, provided his son, Drew Clayton Peterson, with confidential information, learned during various board meetings, about Apache Corporation’s upcoming acquisition of Mariner Energy.  According to the allegations, in the week leading up to the April 15, 2010 announcement, Clayton Peterson tipped his son on multiple telephone calls and at in-person meetings about the impending takeover.  Drew Peterson, a managing director at a Denver-based investment adviser, then traded on the illegally obtained inside information and purchased Mariner Energy stock for himself, his relatives, his clients, and for a close friend.  Drew Peterson also tipped other close friends as to the impending acquisition of Mariner Energy who also traded on the illegally obtained information.  The insider trading by the Petersons and others generated more than $5.2 million in illicit profits.  , According to the SEC’s complaint, Clayton Peterson explicitly instructed his son, Drew Peterson, to purchase Mariner Energy stock for a family member based on positive news that the company was about to announce.  As the announcement date neared, Clayton Peterson was even clearer in his discussions with his son, telling him that the company was going to be acquired and would no longer be a public company within a few days.  Based on the inside information Drew Peterson learned from his father, Drew Peterson purchased Mariner Energy stock for his own accounts, as well as for his relatives, his clients, and for a close friend.  In addition, Drew Peterson used the nonpublic information provided by his father to tip several close friends.  One of those friends, a portfolio manager at a hedge fund, reaped approximately $5 million in illegal profits for himself, his hedge funds and his relatives., The SEC’s complaint charges Clayton Peterson and Drew Peterson with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint seeks a final judgment permanently enjoining the defendants from future violations of the above provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to disgorge their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest on a joint and several basis, and ordering them to pay financial penalties.  The SEC also seeks to permanently prohibit Clayton Peterson from acting as an officer or director of any registered public company.,  ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr22063.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Noack with defrauding five Wisconsin school districts by selling them unsuitably risky and complex investments funded largely with borrowed money., Filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, the SEC’s complaint alleges that Stifel and Noack created a proprietary program to help the school districts fund retiree benefits by investing in notes linked to the performance of synthetic collateralized debt obligations (CDOs).  The school districts established trusts that invested $200 million in three transactions from June to December 2006, paid for largely with borrowed funds. According to the SEC’s complaint, Stifel and Noack misrepresented the risk of the investments and failed to disclose material facts to the school districts.  In the end, the investments were a complete failure, but generated significant fees for Stifel and Noack., According to the SEC’s complaint, the five school districts are the Kenosha Unified School District, Kimberly Area School District, School District of Waukesha, West Allis-West Milwaukee School District, and Whitefish Bay School District.  The SEC alleges that Stifel and Noack made sweeping assurances to the school districts, misrepresenting that it would take “15 Enrons” – a catastrophic, overnight collapse – for the investments to fail.  They also misrepresented that 30 of the 105 companies in the portfolio would have to default and that 100 of the top 800 companies in the world would have to fail before the school districts would suffer a loss of their principal., The SEC alleges that among material facts that Stifel and Noack failed to disclose were the portfolio in the first transaction performing poorly from the outset, credit rating agencies placing 10 percent of the portfolio on negative watch within 36 days of closing, and certain CDO providers expressing concerns about the risks of Stifel’s proprietary program and declining to participate in it., According to the SEC’s complaint, Stifel and Noack sold the school districts an unsuitable product that did not meet their investment needs.  The school districts had no prior experience with investing in CDOs and related instruments.  Stifel and Noack knew that the school districts lacked the requisite sophistication and experience to independently evaluate the risks of the investment, and knew that the school districts relied on Stifel and Noack’s recommendations.  The school districts contributed $37.3 million toward the $200 million investment and borrowed the remaining $162.7 million.  , The SEC alleges that the heavy use of leverage and the structure of the synthetic CDOs exposed the school districts to a heightened risk of catastrophic loss.  The investments steadily declined in value in 2007 and 2008 as the CDO portfolios suffered a series of downgrades.  By 2010, the school districts learned that the second and third investments were a complete loss and that the lender had seized all of the trusts’ assets.  The school districts suffered a complete loss of their investment and suffered credit rating downgrades for failing to provide additional funds to the trusts they established., The SEC alleges that Stifel and Noack violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC also alleges that Stifel violated and Noack aided and abetted violations of Section 15(c)(1)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Evolution Capital was an investment adviser registered with the Commission until June 2010.  The firms and Valdez raised at least than $10 million from more than 80 investors through two fraudulent note offerings., The Commission alleges that, in the offerings, Valdez, Evolution Capital, and EIGI falsely promised that the notes were safe and secured by assets guaranteed by the United States government.  The defendants also falsely promised that they would use leverage to purchase the assets securing the notes.  In fact, according to the Commissions complaint, the assets securing the notes were subject to significant, undisclosed default and prepayment risk.  Moreover, the defendants never obtained leverage to purchase the assets.  The Commission further alleges that the defendants paid themselves more than $2.4 million in fees and expenses and used approximately $2.7 million from the second note offering to make Ponzi-like payments to investors in the first note offering.  As a result of defaults and prepayments on the underlying assets, the failure to obtain leverage, and the excessive Ponzi-like payments and fees, the Commission alleges that the defendants do not have sufficient assets to repay investors in accordance with the notes. , The complaint alleges that Evolution Capital and EIGI violated the anti-fraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint also alleges that Valdez and Evolution Capital aided and abetted the violations and that Valdez is liable as the control person for the firms.

The SEC charged Scammell with insider trading in its complaint filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California and has alleged that Scammell purchased highly speculative Marvel call options for less than $5500.  After the August 31, 2009 announcement that Marvel would be acquired by Disney, Marvel’s stock price increased over 25% and Scammell sold the Marvel options for a profit of more than $192,000 — a 3000% return in less than one month.  , The SEC alleges that Scammell’s girlfriend worked on the Marvel acquisition while she was an extern in the Disney corporate strategy department.  According to the complaint, Scammell’s girlfriend learned confidential information about the deal, including that Disney would pay $50 per share for Marvel and that the deal would be announced by Labor Day.  Scammell purchased Marvel call options with strike prices of $50 and $45 even though Marvel had never traded above $41.74.  The SEC alleges that most of the Marvel options Scammell purchased were set to expire on September 19, 2009, just a few weeks after Disney announced it would acquire Marvel.  The complaint states that Scammell’s trades were so unusual that his purchase of options represented 100% of the market in many instances.  At the time he purchased the Marvel call options, Scammell worked as an associate at an investment fund in Northern California, according to the complaint.  The SEC also alleges that just before he purchased many of the Marvel securities, Scammell searched the internet for the terms “insider trading,” “material, non-public information,” and “Rule 10b-5.”, According to the complaint, Scammell secretly used his brother’s money to purchase the majority of the Marvel call options.  The SEC alleges that Scammell’s brother gave him authority to manage his finances when he was deployed to serve in Iraq with the U.S. Army and this arrangement continued when Scammell’s brother returned to the United States.  However, Scammell never told his brother that he had invested his money in Marvel or that his brother’s account had increased by more than $100,000 in less than one month as a result of the Marvel trades, according to the complaint.   , The SEC’s complaint alleges that Scammell violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

In a judgment against Offill entered on August 19, 2011, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan permanently barred Offill from participating in any offering of penny stock.  The court also prohibited Offill and his company, Collective Thought Holdings, Inc., from offering or selling shares in violation of the registration provisions of the federal securities laws, and ordered Offill to pay $5,000 in disgorgement., In April, the court entered a consent judgment against co-defendant Peter W. Fisher enjoining him against violations of the antifraud and registration provisions of the securities laws, prohibiting him from serving as an officer or director of a public company and from participating in offerings of penny stocks for five years, and requiring him to pay a civil penalty of $25,000.

22075,2011,[<h3>SEC CHARGES FIVE SENIOR EXECUTIVES WITH FINANCIAL FRAUD AT SYNTAX-BRILLIAN CORPORATION</h3>],"[On August 30, 2011, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed charges in connection with a financial fraud perpetrated by senior management and members of the Board of Directors of Syntax-Brillian Corporation, a developer and distributor of high-definition LCD (liquid crystal display) televisions under the Olevia brand name.  The SECs Complaint alleges that the scheme was orchestrated by James Li, a Syntax Director who at times was also its President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Executive Officer, and Thomas Chow, a Syntax Director and its Chief Procurement Officer., According to the SECs Complaint, from at least June 2006 through April 2008, Li and Chow engaged in a complex scheme to overstate Syntaxs financial results by publicly reporting significant sales of LCD televisions in China, when in fact the vast majority of these sales never occurred.  Li and Chow initially concealed the scheme through the use of fake shipping and sales documents.  As the scheme progressed, Li and Chow developed a circular cash flow scheme involving Syntaxs primary manufacturer, Taiwan Kolin Co., Ltd., and its purported customer in Hong Kong, South China House of Technology Consultants Co. Ltd. (SCHOT).  Kolins Chairman of the Board, Christopher Liu, and Kolins executive and board member, Roger Kao, assisted in the scheme, which created the façade of substantial revenues from Syntaxs purported sales in China.  Under the guise of paying various invoices, Li and Chow funneled millions of dollars from Syntax to Kolin.  Liu and Kao then authorized the transmittal of these funds to SCHOT, which then transferred the funds back to Syntax.  Syntax recorded these cash transfers as payments for the previously recorded fictitious sales., The SEC alleges that Wayne Pratt, Syntaxs Chief Financial Officer, ignored red flags of improper revenue recognition and participated in preparing backdated documentation that was provided to Syntaxs auditors to support fictitious fiscal 2006 year-end sales.  Pratt also ignored indications of impaired assets, agency sales, and potential collectability issues., The SECs Complaint alleges that between June 30, 2006, and September 30, 2007, Li, Chow, Liu, and Pratt signed various filings with the SEC containing material misstatements.  In addition, Li, Chow, and Pratt signed management representation letters for Syntaxs auditors that contained material misstatements regarding, among other things, sales to SCHOT, purchases from Kolin, and the relationships between Syntax, SCHOT, and Kolin.  Li and Chow also engaged in insider trading., The SECs Complaint charges Chow with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2, and that he aided and abetted violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13.  In connection with its civil action against Chow, the SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, a civil penalty up to a maximum of three times trading profits pursuant to Section 21A(a)(2) of the Exchange Act, a civil penalty pursuant to Section 20(d) of the Securities Act and Section 21(d)(3)(A) of the Exchange Act, and a bar against service as an officer or director of a public company (officer and director bar).

The SECs complaint also names Diamondback as a relief defendant., In its complaint, the SEC alleges that Arthur Cutillo and Brien Santarlas, two former attorneys with the international law firm of Ropes &amp; Gray LLP, misappropriated from their law firm material, nonpublic information concerning the acquisition of Axcan.  As alleged in the complaint, they tipped the inside information, through another attorney, to Zvi Goffer, a proprietary trader at the broker-dealer Schottenfeld Group LLC, in exchange for kickbacks.  The SEC alleges that Goffer tipped the inside information to fellow Schottenfeld proprietary trader Franz Tudor, who traded in the securities of Axcan, and tipped the information to his friend Scolaro.  The SEC alleges that based on this inside information, Scolaro traded in the securities of Axcan on behalf of a Diamondback hedge fund, resulting in illicit profits for the fund of approximately $1.1 million. , To settle the SECs charges, Scolaro consented to the entry of a final judgment that: (i) permanently enjoins him from violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and (ii) orders him to pay disgorgement of $125,980, prejudgment interest of $14,420, and a civil penalty of $62,945.

The SEC also charged Turnerâs brother-in-law Scott A. Vollmar, Turnerâs friend Scott A. Robarge and Vollmarâs neighbor Mark A. Durbin for their roles in the scheme. In total, the scheme generated illicit gains of nearly $3.9 million., Filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, the SECâs complaint alleges that Vollmar was a director of business development for Autodesk and tipped Turner and Durbin with inside information about Autodeskâs planned tender offer for Moldflow in advance of Autodeskâs public merger announcement on May 1, 2008.

Robarge and Durbin traded on the inside information in their personal accounts. Robarge also recommended that one of his friends buy Moldflow stock. In total, the traders made illicit gains of $2.3 million from their trading in Moldflow stock., According to the SECâs complaint, Vollmar also tipped Turner with inside information about Autodeskâs fourth quarter 2008 earnings in advance of Autodeskâs public earnings announcement on February 26, 2008. Turner traded on the information in his personal accounts, his family membersâ accounts and the Clay Fundâs account. He again tipped Robarge and recommended that several other friends and family members sell short Autodesk stock and purchase Autodesk put options. In total, the traders made illicit gains of nearly $1.1 million from their trading in Autodesk securities., The SECâs complaint further alleges that Robarge, a recruiting technology manager for Salesforce at the time, tipped Turner with confidential information about Salesforceâs performance in advance of the companyâs public earnings announcement on February 27, 2008. Turner traded on the inside information in his personal accounts, his family membersâ accounts and the Clay Fundâs account. Turner also recommended that several other friends and family members, including Vollmar, purchase Salesforce stock and call options. Robarge traded on the information in his personal account and recommended that one of his friends buy Salesforce securities. In total, the traders made illicit gains of nearly $500,000 from their trading in Salesforce securities., The SEC alleges that Clay Capital, Turner and Vollmar violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and that Clay Capital, Turner, Vollmar, Robarge and Durbin violated Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder. The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.

22081,2011,[<h3>SEC CHARGES MASSACHUSETTS-BASED ATTORNEY FOR VIOLATING AN INVESTMENT ADVISER BAR AND HIS SON FOR FAILING TO DISCLOSE HIS FATHERâS BAR TO ADVISORY CLIENTS</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that it filed a civil injunctive action today in federal district court in Massachusetts against John A. âJackâ Grant (âJack Grantâ), Sage Advisory Group, LLC, a Massachusetts-based investment adviser registered with the Commission, and its sole principal, owner, and employee, Benjamin Lee Grant (âLee Grantâ). The Commissionâs complaint alleges that Jack Grant, a lawyer and former stockbroker, has violated and continues to violate a Commission bar from association with investment advisers by associating with his son Lee Grantâs investment advisory firm, Sage, and by acting as an investment adviser himself. The Complaint further alleges that Jack Grant, Lee Grant and Sage fraudulently failed to disclose Jack Grantâs barred status and disciplinary history to Sageâs advisory clients., According to the Complaint, the Commission filed a previous enforcement action against Jack Grant in 1988 alleging that he sold $5,500,000 of unregistered securities and misappropriated investorsâ funds. At that time, Jack Grant agreed to settle the case and to settle related administrative proceedings that resulted in a July 1988 Order issued by the Commission barring Jack Grant from association with broker, dealers, and investment advisers. Notwithstanding his bar from associating with investment advisers, Jack Grant did not remove himself from the securities business. Jack Grant continued to advise individuals and small businesses on the management of their assets and investments, including prior brokerage customers. He retooled his service as the Law Offices of Jack Grant, and continued providing investment advice, using his son, Lee Grant, to help implement his investment advice., The Complaint alleges that, from at least 1998, Jack Grant has advised clients to invest through his son Lee Grant, who worked first as an associated person of an investment adviser, then as a registered representative of a broker-dealer and, since 2005, as the principal and sole director of a registered investment adviser, Sage. Lee Grant has been fully aware of Jack Grantâs bar from associating with investment advisers, but allowed his association with Sage nonetheless. Jack Grant, Lee Grant, and Sage failed to inform their advisory clients that Jack Grant is barred from associating with investment advisers. They also failed to disclose Jack Grantâs other disciplinary history: his suspension from practicing law for one year, imposed in 1994 following an indictment and conviction for bankruptcy fraud., The Commissionâs complaint alleges that Jack Grant, Sage and Lee Grant violated Section 206 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (âAdvisers Actâ) and that Sage and Lee Grant violated Section 207 of the Advisers Act. The Commission seeks, among other things, the entry of a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus pre-judgment interest, and the imposition of civil monetary penalties against Jack Grant, Sage and Lee Grant., The Commission filed a separate civil injunctive action against Sage and Lee Grant on September 29, 2010, alleging that Sage and Lee Grant made material misrepresentations and omissions to his former brokerage customers in order to induce them to transfer their assets to Sage, his new advisory firm.

Powell and his company Christian Stanley Inc. have spent the past seven years creating the illusion that it was a legitimate company involved in the life settlement industry. Contrary to what investors were told, Christian Stanley has never purchased or generated any revenue as a result of brokering the sale of a single life settlement, and has barely derived any revenue from any of its purported business ventures. Instead, Powell has simply used the Christian Stanley name as a vehicle to raise at least $4.5 million in an unregistered offering of debenture notes, and spent most of the money for purposes unrelated to its ostensible business operations. Powell misused investor funds to finance his stays at luxury hotels, visits to nightclubs and restaurants, and purchases of high-end vehicles., The Honorable George H. King for the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California yesterday granted the Commissionâs request for a temporary restraining order and asset freeze against Powell and his companies. The court also appointed Robb Evans and Associates LLC as temporary receiver over the entities., According to the Commissionâs complaint, Powell raised funds from at least 50 investors nationwide in the fraudulent debenture offering, promising investors fixed interest returns ranging from 5 to 15.5 percent annually for five-year terms. Powell claimed the notes were backed by assets such as a gold mine in Nevada and a coal mine in Kentucky that he said held coal deposits valued at $11.8 billion., The Commission alleges that instead of using investor money to purchase life settlements or develop the coal and gold mines, Powell and Christian Stanley instead used investorsâ money for such unrelated purposes as sales commissions and Ponzi-like payments to existing note holders. Among Powellâs other personal expenditures with investor funds were $21,000 toward his school loans, more than $5,000 for cowboy boots, and nearly $5,000 to register for a dating service., The Commissionâs complaint alleges that Christian Stanley and Powell violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions, appointment of a permanent receiver, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest thereon, and financial penalties, against each of them.

(National), Nationalâs president Kay Berenson-Galster (Galster) and Nationalâs owner, Roger Greer (Greer)., The complaint alleges that, for at least five years, National Stock Transfer, Inc., a transfer agent registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, has been violating federal securities laws and important obligations it has as a transfer agent. The Complaint alleges, among other things, that National has failed to report lost or stolen securities in a timely manner, failed to maintain certain records, failed to maintain control books for all of its issuers and failed to file its annual report with the Securities and Exchange Commission. During the time period covered by the complaint, National acted as the transfer agent for 58 issues of common and preferred stock. , National has recently been physically locked out of its office by its creditor, Woodward Capital Partners, LLC, as part of a private state court case. The Commission has moved the court for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction against National and its principals, enjoining them from continued violations. The Court order granted the temporary restraining order against future violations of the federal securities laws regulating transfer agents, accelerated discovery and enjoined further litigation in the private state court action. , The Commissionâs complaint charges National with violations of Sections 17(a)(3) and 17A(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ) and Rules 17Ad-2, 17f-1, 17f-2(a), 17Ac2-1(c), 17Ac-2-2, 17Ad-6, 17Ad-7, 17Ad-10, 17Ad-13, 17Ad-15(c), 17Ad-17 and 17Ad-19 thereunder, and Galster and Greer with aiding and abetting violations of Sections 17(a)(3) and 17A(d) of the Exchange Act and Rules 17Ad-2, 17f-1, 17f-2(a), 17Ac2-1(c), 17Ac-2-2, 17Ad-6, 17Ad-7, 17Ad-10, 17Ad-13, 17Ad-15(c), 17Ad-17 and 17Ad-19 thereunder.

22084,2011,[<h3>SEC DEFENDANT INDICTED IN MONEY LAUNDERING SCHEME TO HIDE AND CONCEAL ASSETS AND OBSTRUCT JUSTICE IN AN SEC CIVIL ENFORCEMENT ACTION</h3>],"[The Commission announced that on August 24, 2011, the United States Attorneyâs Office for the Southern District of Florida unsealed an Indictment charging Steven Steiner a/k/a Steven Steinger, a defendant in a now settled SEC action, with obstructing justice by lying to the SEC. The 54 count Indictment charges Steiner, along with Henry Fecker, III, with money laundering and other violations. According to the Indictment, Steiner and Fecker, among other things, concealed assets and lied in financial statements that they submitted to the SEC. Steiner and Fecker submitted the financial statements during settlement negotiations to resolve the SECâs case against Steiner for his antifraud and other violations in a billion dollar offering fraud conducted by Mutual Benefits Corporation (MBC). Fecker was the sole officer and director of Camden Consulting, Inc., a relief defendant in that case., The Commission first halted the on-going fraud at MBC in May 2004 when it filed a contested emergency civil enforcement action against MBC and its principals, including Steinerâs brothers, Joel and Leslie Steinger. In its complaint, the SEC alleged that the defendants had raised over $1 billion from more than 29,000 investors through a fraudulent, unregistered offering of securities in the form of fractionalized interests in viatical and life settlements. The SEC obtained a restraining order to halt the alleged fraud at MBC, and thereafter a receiver was appointed by the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida (the âMBC Receiverâ), to identify and trace the assets of MBC., In June 2005, the SEC filed an amended complaint adding Steiner as a defendant and naming SKS Consulting, Inc. (SKS) a company he controlled, and Camden, as relief defendants. In the amended complaint, the SEC alleged that Steiner was the public face of MBC, who participated in all or most initial sales training sessions for new in-house and outside sales agents, met with prospective and existing MBC investors, and made misrepresentations to investors about the safety of investing with MBC and the manner in which it obtained life expectancies for the insurance policies that formed the basis of an investment in MBC. The SEC also alleged that Fecker â Steinerâs life partner â was Camdenâs sole officer and director and shared signatory authority with Steiner on the companyâs bank accounts. In January 2006, the SEC filed a second amended complaint and further alleged relief defendant Camden acted as a conduit for MBC to make undisclosed payments to Steiner., On April 10, 2007, the Court entered a settled Final Judgment of Permanent Injunction and Other Relief against Steiner and Relief Defendants SKS and Camden. The Final Judgment enjoins Steiner from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Final Judgment also holds Steiner, SKS, and Camden jointly and severally liable for disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $5,000,000, but orders them to pay $3,925,000 based on their financial statements and other information submitted to the Commission and waives the remainder of the amount and did not impose a penalty based on the financial information., According to the Indictment, in the years after 2004 when MBC was shut down, Steiner and Fecker engaged in a series of transactions to hide assets from the SEC and the MBC Receiver by placing funds attributable to Steiner with third parties or in Feckerâs name alone, and later by causing third parties to make payments of monies due to Steiner, instead to Fecker. Fecker used the funds to support a lavish lifestyle for Fecker and Steiner. To obtain a favorable settlement of the SECâs case against Steiner, SKS, and Camden, the Indictment alleges that in 2006 and early 2007, Steiner and Fecker submitted a series of false and misleading documents to conceal their true financial condition., The Indictment further alleges that in late 2009, to further conceal assets from the SEC and the MBC receiver, Steiner sold a luxury New York apartment for $1.3 million, but caused false documents to state that the sales price was $1.1 million, and submitted these documents to the SEC and the MBC Receiver. The Indictment alleges that Steiner caused the purchaser to make an additional $200,000 in undisclosed side payments to Fecker, and that these undisclosed and concealed funds were thereafter used to support the lavish lifestyle of Steiner and Fecker. To further thwart the SECâs efforts to recover assets attributable to MBC, the Indictment alleges that Steiner provided false and misleading testimony under oath to the MBC Receiver concerning his assets and financial condition., The SECâs actions regarding Mutual Benefits resulted in injunctions and other relief against eight defendants and eight relief defendants, and orders to pay disgorgement and civil penalties totaling $30 million. In addition, before the August 24 Indictment, the United States Attorneyâs Office for the Southern District of Florida had charged 10 defendants in criminal actions for their roles in the fraud., The SEC acknowledges the work of the United States Attorneyâs Office for the Southern District of Florida, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Miami Field Office, and the Internal Revenue Service, Criminal Investigation Division in this matter., For additional information see Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18698.htm>18698</a> (May 6, 2004), Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr19274.htm>19274</a> (June 20, 2005), Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr19480.htm>19480</a> (December 1, 2005), Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr19978.htm>19978</a> (January 24, 2007), Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20151.htm>20151</a> (June 13, 2007), Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20459.htm>20459</a> (February 15, 2008), and Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20521.htm>20521</a> (April 7, 2008).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr22084.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The complaint further alleged that a senior executive at Polycom and an employee at Market Street Partners, an investor relations firm that did work for Google, tipped Roomy Khan, an individual investor, to inside information that Khan passed on to Feinblatt and Yokuty. The Complaint alleged that Feinblatt and Yokuty then traded on the basis of this and other inside information given to them by Khan on behalf of Triviumâs hedge funds, reaping illicit profits for the funds of more than $15 million., To settle the SECâs charges, Feinblatt consented to the entry of a judgment that: (i) permanently enjoins him from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and (ii) orders him to pay disgorgement of $829,765, plus $186,023 in prejudgment interest, plus a civil penalty of $1,659,530.

22086,2011,"[<h3>Commission Sues Massachusetts Investment Adviser For Fraudulently Inducing Clients to Invest in Forex, Causing Investor Losses of Nearly $4 Million While Adviser Earned Hefty Fees</h3>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that, on September 8, 2011, it filed a civil injunctive action in federal district court in Massachusetts against registered investment adviser EagleEye Asset Management, LLC, and its sole principal, Jeffrey A. Liskov, both of Plymouth, MA, in connection their fraudulent conduct toward advisory clients., In its complaint, the Commission alleges that, between at least April 2008 and August 2010, Liskov made material misrepresentations to nearly a dozen advisory clients to induce them to liquidate investments in securities and instead invest the proceeds in foreign currency exchange (âforexâ) trading. These investments, which were not suitable for older clients with conservative investment goals, resulted in steep losses for clients, totaling nearly $4 million, but EagleEye and Liskov came away with over $300,000 in performance fees on these investments alone, in addition to other management fees they collected from clients. Liskovâs strategy was to generate temporary profits on client forex investments to enable him to collect performance fees, after which client investments invariably would sharply decline in value. According to the Commissionâs complaint, Liskovâs material misrepresentations to clients concerned the nature of forex investments, the risks involved, and his expertise and track record in forex trading. As to some clients, Liskov did not explain what forex trading was at all. As to other clients, Liskov downplayed the risks of forex investments. Liskov also falsely told several clients that he had had prior success in forex trading, when in fact he had lost substantial sums of his own or other clientsâ money in forex trading when he made such statements. The Commissionâs complaint further alleges that, in the case of two clients, without their knowledge or consent, Liskov liquidated securities in their brokerage accounts and transferred the proceeds to their forex trading accounts where he lost nearly all client funds, but not before first collecting performance fees for EagleEye (and ultimately himself) on short-lived profits in the clientsâ forex accounts. The complaint alleges that Liskov accomplished the unauthorized transfers by doctoring asset transfer forms. On several occasions, Liskov took old forms signed by the clients and used âwhite outâ correction fluid to change dates, asset transfer amounts, and other data. Liskov also used similar tactics to open multiple forex trading accounts in the name of one client, thereby maximizing his ability to earn performance fees for EagleEye (and ultimately himself) on the clientâs investments, all without disclosing this to the client or obtaining the clientâs consent., The Commissionâs complaint alleges that, by the foregoing conduct, EagleEye and Liskov violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The Commission further alleges that EagleEye failed to maintain certain books and records required of investment advisers in violation of Section 204 of the Advisers Act and Rule 204-2(a) thereunder, and that Liskov aided and abetted EagleEyeâs violations of these provisions. The Commission seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest thereon, and the imposition of a monetary penalty against both EagleEye and Liskov., The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts William F.

Finger opened the firm in February and began managing nearly $5 million in assets, mainly for friends and family members.  The SEC alleges that Finger concealed his misconduct from customers by providing them with doctored account statements inflating their account balances and understating his commission charges., Unbeknownst to his customers, Finger allegedly embarked on a high-frequency, high-risk options trading strategy that lost nearly $2 million over the following months.  At the same time, Black Diamond charged customers more than $2 million in commissions, and Finger diverted some funds to his personal bank account to support a lifestyle that included a $2 million home and luxury vehicles.  , The SEC’s complaint, filed in federal district court for the Western District of Washington, charges Finger and Black Diamond with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and charges Black Diamond with violating Section 15(c)(1)(A) of the Exchange Act and Finger with aiding and abetting violations of Section 15(c)(1)(A).

Although D&amp;T Shanghai is in possession of vast amounts of documents responsive to the subpoena, it has not produced any documents to the SEC to date. As a result, the Commission is unable to gain access to information that is critical to an investigation that has been authorized for the protection of public investors., According to the court papers, D&amp;T Shanghai was Longtopâs auditor since at least 2007, and the firm consented that its audit reports for Longtop could be filed annually with the SEC while knowing full well that they would be relied upon by U.S. investors. On May 22, D&amp;T Shanghai resigned as Longtopâs auditor after discovering numerous improprieties during an audit for the year ended March 31, 2011. In its resignation letter, which was included in a Form 6-K furnished by Longtop on May 23, D&amp;T Shanghai identified numerous indicia of financial fraud at Longtop and indicated that D&amp;T Shanghaiâs prior year audit reports for Longtop could no longer be relied upon by investors., As part of the Longtop investigation, the SEC staff issued and served the subpoena on D&amp;T Shanghai seeking production of documents related to the incomplete audit of Longtop for the year ended March 31 as well as prior year audits that D&amp;T Shanghai completed. According to the court papers, these documents may reveal information about D&amp;T Shanghaiâs discovery of false financial records at Longtop, how any fraud schemes at Longtop were able to continue undetected, and basic information necessary to ferret out whether there was a fraud, who was behind it, how significant it was, and how it was conducted., The SECâs court papers note that Longtop is a foreign private issuer whose American depositary shares (ADSs) traded on the NYSE from the date of its initial public offering in October 2007 until May 17, 2011, when the NYSE halted trading prior to delisting Longtopâs securities in August 2011.

Mowen.  Ms. OâMalley is the former spouse of convicted felon and securities law recidivist, Jeffrey L. Mowen.  On May 4, 2011, Mowen pled guilty to committing wire fraud in a related criminal action, <i>United States of America v. Mowen</i>, Case No. 2:09-cr-00098-DB (D. Utah).  In pleading guilty, Mowen acknowledged operating a Ponzi scheme from around October 2006 to around October 2008, wherein he received over $18 million from investors for use in a purported foreign currency trading program.  The SEC Complaint alleges that the investor funds provided to Mowen were raised by Thomas Fry and the other defendants, Fryâs promoters, from the unregistered offer and sale of high-yield promissory notes to over 150 investors in several states.  Mowen acknowledged in his guilty plea that, rather than using investor funds for their intended purpose, he used the money for his personal benefit, misappropriating over $8 million., According to the SECâs Complaint, Mowen transferred approximately $650,000 of the misappropriated funds to his then wife, relief defendant Erin OâMalley.  The SEC sought the return of those funds in its complaint from Ms. OâMalley, whom it alleged had no <i>bona fide</i> right to the funds.

The Commission also charged two entities controlled by Glatfelter and Rice, K2 Unlimited, Inc. and 211 Ventures, LLC, in connection with the scheme.  , The Commissions Complaint alleges that beginning in 2007, Glatfelter and Rice, through K2 Unlimited and 211 Ventures, offered fraudulent venture capital financing, which was purportedly to be raised through the use of bank guarantees.  According to the Commissions Complaint, Glatfelter, Rice and 211 Ventures also offered direct investments involving fictitious securities and trading programs, promising sky-high returns with guarantees against loss.  In fact, the Commission alleges that the bank guarantees were non-existent fictional instruments and that the defendants defrauded investors of at least $1.8 million., The Commissions Complaint also alleges that in early 2009, Glatfelter became associated with Anderson and the two began to offer fraudulent investments to investors, also based in part on the use of various fictitious financial instruments.

Nelson of Colbert, Wash., defrauded investors in her company - the Little Loan Shoppe - by misrepresenting the profitability and safety of their investments and giving them the false impression that their money was being used to grow her business.  In truth, Nelson used the vast majority of new investor money to repay principal and purported returns to earlier investors.  She misappropriated millions of dollars in investor funds for her personal use., According to the SECs complaint filed in federal district court in Spokane, Nelson raised approximately $135 million between 1999 and 2008 from at least 650 investors in the United States, Canada, and Mexico.  Nelson falsely told investors that Little Loan Shoppe was financially sound.  In written promissory notes, Nelson promised investors annual returns of 40 to 60 percent that she claimed would be paid through Little Loan Shoppes profits.  She also told investors that their money was safe because she had insurance or a separate account to pay investors back.  However, Little Loan Shoppe was not profitable, investor money was not safe, and Nelson misappropriated the money to run her Ponzi scheme., The SEC further alleges that in mid-2008 as the scheme was nearing collapse, Nelson made a last-ditch effort to attract more investment money by announcing a window to invest and falsely telling investors that Little Loan Shoppe had defied financial gravity in the declining economy.  Investors responded by investing millions of dollars in 2008 before the scheme finally collapsed in 2009.  Payments to investors ceased and Little Loan Shoppe was forced into bankruptcy., In its federal court action, the SEC alleges Nelson violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The Commission alleges that Rubin and Scott committed securities fraud by, among other things, engaging in market manipulation in a broader manipulative scheme, and also, through their respective related entities, BGLR Enterprises, LLC and E-Info Solutions, LLC, violated the registration provisions of Section 5(a) and (c) of the Securities Act of 1933 (âSecurities Actâ) by selling stock in unlawful unregistered offerings. The Commission separately alleged that Greeney, through his related entity, Big Baller Media Group, LLC, violated the registration provisions by selling stock in unlawful unregistered offerings., The Commission alleges that Rubin and Scott, in violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder, participated in a broader market manipulation ring that involved bringing companies public through reverse mergers; using Westcap to raise funds for the newly-created companies through purported private placements; and manipulating the public markets for those newly-created public companies, which allowed Rubin and Scott, through their related entities, to sell their holdings of these companies at artificially inflated prices for total proceeds exceeding $1.5 million., In particular, the Commission alleges that Rubin engaged in various manipulative activities including coordinated and matched trading activity, and that Scott similarly engaged in a number of manipulative activities including assuming trading authority and control over multiple accounts to conduct coordinated trading activity. In one email, Rubin complained to another scheme participant that he, not Rubin, should conduct the manipulative trading by writing, âmy job is to bring in all the money and yours [is] to cover the bid,â which referred to entering buy orders to keep the stock price at an artificially inflated level. Scott, in an email to Rubin and another scheme participant, explained that he engaged in manipulation to keep an issuerâs stock price at a certain range - a range that he believed was needed to facilitate Westcapâs concurrent private placement involving that issuer., The Commission seeks injunctions, penny stock bars, disgorgement, and penalties from Rubin and Scott (and their related entities, BGLR Enterprises and E-Info Solutions), in addition to an officer and director bar against Scott because he was an officer of one of the microcap issuers., With respect to Greeney, the Commission alleges that he, through his related entity, sold shares in unregistered offerings of two of the microcap issuers for unlawful profits of approximately $330,000, in violation of the registration provisions of the Securities Act. Greeney and his related entity, Big Baller Media Group, have offered to settle the Commissionâs allegations by consenting, without admitting or denying the allegations, to an injunction against future violations of Securities Act Sections 5(a) and 5(c), to be barred from participating in an offering of penny stock for a period of three years, and to pay disgorgement and penalties in amounts to be determined by the Court. The offer of settlement by Greeney and Big Baller Media Group are subject to the Courtâs approval. Greeney has also offered to settle a yet-to-be instituted administrative proceeding against him, in which Greeney would consent, if the Court enters an injunction against him, to an order barring him from association with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, transfer agent, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization with the right to reapply for admission after three years., See Also: SEC Complaint and Litigation Releases Nos. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr20977.htm>LR-20977</a> and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2010/lr21539.htm>LR-21539</a>.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr22102.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Rivera, Jr., Marc C. Harmon<a name=P10_728></a>, and two companies controlled by Rivera raised nearly $8 million from investors in two separate schemes, one involving purported trading in gold and diamonds and the other involving purported trading in collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs).  However, the funds raised from investors weren’t used for those purposes as Rivera diverted most of the money for his personal exploits, including a $360,000 surprise birthday party for his wife., According to the SEC’s complaint filed in federal court in San Francisco, Rivera previously worked in real estate and portrayed himself to investors as a successful financier.  He raised approximately $4.5 million from investors in 2007 and 2008 through his company, the Joseph Rene Corporation (JRC).  He touted JRC as a route to “financial freedom” and “maximum results with minimum risk” in a brochure he distributed to investors, assuring them high returns by pooling investor money and placing it in “hard assets” such as real estate, oil, diamonds, and gold.  However, as Rivera instead spent investor money as his own and was unable to make payments to investors as promised, he tried to placate them with falsehoods.  For example, Rivera claimed in a June 2008 e-mail to JRC investors that glitches in the banking system had delayed their payouts, but “your money is still making money.”  In a follow-up e-mail, he maintained that despite the worldwide financial downturn, JRC was “thriving,” had “lost NO money,” and all investor funds were “safe.”, The SEC alleges that Rivera later teamed up with Harmon, an unemployed construction worker at the time who had no training or experience in selling or managing investment programs.  Together they raised an additional $3.2 million from 2008 to 2010 through a second company, Executive Members Management Group (EMMG).  Rivera and Harmon led investors to believe they could make rapid profits of up to 6,300 percent by investing in trading programs involving CMOs and other financial instruments.  Specifically, Harmon falsely claimed that EMMG used “licensed traders” and “trading platforms,” and he falsely boasted to investors that extremely wealthy individuals had invested millions of dollars with EMMG.  Harmon even lied to several investors about a phony trip he took to the United Kingdom in an effort to place their money in a trading program.  , In both schemes, the SEC alleges that Rivera used investor funds to afford such personal luxuries as several Mercedes Benz automobiles, jewelry, restaurant meals, and basketball season tickets.  Rivera misused investor funds in the JRC scheme to pay for approximately $1.5 million in improvements to his 8,000-square foot home in Alamo, Calif.  He later misused investor funds in the EMMG scheme to make $1.1 million in additional improvements to his home.  Rivera also paid approximately $180,000 to Harmon.  , The complaint charges Rivera, Harmon, JRC, and EMMG with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint also charges Rivera with violating Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Harmon with violating Section 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act.

According to the complaint, from April 2009 to February 2011, Desai, acting through SSC, an unregistered investment adviser founded by Desai, made numerous materially false and misleading statements to potential investors, including that SSC was a securities broker registered with the Commission and that potential investors would receive returns of at least 50% if they invested their money with SSC.  Desai also guaranteed to investors that he would not lose their money.  On the basis of Desais misrepresentations, five individuals gave Desai money to invest on their behalf through SSC.  Desai then misappropriated investor money, using it to, among other things, make donations to a local religious institution and pay the personal debts and expenses of Desais family members.  Desai also lost investor money through bad trades.  To hide the fact that Desai had misappropriated or lost investor money, Desai provided SSC investors with account statements that overstated the value of the investors accounts by as much as 300%.  , According to the Commissions complaint, Desai and SSC also acted as securities brokers by engaging in the regular business of effecting transactions in securities for the accounts of others and by holding themselves out as securities brokers that were registered with the Commission.  At the time, however, neither Desai nor SSC was registered with the Commission as a broker and neither was associated with a registered broker-dealer., The Commissions complaint charges Desai and SSC with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

22106,2011,[<h3>SEC Charges Long Island-Based Hedge Fund Manager With Fraud Involving PIPE Transactions</h3>],"[On September 28, 2011, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged a Long Island-based investment adviser with defrauding investors in hedge funds investing in PIPE transactions and misappropriating more than $1 million in client assets for his personal use., The SEC alleges that Corey Ribotsky and his firm The NIR Group LLC repeatedly lied to investors to hide the truth that his PIPE investment and trading strategy was failing during the financial crisis. For example, Ribotsky falsely told investors that despite the adverse market conditions he could liquidate all of the PIPE investments in 36 to 48 months â a practical impossibility given the size of the investments. Meanwhile, Ribotsky misused investor money by writing checks to pay for personal services and such luxury items as a Lexus, Mercedes, and Rolex watch., A âPIPEâ transaction involves âprivate investment in public equity.â Microcap public companies often engage in PIPE transactions to raise capital. According to the SECâs complaint filed in federal district court in Brooklyn, N.Y., NIRâs family of AJW Funds provided cash financing to distressed, emerging growth, and start-up microcap companies quoted on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board or the Pink Sheets. The AJW Funds were typically invested in 120 to 130 different companies at any given time., The SEC alleges that beginning in July 2004, Ribotsky began siphoning assets from one of the AJW Funds he was managing through NIR. Ribotsky typically wrote checks to himself or to âcashâ and then instructed NIR office employees to cash the checks at a nearby bank. They would then give Ribotsky the money. Although Ribotsky was warned by NIRâs head accountant that he could not lawfully take this money for himself, Ribotsky continued to do so anyway for the next five years., According to the SECâs complaint, NIRâs strategy of investing in distressed and start-up companies began to show signs of failure by mid-to-late 2007. Many of the distressed companies to which the AJW Funds had made loans were by then essentially defunct or on the verge of filing for bankruptcy. The SEC alleges that Ribotsky made false and misleading statements to investors while his hedge funds were struggling to create the illusion of success. For instance, an NIR employee prepared an investor chart accurately showing that NIR had invested a total of $31.4 million in 57 deals for the relevant period. When Ribotsky reviewed the chart, he told the employee that âinvestors canât see thisâ and instructed him to âchange the number to something near $60 millionâ before sending it to investors so they would falsely see an average investment of at least $1 million per deal. Ribotsky continued to make false and misleading statements to investors even after the AJW Fundsâ outside auditor had calculated that it would take decades â if possible at all â to liquidate all of the AJW Fundsâ PIPE investments under NIRâs stated investment and trading strategy., The SEC further alleges that Ribotsky used money from one group of investors to pay another group of investors in 2007 without adequately disclosing this to any of the investors. Ribotskyâs misconduct also included his failure to conduct any meaningful due diligence before selling a third party $43.2 million of AJW Funds assets in November and December 2008 â a transaction that allowed Ribotsky to book a purported ârealizedâ gain, at a critical time, without his funds actually receiving any money. NIRâs offering materials and investor communications touted that NIR engages in extensive due diligence reviews before making investment decisions on behalf of the AJW Funds. The third-party purchaser soon defaulted on his payment obligations and has never paid for any of the assets., The SECâs complaint charges Ribotsky and NIR with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder. The complaint seeks a final judgment permanently enjoining Ribotsky and NIR from future violations of the above provisions of the federal securities laws and ordering them to disgorge any ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and pay monetary penalties.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr22106.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"
22107,2011,[<h3>SEC CHARGES BAY AREA INVESTMENT ADVISER FOR DEFRAUDING CLIENTS AND FALSIFYING DOCUMENTS DURING SEC EXAM</h3>],"[<i>Washington, D.C., Sept. 28, 2011</i> â The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a San Francisco-area investment adviser with fraud for lying to clients about how brokerage commission rebates were being used and producing phony documents to cover up the fraud during an SEC examination., The SEC alleges that Kurt Hovan misappropriated more than $178,000 in âsoft dollarsâ that he falsely claimed to be using to pay for legitimate investment research on his clientsâ behalf.  In reality, Hovan was secretly funneling the money for such undisclosed uses as office rent, computer hardware, and his brotherâs salary.  When SEC examination staff asked Hovan to provide documentation to back up his claims, he created phony research reports., The SEC also charged his wife Lisa Hovan and his brother Edward Hovan for their roles in the fraudulent scheme at Hovan Capital Management (HCM)., Soft dollars are credits or rebates from brokerage firms on commissions paid by clients for trades executed in the client accounts of an investment adviser.  If appropriately disclosed, an investment adviser may retain the soft dollar credits to pay for a limited category of brokerage and research services that benefit clients., According to the SECâs complaint filed in federal court in San Francisco, Kurt and Lisa Hovan falsely disclosed to clients that HCM would use soft dollars only for certain research services.  Instead, they used $166,667 in soft dollars to pay Edward Hovanâs salary over a 10-month period in 2008 and 2009.  To cover up these payments, the three Hovans created a shell company â âBolton Researchâ â secretly controlled by Edward Hovan.  Through this company, the Hovans invoiced HCMâs brokerage firms for research services that had never been rendered.  Once Edward Hovan received the payments, he kicked back approximately 40 percent ($65,000) to Kurt and Lisa Hovan to pay the office rent.  The SEC further alleges that Kurt and Lisa Hovan instructed a research provider paid with soft dollars to pad its invoices by $12,000 and kick back this amount to help HCM pay for a new computer server., During a January 2010 examination of HCM, the SEC staff asked HCM to provide copies of the research reports prepared by Bolton Research in exchange for the soft dollar payments.  In response, Kurt Hovan quickly drafted numerous research reports and doctored materials to make them appear as if they had been prepared by Bolton.  Hovan provided these phony documents to SEC examiners., The SECâs complaint charges Kurt Hovan with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ) and Rule 10b-5, Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 207 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (âAdvisers Actâ), Section 17(e)(1) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (âInvestment Company Actâ), and aiding and abetting violations of Section 204(a) of the Advisers Act and Rule 204-2(a)(7).  The SECâs complaint charges Lisa Hovan with violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5, Section 207 of the Advisers Act, and aiding and abetting violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 and 206(1) and 206(2) of the Advisers Act.  The SECâs complaint charges Edward Hovan with violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 and Section 17(e)(1) of the Investment Company Act, and aiding and abetting violations of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Advisers Act.  The SECâs complaint charges HCM with violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5, Sections 204(a), 206(1), 206(2), and 207 of the Advisers Act, and Section 17(e)(1) of the Investment Company Act.  The complaint seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and financial penalties., The SECâs case was investigated by Karen Kreuzkamp and Robert S. Leach of the San Francisco Regional Office.  The examination of HCM was conducted by Karah To, Tracey A. Bonner, and Ada C. Chee of the San Francisco Regional Officeâs investment adviser/investment company examination program., The U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Northern District of California today filed criminal charges against Kurt Hovan.

According to the Complaint, from 2006 to 2009, Alden View raised $7.9 million from investors through the sale of promissory notes by representing to investors that Alden View was engaged a sophisticated real-estate lending business. In reality, Alden View funneled the majority of its investorsâ funds into two Ponzi schemes that were run by its most significant borrowers. In doing so, Seeley and Dickson misled investors regarding, among other things: Alden Viewâs primary borrowerâs loan and payment history, the security obtained by Alden View from its borrowers, and Alden Viewâs due diligence and knowledge of how its borrowers were using investor funds., The Complaint alleges that, based on this conduct, Seeley and Dickson violated Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Alfred Clay Ludlum, III, et al.</i>, Civil Action No.10-cv-7379 (E.D. Pa.).  Ludlum is the founder, president, chief compliance officer, and sole individual in control of Printz Capital Management, LLC (Printz Capital), which was registered with the Commission as an investment adviser from September 19, 2006 until its registration was revoked on June 27, 2011.  Ludlum also wholly controls Printz Financial Group, Inc. and PCM Global Holdings LLC (together with Printz Capital, the Printz Entities)., In a civil action filed on December 20, 2010, the Commission alleged that Ludlum and the Printz Entities made fraudulent misrepresentations and material omissions to investors, including Printz Capital advisory clients, concerning unregistered offerings of equity and debt securities in the Printz Entities.  These investors were told that their funds would be used for working capital and to grow and operate the businesses of the Printz Entities when, in fact, Ludlum used most of these funds to support lifestyle, pay his personal expenses, and repay other investors.  The Commission also alleged that Ludlum fraudulently obtained loans from one advisory client and made unauthorized transfers of funds belonging to three advisory clients to accounts that he controlled.  The complaint further alleged that Ludlum failed to register the securities offerings in the Printz Entities with the Commission, even though no exemption from registration applied, and that Printz Capital, aided and abetted by Ludlum, violated additional provisions governing investment advisers. , To settle the SEC’s charges, Ludlum, without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, except as to jurisdiction, consented to the entry of a judgment that: (i) permanently enjoins him from violating Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the Securities Act), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the Advisers Act), and from aiding and abetting any violations of Sections 203, 204, and 207 of the Advisers Act; and (ii) provides that Ludlum will be ordered to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and penalties in amounts to be determined by the court, upon motion by the Commission.  , Based on the entry of these injunctions, on September 29, 2011 the SEC issued an Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Section 203(f) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Notice of Hearing against Ludlum., Previously in this matter, a final judgment was entered by default against the Printz Entities on March 15, 2011,, which permanently enjoined them from violating Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, permanently enjoined Printz Capital from violating Sections 206(1), 206(2), 203A, 204, and 207 of the Advisers Act, and permanently enjoined Printz Financial Group, Inc. from violating Securities Act Rule 503(a) of Regulation D.

No part of this judgment has been paid to date.

The Commission seeks, among other relief, conduct-based injunctions against the defendants, permanently enjoining them from soliciting existing or potential investors to purchase or sell securities., According to the SEC’s complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, Stephen Amella and Andre Hayden sold $450,000 in interests in a real estate joint venture on behalf of Titan Investment Partners Corp and its president, Andrew Buie, by making material misrepresentations about the joint venture and by failing to conduct due diligence on the joint venture.  The complaint alleges that Amella and Hayden represented that investments in the purported real estate joint venture would generate a guaranteed 10% monthly profit, and that the joint venture had already acquired some properties for which it needed investor funds to rehab and convert into condominiums for resale.  Additionally, the complaint alleges that Amella and Hayden represented that investors’ initial investments in the joint venture would be returned to them when the projects were completed.  The complaint adds that the joint venture did not acquire any real properties, and that Buie misappropriated the entire offering proceeds, spending it on his personal expenses and on commissions to Amella and Hayden.  The complaint states further that had Amella and Hayden conducted due diligence, they would have uncovered that prevailing market conditions rendered it highly improbable that the purported real estate project could generate sufficient revenue to guarantee that investors would recover 10% monthly profits, and that Buie did not acquire any real properties.  The complaint also alleges that Amella and Hayden sold the joint venture interests and received commissions for their selling activities without being registered with the Commission as brokers., The defendants were previously charged by the Commission with participating in a fraudulent offering in which they misrepresented the use of proceeds, expected returns, and risks of the investment.  As part of that offering, defendants raised $1.3 million from twenty-seven investors to purportedly trade in foreign currency.  [see SEC v. Platinum Capital Advocates, Inc., et al., 07 C 0985 (N.D. Ill.)]., The complaint charges Amella and Hayden with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 15(a) and 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint seeks conduct-based injunctions against Amella and Hayden enjoining them from directly or indirectly soliciting existing or potential investors to purchase or sell securities, a statutory injunction enjoining them from acting as unregistered brokers, disgorgement, and civil penalties.,  ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr22111.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Hansen, the former Chairman of Keystone Equities Group, a registered broker-dealer and regional investment bank. The Commissionâs complaint, originally filed on September 27, 2010, alleged that Hansen received illegal tips concerning pending acquisitions from his then-employee and close personal friend Donna Murdoch; that Murdoch had learned of the acquisitions through her close personal relationship with James Gansman, then an Ernst &amp; Young (âE&amp;Yâ) partner who worked on the transactions for E&amp;Y clients; and that Hansen traded on the illegal tips through accounts in othersâ names and also passed on one of the tips to his longtime friend Stuart Kobrovsky, a retired stockbroker, who likewise traded. , Without admitting or denying the allegationsâexcept to the extent they are embraced by his guilty plea and conviction in the parallel criminal case of <i>United States v. Hansen</i>, 1:10-cr-875-PAC-1 (S.D.N.Y., judgment entered May 13, 2011) (hereinafter the âparallel criminal caseâ), which he admitsâHansen has agreed to settle the Commissionâs allegations against him, and his settlement papers were submitted to the Court for its consideration. In particular, Hansen signed a consent that providesâsubject to approval by the Courtâfor the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him against future violations of the Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The final judgment to which Hansen consented would further order that he is liable for a combined total in disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $63,038, comprising all the profits flowing from his own illegal trading, which he conducted through the accounts of his daughters and Murdoch, according to the Commissionâs Complaint. Of that total, $32,222 would be deemed satisfied by the order of criminal forfeiture entered against Hansen in the parallel criminal case, leaving a balance due of $30,816, which Hansen would be required to pay within 30 days after entry of the Final Judgment, or within 60 days after his release from prison in the parallel criminal case, whichever is later. Finally, the Final Judgment would bar Hansen permanently from serving as an officer or director of any public company. Additionally, Hansen consented, in related administrative proceedings, to the entry of a Commission order that would bar him from association with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, transfer agent, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization, or from participating in any offering of a penny stock., The parallel criminal case was filed by the United States Attorneysâ Office for the Southern District of New York on September 27, 2010âsimultaneously with the filing of the Commissionâs Complaint in this actionâand charged Hansen with securities fraud and conspiracy to commit securities fraud. Hansen pleaded guilty to those charges on February 9, 2011, and the court entered a judgment of conviction on May 13, 2011. As part of his plea, Hansen agreed to forfeit $59,631, representing proceeds traceable to his illegal conduct. Of that amount, $32,222 derives from illicit trades embraced by the Commissionâs Complaint. The Court sentenced Hansen to three months imprisonment, followed by five months of home confinement and two yearsâ probation., If approved by the Court, this settlement would conclude this case, as the Commissionâs settlement with codefendant Kobrovsky was approved by the Court last October. The Commissionâs related case against Gansman and Murdoch has also been concluded, as has a parallel criminal case against them. In that criminal case, Murdoch entered guilty pleas on December 23, 2008 to a total of 17 felony counts and was sentenced on July 27, 2011 to two yearsâ probation, including six months of home confinement, as well as 300 hours of community service and forfeiture of $392,000. For his part, Gansman was convicted by a jury on May 15, 2009 of six felony counts and acquitted of four; he was sentenced on February 25, 2010 to a year and a day in prison; and his convictions were recently affirmed on appeal.

The SEC filed its action on October 16, 2009, which alleged that Raj Rajaratnam, Galleon Management, LP, Fortuna, S2 Capital, and others engaged in a widespread insider trading scheme involving hedge funds, industry professionals, and corporate insiders., At the time of the alleged conduct, Fortuna resided in Westwood, Massachusetts.  Fortuna was a co-founder and principal of S2 Capital, which was an unregistered hedge fund investment adviser based in New York, New York.

22116,2011,[<h3>SEC CHARGES SILICON VALLEY MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY EXECUTIVES IN FRAUDULENT SALES SCHEME</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed fraud charges against two former sales executives with Mountain View, Calif. medical equipment company Hansen Medical, Inc., alleging they orchestrated fraudulent transactions to inflate the companyâs reported revenues. In a separate proceeding, the SEC also filed settled charges against Hansen Medical for providing misleading financial information to public investors., The SECâs complaint, filed in federal district court in San Francisco, alleges that Christopher Sells, Hansen Medicalâs former Vice President of Commercial Operations, and Timothy Murawski, a former Vice President of Sales who reported to Sells, participated in multiple improper sales transactions in 2008 and 2009. The SEC alleges the individuals engaged in the scheme as Hansen Medical underwent efforts to raise additional capital from investors., According to the SECâs complaint, on multiple occasions Sells of Dallas, Tex., and Murawski of Lake Zurich, Ill., schemed to have Hansen Medical personnel temporarily install the companyâs robotic catheter system at a customer site before the customer was ready for it so that Hansen Medical could record the product sale. Hansen Medical personnel would then immediately dismantle the equipment and put it in storage until months later, when they would return to reinstall the equipment. The SEC further alleges that, in a sales transaction in the final days of December 2008, Sells and Murawski instructed Hansen Medical personnel to forge a customer signature on certain required documents to allow the company to record the revenue that quarter. According to the SEC, Sells and Murawskiâs schemes were intended to circumvent revenue recognition rules and to fool Hansen Medicalâs finance personnel and auditors into believing that the sales had been completed and revenue could be recorded., The SECâs complaint charges Sells and Murawski with violations of Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act, and Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder, aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder. The SEC also charges Sells with violations of Rules 13b2-2 under the Exchange Act. The SEC seeks permanent injunctions and financial penalties against Sells and Murawski, and also seeks to bar Sells from serving as an officer or director of a public company., In a separate administrative proceeding, Hansen Medical consented (without admitting or denying the SECâs findings) to the entry of a Order that requires that Hansen Medical to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act, and Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder. In considering whether to accept Hansen Medicals settlement offer, the Commission took into consideration Hansen Medicalâs cooperation with the Commissionâs investigation and its remedial efforts once the fraud came to light., The case was investigated by Cameron Hoffman, Kristin Snyder, Ron Baer and Tracy Davis of the San Francisco Regional Office.

22117,2011,[<h3>SEC CHARGES OPERATORS OF GREEN PRODUCT-THEMED PONZI SCHEME</h3>],"[On October 6, 2011, United States District Judge Jed S. Rakoff entered an emergency order halting a Ponzi scheme that promised investors rich returns on water-filtering natural stone pavers, but bilked them of approximately $26 million over a four-year period.  The order temporarily restrains defendants Eric Aronson, Vincent Buonauro, Jr., Robert Kondratick, Fredric Aaron, and the PermaPave Companies (PermaPave Industries, LLC, PermaPave USA Corp., PermaPave Distributions, Inc., Permeable Solutions, Inc., Verigreen, LLC) from participating in the fraudulent offering of securities.  The order also freezes the assets of these defendants as well as relief defendants Caroline Aronson, Deborah Buonauro, Aron Holdings, Inc., DASH Development, LLC, PermaPave Construction Corp., Dymoncrete Industries, LLC, Dymon Rock LI, LLC, and Lumi-Coat, Inc., The SECs complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that convicted felon Aronson and others defrauded investors in PermaPave Companies, a group of firms based on Long Island, N.Y., and controlled by Aronson.  About 140 individuals, many working in the construction or landscaping business, invested in the scheme between 2006 and 2010, the SEC alleged.  Investors were told that PermaPave Companies had a tremendous backlog of orders for pavers imported from Australia, which could be sold in the U.S. at a substantial mark-up, yielding monthly returns to investors of 7.8% to 33%.  In reality, the complaint states that there was little demand for the product, and the cost of the pavers far exceeded the revenue from sales.  , Lacking the profits promised to investors, Aronson and two other PermaPave Companies executives, Buonauro and Kondratick, used new investments to make payments to earlier investors and then siphoned off much of the rest for themselves, buying luxury cars, gambling trips to Las Vegas, and jewelry.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Aronson used investors money to make court-ordered restitution payments to victims of a previous scheme to which he pleaded guilty to conducting in 2000., According to the SECs complaint, when investors began demanding money owed to them, Aronson accused them of committing a felony by lending the PermaPave Companies money at the interest rates he promised them, which he suddenly claimed were usurious.  Aronson and his attorney, Aaron, then allegedly made false statements to persuade investors to convert their securities into ones that deferred payments owed them for several years., The SEC also alleges that the defendants used some of the money raised through the Ponzi scheme to purchase a publicly traded company, Interlink-US-Network, Ltd.  Several months later, the SEC said Interlink issued a Form 8-K, signed by Kondratick, which falsely stated that LED Capital Corp. had agreed to invest $6 million in Interlink. According to the complaint, LED Capital Corp. did not have $6 million and had no dealings, let alone any agreements, with Interlink., The SECs complaint charges Aronson, Kondratick, Buonauro, the PermaPave Companies, and Interlink with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and charges Aaron with aiding and abetting the Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 violations.  The complaint charges Interlink with violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-11 thereunder, and charges Aronson, Kondratick, and Aaron with aiding and abetting these violations.  The complaint also asserts violations of Section 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act as to Aronson, Buonauro, and the PermaPave Companies and violations of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act as to Aronson and Buonauro.  , The SEC is seeking preliminary and permanent injunctions against the defendants, and to have them return their allegedly illicit profits with prejudgment interest, and pay civil monetary penalties.  In addition, the SEC seeks to bar Aronson, Kondratick, and Aaron from participating in penny-stock offerings and from serving as officers or directors of public companies., The U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York, which conducted a parallel investigation of the matter, today filed criminal charges against Aronson, Buonauro, and Kondratick, who were arrested earlier today.  , The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York and the Securities Fraud Squad of Federal Bureau of Investigation in connection with this matter.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr22117.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

22121,2011,[<h3>SEC CHARGES BANK EXECUTIVES WITH HIDING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF LOSSES DURING 2008 FINANCIAL CRISIS</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged former bank executives with misleading investors about mounting loan losses at San Francisco-based United Commercial Bank during the height of the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009.  The SEC alleges that the bank’s former Chief Executive Officer, Thomas Wu, Chief Operating Officer Ebrahim Shabudin, and senior officer Thomas Yu concealed losses on loans and other assets from the bank’s auditors, causing the bank’s public holding company UCBH Holdings, Inc. (UCBH) to understate 2008 operating losses by at least $65 million (approximately 50 percent).  A few months later, continued declines in the value of the bank’s loans led the bank to fail, and the California Department of Financial Institutions closed the bank and appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) as receiver.  United Commercial Bank was one of the 10 largest bank failures of the recent financial crisis, causing a loss of $2.5 billion to the FDIC’s insurance fund., In a complaint filed in federal court in San Francisco, the SEC alleges that Wu, Shabudin, and Yu deliberately delayed the proper recording of loan losses, and that each committed securities fraud by making false and misleading statements to investors and UCBH’s independent auditors.  During December 2008 and the first three months of 2009 as the company prepared its 2008 financial statements, Wu, Shabudin, and Yu were aware of significant losses on several large loans.  Among other things, these executives allegedly learned about dramatically reduced property appraisals and worthless collateral securing the loans, yet they repeatedly hid this information from UCBH’s auditors and investors., The SEC’s complaint also alleges that the bank’s former Chief Financial Officer Craig On acted negligently by misleading the company’s outside auditors and aiding the filing of false financial statements.  On agreed to settle the SEC charges without admitting or denying the allegations.  He will be permanently enjoined from violating certain antifraud, reporting, record-keeping, and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws and will pay a $150,000 penalty. On also consented to an administrative order suspending him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an accountant, with a right to apply for reinstatement after five years.  , The SEC’s complaint charges Wu with knowingly violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Wu, Shabudin, and Yu are charged with aiding and abetting UCBH’s violation of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act.  The complaint charges On with violating Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act.   Each of the defendants is charged with aiding and abetting UCBH’s violation of its periodic reporting requirements under Section 13(a) and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-11of the Exchange Act, aiding and abetting UCBH’s violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and falsifying books and records and making false or misleading statements to auditors in violation of Exchange Act Rules 13b2-1 and 13b2-2.

InfrAegis is a company based in the Chicago suburb of Elk Grove Village, Illinois and purports to make products for the homeland security market.  The SEC’s Complaint charges Webb and InfrAegis with conducting a fraudulent, unregistered offering of InfrAegis stock that raised over $20 million from hundreds of investors across the country.  , The SEC’s Complaint alleges that, throughout the offering, in written offering materials provided to investors, Webb and InfrAegis made false and misleading claims about InfrAegis’ commercial success, including the existence of contracts for the sale of InfrAegis’ products.  For example, according to the SEC’s Complaint, Webb and InfrAegis made false and misleading statements to investors about the existence of lucrative contracts with the City of Chicago and the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority that would result in billions of dollars in revenue for InfrAegis.

DiClerico for the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire granted the Commissions Motion for Voluntary Dismissal of Defendant Koji Goto and Relief Defendant Shaleen Cassily in an enforcement action the Commission filed in 2003.  The Commission moved to dismiss the action after Goto was sentenced to up to 75 years in prison and ordered to pay $3.2 million in restitution in a parallel state criminal proceeding, was found incompetent by a court to face further trials, and had all of his assets liquidated and distributed through a bankruptcy proceeding., The Commission originally filed its action against Goto on November 14, 2003, alleging that Goto misappropriated more than $5 million of investor funds by falsely stating that the money would be invested in a Boston-based hedge fund and in a food services business.  Instead of investing the funds in the businesses he purported to represent, Goto diverted investor funds to his own bank accounts for his own personal gain.  Cassily, who was then Gotos wife, was named as a relief defendant in the Commissions action based on her alleged receipt of some proceeds of Gotos fraud.  On November 14, 2003, the U.S. District Court issued a temporary restraining order that, among other things froze defendant Gotos and relief defendant Cassilys assets.  On December 3, 2003, the District Court issued a preliminary injunction and asset freeze against Goto and Cassily.  The asset freeze was modified by the court on September 13, 2004 to allow two creditors to conduct a foreclosure sale of Gotos house.  , In a related criminal case, a New Hampshire state grand jury indicted Goto on 68 counts for his role in several fraudulent schemes.  From December 1994 until November 2001, Goto had been employed in Concord, New Hampshire by subsidiaries of the John Hancock Financial Services Co., including Signator Investors, Inc., a registered investment adviser and broker-dealer, and Hancock- related insurance agencies as both a registered representative and licensed insurance broker.  The indictment charged that Goto committed theft by misapplication of property, theft by deception, criminal solicitation, unlawful securities practice, and witness tampering. The case was filed in New Hampshire Superior Court and is entitled State of New Hampshire v. Koji Goto, (Docket #04-S-0492-0559) (Superior Court, Hillsborough County-North).  , Among other things, the indictment charged that Goto, beginning in June 1999 and continuing until March 2002, successfully solicited certain individuals to invest their money in purported Hancock investments. According to the indictment, Goto then gained control over that money, but never invested it with Hancock. Instead, Goto stole approximately $3.2 million from his purported Hancock clients.   For purposes of trial the New Hampshire state court segregated the charges into five separate schemes including the two schemes alleged in the Commissions Complaint as well as the scheme involving the purported Hancock investments.  , On September 27, 2004, Goto was found guilty by a jury in the criminal action of the 23 counts concerning the purported Hancock investments. The verdict found Goto guilty of: (a) nine counts of theft by deception in violation of New Hampshire Revised Statutes Annotated (RSA) 637:4; (b) one count of theft by misapplication in violation of RSA 637:10; and (c) 13 counts of unlawful securities practice in violation of RSA 421-B:6.  On March 22, 2006, Goto was sentenced on the 23 guilty verdicts to 25 to 75 years in prison and ordered to pay $3.2 million in restitution.  Subsequent to trial, the New Hampshire state court found Goto incompetent to stand trial on the remaining charges.  , On December 9, 2004, based on Gotos criminal conviction, the Commission instituted public administrative proceedings against Goto pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Section 203(f) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 based on his criminal conviction.  On March 21, 2005, Goto was permanently barred from association with any broker, dealer, and investment adviser., On October 20, 2004 Goto filed for bankruptcy, which was resolved as a fully administered Chapter 7 bankruptcy on April 1, 2011., For more information see Litigation Release Nos. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18965.htm>18965</a> (November 9, 2004),  <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18490.htm>18490</a> (December 4, 2003) and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18456.htm>18456</a> (November 14, 2003).,  ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr22123.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The Commission’s amended complaint alleged that Wynn and his companies violated the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws through a scheme to pump and dump the stock of four issuers: Beverage Creations, Inc., My Vintage Baby, Inc., ConnectAJet.com, Inc. and Alchemy Creative, Inc.  , The Commission alleged that Jason Wynn and his companies (1) purchased tens of millions of shares directly from the issuers for pennies per share, (2) touted the stock to investors through a nationwide marketing campaign, and (3) immediately dumped their shares into the public market at grossly inflated prices when no registration statement was filed or in effect.  Wynn created artificial demand for the stocks through various ad campaigns, emails and misleading promotional mailers.  While the promotional mailers disclosed that the Wynn companies received the stock being touted, they did not disclose that Wynn and his companies intended to sell that stock into the artificially inflated market created by the promotions.  , The judgment permanently enjoins Wynn, Wynn Holdings, LLC and Wynn Industries, LLC from violating Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The judgment also bars Wynn and his companies from participating in any penny stock offerings and provides that they will be ordered to pay disgorgement and civil penalties determined by the district court at a later date.  Wynn and his companies consented to the entry of the judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission’s amended complaint., Previously, on January 3, 2011, the district court entered a judgment against stock promoter Carlton Fleming and certain entities under his control – Regus Investment Group LLC and Thomas Wade Investments, LLC.

22129,2011,[<h3>SEC settles misrepresentation charges against SemGroup founder</h3>],"[On October 18, 2011, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Thomas L. Kivisto of Tulsa, Oklahoma with misleading investors in SemGroup Energy Partners, L.P. (“SGLP”) about risks they faced from energy trading he was conducting at SGLP’s parent and largest customer, SemGroup, L.P. (“SemGroup”).  Kivisto has agreed to settle these charges by consenting to injunctive relief, paying a $225,000 civil penalty and forfeiting rights to SGLP limited partnership units recently valued at approximately $1.1 million., The Commission’s complaint, filed in United States District Court in Tulsa, alleges that Kivisto should have known that certain SGLP public filings he signed misled investors about the reliability of SGLP’s revenue stream and the risks SGLP faced from Kivisto’s energy trading.  According to the complaint, SemGroup provided up to 89% of SGLP’s revenues and thus was critical to SGLP’s profitability.  The SEC alleges that SGLP’s filings assured investors that this revenue stream was “stable and predictable” and protected from volatility in oil prices.  The SEC contends, however, that Kivisto’s energy trading increasingly drained SemGroup’s credit facilities and other liquidity sources, jeopardizing its ability to fulfill its commitments to SGLP.  Investors were never warned of these risks, according to the SEC., The SEC alleges that these risks came to a head in July 2008, when SemGroup’s lenders cancelled the credit facility and SemGroup filed bankruptcy.  After these events, the price of SGLP’s publicly traded limited partnership units declined more than 60%.  , Privately held SemGroup, based in Tulsa, bought, transported and sold petroleum products.  It also traded crude oil and related commodities and derivatives.  Kivisto, who helped found the company and served as its CEO and president until its bankruptcy, managed SemGroup’s crude oil trading activities.  , SGLP (now known as Blueknight Energy Partners, L.P.) went public in July 2007.  SGLP primarily owned midstream oil and gas assets such as pipelines and storage facilities.  Kivisto served as a director of SGLP’s general partner from its initial public offering until he resigned in July 2008.  The Commission alleges that Kivisto signed certain misleading filings SGLP made with the SEC, including registration statements SGLP filed in July 2007 and February 2008 and its annual report on Form 10-K filed in March 2008., Without admitting or denying the Commission’s allegations, Kivisto offered to settle by consenting to entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933, ordering him to pay a $225,000 civil penalty, and requiring him to forfeit all claims to 150,000 SGLP units awarded under the company’s long term incentive plan., The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the United States Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Oklahoma and the United States Commodities Futures Trading Commission.,  ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr22129.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

In addition to emergency and interim relief that has been obtained, the SEC seeks a preliminary injunction and a final judgment permanently enjoining the defendants from future violations of the relevant provisions of the federal securities laws and ordering them to pay financial penalties and disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest.  , The case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Michael H.

Welliver and his investment advisory firm, Dblaine Capital, LLC, for fraud and numerous other violations of the federal securities laws in connection with the offer, sale, and management of a mutual fund, the Dblaine Fund.   , The SEC’s complaint alleges that Welliver and Dblaine Capital obtained $4 million in loans pursuant to an improper, undisclosed <i>quid pro quo</i> agreement entered into in breach of their fiduciary duties to the Dblaine Fund.  Specifically, in exchange for the loans, Welliver and Dblaine Capital committed to invest the fund’s assets in certain “alternative investment” securities recommended by the lender.  Welliver and Dblaine Capital then caused the fund to violate various investment restrictions and policies by investing the fund’s assets in a private placement offering that was affiliated with the lender.  The complaint also alleges that Welliver and Dblaine further defrauded the Fund by providing an inaccurate valuation for the private placement holding.  As a result, Welliver and Dblaine Capital caused the fund to offer, sell, and redeem shares at an inflated net asset value.  When Welliver and Dblaine Capital ultimately discovered that the private placement was worthless, they continued their fraud by failing to disclose this to the Fund’s shareholders.  , The complaint also alleges that, in connection with the fraudulent conduct described above, Welliver and Dblaine Capital made false and misleading statements in various reports and filings with the Commission; engaged in certain prohibited affiliated transactions; and aided and abetted the fund’s violations of various provisions of the Investment Company Act of 1940., The SEC complaint alleges that, as a result of their misconduct, Welliver and Dblaine Capital violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Section 206 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder, Sections 17(a)(2), 17(e)(1), 22(e), and 34(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, and Rules 22c-1 and 38a-1 thereunder.   , The SEC is seeking permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, including prejudgment interest, and civil penalties., The staff’s investigation is continuing.,  ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr22131.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

22134,2011,[<h3>Citigroup To Pay $285 Million to Settle SEC Charges For Misleading Investors About CDO Company Profited From Proprietary Short Position Former Citigroup Employee Sued For His Role In Transaction</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) today charged Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (Citigroup), the principal U.S. broker-dealer subsidiary of Citigroup Inc., with misleading investors about a $1 billion collateralized debt obligation (CDO) called Class V Funding III (Class V III). At a time when the U.S. housing market was showing signs of distress, Citigroup structured and marketed Class V III and exercised significant influence over the selection of $500 million of the assets included in the CDO. Citigroup then took a proprietary short position with respect to those $500 million of assets. That short position would provide profits to Citigroup in the event of a downturn in the United States housing market and gave Citigroup economic interests in the Class V III transaction that were adverse to the interests of investors. Citigroup did not disclose to investors the role that it played in the asset selection process or the short position that it took with respect to the assets that it helped select. Without admitting or denying the SECâs allegations, Citigroup has consented to settle the Commissionâs action., The SEC today also brought a litigated civil action against Brian Stoker (Stoker) and instituted settled administrative proceedings against Credit Suisse Asset Alternative Capital, LLC (formerly known as Credit Suisse Alternative Capital, Inc.) (CSAC), Credit Suisse Asset Management, LLC (CSAM), and Samir H. Bhatt (Bhatt), based on their conduct in the Class V III transaction. Stoker was the Citigroup employee primarily responsible for structuring the Class V III transaction. CSAM is the successor in interest to CSAC, which was the collateral manager for the Class V III transaction, and Bhatt was the portfolio manager at CSAC primarily responsible for the Class V III transaction. Without admitting or denying the Commissionâs findings, CSAM, CSAC, and Bhatt have agreed to settle the Commissionâs proceedings., According to the SECs complaints, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (SDNY), in or around October 2006, personnel from Citigroupâs CDO trading and structuring desks had discussions about possibly having the trading desk establish a short position in a specific group of assets by using credit default swaps (CDS) to buy protection on those assets from a CDO that Citigroup would structure and market. Following the institution of discussions with CSAC about having CSAC act as the collateral manager for a proposed CDO transaction, Stoker sent an e-mail to his supervisor in which he stated that he hoped that the transaction would go forward and described the transaction as the Citigroup trading desk headâs âprop trade (donât tell CSAC). CSAC agreed to terms even though they donât get to pick the assets.â, As further set forth in the complaints, Citigroup and CSAC agreed to proceed with the Class V III transaction. During the time when the transaction was being structured, CSAC allowed Citigroup to exercise significant influence over the selection of assets included in the Class V III portfolio. The Class V III transaction marketed primarily through a pitch book and an offering circular. Stoker was primarily responsible for these documents. Both the pitch book and the offering circular included disclosures that CSAC, the collateral manager, had selected the collateral for the Class V III portfolio and that Citigroup would act as the initial CDS counterparty. The disclosures, however, did not provide any information about the extent of Citigroupâs interest in the negative performance of the Class V III collateral or that, by the times when the pitch book and the offering circular were prepared, Citigroup already had short positions in $500 million of the collateral. The pitch book and the offering circular were materially misleading because they failed to disclose that Citigroup had played a substantial role in selecting the assets for Class V III, Citigroup had taken a $500 million short position in the Class V III collateral for its own account, and Citigroupâs short position was comprised of names it had been allowed to select, while Citigroup did not short names that it had no role in selecting. Nothing in the disclosures put investors on notice Citigroup had interests that were adverse to the interests of investors., According to the complaints, the Class V III transaction closed on February 28, 2007. One experienced CDO trader characterized the Class V III portfolio as âdogsh!tâ and âpossibly the best short EVER!â and an experienced collateral manager commented that âthe portfolio is horrible.â On November 7, 2007, a credit rating agency downgraded every tranche of Class V III, and on November 19, 2007, Class V III was declared to be in an Event of Default. The approximately 15 investors in the Class V III transaction lost their entire investments in Class V III. Citigroup received fees of approximately $34 million for structuring and marketing the transaction and realized net profits of at least $160 million from its short position on $500 million of the collateral., As a result of their conduct, the Commission has alleged that Citigroup and Stoker each violated Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissionâs complaint, Citigroup has agreed to settle by consenting to the entry of a final judgment that (i) enjoins it from violating these provisions, (ii) requires it to pay $160 million in disgorgement, plus $30 million in prejudgment interest, and $95 million as a penalty, for a total of $285 million, which will be returned to investors through a Fair Fund distribution, and (iii) requires remedial action by Citigroup in its review and approval of offerings of certain mortgage-related securities. The settlement is subject to Court approval. With respect to Stoker, the SEC is seeking an injunction, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and a civil money penalty., In the related administrative proceedings instituted against CSAM, CSAC, and Bhatt, the SEC found that, as a result of the roles that they played in the asset selection process and the preparation of the pitch book and the offering circular for the Class V III transaction, CSAM and CSAC violated Section 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers Act) and Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act and that Bhatt violated Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act and caused the violations of Section 206(2) of the Advisers Act by CSAC. Without admitting or denying the SECâs findings, CSAM and CSAC consented to the issuance of an order directing each of them to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations, or future violations, of Section 206(2) of the Advisers Act and Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act and requiring them to pay disgorgement of $1 million in fees that it received from the Class V III transaction plus $250,000 in prejudgment interest, and requiring them to pay a penalty of $1,250,000. Without admitting or denying the SECâs findings, Bhatt consented to the issuance of an order directing him to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations, or future violations, of Section 206(2) of the Advisers Act and Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act and suspending him from association with any investment adviser for a period of 6 months., <p align=center># # #, The SEC investigation that led to these enforcement proceedings was conducted by Andrew H.

Drew Clayton Peterson, who was a managing director at a Denver-based investment adviser, then used the inside information to purchase Mariner Energy stock for himself and others., The SEC now alleges that hedge fund manager Drew K. Brownstein who is a longtime friend of Drew Peterson, and the hedge fund advisory firm Brownstein controls, Big 5 Asset Management LLC traded Mariner Energy securities on the basis of inside information Brownstein received from Drew Peterson. Brownstein reaped illicit profits of more than $5 million combined in his own account, the accounts of his relatives, and the accounts of two hedge funds managed by Big 5., According to the SECâs amended complaint, Drew Peterson repeatedly tipped Brownstein about the impending acquisition of Mariner Energy as he learned the information from his father. Brownstein caused two Big 5 hedge funds â the Lion Global Fund LLLP and the Lion Global Master Fund Ltd. â to purchase large quantities of Mariner Energy stock and call option contracts on the basis of the inside information. This was the first time that the Big 5 hedge funds had ever traded Mariner Energy stock or options. Brownstein also purchased thousands of shares of Mariner Energy stock and call option contracts for the accounts of his relatives and for his personal brokerage account. In the days following the announcement of the deal, Brownstein liquidated the positions he had accumulated in Mariner Energy securities., The SECâs amended complaint charges each of the defendants with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint seeks a final judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of the above provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to disgorge their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and ordering them to pay financial penalties. The SEC also seeks to permanently prohibit Clayton Peterson from acting as an officer or director of any publicly registered company.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr22137.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Gupta with insider trading for illegally tipping convicted hedge fund manager Raj Rajaratnam while serving on the boards of Goldman Sachs and Procter &amp; Gamble (P&amp;G). The SEC also filed new insider trading charges against Rajaratnam after first charging him with insider trading in October 2009., According to the SECâs complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan, Gupta illegally tipped Rajaratnam with insider information about the quarterly earnings of both Goldman Sachs and P&amp;G as well as an impending $5 billion investment in Goldman by Berkshire Hathaway at the height of the financial crisis. Rajaratnam, the founder of Galleon Management who was recently convicted of multiple counts of insider trading in other securities stemming from unrelated insider trading schemes, allegedly caused various Galleon funds to trade based on Guptaâs inside information, generating illicit profits or loss avoidance of more than $23 million., The SECâs complaint alleges that Gupta provided his friend and business associate Rajaratnam with confidential information learned during board calls and in other communications and meetings relating to his official duties as a director of Goldman and P&amp;G. Rajaratnam used the inside information to trade on behalf of certain Galleon funds, or shared the information with others at his firm who caused other Galleon funds to trade on it ahead of public announcements by the firms. During this period, Gupta had a variety of business dealings with Rajaratnam and stood to benefit from his relationship with him., According to the SECâs complaint, Gupta while serving as a Goldman board member tipped Rajaratnam about Berkshire Hathawayâs $5 billion investment in Goldman and Goldmanâs upcoming public equity offering before that information was publicly announced on Sept. 23, 2008. Based on this inside information, Rajaratnam arranged for Galleon funds to purchase more than 215,000 Goldman shares. Rajaratnam later informed another participant in the scheme that he received the tip on which he traded only minutes before market close. Rajaratnam caused the Galleon funds to liquidate their Goldman holdings the following day after the information became public, making illicit profits of more than $800,000., The SEC also alleges that Gupta tipped Rajaratnam to inside information about Goldmanâs positive financial results for the second quarter of 2008. There was a flurry of calls between Gupta and Rajaratnam on the evening of June 10, 2008, after Gupta learned from Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein of the firmâs quarterly earnings results, which were significantly better than analyst consensus estimates. The following morning, minutes after the markets opened, Rajaratnam caused Galleon funds to start purchasing Goldman securities including 7,350 out-of-the-money Goldman call options and 350,000 Goldman shares. Rajaratnam liquidated these positions on or around June 17 â the date when Goldman announced its quarterly earnings â generating illicit profits of more than $18.5 million for the Galleon funds., The SECâs complaint further alleges that Gupta tipped Rajaratnam with confidential information that Gupta learned during an Oct. 23, 2008, board posting call about Goldmanâs impending negative financial results for the fourth quarter of 2008. Mere seconds after the board call ended, Gupta tipped Rajaratnam, who then arranged for certain Galleon funds to begin selling their Goldman holdings shortly after the financial markets opened the following day until the funds finished selling off their holdings, which had consisted of more than 150,000 shares. In discussing trading and market information that day with another participant in the insider trading scheme, Rajaratnam explained that while Wall Street expected Goldman to earn $2.50 per share, he heard the prior day from a Goldman board member that the company was actually going to lose $2 per share. As a result of Rajaratnamâs trades based on inside information provided by Gupta, the Galleon funds avoided losses of more than $3.6 million., The SECâs complaint additionally alleges that Gupta illegally disclosed to Rajaratnam inside information about P&amp;Gâs financial results for the quarter ending December 2008. Gupta participated in a telephonic meeting of P&amp;Gâs Audit Committee at 9 a.m. on Jan. 29, 2009, to discuss the planned release of P&amp;Gâs quarterly earnings the next day. A draft of the earnings release, which had been mailed to Gupta and the other committee members two days before the meeting, indicated that P&amp;Gâs expected organic sales would be less than previously publicly predicted. Gupta called Rajaratnam in the early afternoon on January 29, and Rajaratnam shortly afterwards informed another participant in the insider trading scheme that he had learned from a contact on P&amp;Gâs board that the companyâs organic sales growth would be lower than expected. Galleon funds then sold short approximately 180,000 P&amp;G shares, making illicit profits of more than $570,000., The SECâs complaint charges each of the defendants with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933. The complaint seeks a final judgment permanently enjoining the defendants from future violations of the above provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to disgorge on a joint and several basis their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and ordering them to pay financial penalties. The complaint also seeks to permanently prohibit Gupta from acting as an officer or director of any registered public company, and to permanently enjoin him from associating with any broker, dealer or investment adviser., The SEC previously instituted an <a href=/news/press/2011/2011-53.htm>administrative proceeding against Gupta</a><a name=P12_6195></a> for the conduct alleged in todayâs enforcement action, but later <a href=/litigation/admin/2011/33-9249.pdf>dismissed those proceedings</a><a name=P12_6290></a> while reserving the right to file an action against Gupta in federal court., The SEC <a href=/news/press/2009/2009-235.htm>previously charged Rajaratnam</a><a name=P13_6403></a> and others in the widespread insider trading investigation centering on Galleon, the multi-billion dollar New York hedge fund complex founded and controlled by Rajaratnam., The SEC has now charged 29 defendants in its Galleon-related enforcement actions, which have alleged widespread and repeated insider trading at numerous hedge funds, including Galleon, and by other professional traders and corporate insiders in the securities of more than 15 companies.

Kupersmith and Chelly then engaged in illegal free-riding by interchangeably buying and selling the same quantity of the same stock in different accounts - frequently on the same day - with the intention of profiting on swings up or down in the stock price.  Unbeknownst to broker-dealers, Kupersmith and Chelly did not have sufficient securities or cash on hand to cover the trades, and they instead used proceeds from stock sales in one brokerage account to pay for the purchase of the same stock in another brokerage account., The SEC alleges that when trades were profitable, Kupersmith and Chelly took the profits.  But when the trades threatened to result in substantial losses, Kupersmith and Chelly failed to cover their sales and left broker-dealers to settle the trades at a significant loss.  In total, their brokers suffered more than $2 million in losing trades.  , According to the SECs complaint filed in U.S. District Court in New Jersey, Kupersmith and Chelly traded through a special type of cash account that broker-dealers offer to customers with the understanding that the customer has sufficient securities and cash held with a third-party custodial bank to cover the trades that the customer makes in the account.  Kupersmith and Chelly never disclosed to broker-dealers that they were instead using proceeds from sales of shares in one brokerage account to pay for their purchase in another brokerage account.  Kupersmith and Chelly also used offshore accounts to facilitate their trading activity., According to the SECs complaint, the free-riding scheme occurred in 2009 and 2010, and unraveled when Kupersmith and Chelly failed to deliver shares to settle long sales in various brokerage accounts.  , The SECs complaint charges Kupersmith and Chelly with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 10b-5 and 10b-21 thereunder.

Under Graceâs direction, Drake also knowingly or recklessly failed to disclose the hedge fundsâ association with Grace.

Petters sold promissory notes to a number of hedge funds like those controlled by Fry, Palm, and Arrowhead and used some of the note proceeds to pay returns to earlier investors, diverting the rest of the cash to Fryâs own purposes., Among other things, the SECâs complaint alleges that Fry and Palm (individually and through Arrowhead):, The SECs complaint charges Fry, Palm, and Arrowhead, with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and aiding and abetting violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; charges Fry with direct violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; charges Arrowhead LLC with violating Section 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206-4(8) thereunder; and charges Fry and Palm with aiding and abetting violations of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206-4(8) thereunder. The SEC seeks entry of a court order of permanent injunction against Fry, Palm, and Arrowhead, as well as an order of disgorgement, including prejudgment interest and civil penalties.,  Both Fry and Palm have already been charged criminally in connection with the same conduct. On April 8, 2011, Palm pleaded guilty to one count of securities fraud and one count of making false statements to Commission staff during investigative testimony.

22150,2011,[<h3>SEC Seeks Contempt Finding Against Certified Public Accountant Joseph S. Amundsen</h3>],"[On November 9, 2011, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a motion seeking to have Certified Public Accountant Joseph S. Amundsen held in civil contempt of court for violating the terms of an injunction barring him from appearing or practicing before the SEC in any way., Amundsen was barred from appearing or practicing before the SEC in any way as the result of a 1983 SEC action alleging that Amundsen had provided materially false and misleading audit reports to Olympic Oil and Gas, which then included those reports its filings with the SEC. In settling the 1983 suit, Amundsen, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, agreed to be permanently barred from appearing or practicing before the SEC. Amundsen also agreed at that time to be permanently enjoined from violating antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws., According to the SECâs contempt motion filed in federal court in San Francisco, Amundsen violated the terms of the injunction, whose entry he had consented to in February 1983, by repeatedly auditing the financial statements of broker-dealers that were registered with the SEC. Amundsen knew that those broker-dealers would then file those financial statements, including Amundsenâs audit report, with the SEC under Securities Exchange Act Rule 17a-5. The SECâs motion asserts that Amundsenâs audits of broker-dealers violated the terms of the injunction because performing such audits constitutes practicing before the SEC as an accountant., The SECâs motion seeks an order finding that Amundsen has contemptuously violated the 1983 injunction, requiring him to disgorge all ill-gotten gains from violating the injunction, and imposing other equitable relief. The injunction barring Amundsen from appearing or practicing before the Commission in any way remains in effect.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr22150.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"
22151,2011,[<h3>SEC Charges New York-Based Hedge Fund Managers ThinkStrategy Capital and Chetan Kapur with Securities Fraud</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a civil injunctive action charging ThinkStrategy Capital Management, LLC (âThinkStrategyâ) and its sole managing director, Chetan Kapur, with deceptive conduct in connection with two hedge funds that they managed and advised: ThinkStrategy Capital Fund (âCapital Fundâ) and TS Multi-Strategy Fund (âMulti-Strategy Fundâ). The Capital Fund traded primarily equities, while the larger Multi-Strategy Fund holds investments in other hedge funds. At its peak in 2008, ThinkStrategy managed approximately $520 million in assets., The SECâs complaint alleges that over nearly seven years, ThinkStrategy and Kapur engaged in a pattern of deceptive conduct designed to bolster their track record, size, and credentials. In particular, ThinkStrategy and Kapur materially overstated the performance of the Capital Fund, giving investors the false impression that the fundâs returns were consistently positive and minimally volatile. The complaint also alleges that ThinkStrategy and Kapur repeatedly inflated the firmâs assets, exaggerated the firmâs longevity and performance history, and misrepresented the size and credentials of ThinkStrategyâs management team., With respect to the Multi-Strategy Fund, a fund of hedge funds, the complaint alleges that ThinkStrategy and Kapur misstated the scope and quality of due diligence checks on certain managers and funds selected for inclusion in the portfolio. Specifically, the complaint alleges that ThinkStrategy and Kapur told investors that all funds in the portfolio would be selected using a rigorous due diligence process, including having reputable service providers, but instead selected several funds that failed to meet this standard. As a result, the Multi-Strategy Fund made investments in certain hedge funds that were later revealed to be Ponzi schemes or other serious frauds, including Bayou Superfund, Valhalla/Victory Funds, and Finvest Primer Fund. Had ThinkStrategy adhered to its stated due diligence standards, and required audited financial statements certified by bona fide accounting firms, the Multi-Strategy Fund may not have invested detrimentally in those funds., The SECâs complaint, which was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges ThinkStrategy and Kapur with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder. The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement and prejudgment interest thereon, and civil monetary penalties against ThinkStrategy and Kapur., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, ThinkStrategy and Kapur have consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining them from violating the above mentioned provisions, imposing a civil monetary penalty, and ordering them to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in amounts to be determined by the Court upon motion of the Commission. The settlements are subject to Court approval. In addition, Kapur has consented to the entry of an SEC order barring him from association with any investment adviser, broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, transfer agent, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr22151.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"
22152,2011,[<h3><a name=P3_178></a>SEC Charges Philadelphia-Based Business Owner for Defrauding Investors Through an Offering Scheme Involving U.S. Treasury STRIPS</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a Complaint in United States District Court for the Southern District of New York charging Tyrone L. Gilliams and his company TL Gilliams, LLC with fraud for misappropriating approximately $5 million from investors through an offering scheme involving U.S. Treasury STRIPS. According to the SECâs Complaint, Gilliams and TLG, from at least June 2010 through April 2011, claimed, among other things, to have a U.S. Treasury STRIPS Trading Program. According to the Complaint, Gilliams claimed that he would pool and use investor money to engage in large purchases and sales of Treasury STRIPS and that the trading program would yield weekly returns of five percent and was virtually risk-free., U.S. Treasury STRIPS are the individual interest payment components of a United States Treasury bond, payable semi-annually over the life of the bond. These STRIPS are then separately tradeable like other securities. The term STRIPS derives from the program implemented by the Treasury to facilitate this type of trading, entitled âSeparate Trading of Interest and Principal of Securities.â, The Complaint further alleges that contrary to his representations about the Treasury STRIPS Trading Program, Gilliams did not invest any of the funds received from investors in any U.S. Treasury STRIPS, nor in any program that invested in U.S. Treasury STRIPS. Rather, Gilliams used the misappropriated money to support his lavish lifestyle, including expenditures on hotels, nightclubs, airfare, designer apparel, jewelry, luxury car rentals, car payments and private school tuition for his children. In addition, the Complaint alleges, Gilliams caused TLG to spend at least $765,000 to sponsor a so-called celebrity charitable event in Philadelphia that culminated in a star-studded, black-tie gala on December 18, 2010, at the Ritz Carlton in Philadelphia., In February 2011, shortly after misappropriating the $5 million, the Complaint alleges that Gilliams filed paperwork with the Commission indicated TLGâs intent to raise an âindefiniteâ amount of funds from investors in connection with the âBlack Fox Fund,â an unregistered entity created by Gilliams. The Complaint also alleges that Gilliams has made recent efforts to raise money from investors., The Complaint further alleges that Gilliams, the architect of the fraudulent scheme, used a series of middlemen who had access to investors or who controlled investment funds themselves. Gilliams promised the middlemen varying finder fees, and Gilliams paid some of the middlemen from the $5 million he ultimately obtained. Gilliams provided the middlemen and potential investors detailed information about his own experience trading Treasury STRIPS and his purported Treasury STRIPS Trading Program, including information regarding investment minimums, the expected trading frequency, and the expected rate of returns. According to the Complaint, nearly all of this information was false., The SECâs Complaint charges Gilliams and TLG with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement, prejudgment interest and civil monetary penalties., The U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Southern District of New York today filed an indictment charging Gilliams with wire fraud and securities fraud.

Mark Anthony Longoria, et al.</i>, 11-CV-0753 (SDNY) (JSR).  , The SEC filed its Complaint on February 3, 2011, charging two expert network employees and four consultants with insider trading for illegally tipping hedge funds and other investors.  On February 8, 2011, the SEC filed an Amended Complaint, charging a New York-based hedge fund and four hedge fund portfolio managers and analysts who illegally traded on confidential information obtained from technology company employees moonlighting as expert network consultants.  The scheme netted more than $30 million from trades based on material, nonpublic information about such companies as Advanced Micro Devices (“AMD”), Seagate Technology, Western Digital, Fairchild Semiconductor, and Marvell Technology Group Ltd. (“Marvell”).  The charges were the first against traders in the SECs ongoing investigation of insider trading involving expert networks. , The SEC alleged that Longoria, a Supply Chain Manager at AMD, was privy to confidential information about AMD’s internal sales figures for the company’s various operational units.  In addition, in at least 2009, Longoria paid a friend who worked in AMD’s finance department to provide him with “top line” quarterly revenue and profit margin information prior to the company’s release of such information in quarterly financial announcements.  From 2006 to 2010, Longoria regularly provided Primary Global Research LLC (“PGR”) and PGR clients with this inside information so it could be used to trade securities.  Longoria received a total of $178,850 for talking to PGR and its clients.  , The Final Judgment entered against Longoria: (1) permanently enjoins him from violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933; (2) orders him liable for disgorgement of ill-gotten gains of $178,850, together with prejudgment interest of $18,328.94, for a total of $197,178.94; and (3) permanently bars him from acting as an officer or director of a public company.  Based on Longoria’s agreement to cooperate with the SEC, the Commission did not seek a civil penalty. , With respect to Longueuil, the SEC alleged that in May 2008, while Longueil was working as a managing director at Empire Capital Management LLC (“Empire Capital”), Longueuil received material nonpublic information regarding an earnings report about to be issued by Marvell.  Longueuil received this information from co-defendant Noah Freeman, who had received the information from co-defendant Winifred Jiau, a paid consultant at PGR.  Jiau herself had received the information from a Marvell employee.  After receiving the material nonpublic information, Longueuil caused Empire Capital to purchase more than 800,000 shares of Marvell stock.  Days later, when Marvell announced better-than-expected quarterly results, Empire reaped a total of more than $2.5 million in profits., The Final Judgment entered against Longueuil: (1) permanently enjoins him from violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5; and (2) orders him to pay disgorgement in the amount of $250,000, plus prejudgment interest in the amount of $102,832.60, for a total of $352,832.60.  Based on Longueuil’s agreement to cooperate with the SEC, the Commission did not seek a civil penalty.  In addition, on September 27, 2011, the Commission issued an order on consent in a related administrative proceeding that bars Longueuil from association with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, transfer agent, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization.  <a name=P15_4334></a>,  ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr22153.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Battenberg, III, the former Chief Executive Officer of Delphi, and ordered them to pay disgorgement and penalties for federal securities law violations found by a jury. The Court also entered a permanent injunction for fraud and other securities law violations against Free. Delphi is an auto parts manufacturer with headquarters in Troy, Michigan., On January 13, 2011, a jury returned a verdict in favor of the SEC and against Free and Battenberg for violating the federal securities laws. Specifically, the jury found that Battenberg violated the books and records and misrepresentations to accountants provisions of the federal securities laws for his role in the improper accounting for Delphiâs portrayal of $202 million of Delphiâs $237 million warranty settlement with General Motors Corporation (âGMâ) in September 2000 as related to pension and other post-employment benefits. As a result, Delphi filed materially false and misleading financial statements in the companyâs third quarter 2000 quarterly report on Form 10-Q and its fiscal year 2000 annual report on Form 10-K. In addition, the jury found Free liable on fraud and other charges brought by the Commission for his role in Delphiâs false and misleading accounting for two financing transactions at year-end 2000 -- one involving nearly Delphiâs entire inventory of precious metals necessary to the manufacture of catalytic converters, and one involving Delphiâs inventory of generator cores and batteries â which Delphi falsely claimed as inventory sales; as well as Delphiâs false and misleading accounting for a $20 million payment that it received from Electronic Data Systems (âEDSâ) in December 2001 as a rebate (income) rather than as a loan. The jury further found that Free violated the books and records and misrepresentations to accountants provisions of the federal securities laws for his role in the GM warranty transaction.

In addition, the Court found Battenberg liable for violations of Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 promulgated thereunder. The Court ordered Battenberg to disgorge $198,500 in profits and to pay a penalty of $16,500., During the trial, the Commission settled with two individual defendants â Catherine Rozanski, Delphiâs former Director of Financial Accounting and Reporting, and Milan Belans, Delphiâs former Director of Capital Planning, Structured Finance and Pension Analysis. Rozanski consented to the entry of an injunction from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder, and aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and13a-1 thereunder. Rozanski also consented to pay a $40,000 civil money penalty. In settling the Commissionâs claims, Rozanski neither admitted nor denied the Commissionâs allegations. In addition, separately, without admitting or denying the Commissionâs findings, Rozanski consented to the institution of administrative proceedings pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3) of the Commissionâs Rules of Practice, suspending her from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant, with a right to apply for reinstatement after three years, based on the entry of the injunction. The Commissionâs Complaint against Rozanski alleged that as a result of her participation in the EDS $20 million payment transaction, described above, Delphi filed materially false and misleading financial statements in the companyâs 2001 Form 10-K., Moreover, during the trial, Belans consented to the entry of an injunction from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder, and aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder. Belans also consented to pay disgorgement of $17,835, together with prejudgment interest thereon in the amount of $13,865, and a $55,800 civil money penalty. In settling the Commissionâs claims, Belans neither admitted nor denied the Commissionâs allegations. In addition, separately, without admitting or denying the Commissionâs findings, Belans consented to the institution of settled administrative proceedings pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3) of the Commissionâs Rules of Practice, suspending him from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant, with a right to apply for reinstatement after five years, based on the entry of the injunction. The Commissionâs Complaint against Belans alleged that Belans engaged in the GM warranty settlement transaction and the inventory transactions described above, which resulted in Delphi filing materially false and misleading financial statements in the companyâs quarterly report on Form 10-Q for third quarter 2000, and on the companyâs annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2000., The Commission originally filed suit against Delphi and 13 individual defendants on October 30, 2006.

Calmes, Lynn D. Rowntree, and James E. Pratt. Calmes and Rowntree had been principals at First Equity Corporation, a Boca Raton company that took small companies public via reverse mergers. Pratt, a lawyer, provided legal opinions regarding the ability to sell stock in the newly public companies., According to the SECâs Complaint, Calmes, Rowntree, and Pratt, along with co-defendant Manny J.

Benhamou in the SEC’s insider trading case, <i>SEC v. Joseph F. “Chip” Skowron III, et al.</i>, Civil Action No. 10-CV-8266-DAB (S.D.N.Y.).  The SEC charged Benhamou, a French doctor and medical researcher, with unlawfully tipping material, non-public information to Skowron, a former hedge fund portfolio manager, who was charged with using the inside information to trade ahead of a January 23, 2008 negative announcement, helping the hedge funds he managed avoid losses of approximately $30 million. , At the time of the alleged conduct, Skowron managed six health care-related hedge funds affiliated with FrontPoint Partners LLC.  The SEC alleged that Skowron sold hedge fund holdings of Human Genome Sciences Inc. (HGSI) based on tips he received unlawfully from Benhamou, who served on the Steering Committee overseeing HGSI’s clinical trial for Albuferon, a potential drug to treat Hepatitis C.  Benhamou tipped Skowron with material, non-public information about the trial as he learned of negative developments that occurred in December 2007 and January 2008.  In response, Skowron ordered the sale of the entire position in HGSI stock — approximately six million shares held by the six funds.  HGSI announced changes to the trial resulting from the negative developments on January 23, 2008, which led to a 44 percent drop in share price by the end of the day.  The hedge funds avoided losses of approximately $30 million by selling their positions in advance of the news.  The SEC alleged that, at various points in the relationship, including after the illegal HGSI trades were completed, Skowron gave Benhamou envelopes of cash both in appreciation of his work and to induce Benhamou to lie about their communications.  , The final judgments permanently enjoin Skowron and Benhamou from violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.  Skowron was ordered to disgorge $29,017,156 (a joint and several obligation with the relief defendants), plus $1,360,000 (for which he is individually obligated), plus prejudgment interest of $5,142,782, and to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $2,720,000.  Benhamou was ordered to disgorge $52,138, plus prejudgment interest of $8,237.  The six hedge funds, which were named solely as relief defendants, were ordered to disgorge $29,017,156, plus prejudgment interest of $4,003,669; the final judgment against Skowron provides that his disgorgement and prejudgment interest (but not penalty) obligation shall be credited dollar for dollar by amounts the relief defendants are ordered to disgorge and/or by amounts that Skowron is ordered to forfeit in the related criminal action.   , Both Skowron and Benhamou pled guilty in parallel criminal cases before the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, titled <i>United States v.

Laplante of the U.S. District Court in New Hampshire has issued a temporary restraining order that, among other things, freezes the assets of the company and its principal and prohibits them from continuing to solicit or accept investor funds., In its complaint, the SEC alleges that Henry Roche, a Canadian resident, through New Futures Trading International Corporation has been engaged in an ongoing unregistered offering of securities in the United States through operations in New Hampshire and Ontario, Canada.  According to the Complaint, since December 2010  Roche has raised over $1.3 million from at least 14 investors in nine states through the offer and sale of high yield promissory notes purportedly yielding either 5-10% per month, or a 200% return within 14 months.   The Complaint alleges that Roche represented to some investors that funds supplied would be invested in bonds, Treasury notes and/or 10-year Treasury note futures contracts, and to others that the funds would be invested directly in New Futures, an on-line futures day-trading training business Roche was operating from Canada.  According to the complaint, instead of using the funds for either purpose, Roche used approximately $937,000 provided by New Futures investors to make Ponzi “interest” payments to investors in prior Roche-controlled entities.  The Complaint also alleges that Roche misappropriated at least another $359,000 to support his lifestyle, to operate a horse breeding venture, Majestic Horses, and to buy horses.  The Complaint alleges that Roche’s present activity through New Futures appears to be the continuation of an ongoing investment scheme Roche has been operating over the past three years under a series of entity names, including Masters Palace, Inc., and Third Realm Institute (a/k/a Third Realm, Inc.)., The Commission’s complaint charges Roche and New Futures Trading International Corporation with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  , The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Ontario Securities Commission and the New Hampshire Bureau of Securities in this matter. ,  ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr22159.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Judge Kevin Castel of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York has issued a temporary restraining order that, among other things, freezes the assets of multiple defendants and relief defendants. , According to the Commission’s complaint, Florida resident John A. Mattera and several other individuals carried out the fraud using a newly-minted hedge fund named The Praetorian Global Fund.  They falsely claimed that the fund and affiliated Praetorian entities owned shares worth tens of millions of dollars in privately-held companies that were expected to soon hold an initial public offering, including Facebook, Groupon, and others.  Mattera and others solicited investments by, among other things, telling investors that their funds would be safely held in escrow accounts.  , In reality, according to the SEC’s complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan, Mattera and his confederates never owned the promised pre-IPO shares in these companies.  The purported escrow service, headed by defendant John R. Arnold of Florida, merely transferred investor funds to personal accounts controlled by Mattera and Arnold.  After Arnold took a cut of the money for himself, he released the money to entities controlled by Mattera, who misappropriated investors’ funds for private jets, luxury cars, fine art, jewelry, and other personal uses. Mattera also transferred money to his mother Ann Mattera and his wife Lan Phan.

The Commission’s complaint alleges that Konyndyk, a former manager in the Transaction Advisory Services Group of Ernst &amp; Young (“E&amp;Y”), learned through his work at E&amp;Y that Activision, Inc. was the target of highly confidential acquisition talks, code-named “Project Sego,” in which Vivendi S.A. was the potential acquirer.  In particular, Konyndyk performed due-diligence work on Project Sego for E&amp;Y’s client, Vivendi, billing 36 hours to the engagement.  Both before and shortly after his departure from E&amp;Y’s employ on November 2, 2007, including just days before the December 2, 2007, public announcement of the Vivendi-Activision merger, Konyndyk bought Activision out-of-the-money call options with near-term expirations.  He sold the options shortly after the public announcement, earning gross profits of $9,725., Without admitting or denying the allegations, Konyndyk has agreed to settle the Commission’s allegations against him, and the complaint and settlement papers were submitted simultaneously to the Court for its consideration.  In particular, Konyndyk signed a consent that provides—subject to approval by the Court—for the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him against future violations of the Section 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 14e-3 thereunder.  The final judgment to which Konyndyk consented would further order that he is liable for disgorgement of $9,725 (comprising all the profits flowing from his own illegal trading) plus $1,789.28 in prejudgment interest thereon as well as a $9,725 civil penalty, but allow him one year to pay the foregoing sums.

Taylor lured primarily middle-class residents in his community with little to no investing experience to invest in promissory notes issued by his two companies that engaged in purportedly low-risk options trading.  Taylor urged investors to refinance their homes and use any available means to invest, including their personal savings and retirement funds.  The SEC alleges that he promised returns as high as 20 percent per year and falsely assured investors that their investments would be protected by a “reserve account” or that he would employ a “covered call” trading strategy that would not touch the principal amount of their investment.  , According to the SEC’s complaint filed in federal court in Washington D.C., Taylor and his companies instead engaged in very high-risk, speculative options trading and suffered massive losses.  Taylor relied upon money from new investors to pay returns to earlier investors in typical Ponzi scheme fashion.  The SEC’s complaint also alleges that he siphoned off $5 million in investor funds to pay family and friends and for other personal uses, including $73,000 to the private school his children attended., The SEC alleges that the Ponzi scheme defrauded more than $27 million from approximately 130 investors from 2005 to 2010.  The scheme ultimately collapsed in the fall of 2010 when the companies’ accounts were depleted by the trading losses and interest payments to investors., The SEC’s complaint charged Taylor’s companies Garfield Taylor Inc. and Gibraltar Asset Management Group LLC – which were not registered with the SEC – as well as five collaborators in Taylor’s scheme:, According to the SEC’s complaint, Garfield Taylor and the others jointly prepared and finalized a Gibraltar PowerPoint presentation for prospective investors that was riddled with false and misleading statements.  They misrepresented the nature of the company’s options trading strategy, the anticipated rate of return, the protections offered by its outside accountant, and the overall level of risk involved in an investment with Gibraltar.  They pitched the PowerPoint presentation to potential institutional investors and charitable organizations, including a Washington D.C.-based children’s charity and a Baptist church in Maryland.  Garfield Taylor went so far as to provide the Baptist church with a fake “letter of recommendation” from Charles Schwab as he pitched the investment opportunity.  , The SEC alleges that in order to maintain a steady flow of new investor money, Garfield Taylor induced current investors and others including King and Mitchell to solicit and refer new investors to him in exchange for commission payments based on the amounts invested.  Garfield Taylor, who was not a licensed securities broker, persuaded several individuals to give him online access to their personal brokerage accounts so he could place trades and share in any profits generated.  , The SEC’s complaint charges Garfield Taylor, Inc., Gibraltar Asset Management Group LLC, Garfield Taylor, Dalley, King, and Randolph Taylor with violations of Sections 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”).  The SEC’s complaint also charges those defendants and Maurice Taylor with violating or aiding and abetting violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.   It also alleges that Garfield Taylor violated Sections 206(1), (2) and (4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.  The SEC’s complaint also charges Garfield Taylor, Inc., Gibraltar Asset Management Group, LLC, and Garfield Taylor with violations of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act.

Merk was an Executive Vice President at Charles Schwab &amp; Co., Inc., President of Charles Schwab Investment Management, and a Trustee of the Schwab YieldPlus Fund and other Schwab funds., In January 2011, the Commission filed a complaint alleging that Merk and another official committed securities law violations in connection with the offer, sale, and management of the YieldPlus Fund. YieldPlus is an ultra-short bond fund that, at its peak in 2007, had $13.5 billion in assets and over 200,000 accounts, making it the largest ultra-short bond fund at the time. The fund suffered a significant decline during the credit crisis of 2007-2008 and saw its assets fall from $13.5 billion to $1.8 billion during an eight-month period., According to the complaint, Merk misled or failed to inform investors adequately about the risks of investing in YieldPlus. The complaint also alleged that Merk approved other Schwab fundsâ redemptions of their investments in YieldPlus at a time when he knew or was reckless in not knowing that a portfolio manager for those funds had received material, nonpublic information about YieldPlus without the authorization of the YieldPlus Fundâs board of trustees., On November 21, 2011, the SEC filed a consent signed by Merk and a proposed final judgment against him. Without admitting or denying the Commissionâs allegations, Merk consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from aiding and abetting violations of, or otherwise violating, Sections 206(2) and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder. The proposed final judgment also would enjoin Merk from future violations of Section 34(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, which prohibits the making of untrue statements of material fact, or material omissions, in documents filed with the Commission. Merk also agreed to pay a $150,000 civil penalty, which the Commission is seeking to have included in an existing Fair Fund for distribution to injured YieldPlus investors. The proposed judgment is subject to the Courtâs approval., If the Court enters the injunction, Merk also has agreed to settlement of a yet-to-be instituted administrative proceeding in which the Commission would suspend Merk for 12 months from associating with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, transfer agent, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization, and from participating in any penny stock offering., The Commission previously entered into a $118 million settlement with three Schwab entities regarding the YieldPlus Fund and another bond fund.

Madoff Investment Securities LLC (BMIS) for nearly four decades, was asked by Madoff to provide the firmâs investment advisory operations with backdated arbitrage trade information to be formulated into fictitious trading on investorsâ account statements. Kugelâs own account at BMIS was among those in which backdated trades were entered, and he withdrew nearly $10 million in âprofitsâ from the fictitious trading over several years., The SEC previously charged two other longtime Madoff employees Annette Bongiorno and JoAnn Crupi for their roles in producing phony account statements that were sent to Madoff investors. According to the SECâs complaint against Kugel filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Bongiorno and Crupi and other staff in Madoffâs investment advisory (IA) operations used the information provided by Kugel to formulate fictitious trades to appear on investor account statements., The SEC alleges that sometime in the early 1970s after Kugel began his career with Madoff as an arbitrage trader in the firmâs proprietary trading business, Madoff informed Kugel that BMIS managed money for outside clients. He asked Kugel to provide the firmâs IA operations with backdated convertible arbitrage trades for inclusion on investor account statements. Some of these trades replicated successful trades that Kugel had actually made for BMIS proprietary trading operations. Other trades were based on historical information that Kugel obtained from old newspapers., According to the SECâs complaint, Bongiorno and Crupi regularly asked Kugel for backdated information about trades amounting to millions of dollars. After Kugel provided the information, Crupi and Bongiorno would then design trades that totaled that amount. These fictitious trades were highly profitable on an annualized basis, and appeared on account statements and trade confirmations sent to investors. Kugel, who opened his own BMIS account, received these account statements and trade confirmations as well., The SEC alleges that Kugel provided backdated trade information for IA accounts, including his own. He withdrew the purported âprofitsâ of these trades even though he knew they werenât proceeds of actual trading activity. One trade in S&amp;P index options in 2007 earned Kugel a profit of more than $375,000 in just a few weeks. Kugel withdrew almost $10 million from his BMIS IA accounts from 2001 to 2008., The U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Southern District of New York has filed parallel criminal charges against Kugel, who has pled guilty and also agreed to settle the SECâs civil charges. Subject to court approval, the civil case will result in a permanent injunction against Kugel, who must forfeit his ill-gotten monetary gains upon entry of a criminal forfeiture order in the criminal case., The SECâs complaint against Kugel alleges that by engaging in this conduct, Kugel violated and aided and abetted violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; aided and abetted violations of Sections 204, 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 204-2 thereunder, and Sections 15(c) and 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-3 and 17a-3 thereunder., The SECâs investigation was conducted by Kristine M.

Without admitting or denying the Commissionâs allegations, Neufeld and Paridon consented to the entry of the final judgment which imposed a $75,000 civil penalty against Neufeld., Previously, on April 27, 2011, the Court permanently enjoined Neufeld and Paridon from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), 206(3), and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.

Neufeld and Paridon allegedly lied about the fundâs assets under management and reported inflated returns that were not based on actual trading. They also used fictitious returns to lure investors into the TCM Fund. The complaint also alleges that Neufeld and Paridon caused the fund to use a significant portion of its investor money to buy âdebt securitiesâ issued by Paridon. Although called debt securities, this investment was in reality a loan from the fund to Paridon. The debt securities were also not permitted investments for the fund, were not disclosed and consented to by the fund, and were improperly marked up by Neufeld and Paridon to offset and hide significant trading losses., For additional information, see SEC Litigation Release No. 21497 (April 21, 2010),  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr22172.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

(“Soyo”), a now defunct California-based consumer electronics and computer parts company. , The Commission’s civil injunctive complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California on November 29, 2011, alleges that between January 2007 and November 2008, Soyo, through the actions of its chief financial officer, Nancy Shao Wen Chu, and members of her accounting staff, Elizabeth Tsang and Eric Jon Strasser, misled Soyo’s investors, primary lending bank, and auditor by materially overstating Soyo’s net revenues and understating its liabilities. According to the complaint, Chu and Tsang caused Soyo to book over $47 million in fraudulent sales revenues arising from at least 120 fictitious transactions with 21 customers, resulting in Soyo materially overstating its net revenues in its periodic filings by amounts ranging from 14.4 to 76.8 percent. The complaint also alleges that in order to obtain additional bank financing for Soyo and keep its existing line of credit from defaulting, Chu misled Soyo’s investors, primary lending bank, and auditor regarding a $6 million debt-for-equity transaction with a Soyo vendor that was never completed. The complaint further alleges that Strasser, a consultant who prepared Soyo’s filings with the Commission, was alerted to the falsity of the debt-for-equity transaction disclosures, but he failed to correct the misstatements or inform Soyo’s auditor prior to the next quarter’s filing., The Commission’s complaint alleges that, as a result of their conduct, Chu and Tsang violated, and unless enjoined, will continue to violate, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and that Strasser aided and abetted an antifraud violation.

The Court found that Dalton routinely provided investors with false and materially misleading information about investments contracts known as the Trading Program and the Diamond Program.  The Court stated that Dalton told investors they would receive  annual profits ranging from 48% to 120% when, in fact, he was operating a Ponzi scheme, with new investors providing the funds for UCR’s profit payments to existing investors.  The Court held that Dalton misappropriated investors’ funds and used at least $2.5 million for his personal benefit or for the benefit of family members.   , According to the Commission’s complaint, Dalton raised approximately $17 million from 130 investors in 13 states.  Dalton told investors in the Trading Program that their money would be held in an escrow account in a U.S. bank, and that a European trader would use the value of that account to obtain leveraged funds to purchase and sell bank notes.  The Diamond Program supposedly generated profits from the trading of cut and uncut diamonds.  , The Court permanently enjoined Dalton and UCR from violating Sections 5 and  17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Dalton from violating Exchange Act Section 15(a). , The Court also entered a judgment on December 1, 2011 against Marie Dalton, who was named as a relief defendant in the Commission’s complaint.

The defendants named in the Commissions complaint are Michael Balboa, the Funds former portfolio manager, and Gilles De Charsonville, a broker with BCP Securities, LLC., The SECs complaint alleges that from January through October 2008, Balboa surreptitiously provided De Charsonville and another broker with fictional prices for them to pass on to the Funds outside valuation agent and its auditor.  Specifically, Balboa had De Charsonville and the other broker portray the valuations for two of the Funds illiquid securities holdings, Nigerian and Uruguayan warrants, as ostensibly independent month-end marks that were provided by third-party sources.  In fact, Balboa completely fabricated the prices which De Charsonville and the other broker were complicit in passing onto the valuation agent and auditor for these two securities.  This scheme caused the Fund to drastically overvalue these two securities holdings by as much as $163 million in August 2008, which, in turn, allowed the Fund to report inflated and false-positive monthly returns.  By overstating the Funds returns and overall net asset value, Balboa was able to attract at least $410 million in new investments, deter about $230 million in eligible redemptions and generate millions of dollars in inflated management and performance fees., The SECs complaint charges the defendants with committing and/or aiding and abetting violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Section 206 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder and, as to Balboa, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.

The Commission filed civil charges of securities fraud against ZipGlobal Holdings, Inc.; Microholdings US, Inc.; Michael Lee of Hingham, MA; James Wheeler of Camas, WA; Paul Desjourdy of Medfield, MA; and Edward Henderson of Lincoln, Rhode Island and alleging they used kickbacks to engage in fraudulent activity involving microcap stocks. , The criminal case charged 13 defendants who engaged in criminal activity in the midst of an undercover FBI operation.  According to the charges filed in U.S. District Court, the schemes involved secret kickbacks to an investment fund representative in exchange for having the investment fund buy stock in certain companies; the kickbacks were to be concealed through the use of sham consulting agreements.  What the insiders and promoters did not know was that the purported investment fund representative was actually an undercover agent. , The charges follow a year-long investigation focusing on preventing fraud in the micro-cap stock markets.  Microcap companies are small publicly traded companies whose stock often trades at pennies per share.  Fraud in the microcap stock markets is of increasing concern to regulators as such markets have proven to be fertile grounds for fraud and abuse.  This is, in part, because accurate information about microcap stocks may be difficult for the average investor to find, since many microcap companies do not file financial reports with the Commission., The Commissions complaint charges the defendants with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.

22180,2011,[<h3>SEC FREEZES ASSETS OF FOUR CHINESE CITIZENS CHARGED WITH INSIDER TRADING</h3>],"[On December 5, 2011, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged four Chinese citizens and a Chinese-based entity with insider trading and obtained an emergency court order to freeze their assets after they reaped more than $2.7 million in profits by trading in advance of a recent public announcement of a merger agreement between London-based Pearson plc and Beijing-based Global Education and Technology Group, Ltd. , The SEC’s complaint names Sha Chen, Song Li, Lili Wang, Zhi Yao, All Know Holdings Ltd., and one or more unknown purchasers of Global Education stock as defendants. The SEC alleges that they purchased American Depository Shares (ADS) of Global Education in the two weeks leading up to a November 21 public announcement of a planned merger between the two education companies. Some of the defendants’ brokerage accounts were dormant until they bet heavily on Global Education shares, and some of the purchases made either equaled or exceeded the stated annual income of that trader. After the agreement was announced, they immediately began selling some of their Global Education shares. Their illicit gains totaled more than $2.7 million., According to the SEC’s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court in Chicago, Pearson and Global Education each announced before trading began on November 21 that Pearson agreed to acquire all of Global Education’s outstanding stock for $294 million ($11.006 per share traded in the U.S.). Global Education’s stock price increased 97 percent that day, from $5.37 to $10.60. , The SEC alleges that the defendants made their purchases of Global Education’s shares while in possession of material, non-public information about the merger. A Global Education co-founder apparently tipped Wang and possibly others about the potential acquisition. Wang then transferred new funds into her previously dormant brokerage account and bought 28,000 Global Education shares. The others also engaged in similarly suspicious trading in Global Education stock, which was typically thin. On November 18, the last trading day before the acquisition announcement, their purchases accounted for more than 35 percent of the entire day’s trading volume for the company’s shares, which trade on the NASDAQ. , The SEC alleges that the defendants each violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. In addition to the emergency relief, the SEC seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and financial penalties. The emergency court order that the SEC obtained on December 5 on an ex parte basis freezes approximately $2.7 million of defendants’ assets held in U.S. brokerage accounts and, among other things, grants expedited discovery and prohibits the defendants from destroying evidence. The investigation is continuing. ,  A hearing on the SEC’s motion for preliminary injunction has been set for December 15, 2011 at 9:45 a.m. in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Courtroom 1719, located at 219 South Dearborn Street, Chicago, Illinois, 60604.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr22180.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"
22181,2011,[<h3>SEC HALTS PRIME BANK SCHEME OPERATED BY D.C. LAW FIRM AND PENNSYLVANIA COMPANY</h3>],"[ On November 30, 2011, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed an enforcement action under seal in federal court in Washington D.C. and obtained an emergency court order to halt a prime bank scheme that defrauded at least 13 investors out of more than $2 million since August 2010. The Court unsealed the action on December 5, 2011, at the SEC’s request. ,  The SEC’s complaint alleges that Pennsylvania resident Frank L. Pavlico III and Washington D.C. attorney Brynee K. Baylor operated a prime bank scheme, offering investors risk-free returns of up to 20 times the original investment within as few as 45 days through the purported “lease” and “trading” of foreign bank instruments, including “standby letters of credit” and “bank guarantees,” in highly complex transactions with unidentified parties and secretive “trading platforms.” However, the bank instruments and trading programs were entirely fictitious. Pavlico and Baylor provided investors with phony contracts and legal documents, digitally-created computer screen shots, and copies of fictitious foreign bank instruments as purported proof of the ongoing success of the transactions. Baylor and her law firm Baylor &amp; Jackson P.L.L.C. acted as “counsel” for Pavlico’s company The Milan Group, vouching for Pavlico and acting as an escrow agent that in reality was merely receiving and diverting the majority of investor funds. ,  According to the SEC complaint, Pavlico and Baylor lured investors into believing they were being given an exclusive chance to participate in an international investing program involving complex financial instruments that generated astronomical profits. They used vague and complex terms in their communications to confuse investors, and claimed that confidentiality concerns prevented them from providing more complete details regarding the status of the investment. Pavlico and Baylor also provided investors with bogus excuses attempting to explain the delay in providing the promised returns, such as feigned illnesses and false representations that the European bankers supposedly involved in the transaction were on extended vacation. ,  In furtherance of the scheme, the complaint alleges that Baylor provided investors with “attorney attestation” letters that assured them the investments were legitimate, and investor contracts that promised investment profits would be shared among investors, Milan, and Baylor &amp; Jackson. Meanwhile, Pavlico was using a fake name of “Frank Lorenzo” to conceal his 2008 money laundering conviction from investors. He failed to disclose that he served 10 months in prison and was on supervised release at the time he was soliciting their investments. ,  According to the SEC’s complaint, Pavlico and Baylor used investor funds to pay Baylor &amp; Jackson business expenses as well as personal expenditures. Pavlico purchased a Range Rover and a Jaguar, and Baylor made purchases at expensive restaurants and retailers including Jimmy Choo, and financed a trip to the Bahamas in September 2010. Investor funds also were used to make payments to nine individuals and entities – including Baylor’s law partner Dawn R. Jackson – named as relief defendants in the SEC’s complaint for the purpose of recovering funds unrightfully in their possession. ,  None of the defendants charged in the SEC’s enforcement action has ever registered with the SEC to sell securities. ,  On November 30, 2011, the Honorable Rosemary M. Collyer granted the SEC’s request for a temporary restraining order to prevent Pavlico, Milan, Baylor, and Baylor &amp; Jackson from further engaging in the alleged investment program. The Court also granted the SEC’s request for an order freezing the assets of all the defendants and relief defendants, requiring accountings, prohibiting the destruction or alteration of documents, and allowing for expedited discovery. ,  The SEC’s complaint alleges that Pavlico, Baylor, Milan, and Baylor &amp; Jackson violated various antifraud, broker-dealer, and securities registration provisions of the federal securities laws. Specifically, the complaint alleges that they each violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; that Pavlico, Baylor, and Baylor &amp; Jackson aided and abetted violations of Securities Act Section 17(a) and Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5; that Baylor and Baylor &amp; Jackson aided and abetted violations of Securities Act Sections 5(a) and 5(c); and that Pavlico and Baylor also violated Exchange Act Section 15(a). The SEC seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest thereon, and civil penalties against each defendant, and bars prohibiting Pavlico and Baylor from serving as an officer or director of a public company. ,  Separately, the Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested Pavlico on November 29, 2011, charging him with wire fraud. ,  The SEC’s complaint alleges that the defendants in this matter offered fictitious investments involving so-called bank guarantees, “stand-by letters of credit,” or foreign “trading platforms,” among other purported investment vehicles.

(“Dolphin”), Robert Mouallem, a registered representative, and Malcolm Stockdale, a Dolphin shareholder, with engaging in a fraudulent broker bribery scheme designed to manipulate the market for Dolphin’s common stock.  Baldassarre, age 53 and a resident of Indialantic, Florida, was Dolphin’s President from May 15, 2007 until March 20, 2009, and Dolphin’s CEO from May 15, 2007 until June 25, 2008.  Mouallem, age 56 and a resident of Boca Raton, Florida, is a registered representative at Garden State Securities, Inc., a registered broker-dealer.  Stockdale, age 66 and a resident of Prince Edward Island, Canada, is the owner of Winterman Group Ltd., a Canadian limited liability company. , The complaint, filed today in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, alleges that from at least October 2009 until April 2010, Baldassarre, Stockdale, and Mouallem engaged in a fraudulent scheme to manipulate the market for Dolphin stock through matched trades and by bribing registered representatives to purchase Dolphin stock.  The complaint also alleged that Baldassarre and Stockdale entered into a kickback arrangement with an individual (“Individual A”) who claimed to represent a group of registered representatives with trading discretion over the accounts of wealthy customers.  Baldassarre and Stockdale promised to pay a 30% kickback to Individual A and the registered representatives he represented in exchange for the purchase of up to seven million shares of Dolphin stock for at least $3 million., The complaint further alleges that between March 31 and April 6, 2010, and in accordance with the illicit arrangement, Mouallem, who was responsible for handling the sales, instructed Individual A to purchase approximately 105,000 shares of Baldassarre and Stockdale’s Dolphin stock for a total of approximately $38,100. Mouallem gave Individual A detailed instructions concerning the size, price and timing of the orders.  In this way, Mouallem was able to insure that almost all of Individual A’s purchase orders were matched with Mouallem’s sell orders at prices Mouallem predetermined.  Thereafter, Baldassarre paid Individual A bribes of approximately $11,440 for those purchases.    , The complaint charges Baldassarre, Mouallem, and Stockdale with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.  The Commission seeks permanent injunctive relief from the Defendants, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, if any, plus pre-judgment interest, civil penalties, penny stock bars, and a judgment prohibiting Baldassarre from serving as an officer or director of a public company.   , The Commission acknowledges assistance provided by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter.  ,  ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr22182.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"
22183,2011,[<h3>SEC Charges Wachovia with Fraudulent Bidding Rigging in Municipal Bond Proceeds</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Wachovia Bank N.A. with fraudulently engaging in secret arrangements with bidding agents to improperly win business from municipalities and guarantee itself profits in the reinvestment of municipal bond proceeds., The SEC alleges that Wachovia generated millions of dollars in illicit gains during an eight-year period when it fraudulently rigged at least 58 municipal bond reinvestment transactions in 25 states and Puerto Rico. Wachovia won some bids through a practice known as “last looks” in which it obtained information from the bidding agents about competing bids.  It also won bids through “set-ups” in which the bidding agent deliberately obtained non-winning bids from other providers in order to rig the field in Wachovia’s favor.  Wachovia also facilitated some bids rigged for others to win by deliberately submitting non-winning bids., Wachovia agreed to settle the charges by paying $46 million to the SEC that will be returned to affected municipalities or conduit borrowers. Wachovia also entered into agreements with the Justice Department, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Internal Revenue Service, and 26 state attorneys general that include the payment of an additional $102 million. The settlements arise out of long-standing parallel investigations into widespread corruption in the municipal securities reinvestment industry in which 18 individuals have been criminally charged by the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division., Wachovia Bank is now Wells Fargo Bank following a merger in March 2010., When municipal securities are sold to investors, portions of the proceeds often are not spent immediately by municipalities but rather temporarily invested in municipal reinvestment products until the money is used for the intended purposes.  These products are typically financial instruments tailored to meet municipalities’ specific collateral and spend-down needs, such as guaranteed investment contracts (GICs), repurchase agreements (repos), and forward purchase agreements (FPAs).  The proceeds of tax-exempt municipal securities generally must be invested at fair market value, and the most common way of establishing that is through a competitive bidding process in which bidding agents search for the appropriate investment vehicle for a municipality., According to the SEC’s complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, Wachovia engaged in fraudulent bidding of GICs, repos, and FPAs from at least 1997 to 2005.  Wachovia’s fraudulent practices and misrepresentations not only undermined the competitive bidding process, but negatively affected the prices that municipalities paid for reinvestment products.  Wachovia deprived certain municipalities from a conclusive presumption that the reinvestment instruments had been purchased at fair market value, and jeopardized the tax-exempt status of billions of dollars in municipal securities because the supposed competitive bidding process that establishes the fair market value of the investment was corrupted. , Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC’s complaint, Wachovia has consented to the entry of a final judgment enjoining it from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and has agreed to pay a penalty of $25 million and disgorgement of $13,802,984 with prejudgment interest of $7,275,607. The settlement is subject to court approval., Four financial institutions have so far paid a total of $673 million in the ongoing investigations into corruption in the municipal reinvestment industry.  Other financial institutions that the SEC has previously charged are: <a href=/news/press/2011/2011-143.htm target=_top>J.P.

22191,2011,[<h3>SEC Charges Three Individuals in Chicago-Area Offering Fraud</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action alleging fraud in the unregistered offer and sale of securities by Defendants Marcin Malarz (âMalarzâ), Jacek Sienkiewicz (âSienkiewiczâ), and Arthur Lin (âLinâ) (collectively, âDefendantsâ). The SECâs complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, alleges that from at least September 2006 through at least January 2009, Malarz, Sienkiewicz, and Lin raised at least $14,380,000 from at least 43 investors through the fraudulent unregistered offer and sale of promissory notes issued by entities owned and controlled by Malarz and/or Sienkiewicz. Malarz Equity Investments, LLC (âMalarz Equityâ) was the primary entity through which the scheme was perpetrated. Malarz and Linâs wife, Relief Defendant Gloria Lin, were the members of Malarz Equity, and Lin was an officer of Malarz Equity. Malarz, with Sienkiewicz, also used four other entities, Invision Investment, LLC, Burton Grove Condominiums, LLC, Buffalo Creek Condominiums, LLC, and Willow Lake Condominiums, LLC, to carry out the scheme., The complaint alleges that investors were told that their funds would be used to purchase apartment complexes and rehabilitate and convert the individual apartment units for sale as condominiums, and that their investments were safe because they were personally guaranteed by Malarz and, in some cases, Sienkiewicz. The complaint alleges that contrary to these representations, Malarz used substantial sums of the Malarz Equity investorsâ funds for his personal benefit and to make ponzi-type âinterestâ and principal payments to previous investors. Further, Lin received at least $436,000 in undisclosed commission payments, which were transmitted to Relief Defendant Gloria Lin. The complaint further alleges that Malarz and Sienkiewicz provided several investors with personal financial statements that materially overstated their respective net worths. It also alleges that Malarz and Sienkiewicz granted some investors mortgages on properties that they either owned or were about to acquire, to purportedly secure the investments. Most of these investors were falsely told that their particular mortgage would have priority over all other debts, except for the mortgages that had previously been granted to banks in conjunction with the propertyâs purchase. At least two investors were told that their funds would be used as part of a down payment on a new apartment complex in Lombard, Illinois, but Malarz and Sienkiewicz never purchased that property., The SECâs complaint charges Malarz, Sienkiewicz, and Lin with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 (âSecurities Actâ) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ) and Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder, and charges Lin only with violating Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act.

In addition to the asset freeze, the court has appointed a receiver to preserve and marshal assets for the benefit of investors. ,  The complaint alleges that Wendell Jacobson and his son Allen Jacobson operate from a base in Fountain Green, Utah, and offer investors the opportunity to invest in limited liability companies (LLCs) in order to share ownership of large apartment communities in eight states.  It is alleged that the Jacobsons have been soliciting investors personally and through word of mouth and appear to be using their memberships in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints to make connections and win over the trust of prospective investors.  The complaint further alleges the Jacobsons have been representing that they buy apartment complexes with low occupancy rates at significantly discounted prices, renovate the properties, improve their management, and aim to resell them within five years.  Investors are promised they will share in the profits derived from rental income at the apartment complexes as well as the eventual sales.  However, it is alleged that in reality the LLCs are suffering significant losses and the Jacobsons are merely pooling the money raised from investors into large bank accounts from which they are siphoning money to pay family expenses and the operating expenses of their various companies.  They also are allegedly paying earlier investors with funds received from new investors in classic Ponzi scheme fashion. ,  The Commission’s complaint charges Management Solutions and the Jacobsons with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and charges the Jacobsons with violations of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act.

In another related SEC administrative proceeding, Koppel consented to the entry of an SEC order permanently barring him from association with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, transfer agent, or national recognized statistical rating organization.  , According the Commission’s complaint, filed on February 11, 2004, beginning in December 2001, Awan, Koppel, Khurram Tanwir, Alan Labineri, and Joseph Favata, along with three entity defendants, fraudulently raised more than $2 million from investors through three offerings:  (1) the sale of purported private placement shares of OCC Holdings; (2) the sale of promissory notes issued by MB Holdings and other entities; and (3) the purported sale of restricted shares of an unrelated, privately owned company.  The offerings were orchestrated by, and/or for the benefit of, Tanwir and/or Labineri, who had allegedly been conducting fraudulent offerings together since at least 1999.  In conducting the offerings, the defendants allegedly made false and misleading promises of imminent initial public offerings (“IPOs”) and/or substantial increases in the stock price; falsely represented that the promissory notes were guaranteed and risk-free; misappropriated and used investor funds for personal expenses; and failed to disclose their disciplinary history.  , In March and April, 2004, the Commission obtained emergency relief, including temporary restraining orders, orders freezing the assets of almost all of the defendants and relief defendants, and expedited discovery., On December 3, 2008, following the granting of the Commission’s motion for summary judgment, final judgments were entered against Tanwir and Labineri in which they were permanently enjoined from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, barred from participating in the offering of any penny stock and ordered, respectively, to pay $4,660,641.87 in disgorgement plus prejudgment interest and $3,432,739 in civil penalty (Tanwir) and $2,751,710.69 in disgorgement plus prejudgment interest and $2,026,739 in civil penalty (Labineri). , On February 20, 2009, the Commission obtained default judgments against defendants OCC Holdings, MB Holdings, and Equity Services Associates and relief defendants, Off World Strategic Holdings and MB Holdings USA Division A, Inc., in which the defendants were permanently enjoined from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and MB Holdings and Equity Services Associates were permanently barred from participating in the offering of any penny stock.

22201,2011,"[<h3>SEC CHARGES FORMER FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC EXECUTIVES WITH SECURITIES FRAUD</h3>, <h3>FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC AGREE TO COOPERATE IN SEC ACTIONS</h3>, <h3> Fannie Mae </h3>, <h3> Freddie Mac </h3>, <h3> Mudd, Dallavecchia and Lund </h3>, <h3> Syron, Cook and Bisenius </h3>]","[ The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Friday, December 16, 2011, charged six former top executives of the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) with securities fraud, alleging they knew and approved of misleading statements claiming the companies had minimal holdings of higher-risk mortgage loans, including subprime loans. ,  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac each entered into a Non-Prosecution Agreement with the Commission in which each company agreed to accept responsibility for its conduct and not dispute, contest, or contradict the contents of an agreed-upon Statement of Facts without admitting nor denying liability. Each also agreed to cooperate with the Commission’s litigation against the former executives. In entering into these Agreements, the Commission considered the unique circumstances presented by the companies’ current status, including the financial support provided to the companies by the U.S. Treasury, the role of the Federal Housing Finance Agency as conservator of each company, and the costs that may be imposed on U.S. taxpayers. ,  In the complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (S.D.N.Y.), the SEC alleges that Fannie Mae and three former executives of Fannie Mae, Daniel Mudd, former CEO, Enrico Dallavecchia, former CRO, and Thomas Lund, former EVP of the Single Family business made or substantially assisted others in making materially false and misleading statements regarding Fannie Mae’s exposure to subprime and Alt-A loans. ,  For instance, in February 2007, Fannie Mae for the first time disclosed its subprime exposure and claimed that 0.2% (approximately $4.8 billion) of its Single Family mortgage credit book of business consisted of subprime mortgage loans or structured Fannie Mae MBS backed by subprime mortgage loans. This disclosure did not, at minimum, include an additional $57.1 billion worth of loans that fell squarely within the company’s broadly stated subprime definition of loans made to borrowers with weaker credit histories. Nothing in Fannie Mae’s disclosure alerted investors about the excluded subprime loans. ,  Similarly, in Fannie Mae’s 2006 Form 10-K, the company reported that approximately 12% of its Single Family mortgage credit book of business consisted of Alt-A loans with lower or alternative documentation. That disclosure did not include an additional $238 billion worth of undisclosed reduced documentation Alt-A loans, which would have put the company’s Alt-A disclosure at 22% of its Single Family mortgage credit book of business. ,  In a separate complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (S.D.N.Y.), the SEC alleges that Freddie Mac and three of its former executives, Richard F. Syron, former Chairman and CEO of Freddie Mac, Patricia Cook, Former Executive Vice President of Investments and Capital Markets and Chief Business Officer, and Donald Bisenius, former Senior Vice President for Single Family Guarantee, led investors to believe that the firm used a broad definition of subprime loans and was disclosing all of its subprime loan exposure in its Single-Family guarantee portfolio. Unbeknown to investors, as of December 31, 2006, Freddie Mac’s Single Family business was exposed to approximately $141 billion of loans internally referred to as “subprime” or “subprime like,” accounting for 10 percent of the portfolio, and grew to approximately $244 billion, or 14 percent of the portfolio, as of June 30, 2008. ,  The SEC’s complaint also alleges that, among other things, Syron, Cook and Bisenius made, or substantially assisted Freddie Mac or each other in making, materially false and misleading statements regarding the company’s subprime exposure. In particular, the complaint alleges that Syron and Cook each personally made public speeches or statements that led investors to believe that Freddie Mac, in words or in substance, had “basically no subprime exposure.” As the most-senior credit risk officer for the Single Family business, Bisenius had personal knowledge of the company’s exposure to high risk loans internally characterized as “subprime,” “subprime-like” or “otherwise subprime.” Despite this knowledge, each of the defendants certified or sub-certified to the company’s written disclosures, including its materially misleading subprime disclosures. ,  As a result of their conduct, the SEC alleges that Mudd violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) and Rules 10b-5(b) and 13(a)14(a) thereunder, and Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”); and that Mudd aided and abetted Fannie Mae’s violations of Sections 10(b) and 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5(b), 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder. The SEC complaint also alleges that Dallavecchia violated Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act and aided and abetted Fannie Mae’s violations of Sections 10(b) and 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5(b), 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder. Finally, the SEC complaint alleges that Lund aided and abetted Fannie Mae’s violations of Sections 10(b) and 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5(b), 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder. The SEC is seeking injunctions, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, civil money penalties, and officer and director bars. ,  As a result of their conduct, the SEC alleges that Syron and Cook violated, and Syron, Cook and Bisenius aided and abetted violations of, the antifraud and reporting provisions of the federal securities laws, including Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder. Syron and Cook violated Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”). Syron violated Exchange Act Rule 13a-14. Moreover, in connection with Freddie Mac’s filing of its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2008, Syron, Cook and Bisenius aided and abetted Freddie Mac’s violation of Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20 and 13a-13.

The complaint also alleges that Walker and Dennis DeSender, who at one time served as Bixbyâs Chief Financial Officer (âCFOâ), made misstatements directly to shareholders and prospective shareholders in investor presentations and one-on-one meetings. The complaint alleges that these misstatements violated the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and Securities Exchange Act of 1934., The SECâs complaint against Walker and DeSender also alleges that investors were falsely told that company officers would not be compensated for their sale of Bixby securities. In fact, the SEC alleges that Bixby paid DeSender commissions related to his sale of Bixby securities while he served as Bixbyâs CFO. The SEC further alleges that from 2004 to 2006, DeSender kicked back more than $600,000 to Walker in an undisclosed and fraudulent commission-sharing scheme., The complaint against Walker and DeSender further alleges that DeSender and his corporation, DLD Financial Ltd., also acted as unregistered brokers and that Walker aided and abetted these violations. That complaint also charges Walker and DeSender with violations of the securities offering provisions of the Securities Act of 1933., The second complaint filed by the SEC alleges that from at least 2001 to 2010, a large network of unregistered brokers, including DeSender, sold over $21.7 million in Bixby securities to at least 560 investors. The complaint alleges that Gary A. Collyard, Collyard Group LLC, Paul D. Crawford, Crawford Capital Corp., Ronald Musich, Joshua J. Singer, Christopher C. Weides, Michael B. Spadino and his corporation, Marketing Concepts Inc., acted as unregistered brokers in violation of Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As compensation for their sale of Bixby securities, the unregistered brokers were paid a total of at least $4.9 million in transaction-based cash commissions. In addition, they also received warrants to purchase over 900,000 shares of Bixby common stock., The staffâs investigation is continuing.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr22207.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

22209,2011,"[<h3>Court Enters $49 Million Final Judgment Against Alfred S. Teo, Sr. and MAAA Trust</h3>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on December 21, 2011, United States District Court Judge Susan D. Wigenton entered a final judgment ordering defendants Alfred S. Teo, Sr. and the MAAA Trust, a trust Teo controlled, to pay a total of $49,493,143.15 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest and penalties for false filings regarding their Musicland Stores Corporation stock.  In particular, the Court ordered Teo and the Trust to pay $17,422,054.13 in disgorgement plus $14,649,034.89 in prejudgment interest, and civil penalties of $17,422,054.13.  These amounts are in addition to (i) $996,782.68 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest Teo paid for his insider trading violations pursuant to the Court’s previous order of March 15, 2010, and (ii) a $1 million fine that Teo paid in a parallel criminal action for insider trading.  The Court also enjoined Teo and the Trust from further violations of Sections 13(d) and 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 13d-1, 13d-2 and 16a-3 thereunder.  Previously, the Court had enjoined Teo from further violations of Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder, and barred him from serving as an officer and director of a public company., On May 25, 2011, following a ten day trial, a jury sitting in Newark, New Jersey returned a verdict in favor of the Commission finding Teo liable for securities fraud and disclosure violations on all counts against him and finding the Trust liable for disclosure violations.  Prior to the trial, on August 10, 2010, the Court granted the Commission’s motion for summary judgment against Teo finding him liable for violations of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 16a-3 thereunder., The Commission’s complaint, filed on April 22, 2004, charged Teo and others with insider trading and making false Commission filings.  Specifically, Teo and ten of his relatives, friends and colleagues engaged in insider trading in Musicland and C-Cube Microsystems, Inc. stock.  Teo, a major Musicland shareholder, learned about a tender offer for Musicland, and in breach of a duty of trust and confidence to Musicland, he purchased Musicland stock on the basis of this information prior to the company’s December 7, 2000 public announcement of the tender offer.  Teo tipped eight others with this information, who purchased Musicland stock prior to the Musicland announcement.  Teo also engaged in insider trading in the securities of C-Cube.  Teo, a director of Cirrus Logic, Inc., which had been negotiating to acquire C-Cube, misappropriated from Cirrus material, non-public information regarding the negotiations, and he purchased C-Cube stock shortly before C-Cube announced on March 26, 2001 that it had agreed to be acquired by another company.  Teo tipped his business partner, defendant Mitch Sacks, with this information, who purchased C-Cube stock prior to the C-Cube announcement.  Teo also filed false information with the Commission and deceived the investing public regarding his Musicland stock ownership.  Between July 1998 and January 2001, Teo, the Trust, and Teren Seto Handelman, the Trust’s trustee and Teo’s sister-in-law, filed multiple false and misleading Forms 13D with the Commission, and failed to make required filings, thereby materially misrepresenting their ownership of Musicland stock.  Teo made false filings to avoid triggering Musicland’s shareholders rights plan, or “poison pill,” which Teo understood would have significantly diluted his stock causing massive losses to him.  Instead, Teo’s fraud enabled him to secretly purchase millions of Musicland shares well above the poison pill threshold, which he eventually sold, receiving illicit profits., Between May 3, 2004, and January 3, 2011, the Court entered final judgments against Teo’s tippees: defendants Teren Seto Handelman (Teo’s sister-in-law), Mitch Sacks (Teo’s business partner), Phil Sacks (Teo’s tennis partner and Mitch Sacks’ father), John Reier (CFO of Teo’s companies), Larry Rosen (Teo’s friend), Rich Herron (Teo’s yachting friend), Charles Fortune, Jerrold Johnston and Mark Lauzon (Teo’s business associates), David Ross (Teo’s yacht builder), and relief defendant James Ruffolo.  These defendants and relief defendant consented to the entry of judgments without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission’s complaint.  On March 15, 2010, the Court entered a partial judgment on consent against Teo to settle the Commission’s insider trading charges against him, and the Court ordered him to pay $996,782.68 in disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, enjoined him against further violations of Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder, and barred him from serving as an officer or director of any public company.  Prior to the December 21, 2011 final judgment, the Court ordered a total of $3,869,647.76 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest and civil penalties against Teo and his tippees., In a separate action, the United States Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey prosecuted Teo for violations of the federal securities laws.  On June 27, 2006, after a six week trial, Teo pled guilty to insider trading charges.  Thereafter, on February 6, 2007, Teo was sentenced to 30 months in prison, followed by two years supervised release and ordered to pay a $1 million fine.  <i>United States v. Alfred S. Teo</i>, 04-Cr.-583 (KSH) (D.N.J.) , Teo, age 65 and a resident of Kinnelon, New Jersey and Fisher Island, Florida, is the Chairman of several private companies which produce industrial plastics.  Teo’s companies are some of the largest producers of plastic bags in North America.  Teo was a director and audit committee member of two public companies:  Navarre Corp. from May 1, 1998 to April 22, 2004; and Cirrus from July 21, 1998 to April 10, 2001. , The Commission expresses its appreciation to the United States Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey and the New York Stock Exchange for their assistance in this matter., See also: Litigation Release Numbers <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18673.htm>18673</a> (April 22, 2004), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr19045.htm>19045</a> (Jan. 21, 2005), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19939.htm>19939</a> (Dec. 8, 2006), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20160.htm>20160</a> (June 20, 2007), and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr21799.htm>21799</a> (Jan. 6, 2011).,  ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr22209.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The firm also entered into agreements with the Department of Justice, Internal Revenue Service, and a coalition of 25 state attorneys general and will pay an additional $45.35 million., The settlements arise from extensive law enforcement investigations into widespread corruption in the municipal reinvestment industry.  In the past year, federal and state authorities have reached settlements with four other financial firms, and 18 individuals have been indicted or pled guilty, including three former GE Funding CMS traders., According to the SECs complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, in addition to fraudulently manipulating bids, GE Funding CMS made improper, undisclosed payments to certain bidding agents in the form of swap fees that were inflated or unearned.  These payments were in exchange for the assistance of bidding agents in controlling and manipulating the competitive bidding process., The SEC alleges that from August 1999 to October 2004, GE Funding CMS illegally generated millions of dollars by fraudulently manipulating at least 328 municipal bond reinvestment transactions in 44 states and Puerto Rico.  GE Funding CMS won numerous bids through a practice of last looks in which it obtained information regarding competitor bids and either raised a losing bid to a winning bid or reduced its winning bid to a lower amount so that it could make more profit on the transaction.  In connection with other bids, GE Funding CMS deliberately submitted purposely non-winning bids to facilitate bids set up in advance by certain bidding agents for other providers to win.  GE Funding CMSs fraudulent conduct also jeopardized the tax-exempt status of billions of dollars in municipal securities because the supposed competitive bidding process that establishes the fair market value of the investment was corrupted., In settling the SECs charges, GE Funding CMS agreed to pay a $10.5 million penalty along with disgorgement of $10,625,775 with prejudgment interest of $3,775,987.  GE Funding CMS consented to the entry of a final judgment enjoining it from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.  The settlement is subject to court approval.

Zehner and Assistant Municipal Securities Counsel Denise D. Colliers, who are members of the Municipal Securities and Public Pensions Unit in the Philadelphia Regional Office.

Evolution Capital was an investment adviser registered with the Commission until June 2010.  The firms and Valdez raised at least $10 million from more than 80 investors through two fraudulent note offerings., After a contested evidentiary hearing on October 19 and 20, 2011, the Court found that: (1) Valdez, Evolution Capital, and EIGI misled investors to believe that the notes were safe and secured by assets guaranteed by the United States government; (2) the defendants falsely promised to use leverage to purchase the assets securing the notes; (3) the assets securing the notes were subject to significant undisclosed default and prepayment risk; (4) the defendants paid themselves more than $2.4 million in fees and expenses and used approximately $2.7 million from the second note offering to make Ponzi payments to investors in the first note offering; (5) because of defaults and prepayments on the underlying assets, failure to obtain leverage, and excessive Ponzi payments and fees, the defendants lacked sufficient assets to repay investors in accordance with the notes; and (6) the defendants would have continued taking all monies from the account each  month as “profit” had the Commission not brought its enforcement action.  The Court specifically found that Defendant Valdez acted with fraudulent intent., Based on these findings, the Court granted the Commission’s motion for preliminary and permanent injunction, asset freeze, and appointment of a receiver.  The Court also permanently froze the defendants’ assets.
