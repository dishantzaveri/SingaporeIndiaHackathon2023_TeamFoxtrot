Kimball, United States District Judge for the District Court of Utah, entered a final consent judgment against George Badger (Badger), the last remaining defendant in <i>SEC v. Badger, et al.</i>, Civil Action No. 2:97 CV 0963K (D. Utah).  The judgment permanently enjoins Badger from future violations of the antifraud and reporting provisions of the federal securities laws, permanently bars him from acting as an officer or director of a public company, permanently bars him from participating in any penny stock offerings and orders him to pay disgorgement of $5,786,162, plus prejudgment of $7,650,788.54, for a total of $13,436,950.54 and a civil monetary penalty of $5,786,162.  Badger consented to the entry of the judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint., On December 18, 1997, the Commission brought this action against Badger and thirteen other defendants, alleging that the defendants participated in a multifaceted scheme orchestrated by Badger to defraud purchasers of securities issued by Golf Ventures, Inc. (GVI), a Utah corporation whose common stock was publicly traded.  The Commissions complaint alleges that from 1993 through September 1996, Badger (the undisclosed control person of GVI and a recidivist violator of the federal securities laws) routinely engaged in fraudulent schemes to create the false appearance of market demand for GVI stock by paying undisclosed bribes to brokerage firms and individual brokers to induce them to tout and sell GVI stock to retail customers.  See LR-15595 (December 18, 1997)., As a result of the conduct described in the complaint, the Commission charged Badger with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.

Weaver, a Chicago resident, and his company, Beta Asset Management, Inc., from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The Defendants consented to the entry of the preliminary injunction without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions Complaint.  The preliminary injunction extends the Courts previously issued temporary restraining order and asset freeze until final resolution of the Commissions Complaint.  The Commission filed its Complaint on December 23, 2004., In its Complaint, the Commission alleges that since March 2003, Weaver and Beta Asset Management, Inc., have raised more than $10 million by telling at least five investors that they could profitably trade in the error accounts of a broker-dealer at no risk.  The Defendants so-called error account trading strategy did not and could not have existed.  The Complaint further alleges that the Defendants induced investors to roll over their alleged error account trading profits into a limited partnership.  The Defendants represented that the limited partnership had $30 million in assets at an offshore company.  Contrary to their representations, the limited partnership never had more than $30,000 in assets at the offshore company.  The Complaint also alleges that the Defendants repeatedly delayed making requested payouts to investors strongly suggesting that the Defendants were attempting to raise money from new investors to repay current investors, as in a ponzi scheme.    , The United States Attorneys Office in conjunction with the FBI and the Commission are attempting to identify individuals who invested with Weaver or Beta Asset Management, Inc.

(TV Azteca or the company), a Mexican issuer whose American depository receipts trade on the NYSE, its parent company, Azteca Holdings, S.A., de C.V. (Azteca Holdings), and three current and former TV Azteca officers and directors, Ricardo Salinas Pliego, Pedro Padilla Longoria, and Luis Echarte Fernandez.  The SEC alleges in its Complaint that the defendants engaged in an elaborate scheme to conceal Salinass role in a series of transactions through which he personally profited by $109 million.  The SEC complaint also alleges that Salinas and Padilla sold millions of dollars of TV Azteca stock while Salinass self-dealing remained undisclosed to the market place., In its Complaint, the Commission alleged that Salinas and others caused TV Azteca or Azteca Holdings to file periodic reports that did not disclose Salinass involvement in related party transactions between Unefon, a subsidiary of TV Azteca, and a private entity secretly co-owned by Salinas, called Codisco.  In the related party transactions, Salinas purchased from a third party-at a steep discount-approximately $325 million of indebtedness owed by Unefon to the third party.  At the time that Salinas purchased the indebtedness, he was aware that Unefon was in negotiations with another large telecom company which would provide substantial cash to Unefon, and enable Unefon to pay off the full amount of the indebtedness that Salinas had purchased at a discount.  Only three months later, when Unefon closed the deal with the other telecom company, Salinas profited by $109 million upon Unefons repayment of the debt at full value., The Commission alleged that TV Azteca filed the false reports with the SEC, concealing Salinas involvement in the Unefon debt transactions, despite receiving advice from its U.S. counsel that these transactions were material, reportable transactions under U.S. federal securities laws.  While the company provided general disclosure of the transactions, it refused to reveal information crucial to investors: that Salinas was behind the transactions and personally profited from them.  TV Aztecas resistance led to the eventual resignation of its U.S. counsel, who told the companys board of directors and management that it was resigning consistent with its obligations under Section 307 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.  , The Commission further alleged in its Complaint that in various filings and public statements from June 2003 through January 2004, TV Azteca and its management discussed publicly the Unefon debt transactions while either failing to disclose Salinass involvement, or, in several instances, falsely denying Salinass involvement.  For example, Salinas publicly denied any connection to Codisco in response to a query by the press regarding market concern that he may have been affiliated with Codisco.  TV Aztecas U.S. legal counsel subsequently discovered the news article containing Salinass false denial and advised Padilla that corrective disclosure was necessary.  Despite the falsity of the statement, and the advice of counsel, the defendants did nothing to correct Salinass false denial.  Further, in communications with TV Aztecas independent directors, Salinas, Padilla and Echarte intentionally withheld information from, and even lied to the directors about Salinass connection to the underlying transactions and his $109 million profit.  Salinas and Padilla compounded their fraud by executing false Sarbanes-Oxley certifications. , The Commission further alleged in its Complaint that after the resignation of TV Aztecas U.S. legal counsel and a Dec. 24, 2003, New York Times article concerning the matter, Echarte sent an email to Salinas and Padilla, stating, The damage is done and the situation that we didnt want to explain openly is now in the hands of the public.  Shortly thereafter, on Jan. 9, 2004, TV Azteca issued a press release confirming that Salinas indirectly owned half of Codisco.  , The Commission alleges in its Complaint that the defendants violated or aided and abetted violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), 13(b)(5), and 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-14, 13a-16, 13b2-2, 13d-1 and 13d-2, thereunder.  In its action, the Commission is seeking a final judgment enjoining the defendants from future violations of the federal securities laws, imposing civil money penalties, and ordering the defendants to furnish accountings and to disgorge their ill-gotten gains, plus prejudgment interest.  The Commission also seeks in its actions orders barring Salinas and Padilla from serving as officers or directors of any publicly-held company with securities trading in the United States.  , In a consent filed simultaneously with the complaint, Echarte settled the SECs action against him by agreeing, without admitting or denying the complaints allegations, to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating, and aiding and abetting violations, of Sections 10(b) and 13(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-16 thereunder.

First, the Commission filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia charging Monsanto with violating the FCPA and seeking a civil penalty.  Second, the Commission issued an administrative order finding that Monsanto violated the anti-bribery, books-and-records, and internal-controls provisions of the FCPA, ordering Monsanto to cease and desist from such violations, and requiring Monsanto to retain an independent consultant to review and make recommendations concerning the companys FCPA compliance policies and procedures.  Without admitting or denying the Commissions charges, Monsanto consented to the entry of a final judgment in the federal lawsuit requiring it to pay a $500,000 civil penalty and consented to the Commissions issuance of its administrative order., In both its federal court complaint and its administrative order, the Commission charged that, in 2002, a senior Monsanto manager, based in the United States, authorized and directed an Indonesian consulting firm to make an illegal payment totaling $50,000 to a senior Indonesian Ministry of Environment official (the senior Environment Official).  The bribe was made to influence the senior Environment Official to repeal an unfavorable decree that was likely to have an adverse effect on Monsantos business.  Although the payment was made, the unfavorable decree was not repealed.  The Commission further charged that the senior Monsanto manager devised a scheme whereby false invoices were submitted to Monsanto and the senior Monsanto manager approved the invoices for payment. , In addition, the Commission charged that, from 1997 to 2002, Monsanto inaccurately recorded, or failed to record, in its books and records approximately $700,000 of illegal or questionable payments made to at least 140 current and former Indonesian government officials and their family members.  The approximate $700,000 was derived from a bogus product registration scheme undertaken by two Indonesian entities owned or controlled by Monsanto.  The largest single set of payments was for the purchase of land and the design and construction of a house in the name of the wife of a senior Ministry of Agriculture official.  The Commission further charged that, in certain instances, entries were made in the books and records of the two Indonesian entities that concealed the source, use and true nature of these payments.  , As a result of the conduct described above, the Commission charged that Monsanto violated the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA (Section 30A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934).  The Commission further charged that Monsanto violated Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act, which requires reporting companies to make and keep books, records, and accounts, which accurately and fairly reflect their transactions and disposition of their assets.  The Commission further charged that Monsanto violated Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, which requires all reporting companies to devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to, among other things, provide reasonable assurances that transactions are properly recorded.  The Commission further charged that Monsanto violated Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, which prohibits any person or company from knowingly circumventing or knowingly failing to implement a system of internal accounting controls as described in Section 13(b)(2)(B), or knowingly falsifying any book, record, or account as described in Section 13(b)(2)(A).  Finally, the Commission charged that Monsanto violated Rule 13b2-1 of the Exchange Act, which prohibits any person or company from, directly or indirectly, falsifying or causing to be falsified, any book, record or account subject to Section 13(b)(2)(A)., In determining to accept Monsantos settlement offer, the Commission considered the cooperation that Monsanto provided the Commission staff during its investigation., In a related proceeding, the United States Department of Justice has entered into an agreement with Monsanto Company to defer prosecution on charges of violating the anti-bribery and books and records provisions of the FCPA. Under the Agreement, the Justice Department has filed a criminal information charging the company; Monsanto will pay a $1 million monetary penalty; and Monsanto will retain for a period of three years an independent compliance expert to audit the companys compliance program and monitor its implementation of and compliance with new internal policies and procedures., The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Department of Justice in its investigation, which is continuing., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp19023.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>, <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19023.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

At the time, Gazzigli was the companys Executive Vice President and General Manager of Worldwide Products and Services., The complaint alleges that BroadVision entered into a contract to sell software licenses and related engineering and consulting services to a large retail chain.  According to the complaint, in order to circumvent accounting rules that prohibited immediate recognition of the full contract amount, Gazzigli falsely informed BroadVisions accountants that part of the agreement had been cancelled; she subsequently provided forged documents to the companys auditors to cover up the misrepresentations that she had made.  As a result of Gazziglis misconduct, BroadVision improperly recognized $3.75 million of revenue from the transaction, overstating its third quarter 2001 software license revenue by 23.5% and its total revenue by 7.9%.  Thereafter, BroadVision issued an earnings press release and filed a quarterly report with the Commission, both of which were materially false and misleading., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Gazzigli consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder, and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-13 thereunder.  She also agreed to be permanently barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to pay a $40,000 civil penalty., In a related enforcement action announced today, the Commission instituted a settled cease-and-desist proceeding against BroadVision.

Theriot consented to entry of the Final Judgment without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions Complaint.  , In its Complaint, filed on July 30, 2002, the Commission alleged that Theriot aided and abetted a bribery scheme in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).  From approximately January 1998 to August 1999, an American Rice vice president authorized a series of bribery payments to Haitian customs officials in order to reduce American Rices import taxes illegally.  As part of the scheme, American Rice made at least 12 separate bribery payments to Haitian customs officials, totaling approximately $500,000.  In exchange, Haitian customs officials permitted American Rice to illegally avoid approximately $1.5 million in Haitian import taxes.  American Rice was a public company based in Texas at the time of the bribery payments.  The reduced taxes assisted American Rice to obtain or retain its business of selling rice at competitive prices to Haitian rice merchants and consumers.  American Rice employees and agents carried out the bribery scheme in violation of the anti-bribery, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the FCPA.  Theriot, a consultant hired by American Rice, provided substantial assistance to American Rice officers and employees in implementing and monitoring the bribery scheme., The Commissions action against the other two defendants, Douglas A.

In that action, the SEC seeks injunctions, disgorgement of illicit profits, and civil money penalties against Scott B. Gann and George B. Fasciano, based on allegations that the two brokers carried out a fraudulent scheme to enable certain brokerage customers to engage in improper market timing of mutual funds.  , The SEC and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) also jointly announced the institution and settlement of enforcement proceedings against Southwest and three of its managers, Daniel R. Leland (formerly Southwests president), Kerry M. Rigdon (formerly the director of Southwests Private Client Group), and Kevin J. Marsh (formerly the manager of Southwests downtown Dallas branch office).  According to the SEC and NYSE, Southwest and the managers failed reasonably to supervise brokers in Southwests downtown Dallas branch office who engaged in fraudulent mutual fund market timing schemes, late trading of mutual fund shares, or both.  In settlement of the SEC and NYSE actions, Southwest has agreed to pay a total of $10 million, consisting of $2 million in disgorgement and an $8 million civil money penalty, and to undertake a number of measures to prevent future misconduct.  The managers have agreed to settlements that include payments of disgorgement and civil money penalties totaling $275,000, as well as 12-month suspensions from association with a broker-dealer or investment adviser in any supervisory capacity.   As part of the settlements, the firm and the managers neither admitted nor denied the SEC and NYSE findings., Market timing refers to the practice of short term buying and selling of mutual fund shares in order to exploit inefficiencies in mutual fund pricing.  Although market timing is not per se illegal, many mutual funds try to prevent it because it tends to harm long-term mutual fund shareholders.  Late trading refers to the practice of placing orders to buy or sell mutual fund shares after market close at 4:00 ET, but at the net asset value (NAV), or price, determined at the market close.  Late trading enables the trader to profit from knowledge of market moving events that occur after 4:00 ET, but are not reflected in that days fund share price.  Late trading is illegal.  , According to the SEC and the NYSE, the fraudulent market timing schemes sought to circumvent trading restrictions that mutual fund companies imposed on Southwest brokers and accounts, by concealing from mutual fund companies improper market timing activities of Southwest brokerage customers.  The SEC and NYSE found and alleged that more than 30 fund companies, representing hundreds of individual mutual funds, detected market timing trades by Southwest customers, and attempted to prevent further market timing by barring future trades, either in particular accounts or by a particular Southwest broker or branch office.  In response, according to the SEC and the NYSE, Southwest brokers used masking activities, such as multiple customer accounts, multiple broker identification numbers, and multiple branch office numbers, to disguise their customers market timing trades and trick the fund companies into accepting the trades. For example, according to the SEC and NYSE, brokers in Southwests downtown Dallas branch office executed trades for a single hedge fund adviser customer, using 21 accounts held by nine customer-affiliated entities, and using three broker identification numbers.  According to the SEC and NYSE, the brokers used these masking tactics for the sole purpose of circumventing trading restrictions imposed by the fund companies.  The SEC and NYSE found and alleged that those acts constituted a scheme to defraud, in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.  , The SEC and the NYSE also found that the managers failed reasonably to supervise the brokers, by failing to investigate or respond appropriately to red flags that should have alerted them to the brokers improper conduct.  According to the SEC and NYSE findings, the red flags included hundreds of notices, warnings, complaints and trading restrictions (block notices) sent by mutual fund companies in response to the brokers mutual fund market timing activities, and also included the brokers requests for multiple account numbers per customer, and for additional broker identification numbers. The SEC and NYSE also found that Southwest failed to implement procedures designed to detect and prevent late trading.  Section 15(b) of the Exchange Act authorizes the SEC to institute enforcement proceedings based on such supervision failures.  , According to the NYSE and the SEC, Southwest also violated Rule 22c-1 under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, which contains prohibitions against late trading.  The SEC and NYSE also found that Southwest violated Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 17a-3 and 17a-4 thereunder, which require broker-dealers to make and keep certain business records, including order tickets and electronic messages., The SEC and NYSE acknowledged the assistance of the NASD in connection with the investigation.  , <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp19027.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>, <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19027.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The compensation took the form of heavily-discounted shares in the two companies-shares which Calandra later sold at a substantial profit after the stock prices rose following his favorable newsletter write-ups., Calandra, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, has agreed to a permanent injunction from further violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws (Sections 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder), and from further violations of Section 17(b) of the Securities Act of 1933, which prohibits the non-disclosure of compensation received for providing publicity about a security.  Calandra also will disgorge $416,109.58 in illegal trading profits and prejudgment interest and will pay a civil penalty of $125,000., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp19028.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>, <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19028.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

(PurchasePro) - Chris Benyo and Michael Kennedy - and two former executive-level employees of America Online, Inc. (AOL) - John Tuli and Kent Wakeford - for violations of the antifraud, books-and-records, internal accounting controls, periodic reporting and lying-to-auditors provisions of the federal securities laws.   According to the complaint, the defendants participated in a fraudulent scheme to artificially inflate the reported and announced revenues of PurchasePro for the fourth quarter of 2000 (Q4 2000) and first quarter of 2001 (Q1 2001).  PurchasePro, a Las Vegas-based Internet company, is now known as Pro-After, Inc.  , The Commissions complaint alleges that, beginning in Q4 2000 and continuing through April 2001, each defendant took knowing and deliberate steps designed to inflate PurchasePros revenues in contravention of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  In particular, the complaint alleges that, Johnson: (i) fraudulently directed PurchasePro to issue $30 million in unearned performance warrants to AOL at the close of Q4 2000 in exchange for AOLs undisclosed promise to deliver revenue to PurchasePro in future quarters; (ii) entered into, and concealed the existence of, reciprocal contingent agreements that rendered it improper to recognize $3.92 million in revenue from three marketplace license sales to PurchasePro customers in Q4 2000; (iii) backdated or otherwise concealed the execution time of three contracts signed in Q2 2000 in order to improperly recognize $14.7 million in revenue from those agreements in Q1 2001; (iv) entered into, and concealed the existence of, reciprocal contingent agreements that rendered it improper to recognize $4.4 million in revenue from three marketplace license sales to PurchasePro customers in Q1 2001; and (v) created or caused the creation of an entirely fraudulent contract purportedly entered into with AOL (called a Statement of Work), thereby causing PurchasePro to improperly recognize an additional $3.65 million in Q1 2001 revenue.  , The complaint further alleges that Benyo, PurchasePros Senior Vice President for Marketing and Network Development, along with Kennedy, PurchasePros Chief Technology Officer, also took steps to make it falsely appear that the Statement of Work agreement was executed during Q1 2001 when they knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that (i) revenue from the Statement of Work could not be properly recognized in Q1 2001 unless the contract had been signed and performance completed before the end of that quarter; (ii) that the Statement of Work had, in fact, been neither signed nor completed by the end of Q1 2001; and (iii) that PurchasePro nonetheless was going to include revenues from that contract in its Q1 2001 results., Additionally, according to the complaint, Wakeford: (i) fabricated documents to create the false impression that PurchasePro received far more in referred third party business from AOL than it actually had, thereby causing PurchasePro to improperly issue $30 million in PurchasePro warrants to AOL that AOL had not actually earned; (ii) proposed the false Statement of Work contract to help inflate PurchasePros Q1 2001 revenues; and (iii) took steps to backdate or otherwise make it falsely appear that a $3.7 million marketplace license sale agreement was executed within Q1 2001, when in fact the contract was not executed during that quarter.  The complaint further alleges that Tuli, AOLs Vice-President of Business Development for NetScape, repeatedly confirmed (or caused others to confirm) to PurchasePros auditors that the services described in the Statement of Work had been completed and accepted by AOL by the close of Q1 2001 - even though Tuli knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that those confirmations were false.  , The complaint alleges that as a result of the foregoing conduct, PurchasePros annual report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2000 and quarterly report for Q1 2001 on Form 10-Q - as well as the companys public earnings announcements - contained material misstatements and omissions.  As alleged in the complaint, PurchasePros announced and reported revenues for Q4 2000 were artificially and materially overstated by over 11% .  The complaint also alleges that the company issued a public earnings announcement for Q1 2001 that overstated revenues by 65% and subsequently filed a Form 10-Q for that quarter with the Commission that reported revenues that were artificially and materially inflated by 37%.  , In addition, the complaint alleges that Johnson attempted to conceal his fraudulent conduct by destroying, or directing others to destroy, all documents pertaining to PurchasePros dealings with AOL.   , Based on these allegations, the Commission charged: (i) Johnson with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2, and with aiding and abetting PurchasePros violations of Exchange Act Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder; (ii) Benyo with violating Exchange Act Section 13(b)(5) and Exchange Act Rules 13b2-1 and 13b2-2, and with aiding and abetting PurchasePros violations of Exchange Act Sections 10(b), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5; (iii) Kennedy with aiding and abetting PurchasePros violations of Exchange Act Sections 10(b), 13(b)(5), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2; (iv) Tuli with aiding and abetting of PurchasePros violations of Exchange Act Sections 10(b), 13(b)(5), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2; and (v) Wakeford with aiding and abetting of PurchasePros violations of Exchange Act Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(5), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2.  , The Commission seeks: (i) an injunction and civil penalty as to each defendant; (ii) disgorgement of all ill-gotten gains, with prejudgment interest thereon, as to Johnson, Benyo and Kennedy; and (iii) an order barring Johnson, Benyo, Kennedy, and Wakeford from acting as officers or directors of any public company. , Also today, in a related criminal proceeding, the United States Attorneys office for the Eastern District of Virginia announced that each of these defendants has been indicted on criminal charges, including securities fraud and conspiracy to commit securities fraud, arising from the same facts and circumstances as those alleged in the Commissions complaint.  , The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the United States Department of Justice, the United States Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Virginia, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the investigation of this matter. , <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp19029.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>, <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19029.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

LOM and Lines, a Bermuda resident, had refused to produce documents and appear for testimony as directed by the four subpoenas.  On June 10, 2004, the Commission filed the above-mentioned subpoena enforcement action seeking a court order requiring LOM and Lines to comply with the subpoenas.  , The Commission had issued the subpoenas in connection with two separate investigations into possible fraud, market manipulation, and reporting violations in the securities of three U.S. public companies: Sedona Software Solutions, Inc. (“Sedona”), SHEP Technologies, Inc. (“SHEP”), and Hienergy Technologies, Inc. (“Hienergy”).  The Commission’s investigations have revealed that certain individuals engaged in extensive trading in the securities of Hienergy, Sedona, and SHEP through accounts at LOM in Bermuda, the Bahamas, and the Cayman Islands.  The Commission alleged that the subpoenaed documents and testimony were relevant to matters under investigation and were within the scope of the Commission’s investigative authority.  The subpoenas were served on Scott Lines on April 20, 2004 while he was in the United States., The Court ordered LOM and Lines to comply with the document subpoenas by no later than February 14, 2005.  Lines was ordered to appear for testimony in Washington, D.C. within 20 days of the Commission’s receipt of the document production.

Kaiser, Lee and Carter engaged in or substantially participated in a scheme to overstate Aholds income by $700 million or more in SEC filings and other public announcements for at least fiscal years 2001 and 2002.  Resnick, Kaiser, Lee, and Carter were top executives at Columbia, Maryland based wholesale food distributor U.S. Foodservice, a major subsidiary of Ahold.  (Litigation Release No. 18797)  The complaint alleges that they grossly inflated reported profits and induced numerous suppliers to submit false confirmations to the companys auditors in order to conceal their fraud.

No. 05-10074 (MEL).</h2>, <h2>SEC CHARGES WIFE OF FORMER CEO OF MASSACHUSETTS PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY AND TWO OTHERS WITH INSIDER TRADING</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday filed an insider trading action involving trading in the common stock of Massachusetts-based Cubist Pharmaceuticals, Inc. against Patricia B. Rocklage, the wife of Scott M. Rocklage, Cubists former Chairman and CEO, William M. Beaver, Patricia Rocklages brother, and David G. Jones, Beavers best friend and neighbor.  Patricia Rocklage resides in Sudbury, Massachusetts.  Both Beaver and Jones are residents of Charlotte, North Carolina.  The Commission filed its complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. , In its complaint, the Commission alleges that, on December 31, 2001, Scott Rocklage informed Patricia B. Rocklage of the negative results of a clinical trial involving one of Cubists most important products, Cidecin.  The complaint also alleges that, unbeknownst to her husband, Ms. Rocklage had a pre-existing understanding with her brother whereby she would give him a wink and a nod if she ever became aware of any bad news about Cubist that might affect its stock price.  According to the complaint, shortly after learning about the trial results, Ms. Rocklage told her husband that she intended to signal Beaver to sell his Cubist stock.  The complaint states that Scott Rocklage urged his wife not to take this action.  The complaint asserts that, notwithstanding her husbands entreaties, by no later than the morning of January 2, 2002, Ms. Rocklage provided  a wink and a nod to Beaver, who, at approximately 10 a.m. that day, sold all 5,583 shares of Cubist stock that he owned or controlled.  The complaint further contends that, after receiving the signal from his sister, Beaver tipped his best friend and neighbor, Jones, who proceeded to sell all 7,500 shares of Cubist stock that he owned on the morning of January 3, 2002.  Following the post market close announcement of the trial results on January 16, 2002, Cubists stock price dropped by 46%, from a closing price of $31.75 that day to a closing price of $17.02 on January 17, 2002.  By selling when they did, Beaver and Jones avoided losses of $99,527 and $133,222, respectively., In its lawsuit, the Commission alleges that Patricia Rocklage, Beaver and Jones violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Edgar,</i> Civil Action No. 05-2009, (U.S.D.C. C.D.Ill., filed January 12, 2005) </h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that it filed a civil injunctive action against Thomas E. Edgar, a resident of Urbana, Illinois, for perpetrating a fraudulent scheme to manipulate the closing price of nearly two dozen closed-end funds.  The action, filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of Illinois, alleges that on 119 occasions between August 1999 and October 2003, Edgar placed buy and sell orders of 100 or 200 shares of the closed-end funds at or near the close of the trading day for the purpose of artificially increasing or decreasing the funds closing price.  This manipulative trading practice is known as marking-the-close.  The Commissions Complaint alleges that one way Edgar carried out his scheme was to mark-the-close in an attempt to increase his profit from the sale of closed-end funds that he owned.  Specifically, when Edgar owned a large number of shares of a closed-end fund, typically 2,000 shares, he often placed an additional market order to buy approximately 100 or 200 shares of the same closed-end fund within a few minutes of the close of the market.  The execution of these additional market buy orders resulted in an increase to the closing price of the fund.  The Commissions Complaint alleges that Edgars purpose in placing the additional market buy orders at the end of one trading day was to cause an increase to the price of the fund and then to profit from the higher sale price at the beginning of the next trading day.  The Commissions Complaint alleges that in nearly every instance when he marked the close in this fashion, Edgar sold his shares the following day at a higher price. As a result, Edgar fraudulently manipulated the closing price of the closed-end funds that he owned., Edgar consented, without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions Complaint, to the entry of an order of permanent injunction enjoining him from violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 9(a)(2) and 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and the imposition of a $35,000 civil penalty.

The actions filed name as defendants Mark A. Bailin, Kenneth H. Bowman, Timothy Neal Daly, Michael J. Hannigan, Peter O. Marion, John Nettle, Gordon Redgate, Bruce Robinson and Michael Rogers.  All of these individuals were employees of or agents for vendors which supplied U.S. Foodservice., The Commissions complaints allege that U.S. Foodservice personnel contacted vendors and urged them to sign and return the false confirmation letters.  In some cases U.S. Foodservice pressured the vendors; in other cases they provided side letters to the vendors assuring the vendors that they did not owe U.S. Foodservice the amounts reflected as outstanding in the confirmation letters.  The letters clearly stated that the confirmations were being used in connection with the annual audit and the letters directed the defendants to return the confirmations directly to the companys auditors.  , Each of the individuals aided and abetted the fraud by signing and sending to the companys independent auditors confirmation letters that they knew materially overstated the amounts of promotional allowance income paid or owed to U.S. Foodservice.  The amounts overstated in the confirmations were often inflated by millions of dollars and by more than 100 percent., The complaints allege that U.S. Foodservice engaged in a scheme to report earnings equal to or greater than its targets, regardless of the companys true performance.  U.S. Foodservice inflated its promotional allowance income by at least $700 million for fiscal years 2001 and 2002 and thereby caused Ahold to report materially false operating and net income for these periods.  The annual audit confirmation process at U.S. Foodservice was systematically corrupted to help keep the fraud from being discovered.  , The complaints allege aiding and abetting violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a) [in most cases], 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20 [in most cases], and 13b2-1 thereunder.  Bailin, Hannigan, Nettle, Redgate, and Rogers have each agreed to settle the Commissions action, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, by consenting to permanent injunctions and payment of a $25,000 penalty.  Also today, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York announced criminal charges in this matter.  , The Commission also filed today a separate complaint against Bailin alleging that during February and March of 2000, after learning of material, nonpublic information about Aholds intention to acquire U.S. Foodservice, he traded in the shares of U.S. Foodservice and recommended the purchase of U.S. Foodservice to six other traders.  The complaint alleges that he made illegal profits of approximately $1,144,794 and the other six traders had a combined profit of $1,079,653.  The complaint alleges violations of Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder.  Bailin has agreed to settle the Commissions action, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, by consenting to a permanent injunction, and payment of $2,224,446.51 disgorgement, $751,031.78 prejudgment interest and a $175,000 penalty., On July 27, 2004 the SEC filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that Michael Resnick, Mark P.

Dyer and two entities controlled by him, Resource F, LLC, and Bunker Hill Aviation, LLC, concerning their failure to comply with a final judgment entered against them in September 2003 by the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts that ordered payment of disgorgement, interest, and a civil penalty., In its original complaint filed against Dyer, his entities, and others on April 16, 2001, the Commission alleged that, between 1997 and 2000, Dyer and his entities participated in a fraudulent trading scheme that raised approximately $22 million from at least 50 investors, many of whom were members of the Christian Science Church.  According to the complaint, Dyer helped promote and administer the trading scheme through his entities and solicited investors using misrepresentations typical of Prime Bank-type investment frauds, including that the investment involved high-quality debt instruments and that investors principal was never at risk and could be returned after one year.  According to the complaint, during the initial stages of the fraud, investors received monthly payments that the defendants represented were profits on their investment.  The complaint alleged, however, that monthly payments to investors ceased around May 2000, and no investors are known to have received the return of their investment, as promised by the defendants. , The Commissions contempt motion alleges that on September 15, 2003, the court entered a final judgment by consent against Dyer, Resource F, and Bunker Hill Aviation that held them jointly and severally liable for disgorgement and interest of over $570,000.  Dyer was also ordered to pay a civil penalty of $110,000.  The final judgment provided that the disgorgement, interest, and penalty would be paid on a payment plan over the course of 11 months after entry of the judgment.  In its contempt motion, the Commission alleges that, other than releasing $100,000 that they were required to place in escrow prior to issuance of the final judgment, the defendants have made no further payments to satisfy the final judgment., For further information, please see Litigation Release No. 18414 (October 16, 2003)[final judgment against Dyer, Resource F, and Bunker Hill Aviation]; and Litigation Release No. 16963 (April 16, 2001) [SEC files emergency enforcement action against Dyer and others]., <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19035.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The Commissions Complaint alleged that Mohn, Mohn Asset Management, Mohn Financial Group and J. Patrick Kisor (Kisor) offered and sold investments in Agave, Ltd. (Agave) and Genesis Trading Associates, L.L.C. (Genesis), raising a total of approximately $31 million.  The complaint alleged that instead of investing in options, as represented to investors, Kisor misappropriated the vast majority of investor funds for personal purposes and used a significant portion of the funds for illiquid, risky investments in private companies or penny stocks.  According to the complaint, when Mohn learned that Kisor was using the funds for undisclosed investments and that Kisor had misappropriated investor funds, Mohn failed to tell investors these facts.  Rather, Mohn, through Mohn Asset Management and Mohn Financial Group, continued to send investors statements that overvalued their investments in Agave and Genesis and invested some of their funds in risky and illiquid investments in private companies, without telling investors.  The Commissions complaint also alleged that Mohn, Mohn Asset Management, and Mohn Financial Group sold unregistered securities and acted as an investment adviser and unregistered broker., Previously, Kisor consented, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, to an order permanently enjoining him from engaging in fraud in violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Section 15(c)(1) of the Exchange Act and Rule 15c1-2 thereunder, and Sections 206 (1) and 206(2) of the Advisers Act; acting as an unregistered broker in violation of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act; and selling unregistered securities in violation of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act.  The order against Kisor also provided that Kisor would disgorge all ill-gotten gains received by him as a result of the conduct alleged in the Commissions Complaint and that the Court would determine the specific amount of disgorgement, and whether and to what extent to impose civil penalties against Kisor, at a separate hearing upon due notice and motion by the Commission., For further information, see <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17856.htm>Litigation Release No. 17856</a> (November 21, 2002). , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19036.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The Commissions complaint alleges that Jannetti and Debbs violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder when they sold shares of Osteotech while in possession of material, nonpublic information.    , Specifically, the Commissions complaint alleges that that on September 26 and 27, 2002, Jannetti and Debbs learned about contamination problems at Osteotechs production facilities.  While in possession of this material, nonpublic information, Debbs and Jannetti sold their entire positions in Osteotech stock, illegally avoiding the losses they would have incurred had the information been public.  On September 30, 2002, once Osteotech disclosed the contamination problems and the resulting shut down of its last remaining production facility, Osteotechs stock price fell from $9.47 per share on the previous day to $5.16 per share.  Accordingly, Jannetti and Debbs avoided losses of $9,040 and $12,920 by selling when they did. , Jannetti and Debbs have agreed to a resolution of this matter, subject to the Courts approval.

The complaint alleged that, beginning in January 1997, the defendants told prospective investors that Prexomet owned a valuable Arizona manganese mine and offered them an opportunity to purchase Prexomet stock at $1 per share.  The complaint further alleged that the defendants also told the investors that Prexomet would soon go public through an initial public offering (IPO) and that they would earn a 400% return on their investments within several months.  According to the complaint, these statements were false because neither Prexomet, nor any of the defendants, ever owned a mine and none of the defendants ever took any step to conduct an IPO or expended any funds for that purpose.  Instead, the complaint asserted, the defendants diverted most of the funds they raised for their personal benefit.  The Commission further alleged that, once some of the investors began raising questions about their investments, the defendants began making false lulling statements, from as early as April 1997 and continuing through at least March 2000, about how the investors would soon receive their promised 400% returns.  According to the complaint, none of the investors ever received back any portion of the funds raised by the defendants., The Commissions case against defendant Kraemer was resolved through the September 18, 2002 entry of a default judgment that enjoined him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and that required him to pay $192,163 in disgorgement, $87,082 in prejudgment interest and a $192,163 civil penalty.  In a related administrative proceeding, on April 10, 2003, ALJ Brenda P. Murray issued an order, by default, barring Kraemer from participating in any offering of penny stock., The Commissions case against defendant Helm was resolved through the August 1, 2001 entry of a judgment, by consent, that enjoined him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and that required him to pay a $20,000 civil penalty.  In a related administrative proceeding, on September 28, 2001, the Commission issued an order, by consent, barring Helm from participation in any offering of penny stock and barring him from association with any broker or dealer with the right to reapply for association after three years., The Commissions case against defendant Sampson is proceeding., For further information, see Lit.

Additionally, Orlick was prohibited from serving as an officer or director of a public company for ten years.  Orlick has also agreed, in a related administrative action, to be suspended from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  Orlick consented to the relief without admitting or denying the SECs allegations.  , Gemstar is a Los Angeles-based media and technology company that, among other things, publishes TV Guide magazine and develops, licenses, and markets an interactive program guide (IPG) for televisions that enables consumers to navigate through and select television programs.  During the relevant period, Gemstar generated revenues from the IPG by licensing the technology to third parties and selling advertising on the IPG.  In statements to securities analysts and the investing public, Gemstar repeatedly touted the IPG technology and IPG advertising revenues as the companys future and as the value driver of the companys stock, and downplayed expected declines in revenue from TV Guide magazine., Orlick, of Chatsworth, California, served in several senior positions at Gemstar, including as general counsel.  The SECs complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, alleges that from June 1999 through September 2002, Gemstar overstated its total revenues by at least $248 million to meet its ambitious projections for revenue growth from IPG licensing and advertising.  The complaint further alleges that Orlick participated in Gemstars fraudulent recording and disclosure of certain IPG licensing and advertising revenue.  The complaint alleges that Orlick knew, but omitted to disclose, that Gemstar was improperly recognizing and reporting material amounts of licensing revenue from two companies.  Additionally, the complaint alleges that Orlick participated in Gemstars fraudulent recognition of this licensing revenue by repeatedly signing false management representation letters to Gemstars auditors regarding the status of negotiations with one of the companies.  Orlick failed to disclose material information regarding certain of Gemstars IPG revenue.  The complaint charges Orlick with securities fraud, falsifying Gemstars books and records, aiding and abetting Gemstars reporting and record-keeping violations, and lying to auditors in violation of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder., In addition to being enjoined from violating, or aiding and abetting violations, of the above provisions of the federal securities laws, Orlick was also ordered to pay disgorgement of $150,000, representing a portion of his bonus during the relevant period, interest of $5,510.62, and a civil penalty of $150,000.

The Commission alleges that Liang, 27, sold the shares after learning that the NetEase division he managed - which typically accounted for half of the companys revenue - was going to substantially miss its revenue targets.  Without admitting or denying the Commissions charges, Liang agreed to pay over $1 million in disgorgement and penalties and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. , According to the Commissions complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, Liang served as Senior Vice President and General Manager of NetEases Wireless Business Department, the companys fastest growing division and largest source of revenue.

Over the two trading days leading up to the scheduled announcement, Liang sold more than 47,000 shares of NetEase stock (which trades as American Depositary Receipts on the Nasdaq National Market), realizing over $3 million in sales proceeds.  After NetEase announced the revenue shortfall, the stock price plummeted by 23%.

Incorporated (Morgan Stanley) relating to the firms allocation of stock to institutional customers in initial public offerings (IPOs) it underwrote during 1999 and 2000.  In settlement of this matter, Morgan Stanley has consented, without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, to a final judgment that would permanently enjoin Morgan Stanley from violating Rule 101 of the Commissions Regulation M and order it to pay a $40 million civil penalty.  The settlement terms are subject to court approval., In its complaint, the Commission alleges that Morgan Stanley violated Rule 101 of Regulation M under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by attempting to induce certain customers who received allocations of IPOs to place purchase orders for additional shares in the aftermarket.  The complaint further alleges that Morgan Stanley did induce certain customers to place such orders during the new issues first few trading days., The Commissions complaint against Morgan Stanley, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, includes the following allegations:, Rule 101 of Regulation M, among other things, prohibits underwriters, during a restricted period prior to the completion of their participation in the distribution of IPO shares, from directly or indirectly bidding for, purchasing, or attempting to induce any person to bid for or purchase any offered security in the aftermarket.  As a prophylactic rule, Regulation M is designed to prohibit activities that could artificially influence the market for the offered security, including, for example, supporting the IPO price by creating the perception of scarcity of IPO stock or creating the perception of aftermarket demand., During the restricted period, i.e., prior to Morgans Stanleys completion of participation in the distribution of IPO shares, Morgan Stanley attempted to induce certain customers to make aftermarket purchases in violation of Rule 101 of Regulation M by engaging in the following activities., <p class=em2>Aftermkt on [the Avanex IPO] goes into the 100s from lots of customers . . . .  How is this for a strategy: put in aftermkt for $150, the stock runs to about  $110, you buy it there - even if it pulls back and you lose some on the shares short term, you a) got more stock on the deal since your aftermkt was so freakin big b) if you[]re going to own it longer anyway so what if you buy at the peak on the first day and who[]s to say in this market the stock can[]t go even higher[.]  The more outlandish the aftermkt, I would definitely figure the more stock you get., After the distribution of IPO shares was complete, some of Morgan Stanleys sales force made calls and solicited aftermarket orders from certain customers who had provided aftermarket interest.  Morgan Stanley viewed favorably follow-through aftermarket buying in the first few days of trading.  For example, a syndicate manger e-mailed a sales representative, thanks for following up with the [aftermarket] feedback.  i am glad to know that the account reciprocated with aftermarket.  tell them to keep it up.  In addition, after customers bought shares in the immediate aftermarket, some Morgan Stanley sales representatives at times referred to their customers aftermarket buying as fulfilling their promises or commitments.  Further, Morgan Stanley monitored customers aftermarket purchases in the first few days of trading.  This conduct, taken as a whole, demonstrates that when Morgan Stanley previously had solicited aftermarket interest from these customers during the restricted period, it was attempting to induce customers to place aftermarket orders in the first few days of trading., Morgan Stanley also violated Rule 101 of Regulation M in the Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia IPO by soliciting a 350,000 share aftermarket order from a customer before all the IPO shares had been distributed.  On the morning of the Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia IPO, and before Morgan Stanley had announced that syndicate had broken, Morgan Stanley called a customer and told it that Morgan Stanley was concerned because there were no aftermarket orders on Morgan Stanleys trading desk.  Morgan Stanley then asked the customer to place an aftermarket order.  The customer agreed to Morgan Stanleys request and placed an aftermarket order for 350,000 shares in the period before syndicate broke.  Morgan Stanley executed the order later in the day after trading began.  The customer sold all of its IPO shares and the shares it had bought in the aftermarket that same day., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp19050.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>, <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19050.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The Commissions Complaint alleges as follows:, Rule 101 of Regulation M, among other things, prohibits underwriters, during a restricted period (the five-day period preceding the determinations of IPO prices and prior to the completion of distributions of IPO shares), from directly or indirectly bidding for, purchasing, or attempting to induce any person to bid for or purchase any offered security in the aftermarket.  As a prophylactic rule, Regulation Ms prohibition is designed to prevent activities that could artificially influence the market for the offered security, including, for example, supporting the IPO price by creating a perception of scarcity of IPO stock or creating the perception of aftermarket demand for the stock.  Regulation M may be violated with or without, among other things, any impact on the price of a security, scienter, or any agreement to buy stock in the aftermarket., During restricted periods, Goldman Sachs attempted to induce, or induced, certain customers to make aftermarket purchases of IPO stock in violation of Rule 101 of Regulation M by engaging in the following activities:, <p class=em2>Goldman Sachs . . . has told me that for now, all their small techy deals will be subject to close scrutiny with regard to flippers.  AMOs [aftermarket orders] will be watched for follow-thru on indicated intentions. . . .  , During conversations or courses of dealing that included the preceding subjects,  Goldman Sachs sales representatives asked certain customers during restricted periods whether, and at what prices and in what quantities, they intended to place orders to purchase IPO stock in the immediate aftermarket., Through such questions and statements about aftermarket orders during restricted periods, Goldman Sachs communicated to certain customers hopeful of obtaining IPO allocations (including customers that did not have a genuine interest in long-term ownership of the stock being offered) that indications of intentions to place orders in the immediate aftermarket, and/or the aftermarket orders themselves, would increase their likelihood of receiving favorable allocations of IPO stock.   As a result of Goldman Sachss communications concerning aftermarket orders, and because some customers wanted to obtain IPO allocations that they reasonably believed they could flip for large profits, certain customers indicated intentions to place orders and/or placed orders to purchase IPO stock in the immediate aftermarket of certain offerings.  Goldman Sachs engaged in a combination of some or all of the foregoing types of communications to certain customers in connection with the IPOs of CoSine, Marvell, and WebEx, Inc.  , Goldman Sachs has agreed to settle the Commissions action and has consented, without admitting or denying the allegations of the Complaint, to the entry of a final judgment that:  (1) permanently enjoins Goldman Sachs from violating Rule 101 of Regulation M under the Exchange Act; and (2) orders a civil penalty of $40 million pursuant to Section 21(d) of the Exchange Act., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp19051.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>, <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19051.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Hermans Sports was a start-up sporting goods retailer that had acquired the trademarks of Hermans Sporting Goods, Inc., a storied band name.  Specifically, Eisemann and Montaino solicited investors by making a series of false or misleading statements including, among other things, that Hermans Sports would be imminently conducting an IPO, with the assistance of certain banks, which would enable investors to earn a quick profit.

David Wolfson, a resident of Los Angeles, is the son of the alleged co-architect of the Freedom Surf manipulation, defendant Allen Wolfson.  Allen Wolfson was convicted in New York in March 2003 for securities fraud and other violations arising out of his scheme to manipulate the stocks of six companies., David Wolfson consented to the entry of the judgment against him without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint.  He is the fourth of the original 17 defendants in the Freedom Surf action to settle the charges against them.  The action remains pending against Allen Wolfson and 12 other defendants. , The Commissions complaint, filed on September 30, 2002, alleges the following, among other things:  David Wolfson engaged in a scheme with other defendants from at least July through October 2000 to manipulate the stock of Freedom Surf, Inc., a start-up company with offices in Huntington Beach, California.  Certain defendants transferred Freedom Surf stock at no cost to defendant Allen Wolfson, one of two coordinators of the manipulation.  Allen and David Wolfson then called in manipulative trades to accounts that Allen Wolfson controlled, and directed a broker to advance the bid quotation in Freedom Surf stock without relation to genuine market demand or worth of the company.  In this way, the Wolfsons and other defendants artificially increased the price of Freedom Surf stock.  Allen Wolfson then sold a block of Freedom Surf stock at a discount to a retail broker, which in turn marked up the stock and sold it to investors., The judgment entered against David Wolfson enjoins him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5.  It also orders him to pay $86,117 in disgorgement of profits, $21,535 in prejudgment interest, and a penalty of $50,000, for a total payment of $157,652.

The court also found that the stock promoters committed touting violations by describing Dicom stock as an investment but failing to disclose all of the compensation that they received, and were entitled to receive under signed agreements, for doing so.

Dicom and Gane supplied the stock promoters with Dicoms financial projections, which were placed into a due diligence package prepared by Welsh and SFS.  The due diligence package was then reviewed by Gane and distributed to brokers and potential investors., Two of the promoters, Welsh and Tamburello, wrote investment opinions recommending Dicom stock.  Welsh issued his investment opinions, and those that he approved, through SFS and SIG, while Tamburello issued his investment opinions through CRG.  After issuing their favorable investment opinions, however, the stock promoters sold their Dicom shares.  , The court also found that the stock promoters failed to disclose all of the compensation they either received or were to receive under the agreements signed with Dicom and that they engaged in scalping.

After the scheme collapsed in September 2001, GENIs stock price plunged to pennies per share, leading to the bankruptcy of three brokerage firms and the largest bailout in the history of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation.  , The Commission alleges that Smith assisted GENIs Chief Executive Officer and his accomplice (a Saudi Arabian national reputed to be an international arms dealer and financier) in a fraudulent stock manipulation and lending scheme that occurred between September 1999 and September 2001.  According to the complaint, GENIs CEO secretly paid Smith approximately $1.1 million in cash and GENI stock to tout GENI shares on television.  Smiths public statements, many of which were false or misleading, artificially inflated the price of GENI shares and facilitated the misappropriation of approximately $130 million by GENIs CEO and his accomplice.  , According to the complaint, the manipulation of GENIs stock price began shortly after the companys June 1999 public offering.  To benefit from the manipulation, GENIs CEO and his accomplice, with the assistance of Kenneth P. DAngelo (a stock loan broker previously charged by the SEC and criminal authorities), developed a stock lending scheme in which they could profit from lending GENI shares (rather than selling them).  The complaint alleges that the CEO and his accomplice, through an offshore entity called Ultimate Holdings, loaned approximately 15 million shares of GENI stock to more than a dozen broker-dealers in exchange for cash (based upon the market value of the shares).  As the price of GENI shares increased from the efforts of Smith and others, Ultimate Holdings received additional funds when the GENI stock loans were marked-to-market by the broker-dealers involved.  By lending the shares in this manner, Ultimate Holdings and GENIs CEO raised approximately $130 million without giving up control of the stock or depressing the market.  GENIs CEO and his accomplice, however, defaulted on the stock loans and failed to repay the $130 million they had borrowed. , The manipulation caused GENIs stock price to increase approximately 1,400%, from a low of $1.67 per share (split adjusted) on September 1, 1999 to a high of $25 per share on June 29, 2001.  According to the complaint, key to the manipulation scheme were secret payments GENIs CEO made to Smith to compensate him for touting GENI on television, thereby creating demand for the stock.  The complaint alleges that between December 1999 and April 2001, Smith was secretly paid $95,000 in cash and approximately $1 million worth of GENI stock in exchange for making public statements about GENI on CNBC, CNN, CNNfn and Bloomberg TV.  The complaint alleges that Smith knew or was reckless in not knowing that many of his public statements about GENI shares were false or misleading and lacked any reasonable basis.  The complaint also alleges that Smith disguised his receipt of the $1.1 million by funneling the payments and stock through his girlfriend and her small vitamin exporting company.  Additionally, the complaint alleges that Smith worked as an investment adviser and recommended GENI stocks to certain of his clients without disclosing to them that he had been paid to tout GENI., The Commission charged Smith with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as well as the anti-touting provision, Section 17(b) of the Securities Act.  As relief, the Commission is seeking a permanent injunction, an accounting of all the money that Smith obtained as a result of his illegal conduct, disgorgement (with prejudgment interest), and civil penalties.  , Also today, the United States Attorneys Office for the Central District of California announced related criminal charges against Smith.  , The Commission acknowledges the cooperation of the United States Attorneys Office for the Central District of California and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp19064.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>, <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19064.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Elan also claimed that it was making significant progress towards achieving its goal of transforming itself into a fully integrated pharmaceutical company and generating $5 billion of annual revenue by 2005.  The complaint alleges that these statements were materially misleading because Elan failed to disclose, or inadequately disclosed, certain transactions that were critical to Elans perceived success.

As alleged in the Commissions Complaint, DeSpain disseminated false and misleading information to national credit rating agencies about Enrons business and financial condition.

As part of the settlement agreement, which is subject to the approval of the U.S. District Court, DeSpain will be ordered to pay disgorgement of $300,000, payment of which will be waived based upon his sworn financial statements and other documents submitted to the Commission. , Specifically, the Commissions Complaint alleges the following:  DeSpain, while serving as Enrons Assistant Treasurer from 1999 through the fall of 2001, was directed by his superiors to engage in, and did engage in, conduct that DeSpain recognized was intended to fraudulently manipulate Enrons credit rating.  DeSpain and others at Enron falsely represented to credit rating agencies that Enron was meeting its cash flow targets with cash generated from its operating activities at a time when it was actually experiencing significant shortfalls in cash from operating activities.  DeSpain and others falsely portrayed as cash from operating activities cash generated by Enron from complex structured transactions, known internally as Project Nahanni and prepays.  In Project Nahanni, Enron improperly reported the sale of $500 million of Treasury securities as cash flow from operations.  In prepay transactions, Enron accounted for cash received from financial institutions as operating cash flows, when, in substance, prepays created debt-like obligations.  Over the course of DeSpains tenure as Assistant Treasurer, Enrons obligations under the prepay transactions grew to approximately $5 billion.  Enrons Treasurers directed DeSpain not to reveal the nature and extent of the prepay transactions entered into by Enron to the credit rating agencies, and DeSpain complied with these directions.  , The antifraud provisions DeSpain agreed to be enjoined from violating are Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5.

In its complaint, the Commission alleges that James Tambone, the former president of Columbia Funds Distributor, and Robert Hussey, a former senior sales executive, entered into or approved undisclosed timing arrangements with multiple investors that benefited the executives but were detrimental to long-term fund shareholders. , According to the Commissions complaint, from at least 1998 through 2003, Tambone and Hussey secretly entered or approved arrangements with at least eight investors allowing them to engage in frequent short-term trading in at least six Columbia funds.  The Commissions complaint alleges that, in connection with certain of the arrangements, Tambone and Hussey accepted so-called sticky assets  long-term investments that were to remain in place in return for allowing the investors to actively trade in the funds.  According to the complaint, after entering into these arrangements, the eight investors engaged in frequent short-term or excessive trading in at least sixteen different Columbia mutual funds., The Commissions complaint alleges that Tambone and Hussey acted improperly in entering and accepting the short-term trading arrangements, because the arrangements were never disclosed to long-term fund shareholders or the independent trustees of the funds and in most instances were directly contrary to the disclosures made in the prospectuses used to sell the mutual funds. Six of the eight arrangements were  entered into or continued after Columbia adopted prospectus disclosure for the mutual funds expressly stating that the funds did not permit short-term or excessive trading. , The Commissions complaint further alleges that Tambone and Hussey aided and abetted violations by the funds adviser, Columbia Management Advisors, Inc., which breached its duty to act at all times in the best interests of the Columbia mutual funds and to provide full and fair disclosure of all material facts to investors. Columbia Management Advisors is a registered investment adviser that manages Columbia mutual funds.  Columbia Funds Distributor is a registered broker-dealer that is the principal underwriter and entity responsible for selling the funds.

According to the SECs complaint, Crowley obtained that stock through a variety of means, including issuing stock to his nominees through the filing of a fraudulent Form S-8 registration statement., The SECs complaint also alleged that Crowley had conducted a similar scheme with the stock of another company he controlled, Celebrity Entertainment Group, Inc., in 2001.

(Cox), engaged in insider trading in options for securities of Cox and of Concurrent Computer Corporation (Concurrent), which had a business relationship with Cox.  It further alleges that to carry out the scheme, F. Loomans placed orders to trade in a brokerage account in the name of his father, Luc F. Loomans (L. Loomans), via the Internet using a computer at Cox and by telephone.    At the time of the conduct alleged in the complaint, F. Loomans was a resident of Atlanta, Georgia, while his father resided near Brussels, Belgium., The Commissions complaint alleges that F. Loomans was, by virtue of his then and past positions at Cox, intimately involved in the preparation of Cox quarterly earnings releases, from which he obtained highly sensitive and detailed nonpublic information after the end of each quarter, and through the date and time of each quarterly earnings release.  It further alleges that F. Loomans received material nonpublic information regarding publicly traded companies with which Cox had proposed business transactions such as investments, acquisitions, mergers and significant vendor relationships.  While in possession of material nonpublic information, the Complaint alleges that F. Loomans conducted securities trades in L. Loomans brokerage account which included various purchases and sales of Cox and Concurrent options.  As a result, he illegally gained at least $285,505.  After F. Loomans final sale, L. Loomans initiated instructions which caused virtually all of the funds in his brokerage account to be transferred outside of the United States, and was therefore enriched by that amount., The complaint alleges that by his conduct, F. Loomans violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that L. Loomans was unjustly enriched by the amount in his brokerage account arising from the sales.  The Commission seeks a permanent injunction, accounting, disgorgement, prejudgment interest, civil penalties and an officer and director bar against F. Loomans, and further seeks disgorgement and prejudgment interest from L. Loomans.  , <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp19075.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>, <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19075.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Martin, U.S. District Judge for the Northern District of Georgia, entered an Order on February 10, 2005, temporarily restraining Marion D. Sherrill (Sherrill) from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. The Order also freezes his assets.  , The Commissions complaint, filed on February 9, 2005,  alleges that, from approximately May 2003 through as recently as January 26, 2005, Marion D. Sherrill, a recidivist securities law violator, perpetrated a Ponzi scheme, selling over $400,000 of promissory notes to at least nineteen investors.   While engaging in this Ponzi scheme, Sherrill was a registered representative of an Atlanta-based broker-dealer.  The investors who purchased promissory notes were all brokerage customers of Sherrill and many were retired.   Under the terms of these notes, Sherrill borrowed from his investors  principal amounts ranging from $4,400 to $41,000, in exchange for a promise that he would pay monthly interest of 10% per annum and return to them the notes principal at the end of the notes term-a period of either twelve or twenty-four months.   Sherrill told some of these investors that he would invest their money in his brokerage business in order to expand its operations.  Sherrill told at least one customer that he would invest her money in a tax-free mutual fund, from which she would get monthly tax-free income.  Contrary to his representations, Sherrill did not use investor funds to expand his business operations or to purchase mutual funds.  Instead, he deposited most, if not all, of the note proceeds in his personal bank account, commingled those proceeds with his own money, and paid his living expenses and various operating expenses of his business from the balance.  Sherrill did not disclose to the investors that he paid their monthly interest by using money from new investors and that lacked the capacity to repay the principal without raising new investments., The Commissions complaint seeks to permanently enjoin Sherrill from further violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Commission also seeks an accounting by Sherrill, disgorgement of all ill-gotten gains from the illegal conduct with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp19076.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>, <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19076.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

(FFP), a Fort Worth, Texas-based owner and operator of convenience stores and gas stations whose stock was listed on the American Stock Exchange during the relevant period.  The SEC alleged that Scott committed securities fraud, and that he aided and abetted FFPs violations of SEC reporting rules.  Scott neither admitted nor denied the SECs allegations, but he settled the case by agreeing to pay a civil money penalty of $25,000., In June 2002, according to the SECs complaint, FFP restated its net income for 1999, 2000 and the first three quarters of 2001, as a result of recurrent accounting lapses at the company.  The SEC further alleges that, prior to the restatement, in April and May 2002, Scott prepared, and caused FFP to file with the Commission, notices of late filing (Forms 12b-25), when the company was unable to file periodic reports on time., According to the SECs complaint, the late-filing notices that Scott prepared were false and misleading.  The SEC alleges that the notices fraudulently omitted to disclose that an internal investigation of the companys accounting lapses caused the company to delay filing its periodic reports.  The SEC further alleges that the late-filing notices misrepresented the cause of certain losses that the company said it would report.  According to the SEC, the late-filing notices falsely attributed losses that were actually related to the companys accounting lapses to other business conditions.  The SEC alleges that Scott, by preparing the false and misleading notices of late filing, and causing FFP to file them, violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and aided and abetted FFPs violations of Rules 12b-20 and 12b-25 under the Exchange Act., In addition to settling the SECs civil action, Scott, who is a licensed attorney and CPA, simultaneously settled an SEC administrative proceeding under Rule 102(e)(1)(iii) of the SEC Rules of Practice, by agreeing to the entry of an SEC order denying him the privilege of appearing or practicing before the Commission as an attorney or as an accountant, with a right to apply for reinstatement after three years.  , Scott also settled an SEC cease-and-desist proceeding, by consenting to the entry of an order that he cease and desist from committing or causing violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and from causing violations of Rules 12b-20 and 12b-25 under the Exchange Act.  In the same cease-and-desist proceeding, FFP consented to the entry of an order that it cease and desist from committing or causing violations of reporting, record keeping, and internal controls provisions of the Exchange Act and rules promulgated thereunder, and the companys former controller, Warner Williams, consented to an order that he cease and desist from causing violations of those provisions and rules., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp19077.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>, <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19077.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

InVision was acquired in December 2004 by the General Electric Company, and now operates under the name GE InVision, Inc.; the conduct charged by the Commission occurred prior to the acquisition., In both a federal court complaint and an administrative order, the Commission charged that from at least June 2002 through June 2004, InVision employees, sales agents and distributors pursued transactions to sell explosive detection machines to airports in China, the Philippines and Thailand.  According to the Commission, in each of these transactions, InVision was aware of a high probability that its foreign sales agents or distributors made or offered to make improper payments to foreign government officials in order to obtain or retain business for InVision.  Despite this, InVision allowed the agents or distributors to proceed on its behalf, in violation of the FCPA.  The Commission also charged that InVision improperly accounted for certain payments to agents or distributors and failed to have an adequate system of internal controls to detect and prevent violations of the FCPA., The Commissions administrative order finds that InVision violated the anti-bribery, books and records and internal controls provisions of the FCPA (respectively, Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934).  Without admitting or denying liability or the Commissions findings, InVision agreed to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, cease and desist from violations of the FCPA, and comply with its undertakings to retain an independent consultant to ensure that InVision adheres to a corporate compliance program designed to detect and prevent violations of the FCPA.

(Householder Accounting), and Apex Capital Management Corporation, formerly an investment advisory firm registered with the Commission (Apex Capital).  The Court entered the judgments pursuant to these defendants consent and without their admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions complaint.  The judgments against Householder and Householder Accounting permanently enjoined them from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and, as to Householder only, from violating Sections 206(4) and 207 of the Advisers Act, and Rule 206(4)-4.  The judgment also found Householder and Householder Accounting jointly and severally liable for disgorgement of $2,301,026, plus prejudgment interest thereon, but waived payment of all but $56,870.49 of this amount, and did not impose a civil penalty on these defendants, due to these defendants demonstrated inability to pay.  The judgment against Apex Capital Management Corporation ordered it to pay disgorgement of $96,763.73, plus prejudgment interest on this amount, for a total of $106,877.26.  , The Commissions complaint in this civil action alleged that from 1991 through March 2000, Householder acted as investment adviser to a number of accounting clients and acquaintances, individually and acting through his accounting firm.  Householder recommended that his clients allow him to manage their investments and that they purchase certain securities through him and Householder Accounting, including promissory notes and interests in several investment funds he recommended.  The complaint alleged that in offering these securities, Householder knowingly misrepresented the existence of the entity purportedly issuing the security, the use of proceeds, and the safety of the investment.  Householder then misappropriated the assets his clients gave him to manage and the funds his clients gave him to purchase the securities he recommended they buy.  The complaint also alleged that Householder defrauded the Aapex Equity Fund, a registered investment company that Householder formed in 1998.  Householder made the Aapex Equity Funds investment decisions through Aapex Equity Advisors, Inc., an investment adviser he formed and for which he was president.  The complaint also alleged that on a number of occasions between March and May of 1999, Householder conducted trading on behalf of the Aapex Equity Fund that violated restrictions on concentration of assets and short selling set forth in the Funds offering materials, resulting in the loss of all of the Funds assets.  The Commissions complaint also alleged that Householder formed Apex Capital Management Corporation, an investment advisory firm for which he was Director of Operations and Accounting Director, and then sold securities in Apex Limited Partnership through fraudulent offering documents that misrepresented Householders securities industry background and failed to advise investors of Householders previous disciplinary history.

(Pay Pop), a now-defunct British Columbia-based telecommunications company.  The complaint alleges that, during the period CIBC Mellon acted as Pay Pops transfer agent, one of its senior managers was bribed by two of Pay Pops officers and directors to assist them in obtaining a ready supply of Pay Pop stock for these officers and directors to illegally distribute to investors.  By its failure to have sufficient policies, procedures and internal controls in place, CIBC Mellon failed to detect the bribes, and the illegal conduct, thereby allowing the scheme to succeed.  The complaint further alleges that from 1998 through 2003, CIBC Mellon acted as a transfer agent for at least 113 companies whose securities were registered with the Commission and, from 1998 through the present, CIBC Mellon acted as a broker-dealer for at least 45 of those companies yet never registered with the Commission as a transfer agent, or as a broker-dealer as it was required to do.  Subsequently, on February, 6, 2004, CIBC Mellon registered with the Commission as a transfer agent.  CIBC Mellon Trust further requested that the Commission issue an order exempting it from the broker-dealer registration requirement of Section 15(a).  The Commission has approved this request and will issue an order granting the exemption upon entry of the final judgment in these proceedings., Without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, CIBC Mellon consented to the entry of a final judgment enjoining it from future violations of the antifraud, transfer agent registration, broker-dealer registration and securities registration provisions of the federal securities laws (Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Section 17A of the Exchange Act, Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act and Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933).  CIBC Mellon has agreed to pay a $5 million civil penalty, $889,773 in disgorgement, and $140,270 in prejudgment interest.

In its Complaint, the Commission alleged that Curtiss, the former director of corporate development of Gerber Scientific, Inc. (Gerber), was responsible for locating potential mergers and acquisitions and developing other business opportunities for Gerber.  The Commission further alleged that by January 2000, Curtiss was responsible for coordinating Gerbers efforts to enter into a proposed on-line apparel venture with another company.  This information about the proposed venture was material and nonpublic.  On March 1 and 2, 2000, while he was working on a draft of the press release announcing the proposed on-line apparel venture, Curtiss purchased a total of 2,000 shares of Gerber stock at an average price of $15.375 per share on the basis of the material, nonpublic information.  On March 7, 2000, Gerber made its announcement of the plan to form the proposed venture with another company.  Gerbers stock price increased to $17.4375, up $0.9375 from the previous days close.  Curtiss thus enjoyed a profit at that time of $4,125.   , The Commission further alleged that by March 24, 2000, Curtiss received additional material, nonpublic information indicating that Gerber likely would miss earnings expectations for the quarter ending April 30, 2000.  On the basis of this information, Curtiss sold 2,500 shares of Gerber stock at $20.50 per share.  When Gerber announced its lowered earnings expectation on April 26, 2000, Gerbers stock price dropped to $11.50, down $3.94 from the previous days closing price.  By selling his stock in advance of the April 26, 2000, earnings announcement, Curtiss avoided losses of $22,500.  , The Commission further alleged that, when Curtiss traded, he did so in knowing or reckless disregard that he was trading on the basis of material, nonpublic information in breach of the fiduciary or other duty of trust and confidence that he owed to Gerber and its shareholders.  As a result of his conduct, Curtiss violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5.

The Commission alleges that the Defendants did not disclose to the Ardent Funds investors that Northshore had purchased SCM and that Northshore was managing a significant portion of the Ardent Funds assets.  Additionally, the Defendants made numerous misrepresentations concerning (i) the nature of the investments, (ii) the liquidity of the investments, and (iii) the use of investor funds for undisclosed loans.  For the last several months, the Defendants have refused to honor valid redemption requests from Ardent Domestic investors.       , The complaint charges all the Defendants with violating Section 17 (a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint further charges Northshore and SCM, aided and abetted by Kelley, Wildeman, and Sherman, with violating Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act., In its emergency enforcement action, the Commission is seeking, among other emergency relief, a temporary restraining order (i) freezing the Defendants assets; and (ii) appointing a temporary receiver over Northshore, SCM, Ardent Domestic, and Ardent Offshore.  In addition to this emergency relief, the Commission also seeks orders enjoining the Defendants, preliminarily and permanently, from committing future violations of the foregoing federal securities laws, and a final judgment ordering the Defendants to disgorge ill-gotten gains, and assessing civil penalties.   , The Commission expresses its appreciation to the United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York for their assistance in the investigation of this matter.

(Cromwell), a defunct broker-dealer formerly located in Boca Raton, Beirne is Cromwells former president, and Bush was a Cromwell trader., The Commissions Complaint alleges a short selling scheme in which, from late October 2002 through March 2003, defendants fraudulently used non-existent trades to hide a burgeoning short position in the stock of Expedia, Inc. (Expedia), held in Cromwells proprietary account at its clearing broker, which is located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Hamilton and Miller consented to the entry of Final Judgments against them without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint.  The Court enjoined Miller and Hamilton from further violations of  Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act, and Sections 10(b) and 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Final Judgment against Miller requires him to pay a civil penalty of $39,999 and disgorgement of $1.00.  The Final Judgment against Hamilton waives payment of disgorgement and did not impose a civil penalty, based on Hamiltons sworn statement of financial condition and other information furnished to the Commission.  Finally, in separate administrative proceedings, Hamilton and Miller also consented to orders permanently barring them from association with any broker or dealer.  See In the Matter of Harold Miller, Admin. Proc. File No. 3-11811 (February 8, 2005) and In the Matter of Scott Hamilton, Admin. Proc. File No. 3-11778 (December 20, 2004). , The Commission filed the complaint in this matter on June 6, 2003.   The Commissions complaint alleged that Hamilton and Miller -- through oral representations and written offering materials distributed to investors through a network of brokers --  falsely represented that:  (1) investors funds would be used to trade Medium Term Notes (MTNs) on a secret market; (2) MTN trading would yield returns averaging 100 percent per week; (3) investors funds would be pooled at Valenvalls, an allegedly insured financial institution that would pay an additional 20 percent return (over and above the guaranteed 100 percent per week); and (4) the VV-PP was fed controlled and subject to International Monetary Fund rules and regulations.  , According to the complaint, after having potential investors referred from Hamilton and Miller, Patten sent the potential investors promotional materials about Valenvalls, which falsely represented that:  (1) investors would receive individual accounts at Valenvalls, promoted as an international financeria that could trade bonds, currency, real estate, and securities, and (2) Valenvalls would pay investors a 20 percent return on their investment (over and above the guaranteed 100 percent per week).  The complaint also alleged that Patten sent investors account statements falsely indicating that their funds were earning 20 percent in individual Valenvalls accounts.  Ultimately, the complaint alleged, the defendants lulled investors with misrepresentations that the VV-PP was proceeding as planned, when in fact Patten had diverted investors funds to her personal use.

Goodman, age 41, of North Andover, Massachusetts, charging him with three counts of investment adviser fraud, three counts of securities fraud, and five counts of wire fraud. , The Indictment alleges that between February and August 2000, Goodman obtained and then misappropriated $700,000 through two fraudulent investment schemes offered through his investment advisory business, New England Capital Advisory Group, LLC., The first scheme involved a fictitious initial public offering pool (the IPO Pool).  Goodman collected $500,000 from two investors after falsely representing that he would use their funds to obtain stock in initial public offerings underwritten by five investment banks during a specified period. Goodman falsely claimed that his firm would and had opened accounts at each of the five investment banks and that because of his special relationship with each investment bank, the accounts would receive allotments of shares in the IPOs the banks underwrote.  Goodman told the investors that he would be able to sell the IPO shares immediately at a profit, with minimal risk.  In fact, neither Goodman nor his firm established any such accounts with the investment banks, and when he received the funds from the investors, he did not invest the funds in IPOs.  Instead, he used the funds to engage in day trading, to pay other clients, and to pay himself. , The second scheme involved a false arbitrage opportunity in the internet company, Lycos, Inc. (Lycos).  In that scheme, Goodman falsely represented to one of the IPO Pool investors that he has created an investment strategy in which New England Capital would buy stock in Lycos and use options to minimize the risk that Lycos stock would decline in value.  Goodman collected an additional $200,000 from that investor.  Goodman, however, did not invest the money as he represented.  He had no arbitrage strategy.  He did not even buy Lycos stock with the investors $200,000.  Instead, as he had done with the IPO Pool funds, he used the funds to pay other clients and to pay himself., If convicted, Goodman faces a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment and a $1 million fine on each securities fraud count; 5 years imprisonment and a $10,000 fine on each investment adviser fraud count; and 5 years imprisonment and a $250,000 fine on each wire fraud count.   The details contained in the Indictment are allegations.  The defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law., On September 29, 2004, the District Court for the District of Massachusetts entered a final judgment against Goodman in the Commissions civil injunctive action finding that, in connection with the same investment scheme alleged in the indictment, he violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Advisers Act and imposing a $220,000 civil penalty. The court had previously entered an order permanently enjoining Goodman from violating those provisions. , On October 13, 2004, the Commission issued an Order instituting Administrative Proceedings and Notice of Hearing pursuant to Section 203 (f) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 against Goodman.  Subsequently, on November 19, 2004,  the Commission obtained an order by default barring Goodman from association with an investment adviser., For further information, please see Litigation Release <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr16875.htm>No. 16875</a> (January 30, 2001); Investment Advisers Act of 1949 Release No. 2313 (October 13, 2004);  and Investment Advisers Act of 1949 Release No. 2330 (November 19, 2004)., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp19097.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>, <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19097.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Jeffreys, Timothy F. Bell and Tracy A. Edwards.  The Commissions complaint alleges that Jeffreys, the founder and then-president, CEO, and CFO of Earthboard, a privately held, Costa Mesa, California-based manufacturer of all-terrain skateboards and Bell and Edwards, two former registered representatives, fraudulently offered and sold stock of Earthboard Sports USA, Inc.  From April 1998 to March 2003, Earthboard, in an unregistered offering, raised approximately $5.1 million from at least 66 individuals and entities.  Jeffreys, Bell and Edwards enticed investors to purchase Earthboard shares using a number of materially false statements including the claim that Vans Inc., a Nasdaq-traded footwear company, planned to acquire Earthboard in a one-for-one share exchange that would generate a windfall of as much as $24 for each dollar invested in Earthboard stock.  In reality, Vans never had any intention to acquire Earthboard and had never expressed any interest in acquiring Earthboard.   , The complaint alleges that, in one instance, Jeffreys, Bell and Edwards defrauded an elderly couple of at least $455,000.  Bell and Edwards went as far as arranging for the couple to mortgage their paid-off home to buy Earthboard stock; the couple ultimately lost their home when the promised profits from their Earthboard investment failed to materialize and they could not afford to make the mortgage payments.  , The complaint further alleges that Jeffreys misappropriated at least $1.9 million of investor funds, using stock sale proceeds to buy a waterfront home in Newport Beach, three undeveloped plots in a residential community in Lake Havasu, Arizona, a house in his girlfriends name, and a thirty-foot fishing boat and accompanying mooring on Santa Catalina Island., The Commissions action seeks permanent injunctions, orders of disgorgement and civil penalties against Earthboard and Jeffreys for violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as an officer and director bar against Jeffreys.

At the time of the conduct alleged in the complaint, Warren was a part time resident of, and Exo-Brain was located in, Chattanooga, Tennessee.  Warren controlled E-Brain LLC and Exo-Brain.  The complaint alleged that in offering documents, the defendants falsely claimed to have developed a working prototype that could be used to make computers more user friendly, by enabling a person to operate a computer with voice command, and in numerous foreign languages.  The defendants also falsely represented that the company had built a launch product or commercially available product when no such product existed, and also misrepresented, among other things, the companys financial situation. , The complaint alleged that the offerings of E-Brain LLC should be integrated into a single unregistered offering because, in part, the offerings did not cease for more than a six month period of time, the sales of securities by E-Brain LLC all shared the same purpose-to fund the software development business controlled by Warren, and E-Brain LLC was involved in a single plan of financing.

The Commission’s Complaint, which was filed in September 2000, alleges that eleven individuals and four entities engaged in insider trading in the securities of U.S. Shoe Corp. and Luxottica S.p.A. before the March 3, 1995 public announcement that Luxottica was commencing a hostile tender offer for U.S. Shoe.  The Complaint alleges that Adrian Alexander obtained information about Luxottica’s secret plans to launch a tender offer for U.S. Shoe from Susi Belli, the Manager of Investor and Public Relations for Luxottica, who was then Alexander’s girlfriend and is now his wife.  According to the Complaint, Alexander tipped others, including his then business partner Patrick J.

The nominal disgorgement allows the Commission to deposit the civil penalty into a distribution fund under Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.  In addition, the court approved the parties’ stipulation dismissing Belli, who did not trade in U.S. Shoe securities, from this action.  , Earlier in this case, on June 13, 2003, Pavel Hillel consented to the entry of a final judgment: (1) permanently enjoining him from violating Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder; (2) ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $6,375; and (3) ordering him to pay disgorgement of $6,375 plus prejudgment interest of $5,434.83.

(“CDC”) and its chief executive officer Shelby E. Ball alleging that they engaged in a fraudulent distribution of unregistered stock.  CDC is a Delaware corporation based in Bloomfield, New Mexico, which purports to be in the business of supplying compressors for use in the production and distribution of natural gas.  CDC’s stock is not registered with the Commission and is quoted on the National Quotation Bureau Pink Sheets.  According to the complaint, Ball, who lives in Dallas, Texas, worked with a group of stock promoters to cause CDC to issue stock to a purported accredited investor under Rule 504 of Regulation D.  The complaint further alleges that the accredited investor was actually a conduit for the subsequent transfer of the stock to the promoters who sold it to the public, using the Pink Sheets to generate quotations for the stock.  The promoters generated over $4.6 million through their public distribution of CDC stock, and returned $737,000 of the proceeds to CDC., The complaint alleges that while the distribution was occurring, Ball created and distributed to the public 18 press releases that included false and misleading information about the company.  Among other things, these press releases falsely claimed that CDC’s innovative compressor system was available to the public and that CDC would receive revenue from compressors currently operating, when in fact the company did not have any compressors ready for sale or in operation, but simply had plans to develop and manufacture compressors if sufficient funds were raised from investors.  They also claimed that CDC had received an order to place compressors on ten wells owned by a major natural gas producer, when in fact no such order existed, and that CDC owned an inventory of compressor parts worth $600,000 to $800,000 when in fact CDC had purchased the parts at an auction for $50,000.  The complaint also alleges that CDC and Ball filed a Form D with the Commission that made numerous false and misleading statements about the nature of CDC’s stock offering., The complaint alleges that CDC’s stock climbed from an initial trading price of $.50 per share to $9.00 per share (split adjusted) while the fraudulent press releases were publicly distributed.  CDC then issued a series of clarifying press releases beginning October 22, 2004, acknowledging inaccuracies in the items discussed above.  When this information was made public, CDC’s stock price collapsed to $.20 per share., CDC and Ball are charged with violating the securities registration provisions of the federal securities laws, Sections 5(a) and (c) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”), and the antifraud provisions, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The Commission’s contempt motion alleges that Desaigoudar still owes over $300,000, and seeks incarceration or additional monetary penalties to enforce compliance with the judgment. , The Commission originally sued Desaigoudar in August 1998, alleging that Cal Micro’s then-CEO and Chairman participated in a scheme to fraudulently overstate the revenues of the once high-flying Silicon Valley technology firm, while illegally pocketing hundreds of thousands of dollars by selling Cal Micro shares before the fraud was uncovered.  In separate criminal proceedings brought by the United States Attorney for the Northern District of California, Desaigoudar pled guilty to, and was sentenced for, insider trading in Cal Micros stock., Following a three-day bench trial in December 2003, Judge Walker issued an Order finding that Desaigoudar played a central role in the fraudulent scheme to inflate Cal Micro’s revenue, and that Desaigoudar avoided losses of $573,000 by selling Cal Micro stock that he knew was fraudulently inflated in value.  The Court ordered Desaigoudar to pay over $1 million in penalties, as well as prejudgment interest of $308,428.

Specifically, the Commission alleges that Quinn drafted filings that he made with the Commission on behalf of PHC Holdings, a Nevada corporation with its principal place of business in Orlando, Florida, and that he acted as agent and counsel for PHC.

In its Complaint, the Commission alleged that Ek was a close friend of Robert Goehring (“Goehring”), Gerber’s director of corporate communications.  In his capacity as director of corporate communications, Goehring received material, nonpublic information about earnings results and other significant corporate developments at Gerber.  Ek both bought and sold Gerber stock on three occasions based on tips of material, nonpublic information about Gerber that Goehring provided.  Ek had profits and avoided losses totaling $11,438.  , The Commission alleged that Goehring learned by July 1, 1998, that Gerber was anticipating a sharp increase in earnings for the quarter ending July 31, 1998.  This information about Gerber’s anticipated earnings was material and nonpublic.  Prior to July 22, 1998, Goehring communicated information about Gerber’s anticipated first quarter earnings to Ek.

Ek thus enjoyed a profit of $640.   , The Commission further alleged that by the last week of February 2000, Goehring learned that Gerber was going to announce a proposed on-line apparel venture with another company.  This information was material and nonpublic.  Prior to March 2, 2000, Goehring communicated information about the announcement to Ek.  On March 2, 2000, Ek purchased 1,000 shares of Gerber stock at $14.9375 per share on the basis of this information.  On March 7, 2000, Gerber announced its plan to form the on-line apparel venture.  Gerber’s stock price closed that day at $17.4375 per share, up $0.9375 from the previous day’s closing price.  Ek thus enjoyed profits of $2,500 from his trade., The Commission also alleged that by March 23, 2000, Goehring was aware that Gerber was likely to miss earnings expectations for the fourth quarter of its 2000 fiscal year.  After learning this information, and prior to March 24, 2000, Ek’s friend communicated material, nonpublic information about Gerber’s likely fourth quarter earnings miss to Ek.  On March 24, 2000, Ek sold 1,000 shares of Gerber stock at $19.8125 per share on the basis of this information.  When Gerber announced that its fourth quarter results would likely be lower than expected on April 26, 2000, Gerber’s stock price closed that day at $11.50 per share, down $3.93 from the previous day’s closing price.  Ek thus  avoided losses of $8,313 by trading in advance of the April 26, 2000, earnings announcement., The Commission alleged that on each of the three occasions, Goehring knowingly or recklessly communicated the material, nonpublic information to Ek in breach of the duty of trust and confidence that he owed to Gerber and its shareholders.  Ek knew or should have known that he was trading on the basis of material, nonpublic information that Goehring communicated to him in breach of that duty of trust and confidence.  , As a result of his conduct, Ek violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission’s Complaint, Ek consented to the entry of a judgment (i) permanently enjoining him from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, (ii) ordering disgorgement of profits and losses avoided of $11,438 plus prejudgment interest of $3,511, and (iii) imposing a civil penalty of $10,798 pursuant to Section 21A of the Exchange Act., Separately, the Commission announced today that it filed a contested insider trading case in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut against Robert Goehring (SEC v.

Robert Goehring</i>, Civil Action No. 3:05-CV-350 (AWT ) (D.Conn. filed February 28, 2005)</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it filed a contested insider trading case in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut against Robert Goehring.  In its Complaint, the Commission alleged that Goehring, age 64, was the director of corporate communications of Gerber Scientific, Inc. (“Gerber”).   In this position, Goehring reported directly to Gerbers president and chief executive officer.  Goehrings duties included helping prepare company press releases – including those announcing earnings and other material corporate developments – and serving as the companys investor relations contact. While serving as director of corporate communications, Goehring regularly obtained material, non-public information about Gerber.   Between July 1998 and April 2000, Goehring traded in the Gerber stock nine times on the basis of material, nonpublic information he obtained in the course of his employment as Gerbers director of corporate communications.  Goehring enjoyed profits and avoided losses from these illicit trades of $94,016.  In addition, Goehring tipped his close friend, Armund Ek, who was not employed at Gerber, with material, non-public information about Gerber on three occasions.  Ek bought and sold Gerber stock based on these tips and had profits and avoided losses totaling $11,453 as a result of his trading.  , The Complaint alleges that as a member of Gerbers management leadership team, Goehring attended officers meetings where material, non-public information about Gerber was discussed.  At these meetings, Gerbers general counsel frequently stressed that there was not to be any trading of Gerber stock based on inside information, and that members of the leadership management team should consult with him before electing to trade in Gerber stock.  In addition, from as early as November 1998, Goehring received confidential monthly letters which Gerbers subsidiaries sent to Gerbers president and CEO.  These letters frequently contained earnings, earnings projections, and other material, non-public information about Gerber. , In summary, the Complaint alleges that Goehring bought and sold Gerber stock nine times in advance of company announcements. Specifically, Goehring bought in advance of positive quarterly earnings and other favorable company announcements on four occasions. The complaint alleges that Goehring traded in advance of the August 20, 1998; November 19, 1998; May 27, 1999; February 17, 2000 announcements.  Goehring tipped his friend Ek who also traded in advance of the August 20, 1998 earnings announcement.  Goehring also purchased Gerber stock on February 23, 2000, March 1, and March 3, 2000 in advance of Gerber’s March 7, 2000 announcement that it planned to form an on-line apparel venture.  Goehring also tipped his friend Ek who bought Gerber stock on March 2, 2000.  Finally, prior to Gerber’s public announcement on April 26, 2000 that its fourth quarter results would be lower than expected, Goehring liquidated his entire position in Gerber and sold short shares of  Gerber stock.  Goehring tipped Ek who also liquidated his entire position in Gerber. , The Commission complaint alleges that because of his position with Gerber, Goehring owed a fiduciary duty, or other duty of trust or confidence owed directly, indirectly or derivatively to Gerber and its shareholders.  This included a duty to not trade Gerber shares on the basis of material, non-public information and to not communicate such information improperly to others. By engaging in insider trading and by tipping his friend Ek with material non-public information about Gerber, Goehring violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”).  The Commission seeks a judgment against Goehring: a) enjoining him from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, b) ordering Goehring to disgorge the profits and losses avoided by himself and his tippee as a result of the unlawful trading, c) imposing a monetary penalty, and d) imposing an officer and director bar. , Separately, the Commission announced today that it filed a settled insider trading case in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Armund Ek (No. 05 CV 2425 (SWK)), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr19104.htm>Lit.

Simultaneously with the filing of the Commissions complaint, and without admitting or denying its allegations, Titan consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of the FCPA and requiring it (i) to pay $15.479 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, (ii) to pay a $13 million penalty, which will be deemed satisfied by Titans payment of criminal fines of that amount in parallel proceedings brought by the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of California and the U.S. Department of Justice, Fraud Section, and (iii) to retain an independent consultant to review the companys FCPA compliance and procedures and to adopt and implement the consultants recommendations.  , The Commissions complaint alleges that, from 1999 to 2001, Titan paid more than $3.5 million to its agent in Benin, Africa, who was known at the time by Titan to be the President of Benins business advisor.  Titan failed to conduct any meaningful due diligence into the background of its agent either before his retention or thereafter and also failed to ensure that the services alleged to be performed by the agent, and described in his invoices, were in fact provided to Titan.  The complaint alleges, in 2001, at the direction of at least one former senior Titan officer based in the United States, Titan funneled approximately $2 million, via its agent in Benin, towards the election campaign of Benins then-incumbent President.  The complaint also alleges that some of these funds were used to reimburse Titans agent for the purchase to T-shirts adorned with the Presidents picture and instructions to vote for him in the upcoming election.  According to the complaint, Titan made these payments to assist the company in its development of a telecommunications project in Benin and to obtain the Benin governments consent to an increase in the percentage of Titans project management fees for that project.  The complaint alleges that a former senior Titan officer directed that these payments be falsely invoiced by the agent as consulting services and that actual payment of the money be broken into smaller increments and spread out over time.  The complaint does not allege that the then-incumbent President knew of the payments.  , The Commissions complaint also alleges that, from 1999 to 2003, Titan improperly recorded payments in its books and records, directed agents to falsify invoices submitted to Titan, and failed to devise or maintain an effective system of internal controls to prevent or detect other FCPA violations.  Despite utilizing over 120 agents and consultants in over 60 countries, Titan never had a formal company-wide FCPA policy, failed to implement an FCPA compliance program, disregarded or circumvented the limited FCPA policies and procedures in effect, failed to maintain sufficient due diligence files on its foreign agents, and failed to have meaningful oversight over its foreign agents. , According to the complaint, Titan falsified documents that enabled its agents to under-report local commission payments in Nepal, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Titan falsified documents presented to the United States government by under-reporting payments on equipment exported to Sri Lanka, France and Japan.  The complaint also alleges that Titan (i) paid a World Bank Group analyst in cash to assist Titan in its project in Benin, and (ii) paid a Benin government official approximately $14,000 in travel expenses from 1999 to 2001.  , Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Titan has consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder.  Titan also has agreed to disgorge $12,620,000, and to pay prejudgment interest thereon in the amount of $2,859,195.47.  Under the terms of the final judgment, Titan will also retain an independent consultant to review the companys FCPA compliance and procedures and will adopt and implement the consultants recommendations.  , Also today the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of California and the U.S. Department of Justice, Fraud Section filed criminal FCPA charges and a tax charge against Titan, who entered a guilty plea before the Honorable Roger T. Benitez, United States District Judge for the Southern District of California (United States of America v. Titan Corporation, Case No.05cr0314-BEN (S.D. Cal.)).  In particular, Titan agreed to plead guilty to one felony count of violating the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA, one felony count for falsifying the books and records of Titan, and one felony count for violating Title 26 U.S.C. Section 7206(2) and to pay a criminal fine of $13 million., The Commission also today issued a Report of Investigation pursuant to Section 21(a) of the Exchange Act to provide guidance concerning potential liability under the antifraud and proxy provisions of the federal securities laws for publication of materially false or misleading disclosures regarding provisions in merger and other contractual agreements.  , In its Report, the Commission stated that, on September 15, 2003, Titan became a party to a merger agreement with Lockheed Martin Corporation (Lockheed) in which Lockheed agreed to acquire Titan, pending certain contingencies.  Titan affirmatively represented in that merger agreement that to the knowledge of Titan, neither the company nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any director, officer, agent or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, has  taken any action which would cause the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to be in violation of the FCPA.  This representation was publicly disclosed and disseminated by Titan in two places.  The proxy statement disclosed the nature of the representation.  The merger agreement containing the representation was also appended to Titans proxy statement, which was filed with the Commission and sent to Titans shareholders.    , As the Report highlights, when an issuer makes a public disclosure of information -- via filing a proxy statement or otherwise -- the issuer is required to consider whether additional disclosure is necessary in order to put the information contained in, or otherwise incorporated into that publication, into context so that such information is not misleading.  The issuer cannot avoid this disclosure obligation simply because the information published was contained in an agreement or other document not prepared as a disclosure document.  , The Report is not intended to change the way issuers engage in merger, or other contractual, negotiations or to alter existing diligence obligations or to suggest, absent special circumstances (such as provisions intended to create third party beneficiaries), that provisions such as representations and covenants in such agreements are binding on or intended to benefit persons other than parties thereto.  Representations, covenants, or other provisions of an agreement made by an issuer that are not public or disclosed to shareholders are not covered by the scope of this Report. , The Commission will consider bringing an enforcement action under Sections 10(b) and 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 14a-9 thereunder in the future if it determines that the subject matter of representations or other contractual provisions is materially misleading to shareholders because material facts necessary to make that disclosure not misleading are omitted. , The Commission acknowledges the assistance in this investigation from the Department of Justice, Fraud Section; the United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of California; the Federal Bureau of Investigation, San Diego Division; the Internal Revenue Service, Criminal Investigations; and the Department of Defense Inspector Generals Office, Defense Criminal Investigative Service.  , The Commissions investigation is continuing., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp19107.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a><br/><img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/investreport/34-51238.htm>Report of Investigation</a>, <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19107.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

AND ITS CEO AND CFO IN ACCOUNTING-FRAUD SCHEME</h2>]","[On February 28, 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil securities-fraud case in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas (Houston Division) against Humatech, Inc., and its CEO, David G. Williams, 55, and CFO, John D. Rottweiler, 60.  Humatech is a fertilizer and animal-feed additive company whose common stock trades under the ticker symbol HUMT on the OTC Bulletin Board.   At the time of the alleged violations, Humatech was based in Houston, Texas.  The SEC charged Williams and Rottweiler with financial fraud and other securities-law violations related to a bogus revenue-recognition scheme that materially inflated Humatechs assets and revenue from 2000 through 2002. , According to the SECs complaint, in January and October 2000, Humatech improperly recorded two sales totaling $297,640 to Humatech Ltd., a United Kingdom distributor that Williams and Rottweiler secretly controlled.  These purported sales, however, were contingent on the distributor reselling the product to a U.K. purchaser.  The distributor did not resell the product, and, consequently, Humatech failed to ship the products to the U.K.  Given the contingent nature of the transactions, they did not qualify for revenue recognition under generally accepted accounting principles.  , As a result of the improper revenue recognition, Humatech materially overstated its revenue or assets or both in each quarterly and annual SEC report from January 31, 2000, through the quarter ended October 31, 2002.  For example, the initial sale, in the amount of $277,640, represented 100% of the companys revenue for the third quarter of fiscal year 2000.  And accounts receivable relating to the initial improper sale comprised approximately 63% of the companys assets in the same quarter and approximately 42% of the assets reported in Humatechs annual report for fiscal year 2000.   Further, the companys SEC reports, which were also incorporated by reference in five SEC registration statements, never properly disclosed the related-party nature of the two purported sales., On February 13 and 24, 2003, Humatech issued restatements for each reporting period from January 31, 2000, through the quarter ended October 31, 2002.  The restatements reduced revenue by $277,640 in fiscal year 2000 and by $20,000 in fiscal year 2001 and wrote off related assets in those periods.  Likewise, the restatements wrote off related assets for fiscal year 2002 and for the first and second quarters of fiscal year 2003.  The company, however, did not disclose that, from the outset, delivery and payment on these purported sales were contingent upon resale of the product by Humatech Ltd.  Instead, the amended filings falsely stated that an epidemic of foot-and-mouth disease in U.K. cattle herds interrupted ongoing delivery of the product.  In reality, the foot-and-mouth epidemic, which began in February 2001, occurred over a year after the first purported sale, and none of the product had been delivered before the outbreak.  , The SECs complaint against Williams, Rottweiler, and Humatech, alleges violations of the anti-fraud, issuer-reporting, books-and-records, internal-controls, officer-certification, and lying-to-auditor provisions of the federal securities laws-specifically, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2), and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, 13a-14, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder.

Christie, age 50, of Palm Springs, California, was vice president of advertising at AMS from 1997 through 2004.  , The SECs complaint, filed today in federal court in San Diego, alleges that Christie participated in schemes to improperly manipulate AMSs earnings.  These schemes were carried out primarily through AMSs advertising department.  The complaint alleges that the fraudulent schemes caused AMS to overstate its pre-tax earnings by about 9% in fiscal year 2001, 10% in fiscal year 2002, and 19% in fiscal year 2003.  , The complaint alleges that AMS fraudulently overstated its earnings through two schemes.  An advertising service that AMS provides to publishers is to print and mail advertising vehicles - such as inserts, catalogs, and post-cards - for books the publishers produce.  The first scheme alleged by the complaint involved the improper recognition of revenue on more advertising vehicles than AMS had in fact produced.  As a result, AMS recorded revenue for these services contrary to generally accepted accounting principles, and thereby improperly overstated its earnings. , The complaint further alleges that Christie participated in a scheme to increase AMSs income by improperly reversing certain accrued liabilities relating to retail cooperative advertising.  AMS recorded liabilities for credits that it expected retailers to take for certain advertising and promotional services that the retailers provided.  When the retailers did not take the credits due to them, instead of contacting the retailers and reconciling amounts, Christie directed advertising and sales personnel to hide the discrepancies from the retailers, so that AMS could improperly reverse the liability and thereby decrease expenses and increase its income. , Christie profited from her participation in the fraudulent schemes from her receipt of annual bonuses and sales of AMS stock, which totaled more than $72,000.  , The complaint alleges that Christie violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws (Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder), aided and abetted the periodic reporting requirements (Sections 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder), aided and abetted the record-keeping provisions (Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder), and violated the books and records provisions (Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act).  The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of all ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer and director bar against Christie., The SEC previously filed a complaint in federal court in San Diego against Marcy Wilson Roke, the former director of advertising at AMS, for her participation in schemes to improperly inflate the earnings of AMS.

(Suprema), with violating the antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws in connection with his participation in a $700 million multi-year fraud orchestrated by Supremas senior management.   Prior to its delisting in early 2002, Suprema -- a Paterson, New Jersey-based cheese manufacturer -- was a public company whose securities traded on the NASDAQ National Market System.   Gaglio settled the charges without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint. , 	In its complaint, the Commission alleges that, from at least 1998 through February 2002, when Suprema filed for bankruptcy, Suprema engaged in round-tripping transactions that generated approximately $700 million in fictitious sales revenue, or approximately 60% of Supremas total reported revenue of approximately $1.13 billion over the relevant time period.  The complaint alleges that the round-tripping transactions were effectuated through circles of entities, each of which included Suprema, a third-party customer, and a related vendor.   As the complaint alleges, the customer and vendor in each circle tended to have a common owner.  The complaint alleges that false paperwork was created documenting the fictitious transactions, and checks were circulated in purported payment for the transactions.  Participants allegedly received a kick-back or commission on each transaction, the funds for which were drawn on Supremas line of credit, which increased as Supremas accounts receivable grew.  With rare exception, the complaint alleges, no goods were actually sold, purchased, or exchanged in these transactions. , The Commission further alleges that Gaglio participated in the fraudulent scheme as an operator and part owner of entities that engaged as customers or vendors in round-tripping transactions with Suprema.  The complaint alleges that these entities, most of which are now defunct, included A&amp;J Cheese Company, Noble J.G. Cheese, LLC, California Goldfield Cheese Trading, LLC, and Wall Street Cheese, LLC as Suprema customers, and other entities, including Whitehall Specialties, Inc., as Suprema vendors.  For their participation in the scheme, the complaint alleges that the participating entities received payments of one to two cents per pound of cheese purportedly sold., In furtherance of the scheme, Gaglio, through his entities, also allegedly shipped sizeable quantities of artificial cheese to Suprema at fiscal year end which Suprema then relabeled as higher priced cheese products which the company used to support inflated inventory figures on Supremas books and records during the year-end audit by Supremas external auditors.  Gaglio also allegedly signed false audit confirmations that were provided to Supremas independent auditors. , The complaint further alleges that of Supremas $1.13 billion in reported revenue during the period 1998 through the first quarter of 2002, approximately $359 million, or 32%, was attributable to the fictitious transactions with Gaglio.  The complaint alleges that Supremas fictitious transactions with Gaglio accounted for approximately 10%, 23%, 34%, 38%, and 38% of the revenue reported by Suprema in its filings with the Commission for the fiscal years 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, and the first quarter of 2002, respectively. , Based on these allegations, the Commission charged Gaglio with: (i) securities fraud in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5; (ii) aiding and abetting Supremas violations of the periodic reporting, books and records, and internal accounting controls provisions of Exchange Act Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13; and (iii) aiding and abetting misrepresentations by Supremas officers and directors to the companys accountants in violation of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-2. , Without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions complaint, Gaglio consented to entry of a final judgment that would: (i) permanently enjoin him from future violations of the provisions of the federal securities laws charged in the complaint; (ii) permanently bar him from serving as an officer or director of a public company; and (iii) defer the imposition of any disgorgement, interest, or civil penalties until decided by the Court, upon motion by the Commission at a later date., 	Previously, in January 2004, the Commission filed securities fraud and related charges against the former controller, former operations manager, and several former customers and vendors of Suprema in federal district court for the District of New Jersey for their participation in the financial fraud at Suprema.  See Securities and Exchange Commission v. Robert Quattrone, et al., Civil Action No. 04-33(SRC) (D.N.J.) (Lit. Rel. No. 18534 (January 7, 2004)).  All of the defendants to that action have settled with the Commission. , Also today, in a related proceeding, the United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey filed criminal charges against Gaglio.  At a plea hearing in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey held earlier today, Gaglio plead guilty to one count of securities fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, mail fraud, and bank fraud, and to make false statements to auditors.

Brant (Brant) violated a previous Commission order barring him from the securities industry by acting as an investment adviser to six customers of Deutsche Banc Alex Brown, Inc., now known as Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. (Deutsche Banc).  The Complaint alleges that while acting as an investment adviser in violation of the terms of the Commissions Order, Brant misappropriated client funds for his personal use, made unsuitable and unauthorized investment decisions, and traded in speculative stocks.  The Complaint alleges that as a result of his fraud, Brant obtained at least $173,402.80 and caused his clients accounts to drop dramatically in value.  , Brant, without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, has agreed to a final judgment:  (i) permanently enjoining him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers Act); (ii) ordering him, pursuant to Section 21(e) of the Exchange Act, to comply with the administrative bar order previously entered against him; (iii) ordering him to pay disgorgement of $173,402.80, plus prejudgment interest thereon; and (iv) ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $3 million.  Brant has also agreed to a Commission order pursuant to Section 203(f) of the Advisers Act permanently barring him from associating with an investment adviser., In a related action filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, the Commission alleged in its Complaint that Richard W. DeBoe (DeBoe), while employed as a registered representative at Deutsche Banc, engaged in fraudulent conduct in customer accounts and aided and abetted the fraudulent conduct in these same accounts by Brant.  According to the Complaint, DeBoe, a former colleague and social friend of Brant, knew of Brants conviction for felony securities fraud.  Between 1998 and 1999, DeBoe opened four new accounts at Deutsche Banc for customers referred to him by Brant.  The Complaint further alleges that each of the customers gave Brant trading authority.  According to the Complaint, Brants role as investment adviser and his acceptance of fees for these services violated his bar from the securities industry, which was known by DeBoe or he was reckless in not knowing.  , Finally, the Complaint alleges that once the accounts were opened, DeBoe gave free rein to Brant over the accounts, participated with Brant in churning the accounts, violated explicit instructions from customers, and allowed Brant to misappropriate funds from DeBoes customer accounts for Brants own use.  This fraudulent conduct generated substantial commissions for DeBoe, who before opening these accounts referred by Brant, had been a low producer who earned relatively low commission income., The Commissions Complaint seeks a judgment against DeBoe: (i) permanently enjoining him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, permanently enjoining him from violating and aiding and abetting violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Advisers Act; (ii) ordering him to disgorge all unjust enrichment by reason of the conduct described in the Complaint plus prejudgment interest thereon; and (iii) awarding civil monetary penalties. , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19113.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Sutton.  The Commission charged Isaac Sutton, 55, with violating the federal securities laws by making false public statements regarding the financial condition of Happiness Express Incorporated (Happiness Express), a designer, developer, and manufacturer of toys and childrens room decorations located in New York, New York.  , The Commission alleged at trial that, while Happiness Express Chief Operating Officer and its Head of Sales, Isaac Sutton falsely overstated Happiness Express sales results in the companys fiscal year 1995 Form 10-K filed with the Commission.  Specifically, the Commission alleged that Isaac Sutton falsely stated in the Form 10-K that Happiness Express total sales for its 1995 fiscal year were over $60 million, when, in reality, the companys total fiscal year 1995 sales were $52 million.  Isaac Sutton admitted at trial that he signed the Form 10-K, and that the Form 10-K falsely overstated Happiness Express sales by $8 million.  Isaac Sutton, however, denied having had any knowledge of the falsity of the sales figures at the time that he signed the Form 10-K.  , The Commission charged Isaac Sutton with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act (Exchange Act), and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.

The SECs amended complaint alleges that in 1999 Houston-based Reliant Resources, Inc. overstated its revenues by over $1.4 billion by engaging in a series of fictitious round-trip power and natural gas trades.  The complaint alleges that Pallas, Reliants former head of energy trading, was instrumental in orchestrating the round-trip trades and was the most senior Reliant officer to approve them.  , According to the complaint, Reliant in 1999 entered into five round-trip power trades totaling 29.75 million megawatt hours with three counterparties:  PanCanadian Energy Services, Inc., Merchant Energy Group of the Americas, Inc., and Public Service Company of Colorado.  Reliant also entered into a round-trip gas trade for 182 billion cubic feet with Cokinos Energy.  In total, the 1999 round-trip trades added over $1.4 billion in gross revenue and expenses to Reliants books.  , The complaint alleges that, because Reliant reported its trades on a gross basis, the round-trip trades inflated Reliants revenues by 17.7% in 1999.   In addition to recording inaccurate revenues, Reliant allegedly published inflated trading volumes in its annual and quarterly reports and included the overstated volumes and revenues in prospectuses and registration statements filed in anticipation of securities offerings.  , The complaint alleges that Pallas led the effort to devise Reliants round-trip trading program, and that she explicitly approved the trades.  According to the complaint, Pallas understood that the round-trip trades would create a misleading impression of Reliants energy trading operations and intended the trades to have that effect., The complaint charges Pallas with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and for aiding and abetting Reliant Resources, Inc.s and Reliant Energy, Inc.s violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder.

TALX met its 2001 financial targets and increased its stock price, however, through intentional and unintentional accounting misstatements.  , TALXs intentional misstatements involved an improper bill and hold transaction and other premature revenue recognition; capitalizing costs relating to a patent infringement claim that should have been expensed; and expensing executive bonuses in the wrong period.  As a result of these intentional misstatements, TALX overstated its fiscal 2001 pre-tax income by approximately $2.1 million.  In addition, TALX used the wrong method of accounting for certain service transactions prior to and in its 2001 fiscal year, and as a result overstated its 2001 pre-tax income by approximately $2 million.  The combined misstatements resulted in TALX overstating its 2001 pre-tax income by approximately 122%, and inflated artificially TALXs 2001 stock price leading up to its August 3, 2001 secondary offering.  Without the combined misstatements, TALX would have received less than the $82 million realized in the secondary offering.  , TALX agreed to settle the Commissions charges by consenting to a cease-and-desist order finding violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b), 13(a), and 13(b)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder, and by paying disgorgement of $1.  In the related U.S. District Court action, TALX consented to pay a $2.5 million penalty.  TALX settled without admitting or denying the Commissions substantive findings.  The Commissions staff intends to distribute the penalty to injured investors pursuant to the Fair Funds provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.       , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19120.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Cohen, the former chief financial officer of TALX Corporation, a St. Louis-based provider of employment and income verification and other human resources services.  In its complaint, the Commission alleges that Cohen violated the antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws.  , According to the complaint, during fiscal 2001, and through a secondary offering of common stock completed on August 3, 2001, TALX placed emphasis on meeting its internal and external financial projections, and highlighted its earnings growth to the market.  Cohen caused TALX, however, to meet its 2001 financial targets through fraudulent accounting maneuvers.  The misstatements included an improper bill and hold transaction; recognizing revenue prematurely; capitalizing costs relating to a license agreement that should have been expensed; and expensing executive bonuses in the wrong period.  As a result, TALX overstated its 2001 pre-tax income by approximately $2.1 million, or 65%, and inflated TALXs 2001 stock price leading up to the secondary stock offering on August 3, 2001.  Cohen sold TALX shares shortly after TALX announced its false fiscal 2001 results.  The Commission further alleges that Cohen made misleading statements to TALXs auditors.     , The Commission charged Cohen, who is a licensed CPA, with causing TALX to make material financial misrepresentations in Forms 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q for fiscal years 2001 through the second quarter of 2004, and in its fiscal 2002 registration statement, and with  violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder, and aiding and abetting TALXs violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13 thereunder.

The Defendants offered and sold the bonds in question through a series of eleven offerings underwritten by the now-defunct Minnesota broker-dealer firm of Miller &amp; Schroeder Financial, Inc. (Miller &amp; Schroeder).  The Defendants sold the bonds to more than 1,800 investors residing in 36 States.  According to the Complaint, Iverson and Dhooge, registered representatives of Miller &amp; Schroeder, managed the underwriting of the various bond offerings, despite their knowledge that bond proceeds were being wrongfully commingled and diverted.   Boehm, an attorney who acted as counsel for Miller &amp; Schroeder in the bond offerings, issued favorable legal opinions despite his knowledge that bond proceeds were being wrongfully commingled and diverted.   The Complaint alleged that Boehm, Iverson and Dhooge, acting knowingly or with a reckless disregard for the truth, all took part in writing, reviewing, or disseminating bond prospectuses which misled investors and that all the Defendants personally profited from the scheme. , This case is still pending against Defendants Robert A.

In addition, Judge Holmes issued permanent injunctions prohibiting Mabie and Maxxon from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and ordered Mabie to pay more than $1 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and penalties. , The decision followed a jury finding on November 18, 2004, that Maxxon and Mabie had engaged in securities fraud.  The jury found that Mabie and Maxxon violated fraud provisions of the federal securities laws beginning October 7, 1998.  The Commission had alleged that Mabie and Maxxon made false or misleading statements in various media about the company and a “safety syringe” the company stated it was attempting to develop.

Misleading statements regarding the safety syringe were made over a period of years with the intention of inflating the value of Maxxon stock.  The Court finds that, given the degree of scienter and the scope of Defendant Mabie’s involvement with several similar ‘developmental’ corporations that he has promoted in recent years which have not sold a product or made a profit, there is a reasonable likelihood that future violations will occur.”  , Other relief ordered by Judge Holmes consisted of:, In a separate order, Judge Holmes denied Maxxon’s and Mabie’s motions for a new trial, or for judgment as a matter of law. ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19132.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Nacchio, former co-chairman and chief executive officer of Qwest Communications International Inc., and eight other former Qwest officers and employees with fraud and other violations of the federal securities laws.  In three separate but related civil actions, the Commission alleges that, between 1999 and 2002, the Qwest defendants engaged in a multi-faceted fraudulent scheme designed to mislead the investing public about the companys revenue and growth.  In addition to Nacchio, the Commissions complaints name former chief financial officers Robert S. Woodruff and Robin R.

Hoaglund, former senior vice president of finance William L. Eveleth, former director of financial reporting James J. Kozlowski, and former senior manager of financial reporting Frank T. Noyes.  The complaints seek injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against all of the defendants, and officer/director bars against Nacchio, Woodruff, Szeliga, Mohebbi, Casey, and Eveleth.  Hoaglund and Eveleth both consented to the entry of judgments against them without admitting or denying the allegations against them in the complaints., Hoaglund consented to the entry of a judgment enjoining him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1; enjoining him from aiding and abetting any violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13; and directing him to pay a civil penalty of $100,000 and disgorgement of $200,000 plus prejudgment interest.  Eveleth consented to the entry of a judgment enjoining him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1; enjoining him from aiding and abetting any violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13; directing him to pay a civil penalty of $75,000 and disgorgement of $35,575 plus prejudgment interest; and prohibiting him from acting as an officer or director of any public company for five years.  The judgment also resolves the Commissions allegations against Eveleth in a previously filed civil action, SEC v. Arnold, et al., CV-03-Z-0328 (OES) (D. Colo.)., According to the SECs complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado, Nacchio and others made numerous false and misleading statements about Qwests financial condition in annual, quarterly, and current reports, in registration statements that incorporated Qwests financial statements, and in other public statements, including earnings releases and investor calls.  As a result of that scheme, Qwest fraudulently recognized over $3 billion of revenue and excluded $71.3 million in expenses.  The Commission, in October 2004, sued Qwest in a settled injunctive action in which the company agreed to pay a $250 million penalty for its misconduct., The Commissions complaints, which were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado, allege as follows:, In Commission filings and other public statements, Nacchio, Woodruff, and Szeliga fraudulently characterized nonrecurring revenue from indefeasible rights of use (IRUs) and equipment transactions as recurring data and Internet service revenues, thereby masking Qwests declining financial condition and artificially inflating its stock price.  Qwest used such nonrecurring revenue to fill the gap between actual and projected revenue.  Over time, in fact, Qwests dependence on such one-time transactions grew to the point that it was likened internally to an addiction and the nonrecurring IRU and equipment sale transactions were likened to heroin.  Among other things, the Qwest executives misrepresentations about Qwests revenue sources allowed Qwest to maintain a stock price sufficiently high to complete its pending merger with US West, Inc., The complaints allege that, as a result of the above conduct, the defendants violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Sections 10(b) and13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1; and aided and abetted Qwests violations of Sections13(a) and 13(b)(2) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13; Nacchio, Woodruff, Szeliga, Mohebbi and Casey violated Exchange Act Rule 13b2-2; and Mohebbi and Casey aided and abetted Qwests violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5.  , On March 15, 2005, the Commission instituted settled cease-and-desist proceedings and filed related civil actions for penalties against Mark A.

Ambrose, Chief Judge for the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, entered a final judgment against Bryan James Hawes, a financial planner and investment adviser, for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  In its Complaint filed on November 20, 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission alleged that Hawes, individually and through entities he controlled, through an egregious abuse of trust and fraudulent dealings, misappropriated at least $1.2 million from investors whose assets he purported to manage.  The Commissions complaint also alleged that Hawes stole from people he had known for many years, including his own elderly parents. , As alleged in the complaint, Hawes conducted his fraudulent schemes through two businesses he created:  FMS, an insurance business, and FMAS, an investment adviser business.  In one scheme, the complaint alleged, Hawes, through FMS, falsely told certain investors that he had purchased, as they had directed, annuity policies as investment vehicles.  The complaint further alleged that, in fact, for some investors, Hawes never bought the policies but rather took the policy premium for himself.  For other investors, the complaint alleged that Hawes initially purchased the annuities but later liquidated them without the clients knowledge or authorization, keeping the proceeds for himself.  Additionally, in a separate alleged scheme, Hawes, through FMAS, charged exorbitant and unauthorized management fees to investors who believed he was managing their assets.  Hawes then hid his fraud from these investors by sending false account statements to the investors showing inflated balances and omitting the unauthorized fee deductions.  , On April 8, 2004, Hawes pleaded guilty to two counts of mail fraud before the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania.  On August 18, 2004, Hawes was sentenced to 98 months imprisonment and was ordered to pay $2,601,961.60 in restitution.  Hawes is currently incarcerated.   , Hawes, without or admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers Act).  According to the terms of the final judgment, all balances in accounts frozen in the Commissions initial action filed against Hawes will be applied in partial satisfaction of the criminal restitution order.  In addition, under the terms of the final judgment, the other defendants in the original action were dismissed because they were essentially alter egos of Hawes and are in bankruptcy.  , On March 15, 2005, based on the entry of the final judgment against Hawes, the Commission also instituted settled administrative proceedings against Hawes pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Exchange Act and Section 203(f) of the Advisers Act.  Without admitting or denying the Commissions findings, Hawes consented to the entry of the Commissions order, which bars him from associating with any broker, dealer or investment adviser.

The Commissions complaint alleges that, from November 2003 to the present, the defendants made and disseminated false statements concerning the number of imaging centers operated by BodyScan, the companys prospects for growth, and its anticipated earnings.  According to the complaint, BodyScan issued a series of press releases between November 2003 and February 2004 wherein it stated that it operated up to eight imaging centers throughout the United States.  BodyScan reinforced and expanded upon that representation by providing contact information for 11 imaging centers on its website until August 2004.  Sciuto made additional misrepresentations in a May 2004 interview with an online investor newsletter, in which he stated that BodyScan was negotiating to acquire 12 additional imaging centers, was on track to have 20 imaging centers operating within one year, and that company sales would be around the $20 million mark for year-end 2004., The statements concerning the number of imaging centers operated by BodyScan were false and Sciutos projections concerning the growth of the number of imaging centers and year-end company sales were made without a good faith basis.  In reality, the number of BodyScan imaging centers had been dwindling since early 2003, due to the companys failure to remain current on its premises and equipment-leasing obligations.  As of January 2004, BodyScan operated only three imaging centers, only two of which had functioning machinery.  By March 2004, BodyScan was unable to service patients at any of its imaging centers., The Commission has charged BodyScan and Sciuto with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The courts contempt order found that Treadwell violated the courts temporary restraining order of October 12, 2004 and order of preliminary injunction of November 1, 2004., The courts contempt order provides that Treadwell must pay $15,319 to the receiver to cover Treadwells withdrawals from a bank account in violation of the courts asset freeze order.  The courts order further provides that Treadwells obligation to provide an accounting and other financial information to the Commission and his cooperation with the receiver is conditioned upon rulings to be made by Magistrate Judge Leo S.

At that time, if Treadwell fails to comply, Treadwell faces the prospect of incarceration and a fine of $1,000 per day pending his full compliance with the courts orders.  , On October 12, 2004, the Commission filed a complaint against Treadwell, Learn Waterhouse, Rick D.

(Arbor Securities) an unregistered broker dealer and investment adviser located in Needham, Massachusetts.  According to the complaint, the Gilmans funneled investor proceeds to their personal use through Financial Links, Inc. (Financial Links), a registered broker-dealer controlled by G.

Gilman represented he would establish individual brokerage accounts for customers at Arbor Securities, an alleged offshore brokerage firm operated from his office in Needham, Massachusetts, and would use clients funds to trade in the stocks of publicly traded U.S. companies.  Instead of establishing the individual accounts and investing customer funds as represented, G. Gilman and S.

From those accounts, S. Gilman transferred customer funds to himself, to G. Gilman, and to private companies controlled by G.

(UTA-BVI) and Relief Defendants The United Tribes of the Americas, Inc. and Executive Bureau of Research and Recovery, Inc.  , The Complaint alleges that Eldridge and UTA-BVI, which she controlled, misappropriated at least $2 million from two investment advisory clients.  Specifically, the Complaint alleges that in 1999 UTA-BVI, acting through Eldridge, entered into written trust agreements with two entities named First National Equity, LLC (First National Equity) and P.K. Trust &amp; Holding Inc. (P.K. Trust).  After signing the trust agreements, First National Equity and P.K. Trust transferred $24 million into securities brokerage accounts Eldridge controlled in the name of UTA-BVI.  Under the terms of the trust agreements UTA-BVI, through Eldridge, agreed to invest the money received from First National Equity and P.K. Trust in the best interest of those two clients.  However, instead of investing the funds for the benefit of First National Equity and P.K. Trust, Eldridge and UTA-BVI misappropriated at least $2 million of the funds by paying personal expenses for Eldridge and by transferring funds to several bank accounts, including accounts Eldridge controlled in the names of the Relief Defendants.  First National Equity and P.K. Trust, along with others, are defendants in an action the Commission previously filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana.  In that case, the Commission alleges that First National Equity, P.K. Trust and others fraudulently raised the $24 million in funds deposited with UTA-BVI and Eldridge.  Eldridge and UTA-BVI were initially defendants in that action but were dismissed, without prejudice, on venue grounds.  The Commissions allegations against UTA-BVI and Eldridge in the new action pending in the Northern District of Georgia mirror the allegations first alleged in the Indiana action, namely that UTA-BVI, acting through Eldridge, was an investment adviser and violated its fiduciary duty to its clients by misappropriating client funds; by transferring client funds for its and Eldridges benefit, in violation of the trust agreements and without notice to or authorization from its clients; and by knowingly misrepresenting the uses it would make of client funds.  , The Commissions Complaint alleges that UTA-BVI violated Section 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers Act) and that Eldridge aided and abetted UTA-BVIs violations of the Advisers Act.

(formerly known as AOL Time Warner) with materially overstating online advertising revenue and the number of its Internet subscribers, and with aiding and abetting three other securities frauds.  The Commission also charged that the company violated a Commission cease-and-desist order issued against America Online, Inc. on May 15, 2000.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the Commission charged Time Warner CFO Wayne H. Pace, Controller James W. Barge, and Deputy Controller Pascal Desroches with causing violations of the reporting provisions of the federal securities laws. , Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Time Warner consented to the entry of a judgment ordering it to comply with the May 15, 2000 cease-and-desist order against AOL and enjoining Time Warner from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13, and 13b2-1.  The judgment also orders Time Warner to pay $300 million in civil penalties, which the Commission will request be distributed to harmed investors.  The penalties cannot be used to offset any judgment or settlement in any related shareholder suit.  In addition, Time Warner agreed to restate its historical financial results to reduce its reported online advertising revenues by approximately $500 million (in addition to the $190 million already restated) for the fourth quarter of 2000 through 2002 and to properly reflect the consolidation of AOL Europe in the companys 2000 and 2001 financial statements.  The company also agreed to engage an independent examiner to determine whether the companys historical accounting for certain transactions was in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)., In the separate administrative action, Pace, Barge, and Desroches consented, without admitting or denying the allegations, to the entry of an administrative order that finds that they caused reporting violations by the company based on their roles in accounting for $400 million paid to the company by Bertelsmann AG in two sets of transaction.  The order directs them to cease-and-desist from causing any violations and any future violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13. , The Commissions complaint against Time Warner, which was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, includes the following allegations:, Beginning in mid-2000, stock prices of Internet-related businesses declined precipitously as, among other things, sales of online advertising declined and the rate of growth of new online subscriptions started to flatten.  Beginning at this time, and extending through 2002, the company employed fraudulent round-trip transactions that boosted its online advertising revenue to mask the fact that it also experienced a business slow-down.  The round-trip transactions ranged in complexity and sophistication, but in each instance the company effectively funded its own online advertising revenue by giving the counterparties the means to pay for advertising that they would not otherwise have purchased.  To conceal the true nature of the transactions, the company typically structured and documented round-trips as if they were two or more separate, bona fide transactions, conducted at arms length and reflecting each partys independent business purpose.  The company delivered mostly untargeted, less desirable, remnant online advertising to the round-trip advertisers, and the round-trip advertisers often had little or no ability to control the quantity, quality, and sometimes even the content of the online advertising they received.  Because the round-trip customers effectively were paying for the online advertising with the companys funds, the customers seldom, if ever, complained., Several of the counterparties to the round-trip transactions were publicly traded companies.  Three of these counterparties-Homestore, Inc., PurchasePro.com, Inc., and a California software company- improperly recognized revenue on the round-trip transactions and reported materially misstated financial results to their own investors.   , As a consequence, the company aided and abetted the frauds of three public companies., The company artificially inflated the number of AOL subscribers in the second, third, and fourth quarters of 2001 so it could report to the investment community that it had met its new subscriber targets, an important metric the market used to evaluate AOL (both before and after its merger with Time Warner).  Specifically, the company counted members from bulk subscription sales to corporate customers (for distribution to their employees) when the company knew that the memberships had not, and mostly would not, be activated.  In at least one instance, the company entered into round-trip arrangements to fund the corporate customers purchases of bulk subscriptions.  Additionally, in last-minute efforts to meet the quarterly targets, the company on at least four occasions shipped non-conforming bulk subscription membership kits to the customers prior to quarter-end with the understanding that it would turn around and replace them at a later date with conforming kits, but it nonetheless counted new subscribers from these sales as of the quarter-end., From March 2000 through January 2002, the company failed to properly consolidate the financial results of AOL Europe in its financial statements.  AOL Europe was originally a 50/50 joint venture between AOL and Bertelsmann.  In March 2000, AOL entered into a contingent purchase agreement relating to Bertelsmanns interest in AOL Europe.  The agreement gave AOL broad and direct powers enabling it to control the operations and assets of AOL Europe.  In fact, AOL informed the European Commission (in the context of satisfying EC merger regulations) that Bertelsmann relinquished essentially all control regarding the operations or management of AOL Europe.  GAAP requires consolidation when one entity has a controlling financial interest in another entity.  The companys failure to properly consolidate AOL Europe resulted in material misstatements of its financial results, including overstatements of operating income and free cash flow in 2000 and 2001, overstatements of net income in 2000, understatements of net losses in 2001, and understatements of total debt in 2000 and 2001.   , The Commission issued a cease-and-desist order against AOL on May 15, 2000 because AOL violated reporting and books-and-records provisions of the federal securities laws.  Thereafter, the company violated the cease-and-desist order by artificially inflating its online advertising revenue and the number of AOL subscribers, as well as its failure to consolidate AOL Europes financial statements., * * * *, The Commissions cease-and-desist order against Pace, Barge, and Desroches addresses their roles in accounting for transactions with Bertelsmann.  In 2001 and 2002, the company inflated its online advertising revenue by $400 million in connection with transactions with Bertelsmann.  In substance, Bertelsmann paid $400 million as consideration for amendments to the multi-billion-dollar contingent purchase agreement governing the companys purchase of Bertelsmanns interest in AOL Europe.   The contract amendments had substantial value, and Bertelsmann offered to compensate the company for the amendments.  Rather than accept cash in exchange for the amendments, however, the company requested that Bertelsmann purchase advertising in the aggregate amount of $400 million.  The company then improperly and materially inflated its online advertising revenues by recognizing the $400 million as advertising revenue rather than as consideration received for amending the AOL Europe purchase agreement.  , Pace, Barge, and Desroches were corporate-level finance and accounting executives at the company who were responsible for, among other things, reviewing and approving the accounting treatment recommended by the companys business units.  In this role, they approved the companys accounting for the $400 million as advertising revenue.

CARMICHAEL AND IRVING FREIBERG,</i> Case No. 2:05CV00233 PGC (USDC D. Utah).</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) announced that it filed a civil injunctive action on March 18, 2005 against Utah resident Harvey L. Carmichael (Carmichael) and Florida resident Irving Freiberg (Freiberg). The complaint alleges that between late 2001 and early 2002, Carmichael secretly acquired as much as 27% of the stock of Gateway International Holdings, Inc. (Gateway), which was then a publicly traded shell, without filing mandatory forms with the Commission disclosing his beneficial ownership.  Further, the complaint alleges that in November-December 2001, Carmichael manipulated Gateway stock by inducing a trader associated with a registered broker-dealer to repeatedly raise the inside bid price of the stock.  Moreover, the complaint alleges that in February 2002, Carmichael hired Freiberg to send false and misleading spam e-mail messages to a large number of prospective investors.  According to the complaint, Carmichael and Freiberg, who has since pleaded guilty to federal securities fraud charges relating to his touting of Gateway and other microcap stocks, sold restricted Gateway stock that they held into the resulting inflated market for profits of approximately $150,740 and $127,195, respectively, in violation of the securities registration provisions., The Commissions complaint alleges that Carmichael thereby violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Sections 10(b), 13(d) and 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 13d-1, 13d-2, 16a-2 and 16a-3 thereunder, and that Freiberg thereby violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement and prejudgment interest, penny stock bars, and third-tier civil penalties against both defendants, and an officer and director bar against Carmichael. , Without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, Freiberg has consented to the entry of an order that would enjoin him from future violations of the foregoing provisions; imposing a penny stock bar and ordering that he pay $145,098 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, but deeming payment satisfied by his forfeiture of $145,098 or more in settlement of the related criminal case and not imposing a civil penalty based on his anticipated incarceration.  <i>See U.S. v.

First, the Commission filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia charging Flowserve with violating, and C. Scott Greer, Flowserves Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, with aiding and abetting Flowserves violations of, Regulation FD and Section 13(a).  Second, the Commission issued an administrative order finding that Flowserve violated the same provisions, and that Greer and the Companys Director of Investor Relations, Michael Conley, were each a cause of Flowserves violations.  Without admitting or denying the Commissions charges, Flowserve and Greer consented to the entry of a final judgment in the federal lawsuit that requires the company to pay a $350,000 civil penalty and Greer to pay a $50,000 civil penalty.  Flowserve, Greer and Conley also agreed to the issuance of the Commissions administrative order.  , In both its federal court complaint and its administrative order, the Commission charged that, Flowserve, a calendar-year reporting corporation, began 2002 forecasting annual earnings per share in the range of $1.90 to $2.30.  In July of that year, the Company revised that estimate to $1.70 to $1.90 per share.  On September 27th, the Company lowered its earnings estimate to $1.45 to $1.55 per share, which the Company reaffirmed in its press release issued on October 22, 2002.  The $1.45 to $1.55 range represented more than a 30% decline in earnings per share estimates since the beginning of the year.         , On November 19, 2002, forty-two days before the end of Flowserves fiscal year, Greer, along with Conley, met privately in Irving, Texas with analysts from four investment and brokerage firms.  At that meeting, the attendees discussed various aspects of Flowserves business, including recent acquisitions, debt covenants, and free cash flow.  At one point, one of the analysts asked about the Companys earnings guidance for the year.  Neither Conley nor Greer gave the response required by the Companys policy that earnings guidance was effective at the date given and would not be updated until the company publicly announced updated guidance.  Conley did not caution Greer before Greer answered the analysts questions.  In fact, Conley remained altogether silent.  Instead, in response to the question, Greer reaffirmed the previous guidance, which had been issued on October 22, 2002, and provided additional material nonpublic information.  Having heard the exchange between Greer and the analyst, again Conley was silent and did nothing to explain Greers statements.  Conley also failed to reiterate the Company policy as to earnings guidance., On November 20, 2002, an analyst who attended the meeting issued a report to the investment firms subscribers stating that Flowserve reaffirmed its earnings guidance.  The report was electronically distributed to subscribers of Thomsons First Call.  The next day, on November 21, Flowserves closing stock price was approximately 6% higher than the closing price the day before.  In addition, the trading volume of Flowserves stock increased by 75%, from 379,500 shares traded on November 20th to 658,300 shares traded on November 21st.  After the market closed on November 21, Flowserve furnished a Form 8-K admitting that it had reaffirmed its full year 2002 estimated earnings per share.  , In addition to the underlying conduct, the Commission considered the Respondents lack of cooperation afforded the Commission staff.  Specifically, both Greer and Conley denied that a reaffirmation occurred at the meeting, which is inconsistent with the Form 8-K furnished by Flowserve., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp19154.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>, <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19154.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

In addition, Hawk and Delargy caused iGo to improperly record revenue of approximately $107,000 on continued consignment sales to Laptop Lane, Inc.  The approximate 7.6% overstatement of third quarter revenue was disclosed to the public in an October 2000 earnings release and reported in iGos Form 10-Q for the third quarter of fiscal 2000 filed with the Commission on November 14, 2000; , In the final days of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2000, the defendants collectively caused iGo to recognize fraudulently approximately $1.18 million in fourth quarter revenue by improperly recognizing revenue on consignment sales, sham transactions, product that was not shipped, and product that was shipped after the end of the fiscal year.  The approximate 9% overstatement of fourth quarter revenue was disclosed to the public in a January 2001 earnings release.  IGo made additional materially false and misleading statements in two March 2001 releases regarding the amount of revenue it would record in the first quarter of fiscal 2001, and the reasons for those amounts, as a result of reversing improperly recorded fourth quarter 2000 transactions. , Hawk and Delargy signed management representation letters, given to iGos independent auditors in 2000, which were false and misleading.  In addition, in early 2001, Delargy and de Jong made false and misleading statements to iGos independent auditors regarding the propriety of recording the M.Block transaction in the third quarter of fiscal year 2000.  , In its Complaint, the Commission requests that the Court issue a final judgment permanently restraining and enjoining the defendants from violating and/or aiding and abetting violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2.

(Impath) with securities fraud and related violations.  One defendant has agreed to settle the Commissions charges by paying a total of over $250,000 in disgorgement and civil penalties and consenting to permanent injunctive relief., The SECs complaint alleges that from 1999 until 2003, the defendants engaged in fraudulent accounting practices and undisclosed self-dealing in violation of the applicable proxy rules.  As a result of the accounting fraud, Impath falsely reported multimillion dollar profits when it had actually suffered huge losses.  To meet financial projections and boost Impaths stock price, the defendants made, or directed others to make, phony accounting entries that artificially increased revenue and improperly reduced operating expenses., Formerly based in New York City, Impath was a public company that provided diagnostic and other laboratory services used in the treatment of cancer and its stock was traded on the Nasdaq National Market.  Impath filed for bankruptcy in September 2003 and is in the process of being liquidated., Individuals Sued:  The Commissions complaint names the following defendants, who worked at Impath during the relevant period:, <b>Conduct:</b>  The complaint alleges that the defendants engaged in a fraudulent scheme to inflate Impaths financial results, including revenue and net income, without any regard for generally accepted accounting principles or their financial reporting obligations.  Saad, Adelson and Cammarata directed the fraud, while Torres, McKie, Gardner and Jugan implemented the accounting schemes., Torres, Gardner and Jugan were senior members of Impaths corporate finance department and implemented the fraud by making, and directing members of their staff to make, the improper journal entries needed to carry out the scheme.  Each quarter, Torres conferred with Saad, Adelson or Cammarata about the gap between actual and projected results, and they told Torres how much phony revenue they wanted the finance department to record.  McKie was in charge of Predictive Oncology, one of Impaths subsidiaries, and together with other defendants, he fraudulently capitalized his units operating expenses to inflate net income and recognized revenue on a large transaction that never occurred.  Each defendant also engaged in misconduct designed to deceive Impaths outside auditor and conceal the fraud., As a result of this misconduct, Impath filed annual and quarterly reports with the Commission that included, among other misrepresentations and omissions, materially false and misleading financial statements.  Saad, Adelson, Cammarata and Torres each signed one or more of the periodic reports with full knowledge that those reports and the corresponding press releases announcing quarterly earnings materially misrepresented Impaths financial results., While the accounting fraud was occurring, Saad, Adelson and Cammarata also engaged in undisclosed self-dealing.  Not only did they exercise stock options and sell Impath stock during the fraud, they used over $850,000 in corporate funds to pay for option exercises without obtaining board approval or making the required proxy statement disclosures.  Saad also used corporate funds to pay for other personal expenses without the requisite approval or disclosure, including vacations, country club dues and artwork., <b>Statutory Violations:</b>  The Commissions complaint alleges that by engaging in this conduct, the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and are secondarily liable for Impaths violations of reporting, record-keeping, internal control and proxy solicitation provisions.  Specifically, the complaint alleges that each defendant violated Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1.  In addition, each defendant is alleged to be liable for Impaths violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13.  Saad, Adelson, Cammarata and Torres are alleged to have also violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), and to have made, or directed others to make, false statements to Impaths accountants in violation of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-2.  Saad, Adelson and Cammarata are also alleged to be liable for Impaths violations of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 14a-3 and 14a-9.  Finally, the complaint alleges that Saad also violated Exchange Act Rule 13a-14., <b>Relief Sought:</b>  The complaint seeks final judgments enjoining violations of these provisions of the federal securities laws; ordering all defendants to pay disgorgement and civil money penalties; and barring Saad, Adelson, Cammarata and Torres from acting as an officer or director of any public company., <b>Settlement:</b>  McKie, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, has agreed to:  (i) a permanent injunction against future violations of the relevant antifraud, reporting, books and records and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws; (ii) disgorgement of the $100,000 in performance bonuses he received as result of the conduct alleged in the Complaint, plus prejudgment interest; and (iii) a civil penalty in the amount of $150,000., The Commissions claims against the other defendants are pending., The Commission acknowledges the assistance and cooperation of the United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp19159.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>, <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19159.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The action was filed against Pension Fund of America, LC and PFA Assurance Group, Ltd. (collectively, PFA), unregistered investment advisers operating in Coral Gables, Florida, affiliated entities PFA International, Inc. and Claren, TPA, and their principals Luis Cornide and Robert de la Riva.    , Acting on the Commissions request for emergency relief, on March 28, 2003, Judge K. Michael Moore of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, issued temporary restraining orders, asset freezes and other relief against the defendants.  The Court also appointed Thomas G. Schultz as Receiver over all of the entities named in the Commissions Complaint. , The Commissions complaint alleges that from October 1999 to the present, PFA and its principals, Cornide and de la Riva, raised approximately $127 million from over 3,400 investors, through the sale of retirement trust plans that purportedly combine life insurance and investments in mutual funds purchased through U.S. banks and broker-dealers.  Through a network of over 500 sales agents in Central and South America, PFA promotes the investment as a trust plan, assuring prospective investors that their funds are secure because they are held and invested by large and well-established U.S. banks and broker-dealers who act as trustees or custodians of investors funds.  The investment component of the plan provides prospective investors with a choice of up to eight mutual funds offered by well-known U.S. fund companies.  The offering materials provided to investors (available in Spanish and Portuguese) fail to disclose, however, that up to 90% of funds invested in The Liberty Trust - PFAs flagship program chosen by 85% of investors - are used to pay exorbitant commissions, an administrative fee taken by PFA and other costs.  The defendants also fail to disclose that front-end load charges of up to 6.5% are assessed on each mutual fund purchase.   Additionally, the Complaint alleges that defendants have misrepresented their relationship with financial institutions and broker-dealers, and perpetuated those misrepresentations by creating false certificates bearing unauthorized seals.  The Complaint alleges that Cornide and de la Riva have misappropriated at least $15 million of investors funds for themselves.  , The Commissions complaint alleges that defendants violated Sections 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, that Cornide and de la Riva further violated Section 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act, and that defendants PFA, Cornide and de la Riva violated Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  In addition to the emergency relief obtained on March 28, 2005, the Commissions civil action is seeking, among other things, preliminary and permanent injunctions, an order that the defendants disgorge all ill-gotten gains, with pre-judgment interest, and an order imposing civil money penalties., The Commission acknowledges the assistance in this case of the U.S. Department of Homeland Securitys Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement., The Commissions investigation is continuing., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp19161.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>, <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19161.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Allen was the President, CEO, Chief Investment Officer and majority shareholder of Advanced Investment Management, Inc. (AIM), a now-defunct investment adviser previously registered with the Commission.  Smith was AIMs Vice President of Equity Trading. Without admitting or denying the allegations of the Complaint, Allen has consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from engaging in the violations set forth below, and ordering him to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $175,000., The Commissions Complaint alleges that AIMs investment strategy involved matching or exceeding the performance of the S&amp;P 500 Index through the use of derivatives rather than direct investment in the equities that comprised the Index.  Most clients required AIM to maintain not more than 100 percent market exposure in their accounts such that any market movement in the S&amp;P 500 Index would cause comparable percentage movements in the market value of their portfolio.  A few clients authorized market exposure levels as high as 120 percent., The Complaint further alleges that, from at least January 2002 through July 2002, Allen and Smith conducted unauthorized trading in numerous client accounts, and in violation of advisory agreements.  In particular, from April through July 2002, during a time when the S&amp;P 500 Index dropped almost 29 percent, the defendants improperly increased market exposure in an effort to recover from past losses.  This trading caused market exposure in some accounts to reach levels as high as 500 percent, which, in turn, caused more than $415 million in client losses.  In order to conceal the effect of their trading, which otherwise would have been disclosed in monthly account statements, Allen and Smith sold the unauthorized positions before month-end, and repurchased them shortly thereafter.  This strategy of window dressing prevented clients from discovering the scheme., The Complaint alleges that defendants have violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and that Allen has violated, and Smith has violated or aided and abetted violations of, Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  The Complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement together with prejudgment interest against Smith, and civil penalties against both defendants., The Commission acknowledges the cooperation of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the U.S. Department of Labor, who are today filing separate actions against Allen as a result of his conduct., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp19170.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>, <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19170.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

SeaLife Corporation, et al.,</i> Civil Action No. 05-M-622 (CBS) (D. Colo.)</h2>]","[On April 5, 2005, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil complaint against SeaLife Corporation, its president, and several of its promoters alleging that they engaged in a manipulative distribution of unregistered stock.  SeaLife is a Delaware corporation based in Culver City, California, which develops environmental products, including a boat paint and a soil enhancer.  The complaint also names SeaLifes president Robert E. McCaslin of Marina Del Rey, California, Roland M. Thomas of Las Vegas, Nevada, ERT Technology Corporation, a Delaware corporation owned by Thomas, Douglas A. Glaser and Barry S. Griffin of Denver, Colorado, Jeffrey A. Hayden of Walden, Colorado, and Morgan J. Wilbur III of Savannah, Georgia.  Glaser was barred in 1997 by the Commission from association with securities brokers and dealers (Sky Scientific, Inc., Sec. Act Rel. No. 7412 (April 3, 1997))., According to the complaint, SeaLife went public in December 2002 through reverse merger with a public shell call Integrated Enterprises, Inc.  At the same time, McCaslin retained Thomas to raise capital for SeaLife and promote the company to investors, and to raise $400,000 to pay the principal shareholders of the shell and complete the takeover of the shell by McCaslin and other new management.  Thomas devised a plan with Glaser to meet those goals. To carry out the plan, SeaLife issued one million shares to Thomas, Glaser, and an employee of ERT and registered the stock with the Commission on Form S-8, which registers stock issued to a companys employees and consultants.  However, the complaint alleges that Form S-8 was improperly used because Thomas and Glaser were retained to raise capital for SeaLife and to promote and maintain the market for SeaLife stock., The complaint further alleges that Thomas and Glaser transferred portions of their stock to Griffin, Hayden, and Wilbur for ultimate sale to the public through brokerage transactions.  Between January and March 2003, Thomas, ERT, Glaser, Griffin, Hayden, and Wilbur sold most of the one million shares.  While this distribution was occurring, SeaLife embarked on a publicity campaign using press releases, a corporate fact sheet, and a business plan.  The latter two documents were disseminated to brokers and investors and also placed on SeaLifes web site for public review.  The complaint alleges that the publicity included materially false and misleading information.  Specifically, SeaLife allegedly claimed that its products were ready to be marketed, when in fact the company needed capital to conduct further testing; that SeaLifes intellectual property was worth more than $60 million, when in fact SeaLife carried the property on its books at less than $1.5 million; and that SeaLife projected over $5 million sales during its first year and significant profits based on a 70% gross margin, when in fact the company had no basis for figuring its sales margin and could not meet its projections without additional product testing and capital.  In addition, the publicity campaign did not disclose the $400,000 owed to the principal shareholders of the shell or the fact that the company had retained Thomas and Glaser to sell SeaLife stock to pay that debt and raise capital.  Filings made with the Commission on Form 8-K allegedly compounded the false and misleading impact of the publicity campaign., The complaint further alleges that Thomas, ERT, Glaser, Griffin, Hayden, and Wilbur used manipulative techniques to distribute SeaLife stock.  According to the complaint, they engaged in wash sales or matched trades, and purchased small amounts of the stock that they were distributing to create artificial trading volume and maintain the price for the distribution.  Through these techniques, they were able to generate income for themselves, but they did not send any of that money back to SeaLife or to the prior principal shareholders of the shell.  The complaint also alleges that SeaLife made false and misleading statements in an August 2003 press release about a renegotiation with the prior principal shareholders of the shell, which helped conceal the earlier fraudulent activities described above., All defendants are charged with violating the securities registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Sections 5(a) and (c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Thomas, ERT, Glaser, Griffin, Hayden, and Wilbur are also charged with violating Rule 101 of Regulation M, an anti-manipulation rule that prohibits participants in a stock distribution from purchasing stock that they are distributing.  The complaint also charges that McCaslin, Thomas, ERT, and Glaser violated ownership reporting provisions in Sections 13(d)(1) and 16(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13d-1 and 16a-3, and that Thomas, ERT, and Glaser violated Section 13(d)(2) and Rule 13d-2.  Finally, the complaint charges that SeaLife violated the filings provisions, Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-11, 13a-13, and 12b-20, and that McCaslin aided and abetted those violations.  , The Commission seeks permanent injunctions against all defendants, an order requiring Thomas, ERT, Glaser, Griffin, and Wilbur to provide an accounting and disgorgement, civil penalties against all defendants, an officer-and-director bar against McCaslin, and penny stock bars against Thomas, ERT, Glaser, Griffin, Hayden, and Wilbur., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp19171.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>, <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19171.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Clutten, Administrative Proceeding File No.  3-11884</h2>]","[On April 6, 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed fraud and other charges against Drew S. Levin, Noel Cronin, and Michael Macchiarella for a financial fraud conducted at Team Communications Group, Inc.  The Commission also instituted a related administrative action against John D. Clutten., The compliant, filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, alleges that a financial fraud took place at Team from approximately 1999 through 2001 and that there were two major components of the fraudulent scheme.  The first component involved improperly accounting for circular sales transactions between Team and certain other companies, including companies controlled by Cronin.  The second component of the scheme involved non-binding, minimum-guarantee distribution contracts.  Under these contracts, Team improperly recognized minimum-guaranteed revenue (specified in the terms of those contracts) even though the counter-parties were assured that the minimum-guarantee numbers would not be enforced.  In fact, in most or all cases, the minimum-guarantee contractual obligations were voided by undisclosed side-letter agreements., The complaint also alleges that the fraudulent scheme resulted in material misstatements and omissions in Teams periodic reports filed with the Commission and other public statements related to the companys fiscal years 1999 and 2000 (Teams fiscal year ended on 12/31).  For example, the circular and minimum-guarantee transactions caused Team to report in its filings with the Commission materially misstated revenue, income, and assets for the periods ended 12/31/1999, 3/31/2000, 6/30/2000 and 9/30/2000., The complaint further alleges that Levin, Teams former Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, was the architect of the scheme and personally oversaw and directed its execution.  Levins scheme was accomplished with the assistance of Cronin and Macchiarella.  During the relevant time period, Cronin was the head of Teams United Kingdom subsidiary, known as Team Dandelion.  Cronin and other companies in which he had an ownership interest were involved in the circular and minimum-guarantee transactions.  Macchiarella purportedly owned a film distribution company, which was not affiliated with Team and which entered into a guaranteed-minimum with Team.  Levin and Macchiarella made false statements to Teams auditors about Macchiarellas company and the contract.  In its administrative action against Clutten, the Commission alleges that Clutten was involved with the guaranteed-minimum contracts., Cronin has agreed to settle the Commissions action, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, by consenting to the entry of a judgment (a) permanently enjoining him from violating Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder, and (b) prohibiting him from acting as an officer or director of a public company for five years., Macciarella has agreed to settle the Commissions action, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, by consenting to the entry of a judgment (a) permanently enjoining him from violating Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1, 13a-13, and13b2-2 thereunder, and (b) requiring him to pay disgorgement of $25,000 plus prejudgment interest and a $25, 000 civil penalty., Clutten has agreed to settle the Commissions administrative action by consenting to the entry of an order, without admitting or denying the findings in the order, directing him to cease and desist from (1) committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder and (2) causing any violations and any future violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder., The Commission will litigate the case against Levin.

The Commission also today issued a settled administrative order against former Accounting Manager Stephen C. Jones (Jones).  As alleged in the Commissions complaint, during its fiscal years 1998 through 2001, Dollar General engaged in fraudulent or improper accounting practices in violation of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) which ultimately resulted in a restatement of Dollar Generals financial statements in January 2002.  The restatement reduced the Companys pre-tax income by approximately $143 million, or about 30 cents per share, over the restated period.  , The Commissions complaint alleges that Dollar Generals misconduct included:  (1) intentionally underreporting at least $10 million in import freight expenses for the Companys fiscal year 1999; (2) engaging in an $11 million sham sale of outdated, essentially worthless, Omron cash registers in the Companys fiscal year 2000 fourth quarter; (3) overstating cash accounts; (4) manipulating the Companys reported earnings through the use of a general reserve or rainy day account; (5) failing to maintain accurate books and records and filing inaccurate financial reports with the Commission; and (6) failing to maintain adequate internal accounting controls.  The complaint further alleges that some of the fraudulent or improper accounting practices were effected by, or known to, former senior executives and accounting personnel, including Turner, Burr Sanderson and Carpenter and were motivated in part by a desire to report earnings that met or exceeded analysts expectations and to maintain employee bonuses.   , The complaint alleges that, with regard to import freight expenses in 1999 and 2000, Dollar Generals accounting staff determined that the Company should have recognized $13.4 million in freight expenses in fiscal 1999.  Rather than recognizing all the expense in fiscal year 1999, Sanderson, Burr, and Carpenter discussed possible ways to account for the $13.4 million in freight expenses that did not entail recognizing all such expenses in fiscal year 1999.  On February 5, 2000, Sanderson sent a memorandum to Carpenter, Burr and others describing a $10 million variance in relation to freight expenses, and Dollar Generals intention to charge the $10 million 1999 shortfall at a rate of $833,000 per month during Dollar Generals fiscal year 2000.  At a meeting in March 2000, attended by Carpenter and Turner among others, Sanderson explained that the freight expenses would be gradually expensed in fiscal year 2000.  All three individuals knew that deferring the bulk of the expenses to fiscal year 2000 avoided the negative impact on already announced fiscal year 1999 earnings as well as year-end bonus payments to Dollar General employees, including Sanderson, Burr, and Carpenter.  Turner was informed that the freight expenses relating to activity in Dollar Generals fiscal year 1999 were being recorded in 2000, but Turner did not override the decision.  The Commissions complaint alleges that, by deferring the freight expenses, Dollar General met certain targets, including an internal target for employee bonuses and analysts expectations for the Companys earnings per share for fiscal year 1999.  If Dollar General had recognized the freight expenses in 1999, it would have fallen short of the bonus target and analysts expectations.  , The Commissions Order finds that Sanderson directed Jones to record the freight expenses in the following manner:  (1) write off $4 million of the freight expenses in fiscal year 1999; and (2) recognize the remaining $9.4 million over the course of fiscal year 2000 on a monthly basis.  In an attempt to hide part of the improper deferral from the Companys auditors, Sanderson directed Jones to move $1.3 million of the $9.4 million to the miscellaneous accrued liabilities account, widely known at Dollar General as the Rainy Day Fund, and $2.7 million of the $9.4 million to corporate bank clearing accounts.  Neither of these accounts had any connection to freight expenses.  Jones knew that this accounting treatment was improper, but he nevertheless followed Sandersons instructions., Separately, the complaint also alleges that, by February 26, 2001, Turner knew of serious allegations concerning Sanderson and was reckless in not knowing that these issues were likely to impact the integrity and accuracy of Dollar Generals financial statements.  Nevertheless, on February 26, 2001, Dollar General held a conference call announcing its unaudited financial results for fiscal 2000 that Turner knew had been prepared by, among others, Sanderson., Simultaneously with the filing of the Commissions complaint, and without admitting or denying its allegations, Dollar General consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of the antifraud, books and records, internal controls, and periodic reporting provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13 thereunder.  In addition, Dollar General will pay one dollar in disgorgement and a civil penalty of $10,000,000.  , Turner, Sanderson, and Carpenter also have each agreed to settle the case against them without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.

Sanderson and Carpenter also each agreed to be enjoined from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and the provision prohibiting making false or misleading statements to auditors (Rule 13b2-2) and from aiding and abetting certain other reporting violations (Exchange Act Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13).  In addition, Turner agreed to be enjoined from directly or indirectly controlling any person who violates the antifraud, books and records, internal control and periodic reporting provisions of the federal securities laws (Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13 and 13b2-1 thereunder). , In addition to the injunctive relief, Turner agreed to pay $1 in disgorgement and a civil penalty of $1,000,000, Carpenter agreed to pay $143,455, comprising $33,000 in disgorgement, $10,455 in prejudgment interest and a civil penalty of $100,000, and Sanderson agreed to pay $270,595, comprising $150,000 in disgorgement, $45,595 in prejudgment interest and a civil penalty of $75,000.  Carpenter also agreed to be barred permanently from serving as an officer or director of a public company and Sanderson agreed to be barred for a period of five years., The settlements are subject to court approval.  The Commission expects that the penalties from the settling defendants will be distributed pursuant to the Fair Fund provisions of Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.   , Separately, Jones consented, without admitting or denying the Commissions findings, to the entry of a Commission Order pursuant to which he is ordered to cease and desist from committing violations of the antifraud, books and records and internal controls provisions of the securities laws (Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder), and from causing violations of the books and records, internal controls and periodic reporting provisions of the securities laws (Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder).  The Commissions Order also finds that Jones, a certified public accountant, engaged in improper professional conduct within the meaning of Rule 102(e)(1)(ii) of the Commissions Rules of Practice and that he willfully violated and aided and abetted the violation of provisions of the federal securities laws within the meaning of Rule 102(e)(1)(iii).  Accordingly, the Order denies Jones the privilege of appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant with a right to apply for reinstatement after three years.  , Burr, Dollar Generals former CFO, has not reached a settlement with the Commission.  In its complaint, the Commission charges Burr with insider trading, violating the antifraud, books and records and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws and aiding and abetting the books and records, periodic reporting and internal controls provisions of the securities laws.  The Commission seeks against Burr a permanent injunction against future violations, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest thereon, and civil penalties.

The court permanently restrained and enjoined Knee from further violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Court made specific findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding Knees conduct in the fraudulent offer and sale of Focus Mentors securities, in the form of investment contracts.  Knee was ordered to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $15,000., The Court found that Mohamad Elzein, Hussein Hassan El Zein, and Knee, from approximately July through October 2001, raised in excess of $500,000 from investors in a fraudulent, unregistered offering of securities.  The Court concluded that Knee made materially false and misleading statements and omissions in connection with the offer and sale of the  investment contracts including, among other things, false historical returns, security of the investment, and that Knee promised rates of returns without a reasonable basis therefor.  The Court also concluded that Knee took accurate information from the Focus Mentors principals, altered it to make it factually inaccurate, and that Knee thereafter promoted Focus Mentors on his MoneyJoe.com website and in his related electronic newsletter called Insiders Club in which he described Focus Mentors as a secure opportunity with 107% plus principal guaranteed even though Knee had no reasonable basis for such statements.  The Court also concluded that over 90% of Focus Mentors securities investors came to that company through Knees promotional efforts over his website and through his electronic newsletter.  The Court also found that while Knee was entitled to receive a 5% sales commission plus an override, he never received payment of a commission from the company, and that Focus Mentors principals used Knees commission funds to assist in repaying defrauded investors.  As a result, the Court found that disgorgement was not appropriate, but ordered Knee to pay a $15,000 civil penalty within 30 days from the entry of the judgment.

The Commissions action alleges that from 1998 through 2001, Chancellor officials schemed to inflate Chancellors reported assets, revenue and profits using fabricated documents and fraudulent accounting, and that the companys auditors and certain outside directors failed in their responsibilities to address the fraud.  Franklyn E. Churchill, Chancellors former president/COO, and Rudolph Peselman, a former outside director consented to the entry of judgments barring them from serving as officers or directors of public companies and Churchill agreed to pay a $55,000 civil penalty.

The Commissions request for a temporary restraining order was granted by the Honorable Judge Frederick Motz, who, pending a preliminary hearing, also froze certain assets of defendants Larry Michael Parrish and Michael Edward Zimmerman, the two entities through which they conducted the alleged fraud, defendants Z-Par Holdings, Inc. and Z-Par Investment Fund II, LLC, and certain assets of relief defendants Edward Akopian and the entity he controls, Capital Ban Corp.  The SEC alleges that unbeknownst to investors, most of their money was transferred to relief defendants Edward Akopian and the entity he controls, Capital Ban Corp and subsequently used to speculate in the gold and silver markets., The Commissions complaint alleges that the defendants, Larry Parrish and Michael Zimmerman, working off of leads generated by a small, Georgia-based broker-dealer, collected more than $8.2 million from investors, including several retirees, by falsely promising that the funds would be held at Citigroup and managed by the defendants to produce steady, risk-free returns of between 1 and 5 percent per month through investment in debt securities issued by the top fifty banks.  In fact, contrary to what investors were told, the majority of the invested funds were ultimately transferred to Capital Ban Corp. and Akopian, who leveraged them and then used them to engage in highly speculative and expensive trading in the precious metals markets.  , Specifically, the complaint charges the defendants with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks, against each, civil penalties, disgorgement of all ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and preliminary and permanent injunctions barring future violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws., Unscrupulous promoters continue to victimize the public with Prime Bank schemes.

The Commissions complaint alleges that from June 1999 through December 2000, the defendants, acting as principals of a hedge fund called KFSI Equity Fund, L.P. (KFSI Fund), misappropriated more than $3.7 million of the $7.5 million raised by the KFSI Fund.  The defendants raised money from approximately 45 investors by claiming that the KFSI Fund would generate profits by trading in securities.  , The Commissions complaint alleges that in early 2000, the defendants began diverting money in the KFSI Fund to pay for the operations of a broker-dealer the defendants controlled, Krieger Financial Services, Inc. (Krieger Financial), and to pay for their own personal expenses.  According to the Commissions complaint, Peter Krieger was the president, director and control person of Krieger Financial and directed most of the trading activity in the KFSI Fund; Sheldon Krieger was a control person of Krieger Financial and participated in the day-to-day operations of the KFSI Fund; and Madey was the chief financial officer of Krieger Financial and the KFSI Fund.  , According to the Commissions complaint, the defendants concealed their misappropriation of funds, as well as losses in the KFSI Fund as a result of unprofitable securities trades, by issuing false KFSI Fund account statements.  The Commissions complaint alleges that these account statements materially overstated the value of customer accounts, and that these false account statements induced numerous investors to invest additional money in the KFSI Fund.  The Commissions complaint also alleges that towards the end of 2000, when the KFSI Fund suffered significant losses due to unprofitable trades and the defendants misappropriation of funds, the defendants defrauded investors again by promoting and selling fictitious bonds and promissory notes issued by Krieger Financial.  According to the Commissions complaint, these fraudulent investments could not sustain the KFSI Fund or Krieger Financial, and both entities ceased operating in January 2001., The Commissions complaint charges Peter Krieger, of West Palm Beach, Florida, Sheldon Krieger, of Jupiter, Florida, and John Madey, of Jupiter, Florida, with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and with violating, or aiding and abetting violations of, Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  The complaint seeks, among other things, injunctive relief, disgorgement and civil penalties., In a simultaneous filing, the State of Floridas Office of Statewide Prosecution (OSP) issued a 15-count criminal information against Peter Krieger, Sheldon Krieger and Madey based on their activities at the KFSI Fund and Krieger Financial.

The complaint alleges further that, on at least five different occasions between December 1999 and August 2001, Alina Welt tipped her husband, Andrew Welt, to proposed confidential transactions, and in turn, Andrew Welt tipped a friend, Bruce Hirschhorn and his brother, Bruce Welt.

As part of the settlement, KPMG consented to the entry of a final judgment in the SECs civil litigation against it pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.  The final judgment, which is subject to approval by the Honorable Denise L. Cote, orders KPMG to pay disgorgement of $9,800,000 (representing its audit fees for the 1997-2000 Xerox audits), prejudgment interest thereon in the amount of $2,675,000, and a $10,000,000 civil penalty, for a total payment of $22.475 million.  The final judgment also orders KPMG to undertake a series of reforms designed to prevent future violations of the securities laws.  , In addition, the SEC today entered an Order finding that KPMG caused and willfully aided and abetted Xeroxs violations of the anti-fraud, reporting, recordkeeping and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws.  The Order also finds that KPMG violated its obligations to disclose to Xerox illegal acts that came to its attention during the Xerox audits.  The Order censures KPMG and orders it to cease and desist from committing or causing these violations.  KPMG consented to the entry of the Order without admitting or denying the SECs findings.  , The SECs Order finds that from 1997 through 2000, KPMG permitted Xerox to manipulate its accounting practices to close a $3 billion gap between actual operating results and results reported to the investing public.  During this period, Xerox used topside accounting actions at the end of financial reporting periods to increase equipment revenue and earnings through the improper acceleration of revenue from long term leases of Xerox copiers and through manipulation of excess or cookie jar reserves.  Most of Xeroxs topside accounting actions violated generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and all of them inflated and distorted Xeroxs performance but were not disclosed to investors.  These undisclosed actions overstated Xeroxs true equipment revenues by at least $3 billion and overstated its true earnings by approximately $1.5 billion during the four-year period.  , According to the Order, in each of the years 1997-2000, KPMG issued audit reports containing unqualified opinions stating that KPMG had applied generally accepted auditing standards (GAAS) to its review of Xeroxs accounting, that Xeroxs financial reporting was consistent with GAAP and that Xeroxs reported results fairly represented the financial condition of the company.  However, the Order finds that throughout this period KPMG failed to comply with GAAS and allowed Xerox to utilize accounting actions that did not comply with GAAP.  By doing so, KPMG allowed Xerox to manipulate its accounting practices to distort the companys financial results, failed to insist that Xerox disclose those practices and their financial impacts in the companys annual and quarterly reports, and allowed Xerox to falsify its books and records and to fail to maintain adequate internal controls over its accounting.  , The Order finds that KPMG was intimately familiar with the accounting actions Xerox used on a quarterly and annual basis to increase reported revenues and earnings during 1997-2000.   KPMGs audit partners received many warnings from member firms of KPMG International in Europe, Brazil, Canada and Japan that methods adopted by Xerox to close the gap between actual and desired results were not based on adequate evidentiary support.  Even KPMGs U.S. office in Rochester, N.Y., where Xerox had a major manufacturing and administrative center, warned that topside adjustments were creating unnecessary internal accounting control weaknesses.  Nevertheless, from at least 1997 through 2000, KPMG ignored these warnings and did not demand evidence sufficient to establish that these accounting actions and the assumptions Xerox asserted to justify their use were in fact grounded in business realities or fairly reflected the companys performance., Although KPMG at times suggested to Xerox management that it test the assumptions and results of its accounting adjustments to ensure they accurately portrayed Xeroxs business, year after year Xerox management ignored KPMGs requests, and KPMG exerted no pressure on its client to perform such testing.  KPMG did not demand that Xerox test, and KPMG itself never adequately tested, the assumptions Xerox used to justify its topside accounting actions.  Nor did KPMG test -- or demand that Xerox test -- to determine if the topside accounting actions Xerox used resulted in financial statements which fairly presented Xeroxs financial results.  , In addition, the Order finds that during its audits of Xeroxs 1997-2000 financial statements, KPMG became aware of information indicating that illegal acts had or may have occurred as a result of Xeroxs use of accounting actions.  Although KPMG at times raised concerns to Xeroxs management about certain of these accounting actions, KPMG failed prior to the SECs investigation in this matter to inform Xeroxs board of directors or its audit committee about these illegal acts.  Moreover, in 1999 when Xerox complained to KPMGs chairman about the performance of KPMGs audit engagement partner, KPMG replaced the partner after completion of the 1999 audit., As a result of these findings, the SECs Order finds that KPMG willfully violated Section 10A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and caused and willfully aided and abetted Xeroxs violations of Section 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13 and 13b2-1 promulgated thereunder.  The SEC ordered KPMG to cease and desist from committing or causing these violations and censured the firm pursuant to Rule 102(e)(1)(iii) of the Commissions Rules of Practice., In the separate federal court litigation, KPMG consented to the entry of a final judgment finding that it violated Section 10A of the Exchange Act and ordering it to pay the disgorgement, interest and civil penalty identified above.  As part of the settlement, the SEC agreed to dismiss the other claims asserted against KPMG in the federal court action.  In addition, KPMG consented to perform remedial undertakings designed to prevent future violations of the securities laws that arose from circumstances that were present in this case.  The remedial undertakings include reforms in the following areas:, The SECs civil fraud injunctive action against the five KPMG audit partners involved in the Xerox audits during 1997 through 2000 is ongoing.  That action was originally filed against four partners (and KPMG) on January 23, 2003.  The SEC filed an amended complaint on October 3, 2003, to include charges of fraud against an additional KPMG partner.  <i>Securities and Exchange Commission v.

Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, Xerox consented to the entry of a Final Judgment that permanently enjoined the company from violating the antifraud, reporting and record keeping provisions of the federal securities laws.

Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, Leighton has consented to pay $1,939,264 in disgorgement, $660,282.78 in prejudgment interest thereon and $750,000 in civil penalties.  Leighton simultaneously resolved a parallel action with the NASD in which he will pay a fine of $750,000., In addition, Leighton consented to the entry of a final judgment enjoining him from further violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5.  In a separate administrative action, Leighton consented to the entry of an administrative order by the Commission, without admitting or denying the findings therein, that will permanently bar him from association with any broker or dealer., The Commissions complaint against Leighton includes the following allegations:  , The Commissions complaint alleges that by engaging in these trading practices, Leighton defrauded Knights institutional customers by depriving them of best execution in connection with hundreds of institutional orders.  Consequently, the complaint alleges, Leighton and the firm improperly realized tens of millions of dollars in excessive per share profits from its institutional customers.  Accordingly, Leighton violated Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5.  , In the NASD proceeding, the NASD found Leighton violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, and NASD Conduct Rules 2110 and 2120, by intentionally employing a scheme to defraud, engaging in a course of business that operated as a fraud on institutional customers of Knight, and employing deceptive and fraudulent devices in connection with the purchase and sale of securities to Knights institutional customers.  Leighton agreed to settle the NASDs parallel proceeding without admitting or denying the NASDs findings or allegations., In December 2004, the Commission and the NASD brought settled enforcement actions against Knight.  The enforcement actions resulted in payments of over $79 million in disgorgement, civil penalties and fines.  In Knights settlement with the Commission, the firm consented to the issuance of an administrative order, without admitting or denying the findings therein, that found that Knight (i) willfully violated the broker-dealer antifraud provisions of the Exchange Act  (Section 15(c)(1)(A)) and multiple provisions of the books and records provisions of the Exchange Act (Exchange Act Section 17(a) and Rules 17a-3(a)(1), 17a-3(a)(7), 17a-4(b)(1) and 17a-4(b)(4) thereunder), and (ii) failed reasonably to supervise pursuant to Section 15(b)(4)(E) of the Exchange Act with a view to preventing violations of Sections 15(c)(1) and 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 17a-3(a)(1) thereunder.

Hanna is a resident of Rancho Santa Fe, California, and the former Executive Vice President of Research and Chief Scientific Officer of Biogen Idec, Inc. (Biogen).  In its Complaint, the Commission alleged that Hanna obtained approximately $124,000 in illicit profits from insider trading in the securities of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Regeneron) in advance of Regenerons announcement on September 8, 2003 that it had entered into an agreement with Aventis, SA to develop and market a potential cancer treatment known as the VEGF-Trap (the VEGF-Trap).  , More specifically, in its Complaint, the Commission alleged the following.  In early July 2003, Regenerons representatives contacted Biogen to discuss a potential joint venture to develop and market Regenerons VEGF-Trap.  Shortly thereafter, Biogen representatives, including Hanna, and Regeneron representatives began discussing the possible joint venture.  During the course of these confidential discussions, which continued through early September, Hanna learned that the VEGF-Trap was scientifically and commercially viable; that Regenerons preclinical stage testing of the VEGF-Trap produced positive results; that the VEGF-Trap had blockbuster sales potential; and the financial terms Regeneron required for the joint venture.  On August 18 and 19, 2003, while in possession of this material, nonpublic information, Hanna purchased 17,500 shares of Regeneron stock at prices ranging from $13.95 to $14.15 per share.  On September 9, 2003, one day after Regeneron announced its agreement with Aventis, SA , Hanna sold all 17,500 shares of Regeneron stock at $21.15 per share, realizing a profit of $124,000., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions Complaint, Hanna consented to the entry of a final judgment by the Court, which permanently enjoins Hanna from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Hanna also consented to pay disgorgement of $124,000, plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $248,000.

The Commissions Complaint, filed in February 2003, alleged that Norman, the founder of World Transport Authority, Inc. (WTA), knew of and approved materially false or misleading press releases and statements on the internet concerning WTA, that he failed to file required reports concerning his beneficial ownership and holdings of WTA stock, and that he permitted WTA to file materially false or misleading quarterly and annual reports with the Commission.  The Complaint also alleged that during the period when the false or misleading statements were being made, Norman sold, at inflated prices, at least 5.5 million shares of WTA stock without registration, realizing at least $1.8 million from the unlawful sales.  Norman never answered the Complaint., According to the Complaint, Norman was the founder and de facto chief executive of WTA, a Canadian corporation then headquartered in the San Diego, California area.  WTA claimed to have designed a revolutionary car, called the WorldStar, and a unique system for manufacturing the car, called a micro-factory, which could be set up in ninety days and thereafter produce one car per day.  The Complaint alleged, among other things, that in the year 2000 and into 2001, WTA issued numerous materially false and misleading press releases and other statements concerning licenses for production of the WorldStar in underdeveloped countries and regions, and the revenue expected from the license deals.  For example, in September 2000, WTA announced the sale of the license for China for $40 million, and projected revenues from the license over three years at $900 million.  The Commissions Complaint alleged that it was materially false and misleading to describe the license fee as a fixed amount when the agreement did not unconditionally commit the licensee to pay any fee at all.  The Complaint further alleged that even if the license led to the sale and production of cars, there was no reasonable basis to believe that it would do so quickly enough to fulfill the announced revenue projection., The Courts Final Judgment enjoins Norman from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(d) and 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, 13d-1 and 16a-3 thereunder, orders him to pay disgorgement of $1,800,000, plus prejudgment interest of $382,883, for a total of $2,182,833, and assesses a $1,800,000 civil monetary penalty against him.

Gerbasio, of Ocean City, New Jersey, and Raymond L. Braun, Jr., of New York, New York, two former employees of Fiserv Securities, Inc. (Fiserv), a broker-dealer headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the Complaint, Braun agreed to the settlement described below., The Commissions Complaint alleges that, from August 2002 until April 2004, Gerbasio was in charge of a Fiserv office in New York City that placed tens of thousands of market timing trades for certain hedge fund customers (the New York Market Timing Office).  Gerbasio also was the Vice President of the Mutual Fund Department for Fiserv in Philadelphia.  Braun was the Mutual Funds Operations Supervisor of Fiservs New York Market Timing Office, and reported directly to Gerbasio., The Complaint alleges that, from at least August 2002 until October 2003, Gerbasio and Braun participated in a scheme to defraud hundreds of mutual funds and their shareholders by engaging in deceptive practices in connection with market timing by two hedge fund customers.  Specifically, in response to hundreds of notifications from mutual funds monitoring and restricting excessive trading, including kick-out letters rejecting market timing trades, defendants employed a variety of deceptions and evasions on behalf of the hedge fund customers, including misrepresenting the nature of their trades to the funds, opening dozens of accounts under different names to conceal the customers identities from the funds, entering trades in amounts that would avoid the funds detection triggers, trading in funds that were less likely to detect the unwanted market timing, and advising the customers on strategies to conceal their market timing from funds that objected to and/or prohibited this trading., The Complaint further alleges that, using these fraudulent tactics, defendants placed thousands of market timing trades for the hedge fund customers that would have otherwise been rejected by the fund companies.  Between August 2002 and October 2003, the two hedge fund customers placed 37,965 market timing trades.  As a result of their conduct, Gerbasio and Braun received at least $454,797 and $125,318, respectively, in ill-gotten gains., The Complaint alleges that Gerbasio and Braun violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement together with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against both defendants.  Braun has consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from engaging in the violations set forth above, and ordering him to pay disgorgement together with prejudgment interest in the amount of $133,576.  The final judgment waives payment of all but $20,000, and does not impose a civil penalty, based on Brauns sworn financial statements submitted to the Commission., The Commission also announced the institution and settlement of enforcement proceedings against Fiserv and Dennis J. Donnelly, Fiservs former Chief Operating Officer, finding that Fiserv and Donnelly failed reasonably to supervise Gerbasio and Braun, with a view to preventing their violations of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the Commissions findings, Fiserv has agreed to a censure; to pay a total of $15 million, consisting of $5 million in disgorgement and a $10 million civil penalty; and to undertake measures to prevent future misconduct.

Carter (Carter) and American Financial Business, LLC (AFB) as defendants and The Carter Group, Inc. (Carter Group) as a relief defendant in the ongoing litigation against Timothy R. Heyman (Heyman), and Heyman International, Inc. (Heyman International).  The First Amended Complaint alleges that in conjunction with the $10 million Heyman International Ponzi scheme, Carter, through AFB, engaged in an unregistered and fraudulent offering of securities to approximately 100 additional investors.  These additional investors reside in Colorado, Kentucky, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Virginia.  , The Commissions First Amended Complaint alleges that from September 2002 to April 2004, Carter, through AFB, raised nearly $2 million from investors by offering and selling Depository Loan Agreements.  The First Amended Complaint also alleges that Carter represented that investors would earn a minimum return of 3% per month on their principal investment and that investor funds were fully refundable.  The First Amended Complaint further alleges that Carter and AFB misrepresented that AFB traded foreign currencies and employed foreign currency traders.  The First Amended Complaint also alleges that Carter told investors that he was going to send their funds to Heyman who would use their funds to trade foreign currencies.  The First Amended Complaint alleges that Carter could not, at any time during the AFB offering, refund investors principal as he promised. Additionally, the First Amended Complaint alleges that in reality, AFB did not trade foreign currencies or any other securities and none of the AFB investor funds were ever invested in any investment vehicle by Carter, Heyman or anyone else.  While Carter sent AFB investor funds to Heyman, in reality, Carter and Heyman were operating a Ponzi scheme.  The proceeds from Carter and AFBs offering were commingled with funds raised from Heyman International investors which where then used to pay AFB investors their purported monthly interest and Carters personal expenses.  The First Amended Complaint also alleges that Carter had no reasonable basis to represent to investors that Heyman would invest their funds in foreign currencies.  , Moreover, the Commission alleges that Carter used an AFB bank account to deposit the commingled Heyman International and AFB investor funds he received from Heyman that represented the purported interest earned from foreign currency trading.  The Commission further alleges that Carter transferred some of these investor funds to a bank account he controlled under the name of Carter Group, a Kentucky corporation for which Carter served as President.  Carter Group never performed any services for AFB for which it was owed any money.  , The First Amended Complaint alleges that Carter and AFB violated Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The private offerings are often referred to as PIPEs for private investment in public equity.  At the time of the misconduct, Pollet was in charge of investing SG Cowen proprietary funds in PIPE transactions., The Commissions Complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, alleges that during 2001 Pollet traded in the shares of ten public companies that either engaged in, or were contemplating engaging in, PIPE financings after receiving confidential non-public information about the upcoming PIPE transaction.  Specifically, Pollet routinely sold short the publicly traded securities of these PIPE issuers prior to the close of the PIPE transaction in order to lock in gains for SG Cowens proprietary account.  As a result of Pollets illicit trading, SG Cowen locked in over $4 million in trading profits, in addition to other gains SG Cowen made on the transactions.  In several instances, SG Cowen also acted as the PIPE issuers investment banker. , The Commissions Complaint also alleges that, in several instances, Pollets short selling was directly contrary to representations that SG Cowen made to PIPE issuers in connection with the PIPE transactions.  For example, SG Cowen specifically represented to some of the PIPE issuers that SG Cowen would not short sell the securities of such issuer prior to the close of the PIPE transaction.  SG Cowen also represented to each of the PIPE issuers that it was acquiring the PIPE securities with investment intent.  SG Cowen made these representations at a time when Pollet had already started to short sell the securities of these PIPE issuers.  , The Complaint alleges that through his fraudulent trading Pollet violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

During this time period, Allen Wolfson, one of two coordinators of the manipulation, controlled certain brokerage accounts in the U.S., and Chapman had trading authority over five Canadian brokerage accounts.

The Complaint alleges that in February 2005, Bio-Heal issued 12 million shares of its stock to Relief Defendants MRMG Holdings (MRMG), Kess Associates, Inc. (Kess) and ICOR, Inc.  These shares were issued without a restrictive legend based on an attorney opinion letter claiming that the 12 million shares were exempt from registration with the Commission pursuant to Rule 504 of Regulation D of the Securities Act.  According to the Complaint, Bio-Heal is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 of the Exchange Act and, therefore, is not entitled to use Rule 504 of Regulation D as an exemption from registration.  The Complaint further alleges that the attorney opinion letter is a fraud and that the telephone and facsimile numbers on it actually belong to a legal aid service which does not employ the attorney providing the opinion letter, nor does it furnish securities opinion letters.  , The Complaint alleges that MRMG and Kess transferred their Bio-Heal shares to two other Relief Defendants located offshore, Bela Enterprises, LLC, and Gibson Island Enterprises, LLC, who reaped more than $10 million in profits by dumping Bio-Heal shares while the stock was being touted to investors through the Internet.  On April 8, 2005, the Commission suspended trading in Bio-Heal stock.  The Commission filed its action to permanently restrain and enjoin Bio-Heal from continuing to illegally issue its shares and to restrain and enjoin Relief Defendants from trading in these illegal shares.    , The Commissions Complaint charges Bio-Heal with violations of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 and violations of Sections 10(b) and 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The Commission alleges that former director John E. Martin of Irvine, California, began buying Good Guys stock during the merger negotiations, then netted nearly $75,000 in illegal profits by selling the shares after news of the merger boosted Good Guys stock price.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Martin has agreed to settle the enforcement proceeding by paying approximately $150,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties and agreeing to a five-year bar from serving as an officer or director of a public company., According to the civil complaint filed by the Commission in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, Martin was summoned to a special meeting of the Good Guys board in early August 2003.  On August 5, 2003, Martin purchased 100,000 shares of Good Guys stock on margin.  Hours later, Martin participated in a board meeting concerning the potential acquisition of the company by CompUSA.  The board members, including Martin, continued to discuss the merger during August and September 2003, and Martin purchased several thousand additional shares of Good Guys stock during this time.  When the company later announced the news of the merger on September 29, 2003, Good Guys stock price rose 33% to $2.00 per share.  Shortly thereafter, Martin sold his Good Guys holdings, realizing an illicit profit of $73,625.  Martin also failed to file the required forms publicly reporting his purchases and sales of Good Guys stock. , The Commissions lawsuit charges Martin with trading on the basis of material, nonpublic information in violation of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  It also alleges that Martin, as a director of the company, failed to file with the Commission Form 4s reflecting his transactions in Good Guys.  Under the settlement, Martin will pay $76,360.52 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and a $73,625 civil penalty.

The SEC charged that in proxy statements filed with the Commission from 1997 to 2003, Tyson Foods made misleading disclosures of perquisites and personal benefits provided to Don Tyson both prior to and after his retirement as senior chairman in October 2001.  The SEC also charged the company with failing to maintain adequate internal controls over Don Tysons personal use of company assets.  Don Tyson was separately charged in the administrative proceeding with causing the companys violations and in the complaint with aiding and abetting the companys violations. , Both parties agreed to settle the charges by consenting to the entry of a final judgment in a civil action filed today in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia that orders Tyson Foods to pay a $1.5 million penalty and orders Don Tyson to pay a $700,000 penalty.  In addition, both parties separately consented to the entry of an SEC Order that orders the company to cease and desist from violating the proxy solicitation and periodic reporting provisions of the federal securities laws and orders Don Tyson to cease and desist from causing such violations.  The Order also orders Tyson Foods to cease and desist from violating the internal controls provisions of the securities laws.  The company and Don Tyson agreed to the settlements without admitting or denying the findings or allegations in the SECs Order and complaint., The SECs Order finds that while Don Tyson was employed as senior chairman from 1997 to 2001, the company provided approximately $3 million of perquisites and personal benefits to him, his wife, his daughters and three individuals with whom he had close personal relationships.  The Order finds that Don Tyson caused disclosure failures with respect to many of these perquisites because his responses to director and officer questionnaires were inadequate.  The Order also finds that many of those perquisites had not been raised with or authorized by the companys compensation committee.  According to the Order, the $3 million in perquisites included:  , The Order further finds that in its proxy statements filed for 1997 to 2001, the company:  , In addition, according the Order, the companys 2002 and 2003 proxy statements used the same misleading terms travel and entertainment to describe the continuation of Don Tysons perquisites pursuant to an October 2001 retirement agreement with the company and failed to disclose fully the nature and scope of those benefits.  , The SEC also finds and alleges that due to internal control failures at Tyson Foods throughout most of 1997 to 2003, many of the perquisites described above (totaling approximately $1.5 million) were neither raised with nor authorized by the companys compensation committee or its board of directors.  Thus, for example, the board members were unaware until the SECs investigation that the company was paying for substantial personal expenses incurred by Don Tyson and two of his friends or that Don Tysons family and friends regularly used the company aircraft while he was not on board.  Nor was the board aware until November 2002, as a result of an internal company review of perquisites, of the housekeeping, lawn maintenance, telephone services and automobile maintenance provided to Don Tyson and his family and friends., Finally, the SEC finds and alleges that Don Tyson, who signed the companys annual reports that incorporated the proxy statements for each fiscal year from 1997 to 2003, caused and aided and abetted the companys disclosure failures.  In each year from 1997 to 2003, he signed director and officer questionnaires used to prepare the companys proxy statements that failed to identify or quantify various perquisites.  Before signing them, he failed to read the questionnaires or take action to ensure the accuracy of the companys disclosure of his perquisites even though he was the only individual who possessed certain information necessary to accurately complete the questionnaires.  In addition, he provided the company an incomplete list of perquisites that he had received for 2002, which omitted the fact that the company had paid for personal expenses for him and two of his friends and had provided housekeeping, lawn maintenance, automobile maintenance and telephone services to him and his family and friends., As a result of these and other findings, the SECs Order finds that Tyson Foods violated Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(B) and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 13a-1, 14a-3 and 14a-9 thereunder, and orders the company to cease and desist from committing any violations and any future violations of these statutory provisions and rules.  The SECs Order also finds that Don Tyson caused the companys violations of Sections 13(a) and 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1, 14a-3 and 14a-9 thereunder, and orders Don Tyson to cease and desist from causing any violations and any future violations of the foregoing statutory provisions and rules.

(Brown Investments), their principals, Kenneth W. Brown and Wendy E. Brown, and a registered representative of K.W. Brown Investments, Michael S. Cimilluca, Jr., alleging violations of the antifraud, recordkeeping, and investment adviser reporting provisions of the federal securities laws.  , The Commissions complaint alleges that between 2002 and 2004, Kenneth Brown and Cimilluca improperly profited from trading in securities that the Advisers also bought and sold on behalf of their clients.  According to the Commissions complaint, in September 2002, Kenneth Brown and Brown Investments hired Cimilluca to day-trade the Brown Investments proprietary account (the Brown Trading Account).  As compensation for his day-trading, Cimilluca received 50% of all profits from the Brown Trading account.  The Complaint also alleges that from September 2002 to May 2003, Cimilluca was also responsible for executing Brown Investments customer trades, including trades for the Advisers clients who maintained their brokerage accounts at Brown Investments.  For these services, Cimilluca was only paid 1% of all commissions generated from trades he executed.  The Commissions Complaint alleges that Cimillucas compensation structure gave him an incentive to steer more profitable trades to the Brown Trading Account, and that he repeatedly allocated better prices on securities transactions to the Brown Trading Account than to the Advisers clients.  According to the Commissions Complaint, these favorable trades generated over $330,000 in profits for the Brown Trading Account.  , The Commissions complaint also alleges that the Advisers routinely misstated their assets under management in Forms ADV filed with the Commission between May 2002 and March 2004, and failed to provide the Commissions staff with required books and records on a timely basis.  , The Commissions complaint charges the Advisers with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and with violating Sections 204, 206(1), 206(2) and 207 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers Act) and Rules 204-1(a)(2) and 204-2(a)(8), charges Kenneth Brown with violating, or aiding and abetting violations of, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 207, 204, 206(1), and 206(2) of the Advisers Act and Rules 204-1(a)(2) and 204-2(a)(8) thereunder, charges Wendy Brown with violating, or aiding and abetting violations of, Sections 204, 207, 206(1) and 206(2) of the Advisers Act, and charges Cimilluca and Brown Investments with aiding and abetting violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Advisers Act.

Joo (Joo) for their participation in fraudulent insider trading schemes that yielded collective profits in excess of $970,000.  In its complaint, the Commission alleged that, during 2002 and 2003, Shin and Joo misappropriated material nonpublic information from the investment banks where they worked, respectively, Chanin &amp; Co. LLC (Chanin) and Houlihan Lokey Howard &amp; Zukin, Inc. (Houlihan), and tipped Sibal, Chin, Chiu and Sabet in advance of one or more of four separate merger transactions.  The defendants used the misappropriated information to trade in the securities of one or more of the following companies: NCS Healthcare, Inc. (NCS), The DeWolfe Companies, Inc. (DeWolfe), Prime Retail, Inc. (Prime Retail) and Airborne, Inc. (Airborne).  The complaint alleges that during the course of these multifaceted and highly profitable insider trading schemes, the individuals who executed the trades shared certain of their illegal profits with, or paid kickbacks to, Shin and/or Joo.  , The Commissions complaint alleges that the schemes began in or around July 2002, when Shin misappropriated information from Chanin concerning a tender offer for its client, NCS.  Shin shared this information with Joo, who then tipped Chiu, a colleague of his at Houlihan.  Chiu purchased shares of NCS shortly before the public announcement of the tender offer and reaped illegal profits of $11,330.  Chiu paid a kickback to Joo of approximately $1,200, which Joo split with Shin. , The complaint further alleges that, in or around August 2002, Joo misappropriated information from Houlihan concerning a tender offer for its client, DeWolfe.  Joo shared this information with Shin, who then tipped Sibal, a colleague of his at Chanin.  Sibal purchased shares of DeWolfe shortly before the public announcement of the tender offer and reaped illegal profits of $129,298.  Sibal paid Shin a kickback of approximately $4,500, which Shin split with Joo.  Shin also tipped Chin, who purchased shares of DeWolfe for himself and Shin through various brokerage accounts he controlled.  Through this trading, Chin made illegal profits of $13,792 and $11,645 for Shin.  In addition to the tipping done by Shin, Joo tipped Sabet, who was a former Houlihan colleague.  Sabet traded shares of DeWolfe through an account he controlled, made illegal profits of $4,805, and paid Joo a kickback of $1,000., According to the Commissions complaint, beginning in approximately August 2002 and through a substantial part of 2003, Joo misappropriated information concerning Prime Retail, a client of Houlihan that it was assisting with financial restructuring, including identifying potential acquirors of the company.  Joo shared material nonpublic information concerning Prime Retail with, among others, Shin, who in turn provided it to Sibal.  Sibal bought Prime Retail stock on the basis of this material nonpublic information, and Shin also bought Prime Retail stock in his own account and through an account that Chin maintained on his behalf.  The complaint further alleges that Shin provided material nonpublic information about Prime Retail to Chin and to others, who, in turn, bought Prime Retail stock.  Through their illegal trading in shares of Prime Retail, Sibal made profits of $330,302, Shin made profits of $11,318, Chin made profits of $18,436, and Shins other tippees made profits of $9,150., Finally, the Commissions complaint also alleges that in February of 2003, Joo misappropriated material nonpublic information concerning Airborne, a Houlihan client, with regard to the potential sale of its ground operations unit to DHL Worldwide Express.  As outlined in the complaint, Joo, along with Chiu, met with Shin and disclosed the impending deal.  The trio discussed several series of call options in which they believed trading could yield substantial profits.  Shin tipped Sibal, who purchased both Airborne stock and out of the money call options, and reaped illegal profits of $325,080.  Sibal paid Shin a kickback of $11,400, of which Shin gave Joo $1,000.  Shin also bought Airborne stock and out of the money call options, and made illegal profits of $50,194 - of which he paid Joo $12,000.  Shin also tipped Chin, who purchased Airborne call options and made illegal profits of $54,425, which he split with Shin.  Chiu tipped family members, who made $3,043 trading Airborne stock in advance of the merger announcement., Without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, Sibal, Shin, Chin, Chiu and Sabet have consented to the entry of a permanent injunction prohibiting them from further violations of Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder.  These settling defendants have agreed to pay a total of $1,111,515.23 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest and penalties:  , Joo has not settled with the Commission.  The complaint against Joo seeks a permanent injunction against future violations of Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  , In addition, based upon the courts anticipated entry of the final judgment, Sibal, Shin and Chiu each have agreed, without admitting or denying the Commissions findings, to the issuance of a settled administrative order finding that each has violated Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder.  The Commission Orders will bar Sibal and Shin from associating with any broker or dealer, and will bar Chiu from associating with any broker, dealer or investment adviser.  , Today, in related criminal actions, the United States Attorneys Office for the Central District of California announced that Sibal, Shin, Chin, and Chiu each have agreed to plead guilty to conspiring to commit securities fraud and wire fraud - an offense carrying a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment and a fine of up to approximately $2 million.  During the course of its investigation, the Federal Bureau of Investigation seized from Sibal, among other items, his brokerage accounts, valued at approximately $650,000, and his BMW X-5 automobile.  As part of his plea, Sibal agrees to forfeit these items to the government.  All four defendants also have agreed to pay full restitution to the victims of the offense., Joo, who has not entered into any plea agreement, was arrested on criminal charges this morning.

Thomas, who lived in Mount Vernon, N.Y. during the time of the relevant conduct in the late 1990s, illicitly obtained the information from the magazine, which he intercepted from the U.S. Mail on its way to subscribers and news stands, in violation of postal regulations.  Thomas shared information from the Inside Wall Street column with a friend and traded in his own accounts.  Thomas trading in stocks mentioned in a year-and-a-half period enabled him to reap profits of $154,268.61.  Thomass friend, Lionel Thotam, who settled with the Commission in October 2002 for insider trading, profited by $77,213.38 from inside information Thomas provided him. , Under the terms of the settlement, Thomas has consented, without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions Complaint, to the entry of a final judgment that (1) permanently enjoins Thomas from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, (2) orders Thomas to disgorge the $153,711.99 in profits and to pay prejudgment interest in the sum of $273,503.73, and (3) orders Thomas to pay a civil penalty of $153,711.99.  The relief was ordered by Judge Arthur D.

He tipped Thotam to the information.  Thotam paid Thomas $10,000 for Thomass efforts, and updated Thomas on his profits from the illegal trades.  Starting in June 1997 and continuing through January 1999, Thomas also traded in his own accounts in the stocks of the companies mentioned in the Inside Wall Street column.  In almost all instances, Thotam and Thomas bought stock of companies favorably mentioned in the column on Thursday afternoons and sold the stock after the price increased the next day, after the column had been published.  Thomass profits amounted to $153,711.99.

The Commission filed the complaints in two separate actions, the first concerning the original wrong number scheme and the second concerning a similar, copycat scheme.  In one action, the Commission charges Michael OGrady and two affiliated Augusta, Georgia-based telemarketing companies, Telephone Broadcasting Company, LLC (TBC) and Telephony Leasing Corporation, LLC (TLC), with broadcasting wrong number stock tips touting the stocks of six small, thinly-traded companies.

Wiseman, a former chief financial officer of Chesapeakes former subsidiary, Chesapeake Display &amp; Packaging (CD&amp;P); and Douglas J.

Without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions complaint, four of the defendants have agreed to settle this matter by consenting to the entry of final judgments against them.  The fifth, defendant Rex, has consented to the entry of a judgment which imposes injunctive and other non-monetary relief against him but defers for determination by the Court the amount of civil money penalty he will be ordered to pay.   , The Commissions complaint alleges, among other things, that the defendants engaged in a financial fraud which resulted in Chesapeake materially misstating its reported quarterly earnings for the first and second quarters of 2000 and its anticipated earnings for the third quarter of 2000.  Specifically, the complaint alleges that, in an effort to bolster CD&amp;Ps flagging financial performance and forestall a possible sale of CD&amp;P, Wiseman and Rex improperly recorded revenue and delayed recording write-offs which had the result of materially overstating Chesapeakes net income for the first quarter of 2000, and smoothing improperly the earnings impact of the delayed write-offs over the second and third quarters of 2000.  Tolley and Gonzalez knew, or were reckless in not knowing, of certain of the improper accounting practices prior to Chesapeakes filing of its first and second quarter financial statements with the Commission in quarterly Forms 10-Q, which Tolley signed in his capacity as Chesapeakes chief financial officer and Senior Vice President of Finance, and Chesapeakes issuance of an October 2, 2000 press release announcing its anticipated third-quarter earnings.  , As alleged in the complaint, these improper accounting practices included: , In addition to the foregoing, the complaint also alleges that Rex posted two unsupported and fictitious journal entries, which Wiseman approved, that artificially increased U.S. Displays third-quarter 2000 earnings by $7.3 million in order to meet the earnings forecast previously provided to Chesapeakes senior management.  These false journal entries were discovered before Chesapeake filed its third-quarter Form 10-Q with the Commission.  Chesapeake undertook an internal investigation that identified certain of the accounting improprieties alleged in the complaint.  In November 2000, Chesapeake restated its reported earnings for the first and second quarters of 2000 in filings with the Commission, and reduced its previously announced earnings for the third quarter of 2000.  , Based on the facts alleged, the Commission charged the following violations:, Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, all of the defendants have agreed to settle the Commissions charges by consenting to the entry of final judgments (or, in the case of Rex, a judgment) that, if approved by the Court, would permanently enjoin each of them from further violations of the federal securities laws.  In addition, Wiseman and Rex have consented to be permanently barred from serving as officers or directors of any public company.  Tolley and Wiseman have consented to pay civil penalties in the amount of $50,000 each, and Gonzalez has consented to pay a civil penalty of $45,000.  Rex has consented to the entry of a judgment which defers for determination by the Court the amount of civil penalty he will be ordered to pay.  , Based upon the Courts anticipated entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him, Wiseman has also consented to the Commissions issuance of an administrative order, pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3) of the Commissions Rules of Practice, that will suspend him from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant.    , <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp19215.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>, <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19215.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Johnson, 68, of Newfane, Vermont and Brooklyn, New York, was sentenced to 18 months in prison.  The sentencing in the United States District Court in Burlington, Vermont, followed Johnsons guilty plea to two counts of mail fraud in December 2004.  The court also ordered Johnson to pay restitution totaling $1,643,589, serve three years of supervised release following completion of his prison term and perform 200 hours of community service.  On July 6, 2004, a federal grand jury in Burlington, Vermont, returned an indictment charging Johnson with 14 counts of mail fraud and one count of money laundering in connection with a fraudulent stock offering., According to the allegations of the indictment, in 1997 and 1998, Johnson fraudulently enticed about 150 persons across the country to invest approximately $2 million in Kultivar, Inc., a Vermont-based start-up company.  Kultivar was promoted as a company that was in the business of growing and marketing culinary, medicinal and decorative herbal products.  Although the offering materials claimed that Kultivar had products ready for the market, owned significant amounts of real estate and had substantial assets, in fact, Kultivar had no income, no products and few assets.  Eventually, Kultivar failed and investors lost all their money., As alleged in the indictment, in late 1999 and early 2000, Johnson defrauded some of the original investors a second time by soliciting an additional $50,000 that was supposed to be used to merge Kultivar with another company and then take the merged company public.  The proceeds of this later offering were to be deposited into an escrow account and used only for expenses connected with the proposed merger and public offering.  Instead, however, Johnson embezzled and misappropriated the proceeds., In a related civil action brought by the Commission in December 2000, the United States District Court in Vermont issued a temporary restraining order against Johnson, Kultivar and others in connection with the fraudulent stock offering.  In August 2002, by consent, the Court permanently enjoined Johnson from future violations of the antifraud and securities registration provisions of the federal securities laws and ordered him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains.  Also in August 2002, in settled administrative proceedings based on the entry of the injunction, the Commission barred Johnson from participation in any offering of penny stock.  In September 2003, a court-appointed receiver distributed all disgorged funds and liquidated assets to the victims of the fraud.

Leon Levy, Abecassis and Sabbah have also consented to entry of permanent injunctions against future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Information developed during litigation has caused the Commission to determine that dismissal was warranted., On February 19, 2004, the Commission filed a complaint against the defendants in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, Dallas Division, SEC v. Leon Levy, et al. Civ. No. 3:04-CV-0351-N (N.D. Tex.).  The Commissions complaint alleged that defendants engaged in insider trading in the common stock of Texas-based, Over-the-Counter-Bulletin-Board-traded iDial Networks, Inc., shortly before the August 27, 2003 announcement of iDials agreement to merge with GlobalNet, Inc.  On August 4, 2003, Yanni Abecassis and Leon Levy were present, as consultants to iDial, at iDial-GlobalNet merger negotiations in Panama.  According to the complaint, they received material non-public information about the merger and instructions to keep the information confidential.  Between August 4 and the August 27 merger announcement, Leon Levy and Ilan Sabbah each opened brokerage accounts with an Irving, Texas-based broker-dealer and purchased several million shares of iDial common stock through those accounts.  Leon Levy and Sabbah shared a residence in Panama with Abecassis during this period., The complaint alleged that Leon Levy traded on the basis of material non-public information concerning the merger, in breach of a duty of confidentiality that he owed to iDial and its shareholders; that Leon Levy and Abecassis tipped their housemate Sabbah about the merger, in breach of the same duty; and that Sabbah knew, or was severely reckless in not knowing, that the information was confidential and the tip improper, when he traded in iDial securities on the basis of the material non-public information.  , The complaint further charged that Abecassis established a Panamanian shell company, Atlantic 1, to receive proceeds of insider trading.  Between September 30 and November 26, 2003, Sabbah and Leon Levy disposed of their iDial shares by: (a) liquidating certain shares at prices resulting in substantial profits; (b) transferring shares to the Atlantic 1 brokerage account; and (c) transferring iDial sales proceeds to the Atlantic 1 brokerage account.  , Upon the filing of the action, the district court entered an asset freeze and order for accounting, repatriation, document preservation and expedited discovery.  To effectuate the asset freeze, the Commission staff worked closely with the Department of Justice to submit an asset freeze request under the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty with Panama, which resulted in the Panamanian banks honoring the U.S. courts freeze order., Defendants Leon Levy, Ilan Sabbah and Yanni Abecassis and relief defendant Atlantic 1 Corp. have agreed to a final judgment requiring, jointly and severally, disgorgement of $529,074, plus prejudgment interest of $15,141.

In addition to the criminal charges, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil lawsuit in federal district court against the two men., With the filing of its case today, the Commission has now sued a total of 16 individuals for their roles in the Homestore scheme. Wolff and Tafeen have become the tenth and eleventh defendants to face criminal charges in relation to the scheme. All of the defendants except Wolff and Tafeen have settled the Commission charges, pleaded guilty to the criminal charges where applicable and agreed to cooperate with the government. , The civil lawsuit and criminal indictment allege that Tafeen orchestrated the fraud scheme, and that Wolff and Tafeen participated in executing fraudulent round-trip transactions to artificially inflate Homestores revenue in order to exceed Wall Street analysts expectations. Wolff and Tafeen allegedly knew that the transactions fraudulently generated a circular flow of money in which Homestore recognized its own cash as revenue and concealed the scheme from the companys auditors. The civil and criminal cases also allege that Wolff misled investors and analysts about Homestores true financial condition and used the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks as a pretense for Homestores financial decline. Wolff and Tafeen both exercised stock options during the course of the fraudulent scheme, obtaining millions of dollars in proceeds. , Homestore.com is now known as Homestore, Inc., a Westlake Village, California, company that provides real estate listings and related services on the Internet.  , Wolff, 42, of Westlake Village, California, was Homestores CEO and chairman of the board from 1997 until he resigned in January 2002 during an internal investigation into the fraudulent scheme., Tafeen 36, of Parkland, Florida, was the executive vice president of business development at Homestore from 1997 until November 2001.  During his tenure, Tafeen reported directly to Wolff., The grand jury indictment charges Wolff and Tafeen with conspiracy to violate the securities laws, insider trading, creating false books and records and lying to Homestores accountants. Each defendant is charged with 19 counts, and each defendant faces a maximum possible sentence of 185 years in federal prison., An indictment contains allegations that a defendant has committed a crime. Every defendant is presumed innocent until and unless proven guilty., The Commission charged Wolff and Tafeen variously with violating or aiding and abetting violations of numerous provisions of the federal securities laws, including the antifraud provisions, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; reporting provisions, Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-13 thereunder; record-keeping provisions, Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder; internal controls provisions, Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act; and, as to Wolff, lying to the auditors provisions, Rule 13b2-2 under the Exchange Act.  The Commission is seeking permanent injunctions, penalties, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains and prejudgment interest, and an order permanently barring Wolff and Tafeen from serving as an officer or director of a public company., Previously in this investigation, nine defendants have pleaded guilty to criminal charges related to the fraudulent round-trip transactions, and two defendants have admitted in plea agreements that Homestore shareholders suffered losses of at least $100 million when the companys stock price dropped precipitously in 2002 when news of an investigation into accounting irregularities became public., The criminal case is the product of an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The civil case was investigated by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp19218.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>, <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19218.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The Court granted a temporary restraining order, asset freeze and other emergency relief against the defendants., In its complaint, the Commission alleges that CEC promised to pay monthly interest of approximately 7% to 11% (or annual returns of 120% to 260%) representing profits purportedly from trading in international markets.  Tanner, CECs originator and managing partner, maintains the CEC website that instructs new investors on how to purchase the CEC investment and issues monthly statements and newsletters to investors.

Spencer, a convicted felon, controls at least one bank account, held in Marrocs name, in which more than $5 million of investor funds was deposited.  In reality, the CECs international trading program does not exist, investors are not told about the backgrounds of Spencer and Kringen, and Spencer has misappropriated more than $1.5 million for personal expenses and Ponzi payments., The Commission also names in its complaint, as relief defendants, Margaret F.

Jones of the Southern District of New York entered an Order granting the Commissions motion for a preclusion order and summary judgment against Defendant Cole A. Bartiromo and Defendant Invest Better 2001 (IB2001), Bartiromos Internet alias.  The Order (1) precludes Bartiromo from introducing certain evidence based on his refusal to answer deposition questions and invocation of his Fifth Amendment privilege; (2) finds that Bartiromo and IB2001 violated Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17 (a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; (3) finds Bartiromo liable for ill-gotten gains of $47,216 in addition to the more than $1 million of gains the defendants previously disgorged to the Court; and (4) imposes a civil penalty against Bartiromo in the amount of $1,273,371. The Court found the civil penalty to be appropriate because, among other things, the boldness of the fraud conclusively demonstrates the Defendants high level of scienter, and because the risk of loss and the actual loss was substantial. The scheme ensnared approximately 5,000 victims, and would have continued to mushroom had Bartiromo not been caught. Previously, on May 29, 2002, the District Court issued an Amended Partial Final Judgment and Order, on consent, which permanently enjoined Bartiromo and IB2001 from violating the above registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, directed Bartiromo and IB2001 to repatriate all assets outside the United States and deposit such assets into the Courts account, froze Bartiromos and IB20001s assets and granted other relief.  , In its first amended complaint, filed January 7, 2002, the Commission alleged that Bartiromo raised more than $1 million from more than 1,000 investors through a scheme known as Invest Better 2001, which, from at least November 1, 2001, purportedly offered guaranteed and risk-free investment programs in which IB2001 pooled investors funds to bet on sporting events, and promised to repay investors between 125% and 2500% of their principal within specified periods ranging from three days to several weeks., In its second amended complaint, filed April 29, 2002, the Commission alleged that Bartiromo conducted an Internet pump-and-dump scheme in which he manipulated the stock price of fifteen publicly traded companies from approximately May 14, 2001 to July 5, 2001. More specifically, Bartiromo disseminated numerous false and misleading messages concerning publicly traded companies on the Internet. The complaint alleges that for each manipulation Bartiromo purchased large blocks of stock, consisting in some cases of nearly 50% of the volume on that day, then posted thousands of identical false messages on Internet message boards, and subsequently sold his entire position. According to the second amended complaint, Bartiromo posted over 6,000 messages and traded several million shares of the fifteen companies in this manner, and, as a result, generated a net profit of over $91,000., For additional information, see Litigation Release Nos. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17272.htm>17272</a>, <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17296.htm>17296</a>, <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17493.htm>17493</a>, <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17540.htm>17540</a>., <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19221.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The Commissions complaint, filed on July 24, 2003, alleges that, beginning in June 2000, the defendants engaged in a fraud arising out of the unregistered offer and sale of securities in Tecumseh, a purported financial services company with offices in New Jersey and California, and Tecumsehs subsidiary, Tradevest.  Tecumseh and Tradevest conducted the fraud largely through the efforts of Milling, a securities lawyer and Tecumsehs senior official.  According to the complaint, Tecumseh, Tradevest and Milling acted with the assistance of defendants Cantor, a registered broker-dealer; Gerard A. McCallion, Cantors President; Anthony M. Palovchik, Tecumsehs Vice President; and Dale Carone, manager of Tecumsehs California office; and others.  Through the unregistered fraudulent offerings, the defendants together raised approximately $10 million from about 500 investors nationwide.  The complaint also names as relief defendants three Tecumseh affiliates:  Alpha Fund, Alpha LLC, and Stracq, Inc., The complaint alleges that Tecumseh, Tradevest and Milling induced investors to acquire securities of Tecumseh and Tradevest by means of a host of material misrepresentations. Through offering memoranda and other materials, these defendants (a) touted false and misleading profit projections; (b) promised some investors returns on investment or dividends without disclosing that Tecumseh and Cantor had no earnings to distribute and that any such payments necessarily would come from capital, including funds raised from other investors; and (c) made materially misleading statements concerning NASD approval for Tecumsehs acquisition of Cantor.  Tecumseh, Tradevest and Milling knew or acted in reckless disregard of the fact that their representations to investors concerning these matters were materially false and misleading.  The complaint also alleges that relief defendant Stracq, Inc., in which Tecumseh held a controlling interest, was a recipient, without consideration, of proceeds of the fraud. , Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, Stracq, Inc. consented to the Final Consent Judgment ordering it to disgorge $660,000.  The judgment provides that it will be deemed satisfied by payment of $500,000 in cash to the court-appointed receiver for Tecumseh and the delivery to the receiver of a secured note payable to the receiver in the original principal amount of $160,000 in connection with the receivers sale of Tecumsehs controlling interest in Stracq to Stracqs current management.

Mobile Billboards of America, Inc., et al.</i>, Civil Action No. 1:04-CV-2763, N.D.Ga., The complaint alleges that Hollenbeck, Bradshaw and Gilley each engaged in the unregistered sale of Mobile Billboards securities in the form of investment contracts.  The investment contracts included the purchase of two billboard frames which sold for $20,000 per unit. Investors simultaneously leased the billboards back to Outdoor Media Industries, Inc. (Outdoor Media). Investors were told that Outdoor Media would purportedly pay the lease payments, approximating 13.49% per year, to investors. Mobile Billboards agreed to buy back the billboards after seven years at the full purchase price, purportedly guaranteed by Reserve Guaranty (Reserve Guaranty).  According to the complaint, the investment program functioned as a Ponzi scheme and relied on new investor money to make lease payments.  The complaint further alleges that the sales materials used by Hollenbeck, Bradshaw and Gilley made false claims about the number of operational billboards and misrepresented the value of other assets.  According to the complaint, the defendants knew or recklessly ignored information indicating that the Mobile Billboards program was a Ponzi scheme, and added misrepresentations of their own, including claims that the investment was secured or guaranteed.

Shane in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that Shane committed insider trading and registration violations by short selling securities of CompuDyne Corporation prior to the public announcement of a private investment in public equity (PIPE) offering and prior to the effective date of the resale registration statement for the PIPE shares.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Shane consented to the entry of a final judgment, subject to the court’s approval, in which she is permanently enjoined from further violations of the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws and agreed to pay disgorgement of the trading profits, plus prejudgment interest and a civil penalty totaling $1,075,015.  Shane also has consented to be barred from the broker-dealer industry and suspended from the investment advisory industry., The Commission’s complaint alleges that, in September of 2001, Shane was asked to participate in a PIPE offering by CompuDyne.  In a PIPE offering, investors commit to purchase a certain number of restricted shares from a company at a specified price and the company agrees, in turn, to file a resale registration statement so that the investors can resell the shares to the public.  The complaint alleges that the PIPE offering was likely to have a significant dilutive effect on the value of existing CompuDyne shares because the PIPE shares would increase the supply of stock in the market by more than 200% and the PIPE shares were offered at a price of $12 per share when the current market price was $17.38.   In fact, the market reacted negatively when CompuDyne announced the PIPE offering, with the price dropping to a closing price of $14.25.   The stock price continued to trend downward thereafter to close at $12.02 on the first trading day after the resale registration statement for the PIPE shares became effective., The Commission’s complaint also alleges that on October 8, 2001, Shane agreed to purchase shares in the PIPE offering for her personal account and for one of the hedge fund accounts she managed.  Shane agreed both orally and in writing to keep information about the PIPE offering confidential.  The following morning, before the public announcement of the PIPE offering, Shane began short selling CompuDyne securities in both her personal account and the hedge fund’s account.

The Commissions Complaint alleges that in connection with 17 follow-on offerings from 2000 through 2003, Galleon violated Rule 105 of Regulation M, which prohibits covering a short sale with securities obtained in a public offering if the short sale occurred beginning five business days before the pricing of the offering.  These violations occurred in seven of Galleons funds with the majority occurring in the Admirals Overseas fund.  , According to the Commissions Complaint, Galleon routinely created follow-on offering boxed positions by establishing a long position with shares purchased in an offering while simultaneously maintaining a pre-pricing short position in the securities of the same issuer.  In some instances, Galleon instructed its prime broker to flatten these boxed positions through the use of riskless, offsetting journal entries, a practice known as collapsing the box.  On other occasions, Galleon unwound its boxed positions by contemporaneously entering a market order to sell the offering shares and another order to purchase an equivalent number of shares, which were then used to cover the short position that had been established during the Rule 105 restricted period.  These unwinding transactions were entered through two different brokers and executed in the open market.  The Complaint further alleges that Galleon realized profits of $1,040,882 from these transactions.  Galleon, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions Complaint, has consented to pay a civil penalty of $870,247.  , On May 19, 2005, the Commission also instituted and simultaneously settled an administrative cease-and-desist proceeding against Galleon based on the same conduct.  (In the Matter of Galleon Management, L.P., Administrative Proceeding File No. 3-11928) (Order). Galleon agreed to settle the proceeding, without admitting or denying the findings in the Order.

Colker has agreed to settle the charges by consenting, without admitting or denying the findings in the Commissions complaint, to the entry of a final judgment in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois ordering him to pay a $100,000 civil penalty.  The settlement terms are subject to court approval., The Commissions complaint alleges that NSXs MOE rule required NSX dealers to provide customer market orders with the opportunity for price improvement whenever the spread between the national best bid and offer (NBBO) was greater than the minimum price variation (MPV).  In 1996, when NSX adopted the MOE rule, the MPV was 1/8 of a point and, as a result, the rule required an opportunity for price improvement at NBBO spreads of 1/4 point or greater.  In 1997, when the MPV decreased from 1/8 to 1/16 of a point, NSX continued enforcing the rule at spreads of 1/4 point or greater instead of at 1/8 point or greater.  At Colkers direction, NSX did not file a proposed rule amendment with the SEC seeking approval for its limited enforcement of the MOE rule, although NSX was required to do so.  NSX and Colker continued to enforce the MOE Rule only when the NBBO spread was at 1/4 point or greater even after October 2000, when the MPV was decreased from 1/16 of a point to $.01., The Commissions complaint further alleges that Colker, by implementing NSXs limited enforcement of the MOE Rule without first obtaining Commission approval through a proposed rule amendment, aided and abetted NSXs violations of Section 19(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act)., In related administrative proceedings, Colker and NSX consented to the issuance of a Commission Order.  NSX, without admitting or denying the findings in the Commissions Order, consented to a censure and an order to cease and desist from future violations of Sections 17(a), 19(b), and 19(g) of the Exchange Act and Rule 17a-1 thereunder.  In addition, NSX was ordered to undertake substantial remedial measures to bolster its regulatory and governance functions, including removing the current chief executive officer and his successors from any future role in NSXs regulatory functions.

As a result, National Equipment Services, Inc. overstated its assets and net income in its periodic filings with the Commission for 1999, 2000 and the first three quarters of 2001., According to the Commissions complaint, OConnor learned that significant balances for accounts receivable, rental equipment and inventory at two subsidiaries could not be substantiated at the end of 2000.  OConnor also learned that those two subsidiaries carried old and uncollectible accounts receivable.  Although local financial employees recommended writing-off the unsubstantiated and uncollectible account balances at the end of 2000, OConnor did not authorize the proposed write-offs until the fourth quarter of 2001.  OConnor also failed to fully disclose the amount of the proposed write-offs to National Equipment Services, Inc.s independent auditors.  National Equipment Services, Inc. subsequently determined that the unsubstantiated and uncollectible balances should have been written off earlier and restated its previously reported results for 1999, 2000 and the first three quarters of 2001.  The restatement materially reduced National Equipment Services, Inc.s net income for 2000 from $11.009 million to $6.053 million.  The complaint alleges that, as a result of the foregoing, OConnor violated the antifraud provisions and aided and abetted the reporting, record keeping and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws., OConnor agreed to a resolution of this matter, subject to the Courts approval.

Harden, Sr. and Philip E. Lowery, both of whom participated in the unregistered sales of RLLPs that were supposed to profit from online casinos.  , The Commission alleges in its complaint that between January 1999 and March 2001, Harden and Lowery violated the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws in connection with the sale of $5.8 million of Colorado Registered Limited Liability Partnership (“RLLP”) units.  According to the complaint, Harden formed the RLLPs and sold the units to investors ostensibly to provide them with an opportunity to share in the profits of Internet casinos, which were to be formed and operated by Lowery.  Harden and Lowery solicited more than eighty investors to purchase partnership units in ten RLLPs.  None of the offers or sales of these units were registered with the Commission as required by Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933.  , The Commission’s complaint further alleges that Harden and Lowery used high-pressure sales practices to target uneducated and financially unsophisticated, elderly investors, many of whom liquidated retirement accounts and other conservative investments to invest in the RLLPs.  According to the complaint, Harden and Lowery made false and misleading statements in connection with their selling efforts, including the provision of unrealistic profit projections and representations that the investments were guaranteed and the money would be used for partnership and casino business expenses.  The complaint alleges that, in fact, most of the funds were used to pay for Harden and Lowery’s personal expenses.  Eventually, investors lost all of their money after the casinos were shut down due to operational problems., The Commission’s action seeks permanent injunctions, orders of disgorgement and civil penalties against Harden and Lowery for violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The Commission had charged Butler with violating the federal securities laws by trading on the basis of material and non-public information concerning anticipated quarterly financial results of ForeSystems, Inc. (ForeSystems)., The Commission alleged that, approximately two weeks prior to the end of ForeSystems fiscal year 1997 fourth quarter, Butler placed option trades betting on a drop in the price of ForeSystems stock.  He placed these trades immediately after participating in a management conference call during which the participants discussed ForeSystems quarterly financial condition.  The Commission alleged that, during that conference call, Butler learned that ForeSystems likely would not meet analyst revenue predictions for the fourth quarter of 1997.  In fact, ForeSystems ultimately announced financial results for that quarter that were substantially below results predicted by analysts.

According to the Courts order, Eck and others devised a scheme to distribute to the public securities issued by companies controlled by M&amp;A West.  Through a series of transactions, Eck and others initially sold the companies securities to various nominees that Eck and others controlled.  Then, after creating artificial investor demand by trading among the nominees, the nominees sold the securities to the public.

SENTENCED FOR PERPETRATING FINANCIAL REPORTING SCHEMES</h2>]","[On April 22, 2005, the Honorable Carol E. Jackson of the United States District Court in St. Louis, Missouri sentenced David G. Barford, Kent D. Kalkwarf, David L. McCall and James H. Smith III for their roles in two financial reporting schemes that were the subject of a July 2004 Commission action against Charter Communications, Inc, one of the largest cable television operators in the United States.  One scheme caused Charter to report inflated subscriber numbers during certain periods in fiscal year 2001 and the other scheme resulted in inflated revenue and operating cash flow figures for fiscal year 2000., In the criminal case, Barford, Charters former Chief Operating Officer, pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and was sentenced to one year and one day in prison and was ordered to serve two years of supervised release after the prison term and to pay a $200,000 fine.  Kalkwarf, Charters former Chief Financial Officer, pled guilty to one count of wire fraud and was sentenced to 14 months in prison and was ordered to serve two years of supervised release after the prison term and to pay a $200,000 fine.  McCall, a former Charter Senior Vice President of Operations, pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and was sentenced to two years of probation and ordered to pay a $200,000 fine.  Smith, a former Charter Senior Vice President of Operations, pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and was sentenced to two years probation and ordered to pay a $175,000 fine. , In their plea agreements, Barford, McCall and Smith stipulated to certain facts, including that they knowingly participated in a scheme to defraud Charters stockholders by causing Charter to materially inflate the number of subscribers that it reported to the public in press releases and in filings with the Commission.  The purpose of the scheme was to meet internal and Wall Street analysts subscriber growth forecasts.  The number of subscribers and subscriber growth were material factors to prospective buyers and sellers of Charters stock.  Barford and others at Charter instructed employees to stop or postpone for longer than normal the disconnection of subscribers who had not paid their bills or subscribers who requested that their service be terminated.  McCall and Smith were directed to use these manipulative means to meet the forecasted subscriber numbers and in turn, they instructed Charter employees to hold disconnects.  As a result of this conduct, Charter reported materially inflated subscriber numbers to the public in press releases and in Forms 10-Q filed for the second and third quarters of fiscal year 2001 and in Form 10-K filed for fiscal year 2001.  Charter would not have been able to meet its quarterly subscriber growth forecasts without holding the disconnects., As part of his plea agreement, Kalkwarf stipulated that from on or about August 2000 to on or about February 11, 2001, he and others knowingly devised a scheme to defraud Charters stockholders by falsely inflating Charters year-end revenue and operating cash flow in order to meet internal and Wall Street analysts projections for those financial measures and ultimately to artificially inflate Charters stock price.  After realizing in or about August 2001 that Charters fiscal year 2000 year-end cash flow would be lower than projected, Kalkwarf, on behalf of Charter, entered into an agreement with two set top box suppliers that would generate the needed cash flow.  Specifically, the agreement provided that Charter would pay $20 more for each set top box purchased from the suppliers but then receive the same $20 back from the suppliers as advertising revenue. The purpose of this transaction was not to confer an economic benefit on these suppliers or on Charter, but rather to increase Charters reported revenue and cash flow.  As a result of the agreement, during the fourth quarter of 2000, Charter overpaid approximately $17 million to the suppliers for set top boxes and received the same amount back from the suppliers in advertising revenue.  Charter reported the $17 million as revenue and cash flow in its Form 10-K for fiscal year 2000 that it filed with the Commission.  , On July 27, 2004, the Commission issued an Order requiring Charter, pursuant to its consent, to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of certain reporting, books and records, and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws and required Charter to undertake significant improvements in its internal controls designed to prevent and detect future instances of the alleged misconduct.  The undertakings include adopting a zero tolerance policy on holding disconnects to inflate subscriber numbers, prohibiting the consideration of achieving subscriber growth targets as a component of employees bonuses and replacing its top-down budget process with a bottom-up approach which eliminates industry analysts projections as a component of setting Charters budget goals., For additional information, see Exchange Act Rel. 34-50098 (July 27, 2004); , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19240.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The sentencing in the United States District Court in New Haven, Connecticut, followed Andrewss October 29, 2003 conviction by a federal jury on nine counts involving federal bribery, mail and wire fraud, conspiracy to launder money, and making false statements to federal agents. , Andrewss conviction stems from his receipt of a consulting contract worth $1.5 million, arranged by former State Treasurer Paul J. Silvester, in connection with the State of Connecticuts investment of $150 million of state pension assets in a private equity fund in 1998.  Andrews was to receive half of the consulting fees generated by the investment, and had agreed with Silvester to share the remaining half with a close associate of Silvester.  Evidence at trial showed that Andrews agreed to this arrangement, intending to influence Silvesters investment decision, and with knowledge that a portion of the consulting fees would be kicked back to Silvester.  , The Commission filed a civil action in the United States District Court in Connecticut, in October 2000, charging Andrews, Silvester and nine others with securities fraud based on their involvement in the fraudulent kick-back scheme to invest state pension fund money.

Pardue,</i> (United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, 02cv8048, filed October 24, 2002)</h2>, <h2>SEC WINS INSIDER TRADING LAWSUIT AGAINST FORMER EXECUTIVE OF CENTRAL SPRINKLER</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that on April 1, 2005, the Honorable Robert J. Kelly, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, issued an opinion, following a non-jury trial of the matter on January 18, 2005, holding William J. Pardue liable for insider trading in the securities of Central Sprinkler Corp. in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5.  In addition, the Court found that Pardue made approximately $140,000 by misusing confidential information that Tyco International Ltd. planned to take over Central Sprinkler of Lansdale, Pennsylvania in 1999. , The Court determined that Pardue had worked for Central Sprinkler for over 20 years, rising to become a senior officer.   At the time of his trading, he was still employed by the company as a consultant.  The Commission contended that Pardue learned that Tyco was planning to acquire Central Sprinkler from his in-laws the Meyer family, who were officers and directors of Central Sprinkler, and that he illegally used the information to trade for his own personal profit.  The Court found that in the weeks before Tycos public announcement of the acquisition, Pardue spent over $200,000 to accumulate 13,100 shares of Central Sprinkler stock.  After the acquisition was announced, Pardue sold this stock for a profit of approximately $140,000.  In holding Pardue liable for insider trading, the Court found that the Commission had presented strong circumstantial evidence and that Pardues purchase of Central Sprinkler stock was highly suspicious.   The Court further found that [w]hen Pardues proximity to [the Meyer family] during the events in question is added, the Court is left with no other explanation of Pardues conduct other than his possession of material, non-public information.  , The Court scheduled a separate evidentiary hearing to determine appropriate relief, and on May 3, 2005, the Court entered a Final Judgment ordering Pardue to pay disgorgement of $25,000 and a civil penalty of $25,000, notwithstanding Pardues claim that he was unable to pay any monetary judgment.  In determining the disgorgement amount, the Court focused on Pardues present financial condition, noting that $25,000 is a sufficient amount to ensure that Pardue receives no gain from the wrong.  In determining the civil penalty, the Court stated that Pardue blatantly violated his obligation as an officer and stockholder of Central Sprinkler not to trade in his companys stock while aware of confidential information that would be of value in the market.  Further, the Court stated that to this day, Pardue fails to appreciate the gravity of his conduct or its wrongfulness and, as a result, a civil penalty of $25,000 was consistent with the seriousness of his violation and was appropriate to deter future misconduct., For further information about the Commissions action against Pardue, see <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17806.htm>Litigation Release No. 17806</a> (October 24, 2002)., <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19242.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Subject to court approval and without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Huntington consented to pay a penalty of $7.5 million.  In addition, Hoaglin, McMennamin, and Van Fleet agreed to pay disgorgement, pre-judgment interest, and penalties in the amounts of $667,609, $415,215, and $51,660, respectively.  The penalties may be distributed to harmed investors pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.  , According to the Commissions complaint, in 2001 and 2002 Huntington reported inflated earnings in its financial statements, enabling Huntington to meet or exceed Wall Street analyst earnings per share (EPS) expectations and internal EPS targets that determined bonuses for senior management.  The misstatements, which were qualitatively material, included up front recognition of loan and lease origination fees that were required by accounting rules to be deferred and amortized over the term of the loan or lease; improper capitalization of commission expenses and deferral of pension costs that were required to be recognized in the period incurred; misstated reserves; improper deferral of income; and misclassification of non-operating income as operating income.  Without the misstatements, Huntingtons EPS would have fallen short of analysts earnings expectations in 2001 and 2002, 2002 bonuses for Hoaglin and McMennamin would have been eliminated, and Van Fleets 2002 bonus would have been reduced.  All three individuals attended due diligence meetings at which all but one of the misstatements were discussed, and it was decided -- without considering the impact of the misstatements on management bonuses and Huntingtons ability to meet analysts expectations -- that none of the items were material.  All three individuals knew or should have known the impact the accounting misstatements had on bonuses and Huntingtons ability to meet analyst expectations.  , In a related settled administrative proceeding, the Commission charged that in 2001 and 2002 Huntington violated Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 thereunder; that Hoaglin violated Exchange Act Rule 13a-14 (the Sarbanes-Oxley provision that requires a CEO and CFO to certify the accuracy of a public companys financial statements) and caused Huntingtons violations of Securities Act Section 17(a)(2) and Exchange Act Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) and (B), and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 thereunder with respect to fiscal year 2002; that McMennamin and Van Fleet violated Securities Act Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3), Exchange Act Section 13(b)(5) and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder, and caused Huntingtons violations of Exchange Act Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 thereunder in 2001 and 2002; and that McMennamin directly violated Exchange Act Rule 13a-14 in 2002.  Each respondent has agreed to cease and desist from committing and/or causing the violations charged as well as any future violations of these provisions.  , As part of the settlement, Hoaglin agreed to disgorge his 2002 bonus of $480,000 and to pay pre-judgment interest, McMennamin agreed to disgorge his 2002 bonus of $240,000 and to pay pre-judgment interest, and Van Fleet agreed to disgorge $25,000, the portion of his 2002 bonus based on EPS targets, and to pay pre-judgment interest.

Amerindo is a registered investment adviser with offices in San Francisco, New York and London.  The Commission’s complaint seeks disgorgement of the defendants’ ill-gotten gains, civil penalties, and permanent injunctions from future violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  In addition, upon emergency motion by the Commission, the court granted a preliminary injunction against Amerindo, prohibiting Amerindo from future violations of the federal securities laws, and appointed a temporary monitor over Amerindo.  , The complaint names the following defendants:, The Commission’s complaint alleges that in approximately June 2002, Vilar solicited an Amerindo client and close personal friend to invest $5 million in a limited partnership, the Amerindo Venture Fund LP, that was purportedly being organized to qualify and be operated as a Small Business Investment Company (“SBIC”).  Shortly after the investor wired $5 million to a brokerage account as Amerindo had instructed, Tanaka began to transfer a portion of her funds to other accounts Vilar and Amerindo controlled.  Specifically, within several days of her investment, Tanaka signed letters of authorization directing the transfer of at least $1.65 million to other accounts, including $1 million to a personal checking account held in Vilar’s name, and $650,000 to a bank account Amerindo controlled.  Vilar then used the funds he received from the investor to pay personal expenses, including transferring $540,000 to Washington and Jefferson College, his alma mater to which he had pledged large sums, and $177,000 to the American Academy in Berlin, an institution to which Vilar had donated money in the past.  , The complaint alleges that when the investor subsequently inquired about the status of her SBIC investment, Vilar informed her that, although the U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”) had approved Amerindo’s application for an SBIC license, Amerindo had to re-apply for a license because of personnel turnover at the SBA.  Further, Vilar stated that, while this process was ongoing, Amerindo had to deposit funds for the SBA, and that her $5 million investment constituted part of the $10 million Amerindo was required to escrow to initiate the fund.  The complaint alleges that Vilar’s statements were false because the SBA never approved a license for the Amerindo Venture Fund LP (or any other Amerindo affiliated fund), and Amerindo, the purported adviser to the fund, never deposited any funds or otherwise escrowed $10 million for the SBA., The Commission’s complaint alleges that, based on the foregoing, Amerindo, Vilar and Tanaka violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint further alleges that Amerindo violated, and Vilar and Tanaka aided and abetted violations of, Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-2(a).  , On May 26, 2005, the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York arrested Vilar and Tanaka. , The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York and the United States Postal Inspection Service in connection with this matter., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp19245.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19245.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

When Telus announced its tender offer on August 21, 2000, the Watsons sold all of their stock and options, realizing $159,193.75 in illegal profits.  , Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, Linda and Scott Watson consented to the entry of a final judgment against them permanently enjoining them from future violations of Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder.  The final judgment orders Linda Watson and Scott Watson to pay $209,667.54 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest but waives payment of all but $120,000 and does not impose civil penalties based on the Watsons sworn representations in their Statements of Financial Condition and other documents and information submitted to the Commission., In a related criminal matter, on October 22, 2004, Linda Watson pled guilty to one count of perjury for providing false testimony to the staff of the Commission.

Civ. 05 CV 5325 (LP)</h2>, <h2>SEC CHARGES GEN RE EXECUTIVE FOR AIDING IN AIG SECURITIES FRAUD</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that it filed an enforcement action against John Houldsworth (Houldsworth), a former senior executive of General Re Corporation (Gen Re), for his role in aiding and abetting American International Group, Inc. (AIG) in committing securities fraud.  In its complaint filed today in federal court in Manhattan, the Commission alleged that Houldsworth and others helped AIG structure two sham reinsurance transactions that had as their only purpose to allow AIG to add a total of $500 million in phony loss reserves to its balance sheet in the fourth quarter of 2000 and the first quarter of 2001.  The transactions were initiated by AIG to quell criticism by analysts concerning a reduction in the companys loss reserves in the third quarter of 2000.  , In partial settlement of the Commissions claims, without admitting or denying the SECs allegations, Houldsworth consented to the entry of a partial final judgment which resolves all issues of liability against him but defers the determination of disgorgement and penalties until a later date.  As part of his settlement, Houldsworth has agreed to cooperate fully with the Commission in its continuing investigation of this matter., In its complaint against Houldsworth, the Commission alleges that Houldsworth and others at Gen Re worked with their counterparts at AIG to fashion two sham reinsurance contracts between Cologne Re Dublin, a Gen Re subsidiary in Dublin, Ireland of which Houldsworth was the Chief Executive Officer, and an AIG subsidiary.  , The complaint details the conversations of participants in the planning meeting and other conversations that led to AIGs filing of fraudulent financial statements.  On the basis of these conversations and other facts alleged, the complaint charges that all parties understood from the beginning that they were engaged in an undertaking to create sham transaction documents for the sole purpose of allowing AIG to make false accounting entries on its books., As Houldsworth and others at Gen Re knew, AIG accounted for the sham transactions as if they were real reinsurance contracts that transferred risk from Gen Re to AIG, when all parties involved knew that was not true.  As a result of AIGs accounting treatment for these transactions, the companys financial results showed false increases in reserves that AIG touted in the companys quarterly earnings releases for the fourth quarter of 2000 and the first quarter of 2001.  Without the phony loss reserves, AIGs financial results in both quarters would have shown further declines in its loss reserves.  In a press release dated March 30, 2005, AIG admitted that the accounting for these transactions was improper and would be corrected.  In its 2004 Form 10-K filed with the Commission on May 31, 2005, AIG restated its financial statements to recharacterize the transactions as deposits rather than as reinsurance., The Commissions complaint charges Houldsworth with aiding and abetting the violations by AIG and others of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2) and 13(b)(5) and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13 and 13b2-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Houldsworth, in addition to undertaking to cooperate fully with the Commission, consented to the entry of a partial final judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of these provisions, barring him from serving as an officer or director of a public company and deferring the determination of civil penalties and disgorgement to a later date.  , In addition, Houldsworth has agreed to a Commission administrative order, based on the injunction, barring him from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant, under Rule 102(e) of the Commissions Rules of Practice.  Houldsworth is licensed as a Chartered Accountant in England.  , The Commissions investigation is continuing.

Yoder, permanently enjoining him from future violations of the registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering disgorgement and pre-judgment interest of $394,991.70, and ordering a civil penalty of $110,000.  The judgment arises out of Yoders operation of two investment schemes that defrauded 85 investors out of more than $1.6 million.  Yoder, age 27, currently resides in Sarasota, Florida, but lived in Goshen, Indiana during the time he engaged in his fraudulent conduct.  , From December 2000 to February 2001, Yoder raised approximately $637,603 from investors in All the Way to the Top, a so-called loan program in which Yoder promised guaranteed returns of 40 to 50 percent per month.  Yoder made various misrepresentations about the use of investor funds and told investors that their investment was safe and risk-free.  Yoder used the money inconsistently with his representations to shareholders, and used a significant portion of the funds he raised for personal expenses, including an SUV, a sports car, and a motorcycle.  Yoder also used the funds to pay for trips to Switzerland and the Bahamas.  The investors received neither the interest that was promised them, nor were they able to recover their principal investment.  In January 2001, Yoder also raised over $1 million for a prime bank trading program.  Yoder told investors that the program was safe and risk-free, and that they would earn 100% return per week for eleven months through the trading of medium term notes.  In reality, such trading programs do not exist.  The investors never received any returns, and most investors lost their principal., Yoder was enjoined from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

McDermott, Jr. (McDermott), the former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, Inc., and Kathryn B. Gannon (a.k.a. Marilyn Starr), a former actress in adult films, based upon charges of insider trading.  In its Complaint filed on December 21, 1999, the Commission alleged that while he was Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, Inc., McDermott provided Gannon with material nonpublic information concerning merger transactions involving Central Fidelity Banks, Inc., Advanta Corporation, Barnett Banks, Inc., First Commerce Corp., California State Bank (West Covina), and First Commercial Corp.  The Complaint further alleged that Gannon made illegal profits of at least $88,135 by trading in these securities while in possession of material nonpublic information.  In addition, the Complaint alleged that Gannon tipped Anthony Pomponio (Pomponio) with material nonpublic information in advance of five of the merger transactions, that he traded on the basis of the information, and reaped illegal profits of at least $86,378.  The Commissions action against Pomponio continues., McDermott was indicted by the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, and on June 29, 2001, pled guilty to a single count of insider trading for tipping Gannon in connection with her trading in the securities of Barnett Banks, Inc., and was sentenced to five months incarceration.  On June 12, 2002, Gannon pled guilty to two counts of conspiracy to commit securities fraud in connection with this matter and was sentenced to three months incarceration.  , Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions Complaint, McDermott and Gannon each consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions contained within Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.  The Court also ordered McDermott to pay $230,464.23, comprising full disgorgement of Gannons profits of $88,135.05 and $54,194.13 in prejudgment interest, and a one-time civil penalty of $88,135.05.  While the court held Gannon liable for $141,157.75 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, based on sworn representations in her Statement of Financial Condition dated August 4, 2004, and other documents and information submitted to the Commission, the Court waived payment of disgorgement and prejudgment interest and did not order her to pay a civil penalty., Today, based on the entry of the Courts injunction, the Commission instituted settled administrative proceedings against McDermott.

According to allegations of the SECs complaint, the defendants have swindled more than 200 investors out of at least $1.4 million.  The Complaint further alleges that the fraud has been ongoing since at least August 2002, when UMDA and Gallo were sued by the SEC and indicted by the United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of Florida for securities fraud., The SECs Complaint alleges that Gallo, Rafferty, and Hornick raised funds, through UMDA and 3D, by offering promissory notes and common stock.  The defendants recruited investors by word of mouth and during seminars held at various locations throughout the country.  According to the SECs Complaint, Gallo told investors that 3D had the technology to meet current demands of the music, movie, and cellular telephone industries.  Gallo and Rafferty touted UMDA and 3D as having many valuable contracts with expected revenue in the hundreds of millions of dollars when, according to the SECs Complaint, UMDA reported a net loss of over $1.4 million in its last quarterly report.

Force, the owner of automobile dealerships in Kentucky and Tennessee.  The Commission’s complaint alleges that from June 1998 through December 1999, Force engaged in highly profitable, illegal securities trading based on inside information he received from his broker, Chad Conner, about seven upcoming mergers or acquisitions. According to the complaint, Force knew or was reckless in not knowing that the stock recommendations he received from Conner were based on information misappropriated from two investment banking firms in New York City.  Based on the inside information, Force made substantial investments in these seven stocks, purchasing as much as $1 million worth of stock in a single transaction.  After the deals were announced, Force made more than $1.5 million in profits from his trading, often obtaining high returns in a matter of days or weeks.  Force also shared some of the recommendations with his daughter, who purchased stock in advance of four deals and reaped more than $220,000 in profits.  , Conner’s source for the inside information was James Cooper, one of Conner’s clients, who obtained the information from a source at the New York investment banks.  The Complaint alleges that Force compensated Cooper by purchasing stock in one of the seven companies on behalf of Cooper and his brother.  Force then authorized Conner to pay $20,000 out of Force’s account to the Coopers, representing the profits from that stock purchase.  According to the complaint, Force also arranged for and guaranteed $250,000 in loans from his bank to Cooper and his brother, enabling the Coopers to continue to trade on the inside information.  At the time that Force arranged these loans and paid the $20,000 to the Coopers, Force had never met or spoken to them., Force has agreed to settle the charges against him by consenting, without admitting or denying the findings in the Commission’s Complaint, to the entry of a final judgment by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York ordering him to pay a total of $4,152,197.  This amount includes disgorgement of Force’s profits in the amount of $1,515,213 and disgorgement of his daughter’s profits in the amount of $221,062; prejudgment interest in the amount of $900,709; and a civil penalty of $1,515,213.  The final judgment also enjoins Force from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3.  The settlement terms are subject to court approval., The Commission’s complaint alleges that Force’s trading was part of a broader insider trading scheme that was launched on the Internet and ultimately involved more than twenty individuals located in and around New York City and Bowling Green, Kentucky.  Eighteen individuals have been convicted criminally for their roles in the scheme and the Commission has also obtained civil judgments against those eighteen individuals, including Cooper and Conner.  , For additional information, please see <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18149.htm>Litigation Release No. 18149</a> (May 20, 2003), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17912.htm>Litigation Release No. 17912</a> (January 2, 2003), and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr16469.htm>Litigation Release No. 16469</a> (March 14, 2000).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19252.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

(later known as eBT International, Inc.), a now defunct software company headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts.  Hill, age 41, the former General Counsel of Inso Corporation, was convicted by a jury sitting before U.S. District Judge Douglas P. Woodlock on charges brought by the United States Attorney for the District of Massachusetts.  The jury was deadlocked as to the five remaining counts against Hill: one count of securities fraud, two counts of wire fraud, one count of false statements to accountants and a second perjury count.  The Court declared a mistrial as to those counts., Evidence was presented at the month-long criminal trial that at the end of September 1998, Inso Corporation arranged a sham transaction whereby a Malaysian software distributor signed a purchase order for roughly $3 million upon assurances that Inso would actually sell the software to another customer within a few days or weeks.  At the end of 1998, Hill, who was the Vice President, Secretary, and General Counsel of Inso, played a pivotal role in arranging a series of deals that were designed to create the appearance that the Malaysian software distributor had paid Inso $3 million for software products that Inso had reported as sold during the third quarter of 1998.  In sworn testimony during a Commission investigation, Hill disavowed any knowledge about the preparation of a fraudulent certificate which purported to reflect approval by Inso’s Board of Directors of the issuance of approximately $4 million in letters of credit that were used to create the appearance that Inso received $3 million in payment for the reported third quarter sale.  The United States presented evidence at the criminal trial that, contrary to his sworn investigative testimony, Hill had personally directed the preparation of the certificate and approved its signing., Judge Woodlock has not yet scheduled a date for sentencing.  For his perjury conviction, Hill faces a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment to be followed by 3 years of supervised release and a $250,000 fine., Hill is the third individual to face criminal charges arising from revenue overstatement at the former Inso Corporation.  On September 30, 2003, Richard Vatcher, Insos former Vice-President in charge of worldwide sales pled guilty to violations of the securities laws. Charges are still pending against Hill’s co-defendant Graham Marshall, Insos former Vice President and Manager of the Electronic Publishing Division.  Marshall, age 58, of Aslackby, Sleaford Lincolnshire, United Kingdom, is subject to ongoing extradition proceedings., On June 21, 2002, the Commission filed related civil enforcement actions against Hill and certain other senior officers of Inso.

District Judge for the Eastern District of Tennessee, granted the Commission’s motion for summary judgment and entered a final judgment against Dianna Blairtorbett (“Blairtorbett”) on June 3, 2005.  In its order, the Court directed Blairtorbett to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest and a civil penalty in the amounts of $5,080,266, $1,908,784 and $50,000, respectively, within 30 days from the entry of the final judgment.  The Court concluded that Blairtorbett’s consent to an earlier order, which enjoined her from further violations of the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws, amounted to a stipulation in the instant motion, that all allegations of the complaint were true. On April 1, 2003, Blairtorbett was permanently enjoined from further violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and from further violations of the registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act.  On August 1, 2003, a judgment by default was entered against Blairtorbett’s codefendant, McMinn Consultants, Limited., The complaint in this matter alleged that Blairtorbett and her company McMinn fraudulently offered and sold unregistered securities by promising extravagant rates of return derived from a variety of investments, including purported prime bank trading programs.  The defendants raised approximately $7.7 million from nearly 100 investors in thirteen states and the funds were pooled into accounts owned and controlled by McMinn.  The complaint also alleged that the defendants made misrepresentations and omissions of material fact to investors concerning, among other things, the touted risk free nature of McMinn’s investments, the use of investor funds, expected returns and the false representation that McMinn’s investments were secured by approximately $7 billion in gold and other precious metals.  The precious metals did not exist.  Furthermore, the complaint alleged that Blairtorbett falsely represented that an initial investment of $50,000 would be worth approximately $1.7 million in three years and $22 million in five years, but that she had no basis for these representation, and that she knowingly or recklessly failed to disclose that a significant percentage of investor funds would be used to pay the “returns” of earlier investors.  , See also: <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17919.htm>L.R. 17919</a> (January 7, 2003); <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18068.htm>L.R. 18068</a> (April 3, 2003); and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18282.htm>L.R. 18282</a> (August 11, 2003),  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19254.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The complaint alleges that each of the defendants provided false or misleading documents or information to Fischer’s accountants or auditors in an attempt to conceal Fischer’s improper accounting practices., Based on this conduct, the Commission claims that each of the defendants violated or aided and abetted violations of some or all of the following provisions of the federal securities laws:  Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2), and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, 13a-14, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder.  The complaint seeks final judgments enjoining the defendants from future violations of these provisions, and ordering each of them to disgorge ill-gotten gains and pay civil money penalties.  The Commission also seeks an order barring Rivelli, Johnson, Burke and Ayers from serving as an officer or director of a public company., On November 15, 2004, with Fischer’s consent, the Commission ordered Fischer to cease-and-desist from violating the antifraud, reporting, and recordkeeping provisions of the federal securities laws based on the same accounting misstatements.

Perry (“Perry”) and M. Brooks Turkel (“Turkel”) with securities fraud in connection with the offer and sale of municipal bonds issued in May 2001, by Mount Sinai Medical Center of Florida, Inc. (“Mount Sinai” or the “hospital”), a hospital based in Miami Beach, Florida.   Perry and Turkel were senior officers of Mount Sinai.  Specifically, Perry was the hospital’s chief executive officer from January 1999 through October 2001, and Turkel was its chief financial officer from December 1999 through July 2001 and then its chief planning officer from July 2001 until October 2001.   , The complaint alleges that Perry and Turkel made material misrepresentations and omissions in the Official Statements and other documents disseminated to investors in connection with a series of three bonds issued by Mount Sinai in May 2001, through the City of Miami Beach Health Facilities Authority, totaling approximately $184 million (the “2001 bond offerings”).  Specifically, the complaint alleges that Mount Sinai, through Perry and Turkel, made material misrepresentations and omissions in connection with the 2001 bond offerings because it failed to disclose in the Official Statements that the hospital was experiencing a significant deterioration in its cash position, and was in the midst of a severe liquidity problem.  Further, the complaint alleges that the Official Statements misrepresented that eight of Mount Sinai’s high volume managed care contracts had been renegotiated, and that the renegotiated contracts were expected to contribute approximately $10 million annually of additional revenue for the hospital beginning in 2001.  According to the complaint, the Official Statements also contained baseless projections of the hospital’s anticipated revenue.  , As alleged in the complaint, Perry and Turkel re-iterated the above misrepresentations to institutional investors and bond rating agencies prior to the 2001 bond issue.  Moreover, the complaint alleges that Mount Sinai, through Perry and Turkel, made additional misrepresentations and omissions in its second quarter report for the quarter ended June 30, 2001, which was filed with various repositories in accordance with the terms of the bond covenants., The complaint alleges that, as a result of the foregoing, Perry and Turkel violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Commission seeks a permanent injunction against Perry and the imposition of civil money penalties against Perry and Turkel.  Turkel has consented, without admitting or denying, to the entry of a Final Judgment imposing a civil money penalty of $35,000 against him.     , In a separate administrative action, the Commission issued an Order Instituting Cease-and-Desist Proceedings, Making Findings, and Imposing Cease-and-Desist Order (“Order”) against Mount Sinai, Turkel and another former senior officer of Mount Sinai.  The Order, which makes findings based on the same conduct alleged in the Commission’s complaint against Perry and Turkel, orders Mount Sinai, Turkel and the other former senior officer to each cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Mount Sinai, Turkel and the other former senior officer each consented to the issuance of the Order without admitting or denying any of its findings.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19256.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

(collectively, the Focus Companies), and their principals Max Francois, Aiby Pierre-Louis, and Jean Fritz Montinard.  According to the Complaint, the defendants engaged in an affinity fraud that targeted members of the Haitian-American community in Miami through local radio programs and presentations to Haitian-American church congregations.  The case, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, has been assigned to Judge Michael Moore.   , The Commission’s complaint alleges that from February 2002 to July 2004, the Focus Companies and their principals raised approximately $6 million from about 600 Haitian-American investors living in South Florida.  The Defendants offered twelve-month term notes that purportedly generated “guaranteed” annual returns of 15 to 20%.  The Defendants told prospective investors that the funds they invested would be distributed to companies operating under a related “Focus” name, including an airline providing direct flights between Miami and Haiti, a tax return preparation service, a chiropractic center, a landscaping service, an auto dealership, and two auto repair shops, among others.<sup> </sup>  The individual Defendants touted their experience in running these businesses, and claimed that the returns to investors would be paid from the profits that were being generated by the businesses.  Defendants claimed that the investment provided a unique opportunity for members of the Haitian community to earn a guaranteed return of over 15%, while at the same time creating jobs and making an investment in their own community.  In truth, Defendants’ scheme was a Ponzi scheme because all principal and interest payments made to investors were made with new investor funds, and not the new businesses’ profits.  , The SEC’s Complaint alleges that, as a result of their conduct, Defendants violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), and Rule 10b-5, thereunder.

Poyiadjis agreed to disgorge approximately $200 million of unlawful profit from his trading in AremisSoft stock, and to entry of a final judgment that prohibits him from acting as an officer or director of a public company.  The judgment, which was entered on April 20, 2005, permanently enjoins him from future violation, or conduct giving rise to violation, of the antifraud, reporting, and other provisions of the federal securities laws (Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b), 13(a), and 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, 16a-2, and 16a-3 under that Act).  The disgorged funds will be distributed to defrauded investors pursuant to a distribution plan for beneficiaries of the AremisSoft post-bankruptcy estate.  Poyiadjis consent is without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint. , The Commissions complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on October 4, 2001, charged that AremisSoft, its co-chairmen and co-CEOs Poyiadjis and Lycourgos Kyprianou, made fraudulent statements in public filings and press releases, including:  1) reporting in AremisSofts 2000 financial statements millions of dollars in sales to entities that either did not exist as operating businesses or did not purchase product from AremisSoft; 2) reporting in AremisSofts 1999 and 2000 financial statements that the company paid a total of $32.7 million to acquire three software companies, when in fact the actual purchase prices paid ranged from approximately $100,000 to $300,000; and 3) misrepresenting the value of and revenue earned from a contract with Bulgarias Health Insurance Fund in press release and public filings.  The complaint further alleged that Poyiadjis and Kyprianou, acting through offshore entities, engaged in massive insider trading during the period of the fraud, selling millions of shares of AremisSoft stock.  Olympus Capital Investments, Inc. and Oracle Capital, Inc. were charged as relief defendants.  , On October 19, 2001, the Honorable Charles S. Haight, Jr. entered a preliminary injunction against Poyiadjis, Kyprianou, and the relief defendants that, among other things, froze proceeds of their illegal AremisSoft stock sales and directed all defendants to repatriate the tainted funds to the United States.  Kyprianou failed to answer the complaint or comply with the Courts order and remains a fugitive from justice., On July 22, 2002, the Honorable Charles L. Brieant of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York issued a Final Judgment of Permanent Injunction and Other Relief on consent against AremisSoft, prohibiting AremisSoft and its successor, Softbrands, Inc., from violating the antifraud and reporting provisions of the federal securities laws.  As part of the resolution, AremisSoft consented to a Commission Order, pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(j), revoking registration of its common stock.  AremisSoft neither admitted nor denied the allegations in the Commissions complaint or the findings in the Commissions Order., On March 15, 2002, AremisSoft filed a petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.  On July 15, 2002, the Honorable Joel A. Pisano of the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey entered an order confirming AremisSofts Chapter 11 Plan and authorizing AremisSoft to enter into the settlement with the Commission.  , On March 22, 2002, the United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York initiated a civil in rem forfeiture action in the United States District Court for that district, seeking forfeiture of funds frozen by the High Court of Justice of the Isle of Man in four bank accounts located there.  The freeze order was secured by the Isle of Man Attorney General at the request of the United States Attorney General on the basis of information provided by the Commission.  After the New York Court entered a default judgment in the civil forfeiture action on June 3, 2002, the Isle of Man Attorney General, again at the request of the United States Attorney General, applied to the High Court for registration of the civil forfeiture judgment, preliminary to an order repatriating the funds to the United States.  On June 24, 2002 a superseding indictment issued against Poyiadjis, Kyprianou, and another former AremisSoft officer, M.C. Mathews, charging securities fraud, money laundering and conspiracy to commit securities fraud, mail fraud, wire fraud, and money laundering. , The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Isle of Man Attorney General in this matter., <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19259.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

BLAU, Securities Act of 1933 Release No. 8581, Exchange Act of 1934 Release No. 51809 / June 9, 2005</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that it filed a civil action in federal district court against: Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc., a New York-based publisher and distributor of video and computer games; the companys former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Ryan Brant; its former Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, Larry Muller; its former Chief Financial Officer, James David, Jr.; and its current Vice President of Sales, Robert Blau for fraudulent accounting practices designed to inflate its reported revenue during fiscal years 2000 and 2001.  Those practices allowed Take-Two to consistently meet or exceed analysts predictions regarding its earnings per share during all four quarters of fiscal year 2000 and to meet certain financial targets which triggered the payment of substantial bonuses to Brant, Muller and David.  The Commission has also issued an order in a related administrative proceeding against Blau.  , According to the Commissions complaint, Take-Two systematically recognized sales revenue from approximately 180 parking transactions in which the company, at or near the end of fiscal quarters or year end, shipped hundreds of thousands of video games to distributors who had no obligation to pay for the product, fraudulently recorded the shipments as if they were sales, and then accepted return of the games in subsequent reporting periods.  In many cases, Take-Two created fraudulent invoices to disguise the returns as purchases of assorted product.  Take-Two also improperly recognized sales revenue for games that were still being manufactured and could not in fact be shipped, and in fiscal year 2000, improperly accounted for the acquisition of two video game publishers.  In addition, from fiscal year 2000 through the third quarter of fiscal year 2003, Take-Two failed to establish proper reserves for reductions in the prices of its games at the retail level (referred to in the industry as price protection or price concessions)., Muller was the principal architect of the fraudulent parking transactions.  At Mullers direction, Blau arranged and executed several of those transactions.  For example, Muller instructed Blau to arrange a large parking transaction at the end of Take-Twos fiscal year 2000 with Capitol Distributing, a distributor formerly based in Virginia.  On October 31, 2000, Take-Twos fiscal year-end, Blau arranged a shipment of 230,000 video games to Capitol with the understanding that the shipment would be returned.  Take-Two improperly recorded $5.4 million in revenue from the shipment - which at that time was Take-Twos largest sale ever.  Capitol subsequently returned the entire shipment.  In an effort to hide the return from Take Twos auditors, Blau arranged, at Mullers direction, for the return to be made through an affiliate of Capitol and to disguise the return as a purchase of assorted product from that Capitol affiliate.  , David knew about the fraudulent sales and parking transactions during 2000 and 2001 -- including the disguising of returns as purchases of new inventory, and the impact of those transactions on Take-Twos reported financials.  Brant was similarly aware that Take Two was making certain shipments to Capitol and he knew that some games from those shipments were being returned.  He also discussed with Muller and David treating some of those returns as purchases of new inventory.  Consequently, Brant knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that Take-Twos reported financial results in 2000 and 2001 were materially inflated by the transactions with Capitol.  Yet Brant and David signed Take-Twos Form 10-K for fiscal-year 2000 (filed on January 29, 2001) and David signed its Form 10-Q filed on April 30, 2001.  , Take-Twos fraudulent accounting practices allowed it to improperly recognize approximately $60 million in revenue during 2000 and 2001, and report after-tax fiscal year 2000 earnings that were inflated by $20 million.  Take-Twos quarterly revenue and/or earnings were materially overstated in nine of fifteen quarters from 2000 through the third quarter of 2003.  On December 14, 2001, after press accounts appeared regarding concern that the Company would have to restate its earnings for fiscal year 2001, the price of Take-Two shares declined 31 percent on trading volume of 20.3 million shares, more than ten times the average trading volume for Take-Two shares during the previous three months.  , In February 2002, Take-Two restated its financial statements for its fiscal year ended October 31, 2000 and the first three quarters of its fiscal year 2001 to correct for approximately 90 parking transactions during the period that the Company had used to inflate its revenues.  The Companys February 2002 restatement also corrected for its improper accounting for the acquisition of two video game publishers in 2000.  In February 2004, Take-Two again restated its financial statements.  In its 2004 restatement, Take-Two corrected for its failure to set aside reserves for future price concessions during fiscal year 2000 through the end of the third quarter of fiscal year 2003.  The Companys February 2004 restatement also corrected for the improper accounting treatment of approximately 88 additional sales transactions during 2000 and 2001 that had inflated its revenues., Take-Two consented to pay a penalty of $7.5 million.  Brant consented to pay a penalty of $500,000 and disgorgement and pre-judgment interest of $3,103,252; Muller consented to pay a penalty of $500,000 and disgorgement and pre-judgment interest of $1,215,720; David consented to pay a penalty of $200,000 and disgorgement and pre-judgment interest of $793,949; and Blau consented to pay a penalty of $50,000 and disgorgement and pre-judgment interest of $64,508.  The settlements are without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, and are subject to court approval.

From approximately 1986 until May 2001, Slatkin operated a massive Ponzi scheme in which he raised more than $593 million from approximately 800 investors.  , In her plea agreement, Janu admitted that, at Slatkins direction, she created and revised account statements and other documents that supported Slatkins claim that he held over $500 million in securities in brokerage accounts at the fictitious entity NAA Financial of Zurich, Switzerland.  Janu knew these documents were to be submitted to the SEC.  Janu created these bogus statements on her computer and printed the NAA account statements on blank, European-sized stationary provided to her by Slatkin that contained NAAs name and purported Swiss address.  Slatkin then instructed Janu to erase the account statements from her computer., During the SEC investigation, Janu falsely testified under oath that she did not have any knowledge of any foreign accounts held by Slatkin.  In addition, Janu falsely testified that she had never heard the name NAA Financial., On June 7, 2001, in the SECs action, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered a judgment of permanent injunction against Slatkin.

Anderson (Anderson), Zomaxs former Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, and his wife, Michelle Bedard-Anderson (Bedard-Anderson), Zomaxs former Executive Vice-President of Sales and Marketing, engaged in insider trading by liquidating their 821,250 shares of Zomax stock on the basis of material, non-public information that Zomaxs third quarter 2000 revenue and earnings would be lower than current consensus estimates.  Specifically, the Complaint alleges that in August 2000 Anderson and Bedard-Anderson sold 365,250 shares of Zomax stock in open market transactions.  Shortly thereafter, Anderson and Bedard-Anderson used the Jim and Mikki Anderson Charitable Reminder Annuity Trust (Trust) to sell their remaining 465,000 shares of Zomax stock.  As a result, Anderson and Bedard-Anderson allegedly avoided losses of approximately $9 million.  The Commissions complaint also alleges that Anderson tipped his friend, Neil Dolinsky (Dolinsky), to sell his shares of Zomax stock on the basis of material, nonpublic information.  As a result, Dolinsky allegedly avoided losses totaling $139,014. , The Complaint further alleges that Anderson and James E. Flaherty (Flaherty), Zomaxs former Chief Financial Officer, misrepresented or omitted to state material facts about Zomaxs prospects of meeting projected third quarter revenue and earnings targets.    Specifically, Anderson and Flaherty, in a conference call with analysts on July 24, 2000 allegedly represented that Zomax would meet its projected revenue target and analyst expectations.  Zomax, Anderson, and Flaherty also allegedly failed to disclose information concerning the decrease in demand for Zomaxs products and the material loss of business during this call and in Zomaxs Form 10-Q for the second quarter of 2000.  The Complaint also alleges that Anthony Angelini (Angelini), Zomaxs former President and Chief Operating Officer recklessly failed to act to prevent such disclosures and omissions of material facts from being made.  When Zomax announced it would not meet analysts estimates for the third quarter 2000 its stock dropped 61%., As alleged in the Commissions Complaint, Zomax violated Sections 10(b) and 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20 and 13a-13 thereunder by filing a materially misstated Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2000.  Furthermore, Anderson, Flaherty violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder by making material misstatements and omissions regarding the third quarter sales and revenue for Zomax and aided and abetted Zomax in violating Section 13(a) and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-13 thereunder and Angelini aid and abetted Zomaxs violations.  Anderson, Bedard-Anderson, Dolinsky and the Trust also violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder by their trading in Zomax securities and tipping others who traded.  Moreover, Anderson violated Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 16a-3 and 16a-8(b)(3)(i) thereunder for failing to report the sales of Zomax stock by the Trust. , Zomax, Flaherty and Angelini, without admitting or denying the allegations against them, consented to the entry of orders of permanent injunction against them.  In addition, Zomax has agreed to pay $2 million in civil penalty.  In determining to accept the Offer, the Commission considered remedial acts promptly undertaken by Zomax and cooperation afforded the Commission staff.

(filed June 9, 2005) </h2>, <h2>SEC SUES STOCK PROMOTER RICHARD SPRADLING FOR FRAUD, ILLEGAL TOUTING AND SCALPING</h2>]","[On June 09, 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against Richard G. Spradling, a penny stock promoter who distributed newsletters under various titles including Market News Alert.  The Complaint alleges that, through his newsletters and websites, Spradling illegally touted stocks without adequately disclosing the amount and nature of his compensation.  In fact, Spradlings compensation most often came from the very companies he promoted or persons associated with the companies that he promoted.  The Complaint also alleges that Spradling scalped stocks he promoted by selling into the demand that his newsletters and website promotions created.  Specifically, the Complaint alleges that between April 2001 and September 2003, Spradling promoted more than 44 penny stock issues by faxing newsletters to hundreds of thousands of individuals.  The Complaint further alleges that Spradling received compensation in the form of stock for at least 36 of the penny stocks he promoted and that he sold at least 32 of the stocks during the promotion of the stock.  By his conduct, Spradling yielded net proceeds of over $1.6 million.  , The Complaint also alleges that Spradling falsely stated that Market News Alert is an independent research firm with paid subscribers.  In fact, the production and dissemination of each newsletter was paid for by the subject company or a related promoter and Spradlings newsletter had no paid subscribers.  The Complaint also alleges that Spradling disseminated fraudulent annual revenues and revenue forecasts on behalf of at least one company.  Specifically, the Complaint alleges that, in May 2002, Spradling wrote and disseminated a promotion of THC Communications (THCR) in his Market News Alert newsletter.  Prior to disseminating the newsletter, Spradling met with the officers of THCR, obtained a copy of THCRs business plan, and its 2001 financial statements filed with the Commission.  THCRs 2001 financial statements reflected $739,065 of audited revenues and its business plan projected 2002 revenues of $12 million.  The Complaint further alleges that Spradlings May 2002 newsletter listed THCRs audited 2001 revenues as $11.1 million, which was fifteen times greater than THCRs actual 2001 audited revenues filed with the Commission.  The newsletter also listed THCRs projected 2002 revenue as $25 million, which was twice the amount projected in the companys business plan given to Spradling.  The Complaint alleges that in exchange for the promotion, Spradling received compensation of approximately $400,000 from the company and individuals whom Spradling knew were the CEO and CFO of the company.  , The Complaint seeks to permanently enjoin Spradling from violating the antifraud provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, specifically Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and the anti-touting provision of the Securities Act of 1933, specifically Section 17(b).  The Complaint further seeks to permanently bar Spradling from any future participation in the offering of penny stocks; disgorgement of ill-gotten gains Spradling received as a result of his wrongful conduct, plus prejudgment interest thereon; and civil monetary penalties., <img alt=* border=0 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif/><a href=/litigation/complaints/comp19263.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>, <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19263.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

(AIG).  In an amended complaint filed today in federal court in Manhattan, the Commission added Napier as a defendant in the action it instituted on June 6, 2005 against John Houldsworth (Houldsworth), a former Gen Re executive and former CEO of a Gen Re subsidiary, Cologne Re Dublin.  Napier was a Gen Re Senior Vice President and the executive responsible for Gen Res relationship with AIG.  The amended complaint alleges that Napier, together with Houldsworth and others, helped AIG structure two sham reinsurance transactions that had as their only purpose to allow AIG to add a total of $500 million in phony loss reserves to its balance sheet in the fourth quarter of 2000 and the first quarter of 2001.  The transactions were initiated by AIG to quell criticism by analysts concerning a reduction in the companys loss reserves in the third quarter of 2000.  , In partial settlement of the Commissions claims, without admitting or denying the allegations, Napier has consented to the entry of a partial final judgment, which resolves all issues of liability against him and defers the determination of disgorgement and penalties until a later date.  As part of his settlement, Napier has agreed to cooperate fully with the Commissions continuing investigation of this matter.  , In connection with the same conduct, both Napier and Houldsworth have also entered guilty pleas to criminal charges filed by the U.S. Department of Justice, Fraud Section (DOJ) in a Virginia federal court.  Under the respective plea agreements, each defendant has agreed to cooperate fully with DOJs continuing investigation., The Commissions amended complaint charges Napier with aiding and abetting the violations by AIG and others of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2) and 13(b)(5) and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13 and 13b2-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Napier, in addition to undertaking to cooperate fully with the Commission, consented to the entry of a partial final judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the above-cited provisions, barring him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years following the entry of the partial final judgment against him and deferring the determination of civil penalties and disgorgement to a later date.  , The Commissions investigation is continuing.

The Complaint also alleges that Defendants falsely represented to investors that they were day-trading their investments in options and futures and generating approximately 20% annualized returns.  The Complaint further alleges that Defendants sent out fictitious account statements to investors that materially overstated the account values in the individual investors’ accounts.  Furthermore, the Complaint alleges that Defendants operated a Ponzi scheme by paying out approximately 20% annualized returns to investors, in part, from new investors’ capital.

Novosselov, with the substantial assistance of Malyar, orchestrated a fraudulent offering through Blue Square Management, Inc., a purported venture capital firm.  From January 2001 to February 2004, one or more representatives of Blue Square cold-called potential investors across the country and solicited their investments in the stock and warrants of Cash Money Lending Corp., a purported ATM management company.  After raising approximately $3.7 million from over 280 investors, Blue Square disconnected its phone lines and vacated its offices leaving investors unable to contact anyone about their investments., The Commissions complaint further alleges that about the same time Blue Square disappeared, Malyar and several other individuals claiming to be associated with Westwood Holdings, Inc. began soliciting investors in a similar fraudulent offering involving a second purported ATM-related company.  Using many of the same methods of operation, Westwoods representatives were able to raise at least $1.2 million from over 80 investors.  , According to the Commissions complaint, the defendants induced investment through false and misleading statements which included verbal and written claims that investments would yield up to 160% returns from a highly anticipated IPO and/or buy-out proposal.  In fact, none of the promised IPOs or buy-out proposals ever materialized.  Instead, the defendants dissipated virtually all of investors funds, using the proceeds primarily for cash, food, entertainment and other personal expenses., The Commissions action seeks permanent injunctions, orders of disgorgement and civil penalties against Blue Square, Novosselov, Westwood and Malyar for violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b), 15(a) and 15(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and also against Malyar for aiding and abetting Novosselov and Blue Squares violation of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder., In a related criminal action, the United States Attorneys Office for the District of Connecticut announced today the arrest of Novosselov and Malyar and the unsealing of an indictment charging them with securities fraud, mail fraud, money laundering, and money laundering conspiracy violations based on their activities at Blue Square.  , The staff acknowledges the assistance and cooperation of the United States Attorneys Office for the District of Connecticut, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Social Security Administration (Office of the Inspector General, Office of Investigations), the United States Postal Inspection Service, the New York Police Department and the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement Service in the investigation of this matter., For tips on how to avoid investment scams involving cold calling, visit <a href=/investor/pubs/coldcall.htm>http://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/coldcall.htm</a>.

In a civil action brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) in federal court in San Francisco, the court had already enjoined Waage on December 19, 2002 from future violations of the antifraud and registration provisions of the securities laws, and ordered him to disgorge $58 million in proceeds, plus interest, and to pay a civil penalty of $120,000.  Haarlem Universal Corporation, a corporation based in Panama that Waage used to perpetrate the Tri-West scheme, was named as a relief defendant in the Commissions civil action and was also ordered to disgorge $58 million., The Commissions complaint alleged that Tri-West was promoted as an investment program to trade in fictitious prime bank securities.  Investors were encouraged to send checks to various locations in California and Belize, and promised an annualized return of 120 percent.  However, none of the investors money was invested as promised.  Instead, according to Department of Justice press releases, it was used to purchase millions of dollars worth of real property in Mexico and Costa Rica, as well as high-priced items such as a yacht, helicopter, and numerous late-model cars. , Three of Waages associates have also been sentenced for their roles in the Tri-West scheme.  Cary Alyn Waage, Waages son, was sentenced to 50 months in prison and ordered to pay a $250,000 fine; Keith Nordick, who assisted Waage with a variety of Tri West-related business, was sentenced to 65 months in prison; and James Michael Webb, Tri-Wests web page designer, was sentenced to 59 months in prison., The United States Attorneys Office in Sacramento, which prosecuted the criminal cases, has also instituted civil and criminal actions seeking the forfeiture of millions of dollars in assets connected to the Tri-West scheme.

In the first scheme, as alleged in the Complaint, Todt and others inflated the price for the stock of Quality of Life Health Corporation (QLHC) from March 2003 until at least October 2004 by issuing press releases falsely claiming that QLHC owned approximately $60 million worth of assisted living facilities and repeating those claims on its website.

The Amended Complaint charges Steiner, former vice president of MBC, with violations of the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws in connection with MBCs fraudulent offering of viatical settlement investments, which raised over $1 billion from approximately 29,000 investors worldwide.  , The SECs Amended Complaint alleges that Steiner, who is the brother of Defendants Joel and Leslie Steinger, was the public face of MBC, who  participated in all or most initial sales training sessions for new in-house and outside sales agents, met with prospective and existing MBC investors, and directed MBCs philanthropic activities in the community.  The Amended Complaint further alleges that during meetings with prospective sales agents and investors, Steiner touted the safety and humanitarian nature of viatical settlement investments, assured investors that life expectancies are determined by doctors prior to their being placed on policies, and made glowing remarks about MBC as the leader in the viatical industry.  Steiner also wrote articles in newspapers and business journals (provided in investor packets) touting viatical settlement investments, new regulations designed to protect investors, and specifically referring to MBC as a superior operation and clean company with thousands of satisfied customers.  Steiner failed to disclose, among other things, that over 90% of the viatical settlements were beyond their projected life expectancies, that his brothers (defendants Joel and Leslie Steinger) were the de facto principals of MBC, his brothers prior disciplinary history, or that cease-and-desist orders had been issued against MBC.  , The SECs complaint charges Steiner with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, thereunder.

The complaint seeks disgorgement of the defendants ill-gotten gains, civil penalties, and permanent injunctions against future violations of certain of the antifraud and broker-dealer registration provisions of the federal securities laws.  The complaint also charges Telvest Communications, a Texas company that Gross controlled and Arizona-based broker John Flanders with acting as unregistered broker-dealers in connection with the fraudulent transactions.  , The Commissions complaint alleges that from approximately late 2001 through September 30, 2003, Gross, along with Telvest and his wholly owned entity Morgan Spaulding, engaged in a deliberate scheme to defraud overseas purchasers of Regulation S stock.  These defendants facilitated the sale of nearly $15 million in unregistered shares of U.S.-based companies to overseas investors by, among other things, deceiving the investors into believing that nearly all of the stock purchase price would be remitted to the companies issuing shares.  Transaction confirmations sent to investors disclosed only a fee of either one percent of the purchase price or a flat $50, concealing the fact that approximately 55 to 70 percent of the purchase price would be paid to Gross, Morgan Spaulding and Telvest; to overseas brokerage firms as undisclosed commissions; and as finder fees to promoters including defendant John Flanders.  In truth, only about 30 to 45 percent of the invested proceeds actually made it to the issuers.  The complaint alleges that Telvest and Flanders acted as unregistered broker-dealers in connection with the fraudulent transactions.  , The complaint also alleges that Gross directed and controlled the day-to-day operations of Telvest and Morgan Spaulding during the period of the fraud, and closely supervised the Morgan Spaulding employees who administered the fraudulent stock sales.  As alleged in the complaint, Gross, on behalf of Telvest, entered into the agreements with the issuing companies, and directed the wire transfers to the overseas brokerage firms and finders in amounts far in excess of the fees and commissions disclosed to investors.  , The Commissions complaint alleges that Gross, Morgan Spaulding and Telvest violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

After acquiring control of the stock, Pellett and Sperry issued a series of optimistic press releases touting Victors products.  They then took advantage of the rising stock price to sell the stock through Xion at a profit.

The sentencing in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana in Indianapolis followed Harrolds guilty plea to 16 counts of mail fraud, two counts of wire fraud, seven counts of interstate transportation securities acquired by fraud, and four counts of money laundering.  The court also ordered Harrold to pay restitution of approximately $3.6 million, and imposed three years of supervised release after Harrold completes his prison term., The guilty plea followed Harrolds indictment on charges stemming from a prime bank scheme, in which Harrold solicited groups of people to invest in an investment program, in which their funds would ultimately end up in a so-called prime prime bank debenture instrument that would generate a monthly profit of 20%.  Rather than make the promised investments, Harrold utilized the investors funds to pay personal and business expenses, and to repay principal and the purported 20% interest to investors who liquidated their investments., In a related civil case brought by the Commission on September 7, 2001, the Commission filed a complaint alleging that Harrold and various entities (Entity Defendants) through which he operated had violated the registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws by operating a prime bank scheme.  On the same day, the court entered a Temporary Restraining Order freezing three accounts controlled by Harrold and, on September 10, 2001, the court entered an order freezing all of the defendants assets.

In particular, Hankins and Tenet have recently made numerous false statements to investors of the Convertible Opportunities Fund, as well as to investors in another hedge fund managed by Tenet and Hankins, Tenet Offshore Capital Partners Ltd. (Offshore Capital Partners) (collectively, the Funds).    , The Complaint also alleges that within the last four months, in an effort to raise new capital for the Funds, Hankins met with investors and made false representations concerning Tenets investment strategy and the Funds performance.  Hankins also provided investors with deceptive and false marketing materials that, among other things, grossly misrepresented the performance of the Convertible Opportunities Fund during the period April through December 2004.  While the marketing materials for the Convertible Opportunities Fund reflected a gain of more than 32% during that period, the Convertible Opportunities Funds audited financial statements for that period reflect that the fund returned a 24% loss during the period., In addition, as recently as May 25, 2005, Hankins distributed to at least one investor altered audited financial statements for 2004 for the Convertible Opportunities Fund.  The altered 2004 audited financial statements: (a) concealed the funds reported $1.4 million net loss in 2004; (b) falsely stated that the fund had net assets of $31.2 million when, in fact, it reported only $4.2 million; and (c) falsely stated that the fund earned 32.4% in investment returns when, in fact, it reported a 24.5% loss., The Complaint further alleges that Defendants are also seeking to improperly distribute assets to cover up the fraud.  Recently, to assuage the concerns of one investor, Hankins requested that the Funds prime broker redeem this investors funds from the Convertible Opportunities Funds account (a total of $3 million) at a level of redemption inconsistent with the losses incurred in the funds accounts.  Although the prime broker has not acted on Hankins request, there is no guarantee that it will refrain from honoring future requests, nor is it obligated to do so.  Moreover, Hankins recent request suggests that he may likely attempt to make additional, improper distribution requests, and by doing so, will leave empty-handed the last investors to seek a withdrawal. , The complaint charges all the Defendants with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint further charges Hankins and Tenet with violating Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act., The Court granted, among other emergency relief, a temporary restraining order which included the appointment of a temporary receiver over the Convertible Opportunities Fund and Tenet.  In its enforcement action, the Commission is seeking additional emergency relief, including orders enjoining the Defendants, preliminarily and permanently, from committing future violations of the foregoing federal securities laws, and a final judgment ordering the Defendants to disgorge ill-gotten gains, and assessing civil penalties.   , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19283.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Grotto, Mark B. Leffers and Jon M. Bloodworth with fraud in connection with the June 2000 initial public offering of Busybox.com, Inc.  At the time of the fraudulent IPO, Grotto was chief executive officer and chairman of Busyboxs board of directors, Leffers was chief financial officer, Bloodworth was general counsel and a director.  Grotto, 53, is a resident of New York City and Easton, Maryland; Leffers, 40, is a resident of Queenstown, Maryland; Bloodworth, 44, is a resident of Santa Fe, New Mexico., The Commissions complaint alleges:  , The defendants learned that Barron Chase Securities Inc., which had agreed to underwrite a $12.8 million firm commitment IPO for Busybox, could not sell all of the IPO securities to bona fide investors.  The defendants then knowingly or recklessly participated in a scheme to close the IPO.  , The defendants purchased unsold IPO securities using undisclosed and unearned bonuses which they caused Busybox to pay to themselves.  In addition, the defendants paid Busyboxs lawyer an inflated and undisclosed legal fee using unsold IPO securities.  Barron Chase financed these transactions and, during the IPO closing, the defendants caused Busybox to repay Barron Chase out of the proceeds of the offering.  As a result, the defendants and others received almost 20% of the securities offered in the IPO, which reduced the proceeds available to Busybox by over $2.1 million.  , The defendants knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that the IPO registration statement did not disclose the insider transactions, the inflated legal fee, Barron Chases financing or the repayment to Barron Chase using IPO proceeds.  In the week following the close of the IPO, the defendants spent a further 30% of the IPO proceeds ($2.9 million) on items that were not disclosed in the registration statement.  , The Commission alleges that the defendants thereby violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Commission seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, civil monetary penalties and orders barring all three defendants from acting as an officer or director of a public company.  , This is the second enforcement action taken by the commission based on its investigation of the Busybox IPO.  Previously, the Commission had sued Thomas Prousalis, Busyboxs lawyer, and Robert Kirk, the president of Barron Chase, for their roles in the IPO.  On March 21, 2005, the Honorable Gerard E. Lynch, U.S. District Judge for the Southern District of New York entered final judgments, enjoining Prousalis and Kirk from violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and ordering payment of disgorgement and interest, and imposing a penalty on Prousalis.

Kiser, Criminal No. 05-CR-278D</h2>, <h2>Former Vari-L CEO Criminally Indicted for Charges Including Securities Fraud</h2>]","[The indictment charges that from January, 1996 through May, 2000, Kiser, along with co-conspirator David Sherman (Sherman), conspired to inflate revenue artificially in order to meet or exceed market expectations for Vari-Ls financial results, and thereby maintain and inflate Vari-Ls stock price.  , Vari-L, a now defunct company formerly based in Denver, designed, manufactured, and marketed a range of signal processing components used in communications equipment and systems, such as cellular telephones and base stations.  Vari-Ls common stock traded on Nasdaq. , Kiser held various executive positions at Vari-L, including President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Scientific Officer.  From about 1985 until 2000, Kiser was Vari-Ls Chairman of the Board of Directors.  Sherman also held various positions as Vari-Ls President, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Executive Officer.  Both Kisers and Shermans compensation included performance-based cash bonuses and stock options., According to the indictment, Kiser and Sherman met regularly to discuss the status of Vari-Ls revenue for a given quarter and compare financial performance against forecasted goals.  If it appeared that Vari-L would fall short of financial forecasts, which occurred every quarter beginning in early 1996 through at least the third quarter of 1998, Kiser and Sherman would discuss how much fraudulent revenue Vari-L would recognize for a given quarter to meet or exceed the projected results., After Kiser determined how much false revenue to recognize for a given quarter, Sherman instructed Vari-Ls accounting personnel to book the entry.  Vari-L claimed the fraudulent revenue by: recording revenue on products that had not been shipped or fully manufactured; falsifying sales orders and booking revenue from fictitious orders; holding open Vari-Ls books in order to claim revenue in the current quarter based upon revenue that was earned in the subsequent weeks or months of the next quarter; and making fraudulent entries to company books and records at the end of a quarter, thereby reducing operating expenses through improper capitalization.The indictment further alleges that Kiser and Sherman knowingly made materially false and misleading statements about Vari-Ls financial performance to the public in press releases, quarterly and annual reports to shareholders, and 10-QSB and 10-KSB filings with the Commission.  Kiser would then recommend to Vari-Ls Compensation Committee that he and Sherman should receive stock options and cash bonuses, based upon the fact that Vari-L consistently met or exceeded projected financial results.  Kiser and Sherman enriched themselves by selling Vari-L stock during the height of the fraud.  , On September 27, 2001, the Commission instituted and settled administrative proceedings against Kiser for causing violations of the reporting provisions and proxy rules by Vari-L.  Kiser was ordered to cease and desist from causing any violation and any future violation of Section 13(b)(2)(B) and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 14a-3 and 14a-9 thereunder.  Further, Kiser was ordered to pay disgorgement of $58,000 and prejudgment interest of $4,969.  See Release No. 44859 (September 27, 2001).  , Sherman was indicted by a federal grand jury in Denver on March 11, 2004, on charges of securities fraud, wire fraud, making false statements in reports filed with the Commission, making false statements to auditors, and keeping false books and records.  A Change of Plea Hearing in Shermans case is scheduled for July 28.  On September 27, 2001, the Commission filed a civil complaint against Sherman alleging that Sherman, other Vari-L employees, and Vari-L engaged in a massive financial reporting fraud designed to show consistently increasing revenue and earnings, instead of losses, from 1996 through the quarter ended March 31, 2000.  On September 26, 2003, the U.S. District Court of Colorado entered a final judgment of permanent injunction against Sherman pursuant to his consent.

The Courts order also prohibits Klarman from serving as an officer or director of a public company for ten years and permanently enjoins him from violating antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws.  , Klarman consented to the order without admitting or denying the substantive allegations in the Commissions complaint.  Klarman has similarly consented to a separate administrative order suspending him from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an attorney., Klarman, age 40, of New York, was the general counsel of U.S. Wireless, a now-bankrupt company based in San Ramon, California.  The Commissions complaint alleged that Klarman and Oliver Hilsenrath, the former CEO of U.S. Wireless, embezzled assets by having U.S. Wireless transfer stock and cash to several offshore entities that they secretly owned and controlled.  The Commission further alleged that as part of the scheme, Klarman and Hilsenrath caused U.S. Wireless to file false and misleading periodic reports with the Commission, falsified entries in the companys books and records, and made false statements to the companys auditors.  , The Courts order deems Klarman liable for approximately $3.9 million, representing $3.2 million in disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus $700,000 in prejudgment interest on the disgorgement amount.  The order also enjoins Klarman from violating or aiding and abetting violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder.

In a complaint filed on April 28, 2004, the Commission alleged that D.W. Heath &amp; Associates, Inc., Private Capital Management, Inc. (PCM), Private Collateral Management, Inc., and PCM Fixed Income Fund I, LLC (PCM Fund), and two individuals, Daniel William Heath, 48, formerly of Chino Hills, California, and Denis Timothy OBrien, 50, formerly of Yorba Linda, California, fraudulently induced elderly investors to invest in secured notes that paid a guaranteed return.  The court appointed Robb Evans as permanent receiver over Heath &amp; Associates, PCM, Private Collateral Management, and the PCM Fund.  , On March 8, 2005 and May 25, 2005, the District Court entered final judgments of permanent injunction and other relief against OBrien and Heath, respectively.  The judgments enjoin OBrien and Heath from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, the securities registration provisions of Section 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act, and the broker-dealer registration provisions of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act.

OBrien and Heath consented to the entry of the orders without admitting or denying the Commissions findings., Previously, the District Court entered judgments of permanent injunction and other relief against Heath &amp; Associates, PCM, Private Collateral Management, and the PCM Fund, pursuant to the consent of the receiver.  The judgments enjoin the receivership entities from violating the antifraud and securities registration provisions, and specify that pursuant to one or more plans of distribution to be submitted by the receiver to the court, the funds and assets of the receivership estate will be distributed to investors less court-approved fees and expenses.      , The final judgment against Heath concludes the Commissions action.  Administration of the receivership estate will continue., In a report to the court, the receiver stated that approximately $144.8 million was raised from investors through PCM and the PCM Fund, and of that amount, approximately $39.6 million in principal and interest was returned to investors.  According to the receivers report, over the life of the company, PCM suffered a net loss of about $41.8 million and earned only $1 million in total income.  , On July 1, 2004, the Riverside County District Attorneys Office arrested Heath, OBrien, John William Heath, formerly of Covina, California, and Larre Jaye Schlarmann, formerly of Carlsbad, California.  They have been charged with multiple felony counts, including selling unqualified securities, selling securities by misrepresentation, violating a court order to desist and refrain from selling securities, elder abuse, grand theft, burglary, and money laundering.

The fraud arises out of a scheme orchestrated by Defendant Robert Ross, along with Defendants Chance Vought, George Kundrat, John Lucarelli, and Frederick Raila, in which they illegally purchased stock in the NewAlliance IPO in violation of the federal securities laws.  The SECs action was brought in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut.  The SEC is seeking to obtain permanent injunctions, full disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against each of the defendants.  The United States Attorneys Office for the District of Connecticut also brought related criminal charges in connection with the scheme., According to the Commissions complaint, the actions arise out of the April 2004 conversion of New Haven Savings Bank, which was based in New Haven, Connecticut, from a mutual form of organization to a stock form of organization.  Because mutual banks are owned by its depositors, they are given first priority in receiving the shares arising out of the conversions initial public offering.  The Commissions complaint alleges that, beginning in or about February 2004, Ross orchestrated a scheme in which he and others used seven individuals who were depositors of New Haven Savings Bank to illegally obtain 490,000 shares of NewAlliance Bancshares stock at the initial offering price of $10 per share.  According to the complaint, Ross recruited Defendants Lucarelli and Raila to locate depositors who would be willing to enter into arrangements with Ross.  In these arrangements, as alleged in the complaint, Ross would put up the funds to purchase the stock and the depositor was to receive a small portion of the profits.  The Commissions complaint further alleges that, in addition to providing funds himself, Ross recruited Vought and Kundrat to provide funds for the nominee depositors to purchase the stock.  Further, according to the complaint, Ross caused the nominee depositors to submit to the bank subscription documents that falsely and misleadingly represented that the depositors were the true purchasers of the stock and had not entered into any agreements relating to the sale or transfer of the stock.  The complaint alleges that, as a result of this fraudulent conduct, the scheme generated approximately $1.75 million in total profits.  , The Commissions complain alleges that Ross, Vought, Kundrat, and Lucarelli violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Raila and Lucarelli are charged with aiding and abetting Ross violations.  Lucarelli is also charged with violating Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Kundrat agreed to a permanent injunction and the payment of disgorgement plus prejudgment interest of $474,279 and a civil penalty of $120,000. , Todays civil and criminal actions are the result of ongoing investigations by the SEC, the U.S. Attorney for the District of Connecticut, and the New Haven Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  The SEC also acknowledges the assistance and cooperation of the Connecticut Department of Banking, Securities and Business Investment Division in the investigation, which is continuing., The SEC has also issued a related Investor Alert, which is available at:  <a href=/investor/pubs/mutualconversion.htm>www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/mutualconversion.htm</a>.  , <img alt=* border=0 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif/><a href=/litigation/complaints/comp19288.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>, <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19288.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Liberate is a San Mateo, California-based provider of software and services for interactive television., In the settlement announced today, Fitzpatrick consented to a court order that directs him to pay a total of $222,499, consisting of $97,499 in disgorgement of commissions and bonuses plus prejudgment interest, and a monetary penalty of $125,000.

Fitzpatrick consented to the order without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint., The Commissions complaint, which was filed in September 2004, alleged that Fitzpatrick used a variety of methods to fraudulently inflate Liberates financial results.  These included arranging a so-called round-trip transaction, in which Liberate provided all of the funds that a customer needed to purchase Liberate product; entering into a side deal that allowed a customer to return excess Liberate product; and granting undisclosed concessions to induce a customer to purchase Liberate products.  In each instance, the complaint alleges, Fitzpatrick misrepresented or withheld key information about the transactions from Liberates finance department and its outside auditors., In January 2005, the Commission settled charges against former Liberate sales executive Thomas R.

Hurleys consent, subject to Court approval, is without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint. , In its complaint, the Commission alleges that prior to aaiPharmas 2003 fiscal third quarter end, Hurley arranged three fraudulent sales transactions with customers to create the illusion that aaiPharma had met or exceeded its sales goals for the quarter.  Although the sales Hurley arranged were either consignment sales or other types of non-final sales, aaiPharma falsely recorded the sales as final.  These fraudulent sales, totaling approximately $20.6 million, were reflected in aaiPharmas financial statements included in filings made with the Commission and publicly disseminated in November 2003 and February 2004. , The complaint further alleges that in the fourth quarter of 2003, Hurley arranged another fraudulent sales transaction with an aaiPharma customer.  Although the transaction gave the customer the right to return the product, aaiPharma falsely recorded it as a final sale.  As a result, aaiPharma reflected fraudulent sales of approximately $8 million in a Form 8-K filed with the Commission in February 2004 that announced the companys financial results for its fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal year ended 2003.  , The United States Attorneys Office for the Western District of North Carolina also previously announced that Hurley had agreed to plead guilty to a criminal charge based, in part, on conduct described in the Commissions complaint.  , The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the United States Attorneys Office for the Western District of North Carolina and the Federal Bureau of Investigations Charlotte, North Carolina Field Office in this matter., <img alt=* border=0 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif/><a href=/litigation/complaints/comp19290.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>, <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19290.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The Commissions complaint alleges that the scheme was orchestrated by Stanley A. Leitner (Leitner), of Argyle Texas, and Bradley C. Stark (Stark), of Riverside California, a felon who engaged in the scheme while on federal probation for possessing counterfeit government securities.  Also named in the Commissions action are Megafund Corporation (Megafund) a Texas company controlled by Leitner, and Sardaukar Holdings, IBC, (Sardaukar), a British Virgin Island company controlled by Stark.  United States District Judge Sam A. Lindsay has entered a temporary restraining order and asset freeze against the defendants, appointed a receiver to preserve assets, ordered the repatriation of all funds in offshore accounts, and directed Leitner and Stark to immediately surrender their passports.  , The Commissions complaint alleges that, from June 2004 through the present, the defendants engaged in a scheme to defraud investors with promises of 120 percent annual investment returns and safety of investment principal.  It is further alleged that the defendants targeted Christian ministries and other non-profit organizations with claims that a portion of the profits generated would benefit charitable causes. According to the complaint, the defendants represented that investor funds would be placed in an account at a major U.S. Brokerage firm where an unnamed Trader would engage in arbitrage transactions involving, among other things, Treasury bills and certificates of deposits.  In truth, the Complaint alleges that Megafund and Leitner transferred nearly $11 million of investor funds to a Netherlands Antilles bank account in the name of an undisclosed entity, CIG Ltd. (CIG), and subsequently, Sardaukar and Stark received at least $9.5 million of these funds.  , It is further alleged that the defendants used investor funds for personal purposes and for other purposes that were not disclosed to investors, including $1 million used by Leitner to finance the production of a movie.  Stark is alleged to have squandered investor funds on among other things, the purchase of luxury automobiles, and to have transferred over $1 million to his wife, Pamela C.

CHRISTIAN,</i> CV 05 6239 (LTS)(S.D.N.Y.)</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) today filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Scott A. Christian (Christian), a registered representative (or broker) at Trautman Wasserman &amp; Co., Inc. (Trautman Wasserman), who participated in a scheme to defraud mutual funds and their shareholders by engaging in late trading and disruptive market timing of mutual fund shares for customers.  The Commissions complaint alleges that Christian executed tens of thousands of late trades for hedge fund customers and engaged in deceptive conduct to evade restrictions that mutual fund companies sought to place on his customers frequent, short-term trading of mutual fund shares.  Additionally, Christian created false records to conceal late trading., <p class=em2>The Commission filed its complaint against:, <p class=em4>Christian, 29 years old, a resident of New York, New York.  At all relevant times, Christian was employed by Trautman Wasserman as a registered representative., <p class=em2>The complaint alleges the following:, Between January 2001 and September 2003, Christian, together with others at Trautman Wasserman, engaged in late trading on behalf of customers.  Late trading refers to the practice of placing orders to buy, redeem, or exchange mutual fund shares after 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, the time as of which mutual funds typically calculate their net asset value (NAV), but receiving the priced based on the prior NAV already determined as of 4:00 p.m.  Late trading enables the trader to profit by basing trades on market events that occur after 4:00 p.m.  Christian carried out the late-trading scheme by having customers submit proposed mutual-fund trading orders during the trading day and time-stamping them just before 4:00 p.m. to make it appear that customer orders were received before 4:00 p.m.  Christian did not, however, enter these proposed trades for execution.  Instead, Christian communicated with customers after 4:00 p.m. and often until 6:30 p.m. or later to determine if the customers wanted to execute the proposed orders or submit different orders based on post-4:00 p.m. market information.  After customers made their final post-4:00 p.m. trading decisions, Christian entered orders into the trading system used by Trautman Wasserman., Additionally, Christian engaged in deceptive conduct to evade restrictions that mutual fund companies sought to place on Christians potentially harmful market timing trades.  Market timing includes frequent, short-term trading in mutual fund shares to exploit inefficiencies in mutual fund pricing.  Market timing, while not illegal per se, can harm other mutual fund shareholders because it can dilute the value of their shares, disrupt the management of the mutual funds investment portfolio, and cause other shareholders to bear the costs incurred by accommodating frequent trading by the market timer.  During the period March 2001 through April 2003, Christian and Trautman Wasserman received 307 letters from 40 fund companies seeking to stop excessive trading by accounts at Trautman Wasserman.  Knowing that mutual fund companies monitored market-timing activity by account number and registered representative identification number, Christian opened and traded in multiple accounts for his market-timing customers and utilized numerous different registered representative identification numbers, so that his customers could evade mutual fund companies restrictions on their trading., The Commission charges Christian with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting violations of Section 10(b), 15(c) and 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-3, 10b-5 and 17a-3 thereunder.

Cook, an emergency action brought to stop a ponzi scheme., The SEC v. Cook case concerned the offer and sale of non-existent prime bank securities issued by Dennel Finance Limited in 1999.  The Commission, after successfully shutting down the Dennel scheme, learned that certain individuals affiliated with Dennel were conducting a nearly identical fraud under a new name, Resource Development International, LLC.  As a result, the Commission successfully brought a second emergency action in March 2002 against Resource Development and others to end the related scheme.  William Whelan was a named Defendant in the SEC v. Resource Development litigation.    , The indictment alleges that Whelan, a licensed insurance agent, was sued by the Court-appointed Receiver in the SEC v. Cook case after he was identified as facilitator who received commissions from the offer and sale of the fraudulent Dennel program.  The Commission and Receiver deposed Whelan in SEC v. Cook in August 2000, and Whelan was questioned about his involvement in other high-yield, prime bank programs, including, specifically, the Resource Development program.  , The indictment alleges that Whelan, during his deposition, testified falsely numerous times about his role in the Resource Development program.  Whelan testified that he had never received any commissions for offering or selling any high-yield bank debenture-type program other than the Dennel program.  Whelan further testified that he had never seen documents relating to the Resource Development program.  In addition, Whelan testified that he had never heard of an entity called Resource Development.  Contrary to Whelans statements, he had, in fact, been offering and selling the fraudulent Resource Development program for several months prior to his testimony, had received commissions for selling the Resource Development investment and had utilized the documents disseminated by Resource Development in the course of selling the program., The Commissions civil complaint against Whelan and others in the SEC v. Resource Development matter charged that from January 1999 through March 2002, the defendants fraudulently raised approximately $98 million from more than 1,300 investors nationwide, targeting persons seeking to invest retirement funds. In the course of marketing the RDI trading program, the Defendants falsely claimed that investor money would be used in Europe to trade financial instruments with top 25 or top 50 banks in a program sponsored by the Federal Reserve and global organizations, generating annual returns of 48 to 120 percent with complete safety of principal. In reality, the prime bank program marketed to investors did not exist and investor funds were misappropriated for personal and unauthorized uses, including making ponzi payments. , The Commissions complaint charged the Whelan and other defendants violated Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. , Unscrupulous promoters continue to victimize the public with Prime Bank schemes.

Directly and through salespersons, the defendants fraudulently induced individuals to purchase securities by making numerous misrepresentations and omissions of material facts.

These misstatements caused IBP to materially misstate its own financial results for the fourth quarter of 1999 and the first three quarters of 2000. Specifically, the Commission alleged that Berryman and others directed that DFG not charge certain expense items in the period they were incurred, but instead improperly included these amounts in inventory, prepaid expense, and accounts receivable asset accounts to overstate DFGs earnings. The Commission alleged that Berryman was motivated by personal compensation tied to DFGs financial performance., In its complaint, the Commission claims that, through these actions, each of the defendants violated Section 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder, and aided and abetted IBPs violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 thereunder.

(Suprema), with violating the antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws in connection with their participation in a multi-year fraud orchestrated by Supremas senior management.   Prior to its delisting in early 2002, Suprema -- a Paterson, New Jersey-based cheese manufacturer -- was a public company whose securities traded on the Nasdaq National Market System.   , In its complaint, the Commission alleges that Suprema engaged in fraudulent round-tripping transactions that resulted in total misstatements of Supremas reported revenue of between approximately 35% and over 60% in each of the 1999, 2000 and 2001 fiscal years, and in the first quarter of fiscal year 2002.  The complaint further alleges that the scheme resulted in total misstatements of Supremas reported accounts receivable of 60% or more in each of the 1999, 2000 and 2001 fiscal years.    , According to the complaint, the round-tripping transactions were effectuated through circles of entities, each of which included Suprema, a third-party customer, and a related vendor.   As the complaint alleges, the customer and vendor in each circle tended to have a common owner.  The complaint alleges that false paperwork was created documenting the fictitious transactions, and checks were circulated in purported payment for the transactions.  Participants allegedly received a kick-back or commission on each transaction, the funds for which were generally drawn from Supremas line of credit, which increased as Supremas accounts receivable grew.  With rare exceptions, the complaint alleges, no goods were actually sold, purchased, or exchanged in these transactions.  , The Commission alleges that Cocchiola and Venechanos were aware of, approved of, and participated in the fraud from at least in or around February 2000.  The complaint alleges that, among other things, Cocchiola and Venechanos signed and caused to be filed an annual report on Form 10-K for the 2000 and 2001 fiscal year, and a registration statement on Form S-2 for secondary public offerings of Suprema stock in August 2000 and November 2001, which included financial statements for the fiscal year 1999 and subsequent reporting periods, which Cocchiola and Venechanos knew, were reckless in not knowing, or should have known were materially false and misleading.  The complaint further alleges that Cocchiola and Venechanos signed and caused to be filed a Form 10-Q for the first quarter of the 2002 fiscal year, which included financial statements for the quarter ended on September 30, 2001, which Cocchiola and Venechanos knew, were reckless in not knowing, or should have known were materially false and misleading.  Furthermore, the complaint alleges that Cocchiola and Venechanos received illicit gains of over $4.8 million and $1.4 million, respectively, by selling Suprema stock during the commission of the fraud.     , Based on these allegations, the Commission charged Cocchiola and Venechanos with: (i) securities fraud in violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5; (ii) knowingly circumventing internal accounting controls and knowingly falsifying corporate books and records in violation of Exchange Act Section 13(b)(5) and Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1; (iii) lying to the companys independent auditors in violation of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-2; and (iv) aiding and abetting Supremas violations of the periodic reporting, books and records, and internal accounting controls provisions of Exchange Act Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13.

Ebbers has agreed to settle the matter by consenting, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, to the entry of a final judgment enjoining him from violating the anti-fraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws, and permanently barring him from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  The settlement is subject to the approval of the Court.   , The Commissions action against Ebbers is its sixth civil enforcement action related to the WorldCom fraud.  The complaint filed today alleges that Ebbers, along with other WorldCom senior officers, caused numerous fraudulent adjustments and entries in WorldComs books and records, often in the hundreds of millions of dollars, in furtherance of a scheme to make the Companys publicly reported financial results appear to meet Wall Streets expectations.  The complaint further alleges that these market expectations were based, in some instances, on financial performance targets set by Ebbers that Ebbers knew could not be attained by legitimate means.  In addition, the Commission alleged that Ebbers made numerous false and misleading public statements about WorldComs financial condition and performance, and signed multiple SEC filings that contained false and misleading material information.  , If the settlement is approved by the Court, Ebbers will be enjoined from future violations of the antifraud, reporting, books and records, internal controls, and lying-to-auditors provisions of the federal securities laws-Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder. , The Commission acknowledges the assistance and cooperation of the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

The handwritten fax had the appearance of an urgent message from a financial planner intended only for his client, Dr. Mitchel, urging the purchase of a stock that was about to triple in price.  In fact, neither the financial planner nor Dr. Mitchel exists.  The fax was sent to more than one million recipients across the country by stock promoters who made over half a million dollars unloading their shares on duped investors., The Commissions complaint alleges that Joshua Yafa, 31, of Coral Gables, Florida, drafted a fax in which a fictitious financial planner urged Dr. Mitchel to buy shares of AVL Global, Inc. (ticker: AVLL), a company which had hired Yafa as a public relations consultant and paid him in stock.  Yafa sent the supposedly misdirected Dr. Mitchel fax to more than 150,000 fax machines across the United States the evening of December 15, 2004.  The complaint alleges that AVLLs stock price soared as soon as the market opened, after which Yafa sold his shares of AVLL, reaping more than $300,000 in proceeds., The Commission also charged Nocona, Texas resident Michael OBrien Pickens, 51, with hatching a copycat scheme.  According to the Commissions complaint, Pickens obtained a copy of Yafas Dr. Mitchel fax and had the AVLL ticker symbol replaced with the symbols of three different microcap companies Pickens had been promoting - Data Evolution Holdings, Inc. (ticker: DTEV), Infinium Labs, Inc. (ticker: IFLB), and Soleil Film, Inc. (ticker: SFLM).  The Commission alleges that Pickens sent out nearly a million of the modified Dr. Mitchel faxes in December 2004.  The share price of the three stocks climbed by as much as 100% on massive volume, and Pickens made over $300,000 selling stock in the companies., The Commission also brought fraud charges against Serafin Sierra, 45, a salesman at Miami-based Vision Lab Telecommunications, Inc., the fax blasting company that transmitted both sets of Dr. Mitchel faxes.  According to the Commissions complaint, Sierra learned of Yafas scam, and forwarded a copy of the original AVLL Dr. Mitchel fax to his customer Pickens, facilitating Pickens copycat scheme., The Commissions complaint charges Yafa, Pickens, and their affiliated companies, Global Media Marking, Inc., M3, Inc., and M3 Research LLC, with violating Section 17(a) and 17(b) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

According to the complaint, for the four years ended December 31, 2001 and the first three quarters of 2002 (the restatement period), the defendants intentionally or recklessly participated in a scheme to misstate approximately $1 billion of software license revenues, including over $125 million of revenues that should never have been recognized; to conceal from investors the true nature of certain reciprocal, or barter, transactions i2 entered into; and to hide grave customer problems i2 was experiencing.  These matters were the subject of a settled enforcement action the Commission brought against i2 on June 9, 2004, in which i2 paid a $10 million civil penalty.  <i>See In the Matter of i2 Technologies, Inc.</i>, Lit. Rel. No. 18741 (June 9, 2004)., The individuals named in the Commissions suit are:, <b>Gregory Brady</b>, i2s former president and chief executive officer during critical parts of the restatement period.  , <b>William M. Beecher</b>, i2s former chief financial officer during the restatement period.    , <b>Reagan L. Lancaster</b>, i2s former executive vice president of worldwide sales, and later president of field operations, during critical parts of the restatement period.  , In its complaint, the Commission alleges that each defendant knew or recklessly disregarded that certain i2 software products lacked functionality essential to the needs of i2s customers (which defendant Lancaster called vaporware), functionality that could only be provided through extensive customization and modification efforts by i2 consultants.  The Commission also alleges that the defendants knew these functionality problems were causing serious customer relations problems, in contrast to the rosy customer relations story they were giving the public at the time.  , According to the complaint, defendants also knew or recklessly disregarded that i2 was recording material software license revenues on transactions involving the non-functional software, in violation of generally accepted accounting principals (GAAP), notwithstanding i2s public representations (endorsed by defendants) that i2s accounting for software license revenues comported with GAAP.  The complaint also describes defendants involvement in a transaction between i2 and Enron Corporation, in which i2 purported to sell Enron a $10 million software license during the first quarter of 2000 while simultaneously agreeing to buy an identical amount of broadband services from an Enron subsidiary.   As the complaint alleges, defendants knew or recklessly disregarded that i2 could not properly recognize this entire license revenue in the first quarter of 2000, but they nonetheless caused the company to do so, without any disclosure to the public about the true nature of the transaction.  , The Commission alleges that the defendants concealed these matters from the public, as well as from i2s external auditors and the audit committee of i2s board of directors, for fear that disclosing them would cause i2s stock price to decline, thereby damaging defendants ability to exercise lucrative stock options.  As alleged in the complaint, the defendants, on the basis of the material non-public information described above, violated insider trading rules by reaping tens of millions of dollars profit exercising options on, and selling, i2s grossly inflated stock.  , The Commission alleges in its complaint that defendants violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder; that defendants aided and abetted i2s violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder; that Brady and Beecher violated Rule 13b2-2 under the Exchange Act; and that Beecher violated Rule 13a-14 under the Exchange Act.

It is further alleged that the defendants targeted Christian ministries and other non-profit organizations with claims that a portion of the profits generated would benefit charitable causes. According to the amended complaint, the defendants represented that investor funds would be placed in an account at a major U.S. Brokerage firm where an unnamed Trader would engage in arbitrage transactions involving, among other things, Treasury bills and certificates of deposits.  In truth, the amended complaint alleges that Megafund and Leitner transferred nearly $11 million of investor funds to a Netherlands Antilles bank account controlled by Rumpf and CIG, and subsequently, Sardaukar and Stark received at least $9.5 million of these funds.  , On July 19, 2005, United States District Judge Sam A.

The SECs complaint, which alleges that Glasshagel orchestrated a scheme to manipulate Roadhouse Grills earnings between 1999 and 2000, seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, civil money penalties, and an officer and director bar., According to the SECs Complaint, during Roadhouse Grills 1999 and 2000 fiscal years, Glasshagel implemented various accounting schemes designed to artificially inflate Roadhouse Grills reported pre-tax earnings in order to meet the expectations of the one Wall Street analyst that covered the company.  The Complaint alleges, for example, that Glasshagel caused Roadhouse Grill to inflate its earnings by understating various accrual accounts.  Accrual accounts contain provisions for anticipated expenses that companies expect to incur within a fiscal year.  According to the Commissions Complaint, at the end of certain periods during the 1999 and 2000 fiscal years, Glasshagel made improper reductions in these accrual accounts in order to improve Roadhouse Grills earnings.  , The Complaint also alleges that Glasshagel caused Roadhouse Grill to overstate its fiscal 2000 net income by recording a non-existent rebate receivable from one of the companys suppliers.  According to the Commissions Complaint, this rebate never existed and Roadhouse Grill never received it.  Based on these various improper entries, the Commissions Complaint alleges that Glasshagel caused Roadhouse Grill to overstate its fiscal 1999 net income by 5% and its fiscal 2000 net income by 35%.  In both of those fiscal years, Roadhouse Grill met the expectations set by the Wall Street analyst that covered the company., After Glasshagel resigned from Roadhouse Grill in July 2000, the companys new management discovered his misconduct.

DEMKO AND MICHAEL J. CHESHIRE</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced the filing of complaints in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against Gary K. Bennett and Bernard J. Demko.  The Commission charged Bennett and Demko with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws for engaging in misconduct that led Gerber Scientific, Inc. to improperly exclude a $1.5 million charge from its financial results when the company filed its Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2000.  At the time, Bennett was the companys Chief Financial Officer and Demko was its Controller.  Bennett was also charged with improperly maintaining and using certain corporate reserves in 1998 and 1999., The complaints allege that in June 2000, while Gerber was finalizing its annual report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2000, Bennett and Demko learned that, due to a clerical error, the company had failed to record approximately $1.5 million of a required $6 million inventory write-down.  Instead of correcting the mistake, the company went ahead and filed its Form 10-K, which contained materially inaccurate financial statements and related disclosures.  Then, without disclosure, Bennett and Demko sought to eliminate the error by improperly amortizing the $1.5 million charge over the next four fiscal quarters.  As a result, Gerbers reported earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 were overstated by 100% and reported earnings for the year were overstated by 3.5%.  According to the complaint, after discovering the $1.5 million error, Bennett also failed to correct a press release, dated May 25, 2000, that he knew or was reckless in not knowing was materially inaccurate, and he signed a subsequent events letter to the companys auditor that omitted any reference to the error. , With respect to the improper corporate reserves, the complaint alleges that Bennett approved the maintenance and use of corporate-level reserves for which there was no specific contingency.  He also approved the establishment and use of a reserve set up in connection with Gerbers sale of a subsidiary for which there was insufficient support.  The use of the corporate-level reserves resulted in overstatements of net earnings in both 1998 and 1999, and the use of the reserve relating to the subsidiary sale in 1999 resulted in an increase in Gerbers reported income for that year., Without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, Bennett and Demko consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating or aiding and abetting violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b 20, 13a 1 and 13a 13 thereunder.  Bennett also consented to be enjoined from violating Exchange Act Rule 13b2-2 and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  In addition, Bennett and Demko each agreed to pay a civil penalty of $25,000.  The final judgments are subject to Court approval., In a related enforcement action announced today, the Commission instituted a settled cease-and-desist proceeding against Michael J. Cheshire, who was Gerbers Chief Executive Officer during the relevant time.  Cheshire consented to the issuance of the order instituting proceedings without admitting or denying the findings therein, including findings that he was a cause of Gerbers reporting violations.  He was ordered to cease and desist from committing or causing violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 thereunder.  (Rel. No. 34-52126: File No. 3-11990)., The Commission previously issued a settled cease-and-desist order against Gerber relating to the same issues.

Shadur of  the United Stated District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division, issued a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) temporarily restraining: U.S. Wind Farming, Inc. (Wind Farming), William L. Telander, Raymond J. McNamee, Templar Financial, LLC, Mad World Capital Group, LLC, Time Limit Capital, LLC, Anthony M. Necoechea, 20th Century Jackson Equities, Inc., Charles S. Flemming, Ashlin Capital, LLC, and Kyoto Capital Group, LLC from violating Sections 5(a) and (c) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and temporarily restraining Wind Farming and Telander from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder in connection with the offer and sale of Wind Farmings common stock.  The Court also entered orders freezing the assets of Wind Farming and Telander, and temporarily barring Wind Farming, Telander, McNamee, Templar Financial, Mad World Capital, Time Limit Capital, Necoechea, 20th Century Jackson, Flemming, Ashlin Capital, and Kyoto Capital from participating in penny stock offerings, prohibited all of these defendants from destroying documents, and required all of these defendants to provide an accounting.  The Commissions complaint also alleged that Michael D. Spadaccini and Oronex, LLC violated Sections 5(a) and (c) of the Securities Act in connection with the offer and sale of Wind Farming common stock., The Commissions complaint alleged that Telander, Wind Farmings CEO and a recidivist who was permanently enjoined and criminally convicted for securities fraud in 1994, caused Wind Farming to improperly issue millions of unregistered shares to McNamee, Necoechea, Flemming, Spadaccini, and entities that they controlled.  The entities these defendants controlled purported to be Pennsylvania accredited investors, but in reality these entities were mere conduits for Telander and Wind Farming to access the public market for financing.  From April 2004 through the spring of 2005, Telander issued millions of unregistered shares to these entities with the expectation that Wind Farming would, in turn, receive payments from the sales proceeds.  After Telander caused Wind Farming to issue McNamee, Necoechea, Flemming, and Spadaccini unregistered shares, through the entities they controlled, these individuals quickly caused the entities they controlled to dump their unregistered shares into the public market.  From June 2004 to May 2005, as these sales occurred, Telander and Wind Farming created artificial demand for Wind Farming stock by issuing false and misleading press releases regarding Wind Farmings business operations, financial condition and business relationships.  At the same time, Wind Farmings website touted the business accomplishments of Telander without disclosing his prior disciplinary and criminal history.  At least Necoechea and Flemming made payments to Wind Farming with proceeds from their sales of unregistered shares at prices buoyed by Telanders and Wind Farmings fraudulent activities.  , On June 9, 2005, the Commission entered an order suspending trading in Wind Farmings stock for a ten-day period.  The Complaint seeks the entry of temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctions against Wind Farming, Telander, McNamee, Templar Financial, Mad World Capital, Time Limit Capital, Necoechea, 20th Century Jackson, Flemming, Ashlin Capital, and Kyoto Capital.  The Complaint also seeks the entry of permanent injunctions against Spadaccini and Oronex.  Further, the Complaint seeks the entry of temporary, preliminary and permanent penny stock bars against Wind Farming, Telander, McNamee, Templar Financial, Mad World Capital, Time Limit Capital, Necoechea, 20th Century Jackson, Flemming, Ashlin Capital, and Kyoto Capital.   Finally, the Complaint seeks disgorgement of profits from all defendants and the imposition of civil penalties against all defendants.  , The Commission acknowledges the assistance and cooperation of the Pennsylvania Securities Commission and the National Association of Securities Dealers Division of Market Regulation., <img alt=* border=0 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif/><a href=/litigation/complaints/comp19311.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>, <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19311.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Or. filed July 26, 2005)</h2>, <h2>SEC FILES INSIDER TRADING CHARGES AGAINST OREGON TECH COMPANY EMPLOYEE AND BROTHER</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a financial analyst for Beaverton, Oregon circuit board company Merix Corporation with trading on inside information and tipping his brother, allowing the pair to net over $400,000 in illegal profits.  The Commission alleges that Philip E. Evans, 43, of Beaverton, Oregon, sold Merix stock in May 2004 after learning the company was preparing to report disappointing financial news.  According to the Commission, Evans also passed the information to his brother Paul, 41, of Mt. Shasta, California, who bought speculative Merix put options - securities of value only if the companys stock price fell in the short term.  When the company publicly announced the bad news days later, Merix investors saw the value of their stock plummet by 30% while the Evans brothers reaped substantial profits., According to the Commissions complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Oregon, Philip Evans learned from his boss on May 4, 2004, that Merix would likely announce the following week that its earnings were falling short of investor expectations.  Although told that the information was confidential, and aware that a trading black-out was in effect prohibiting him from trading, Philip Evans sold all the Merix stock he held in his brokerage account the next day.  In addition, according to the Commission, Philip used an account he maintained in the name of his fiancée to sell Merix stock short - trades that would be profitable if the price of Merix stock fell.  When Merix announced on May 13 that it would miss its fourth quarter earnings guidance, its stock price fell by 30%, and Philip Evans avoided losses and made profits of over $30,000., The Commissions complaint also alleges that, after learning the confidential financial information on May 4, Philip called his brother Paul Evans to relay the news.  Beginning the next morning, and continuing throughout the following week, Paul Evans sold Merix stock short and bought numerous Merix put options.  When the public announcement drove down Merixs stock price, Paul Evans made profits in excess of $400,000., The Commission also alleges that Philip Evans shared the nonpublic information with his mother, who avoided losses of over $3,000 by selling all of her Merix stock, and that Paul Evans shared the nonpublic information with a friend who profited approximately $14,000 by trading Merix securities.  Neither the mother nor friend is charged in the Commissions complaint., The Commissions complaint alleges that through their fraudulent trading and tipping, Philip and Paul Evans violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Commission seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement of all ill-gotten gains as well as the gains of the people they tipped plus pre-judgment interest and civil monetary penalties. , The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange in this matter., <img alt=* border=0 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif/><a href=/litigation/complaints/comp19312.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>, <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19312.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Casey, a resident of Houston, Texas, and a former executive vice president of Qwest Communications International Inc. (Qwest).  Casey, without admitting or denying the Commissions claims, consented to the entry of a judgment dismissing the claims against him for primary liability pursuant to Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5 thereunder; enjoining him from violating Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder, and aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder; directing him to pay $1,390,344 of disgorgement, plus $456,481 of prejudgment interest, and a $250,000 civil penalty; and prohibiting him from acting as an officer or director of any public company for five years. , According to the SECs Complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado in March 2005, Caseys actions in several indefeasible rights of use (IRUs) transactions were part of a scheme by Qwest to inflate revenue and earnings artificially.  Specifically, Casey provided, or knew others provided, secret side agreements to IRU customers allowing those customers to exchange, or port, the capacity purchased for different capacity.  The purpose of the secret side agreements was to conceal from Qwests accountants and auditors the purchasers ability to port, as such exchange rights would have defeated, under GAAP, the immediate recognition of revenue.  Additionally, Casey participated in backdating IRU agreements to demonstrate falsely that the agreements were completed by the end of the quarter as required by GAAP to recognize revenue in that quarter.  Finally, to close IRU sales, Casey caused Qwest to purchase capacity Qwest did not need.  Under GAAP, Qwest should not have recognized revenue where there was no legitimate business need for the IRU assets received., In March 2005, the Commission filed a civil action against Joseph Nacchio, Robert Woodruff, Robin Szeliga, Afshin Mohebbi, Casey, James Kozlowski, and Frank Noyes (Litigation Release No. 19136)., In March 2005, the Commission filed a settled civil injunctive action against Roger B.

The defendants consented to the Order of Permanent Injunction and Other Relief without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commission’s complaint., In its complaint, the Commission charged that the Reeves’ investment scheme was an “affinity fraud.”  The Commission alleged that by employing solicitations appealing to the Christian faith of many investors, the Reeves succeeded in raising over $120 million from investors in church bonds (bondholders) and over $50 million from investors in the Bond Funds (Bond Fund investors).  Through their control of Alanar, the Bond Funds and the Paying Agents, the Reeves allegedly misused funds that churches paid to the Paying Agents to be held in trust for the benefit of bondholders, misused Bond Fund investor proceeds, and misrepresented the rates of return of the Bond Funds.  For instance, from September 2003 to May 2005, the Reeves and the Paying Agents allegedly diverted $8 million worth of church funds held in trust for the repayment of bondholders into an online brokerage account.  The Reeves allegedly used those funds to trade stock and equity options, loan money to at least one church and to make unsecured loans to themselves and companies they controlled.  Similarly, the Reeves allegedly caused the Bond Funds to loan investor proceeds to other Bond Funds, and transferred almost $5 million worth of Bond Fund investor proceeds to their companies. , The complaint alleged that, by the above conduct: Alanar, the Reeves, and the Bond Funds violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”), and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act (“Exchange Act”) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; the Paying Agents violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and Alanar violated Section 15(c)(1) of the Exchange Act.

Lipkin (Lipkin) and Joshua Shainberg (Shainberg), both associated with the broker-dealer Securities Planners, Inc., violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws for receiving undisclosed stock kickbacks, and that Lipkin also violated the antifraud provisions by making material misrepresentations to brokerage customers.  The jury reached its verdict after a two-week trial in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York before Magistrate Judge Viktor V. Pohorelsky.  The jury found the third defendant, Robert Shatles (Shatles), not liable on a similar charge of receiving undisclosed kickback payments.  Shatles was associated with another broker-dealer named S.D. Cohn., The Commissions Amended Complaint, dated November 15, 2002, charged that all three defendants violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5, in connection with their receipt of undisclosed kickbacks, and that Lipkin violated the antifraud provisions by making material false representations to brokerage customers. , The evidence at trial demonstrated that Shainberg and Lipkin were branch office principals of Securities Planners, which is now defunct.  The jury found that both Shainberg and Lipkin received undisclosed shares of stock issued by a company called Alter Sales (subsequently known as ICIS Management Group) in return for recommending that stock to customers of Securities Planners.  The evidence at trial demonstrated that those undisclosed kickback shares were sold from accounts for Shainbergs and Lipkins benefit, and the proceeds from those accounts were sent to a bank account in the Bahamas.  Ultimately, those proceeds were returned to the United States to persons and entities associated with Shainberg and Lipkin.  The jury also found Lipkin liable for participating in a scheme to defraud investors who purchased Alter Sales securities.  The jury found that Lipkin (1) knew or recklessly disregarded that Alter Sales securities were not a sound investment, (2) knew that brokers under his supervision were making false and misleading statements to their customers to the effect that Alter Sales securities were a good or sound investment, and (3) participated in making those false statements to customers.  , The Court will determine at a later date the appropriate relief and sanctions against Lipkin and Shainberg.

The complaint also alleges that Favara caused Core Solutions to improperly register and issue shares under a Form S-8 registration statement (i.e., stock that was intended to be issued in connection with an employee benefit plan), because the recipients of those shares did not qualify as proper recipients of Form S-8 shares., The Commission alleges in its complaint that Favara violated the securities registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, and aided and abetted violations of the reporting provisions, Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 thereunder.  In its action, the Commission is seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement, and civil penalties.  In addition, the Commission is seeking to prohibit Favara from participating in a penny stock offering and from serving as an officer or director of an issuer., <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19318.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The defendants had previously paid back all of the investors who had been defrauded by the defendants scheme.  , The complaint in this case, filed on September 7, 2004, alleges that, from September 2002 to May 2003, the defendants offered and sold $6.7 million worth of notes to at least fifty investors nationwide, claiming that the funds would be used to finance a purported trading program that would buy and sell high-grade AA and AAA-rated bank notes, which is a common form of prime bank instrument.  One form of a prime bank scheme involves a supposed bank trading program where investor funds are purportedly used to trade high-grade bank notes.  In fact, such bank notes do not exist and are used to defraud investors.

The defendants are Russell W. Jones of Logan, Utah and a company he controlled, R&amp;D Marketing, Inc., a Utah corporation.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the antifraud, securities registration, and broker-dealer registration provisions of the federal securities laws.  The defendants disgorgement obligations were waived, and no civil penalties were imposed against them, based on R&amp;D Marketings financial condition, and in the case of Jones, based on recognition of his $842,176 restitution order in a parallel criminal case.  Jones has also agreed to be bared from association with any broker or dealer pursuant to a follow-on administrative proceeding. , The Commissions complaint alleges that the defendants acted as the primary broker and wholesaler of a fraudulent bank-instrument trading program through which they defrauded investors throughout the United States of at least $1.9 million, including at least $240,000 from Virginia investor-victims.  According to the complaint, Jones, acting through R&amp;D Marketing, dispatched a network of local agents around the country, including one who solicited investors in Virginia, to market the program.  Jones supplied these agents, according to the complaint, with fraudulent representations that were echoed to investors: (1) that investors funds would be used to trade in European bank instruments; (2) that this activity would yield returns in excess of 200% within forty-five days; and (3) that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) sponsored the program.  The complaint further alleges that, rather than investing the investors funds in such a bank-instrument trading program, Jones unilaterally decided to wire the funds to an altogether different fraudulent program, supposedly involving the purchase and re-sale-at rapid and exorbitant profits-of assets from estate auctions in Europe.  The complaint further alleges that Jones failed to inform the investors or obtain their consent, and that the funds disappeared shortly after Jones wired them in June 1997.  Finally, the complaint alleges that thereafter, and continuing into 2002, Jones lulled investors by (among other things) assuring them that they would still realize the promised returns by sharing in the proceeds of yet another fraudulent program.   , The Courts final judgments permanently enjoin both of the defendants from violating securities registration, broker-dealer registration, and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws as set forth in Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act), and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5.  , In a related matter, the United States Attorneys Office for the Western District of Virginia prosecuted Jones for his role in this fraud.

Jones and Lewis Daidone with fraud relating to Citigroups creation of an affiliated transfer agent to serve its Smith Barney family of mutual funds at steeply discounted rates.  Rather than passing the substantial fee discount on to the mutual funds, Citigroup took most of the benefit of the discount for itself, reaping tens of millions of dollars in profit at the expense of mutual fund shareholders.  , The actions against the individuals follows the Commissions settlement with the company in May in which Citigroup agreed to pay $208 million that will distributed to victims of the fraud. , In its complaint filed today, the Commission alleges that Jones and Daidone were two of the officers principally responsible for the fraud.  The complaint alleges that Jones, the former chairman and chief executive officer of the asset management division, directed an effort to negotiate a deal that would permit Citigroup to reap much of the profit that the funds third party transfer agent had been making.  Jones approved the final structure of the deal fully aware that the affiliated transfer agent was projected to make tens of millions of dollars in profit each year for doing minimal work.  The complaint further alleges that Jones intentionally or recklessly acted in disregard of his fiduciary duty by failing to take steps to ensure the funds independent directors were fully informed of the details of the proposal and that Jones approved the presentation delivered to the funds boards seeking approval of the self-dealing transaction knowing or recklessly disregarding that the presentation was materially misleading.  , The complaint alleges that Daidone, a senior vice president of the Adviser and the funds treasurer and chief financial officer, participated in the negotiations with the existing third party transfer agent and was the person responsible for making the presentation to the funds boards in a way that led the boards to believe the affiliated transfer agent proposal was in the funds best interests, which was not true.  , The complaint charges Jones and Daidone with aiding and abetting the Adviser and Global Markets violations of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, which prohibit registered investment advisers from employing devices, schemes or artifices to defraud clients or prospective clients and from engaging in transactions, practices, or courses of business that operated or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon clients or prospective clients.

IPM is a limited liability company owned by Gibson. , The Commissions complaint alleges that, from approximately December 2002 through the present, Gibson misappropriated for his personal use approximately $450,000 from investors in American Car Wash Fund, LP (ACW), a limited partnership.  IPM serves as ACWs general manager.  Between December 2002 and April 2003, Gibson, through IPM, sold approximately 43 limited partnership interests in ACW, raising approximately $875,000.  Approximately 38 of the limited partners were also clients of his advisory business.  Almost as soon as he began selling interests, Gibson began writing checks, payable to cash, on ACWs bank accounts and then misappropriating the funds from those checks for his personal use.  In an effort to conceal the misappropriation of funds, Gibson and IPM regularly sent letters to ACW investors describing annualized rates of return, dividends and purchases of various properties.  None of those letters disclosed the ongoing misuse of proceeds by Gibson and IPM. , The Commissions complaint charges defendants Gibson and IPM with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Gibson with violations of Section 206 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1933.

Shlansky for improperly buying stock in his clients company after learning the company was on the verge of being acquired.  According to the Commission, Shlansky, 36, of Ferrisburg, Vermont, purchased shares of San Diego biotechnology company Applied Molecular Evolution, Inc., after the companys CFO informed him of the confidential merger negotiations.  Shlansky netted illegal profits of nearly $40,000 when it was later announced that pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly &amp; Co. would be buying the company.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Shlansky has agreed to pay disgorgement (with interest) and penalties totaling approximately $80,000., The Commissions complaint, filed in the Southern District of California, alleges that on November 18, 2003, Applied Moleculars then-CFO retained Shlansky to represent him in connection with a pending acquisition of the company, cautioning Shlansky that the deal was still confidential.  The next day, Shlansky purchased 6,000 shares of Applied Molecular stock at around $11.55 per share.  Two days later, Applied Molecular announced that it was being acquired by Eli Lilly at a price of $18 per share, causing an immediate 50% jump in the companys stock price.  Shlansky realized profits of $38,681 by trading ahead of the merger announcement., The Commissions complaint notes that Shlansky had been a long-time investor in Applied Molecular, and had purchased company stock in the days even before he learned about the acquisition. The Commission alleges, however, that once Shlansky learned significant inside information from his client, he had a duty to refrain from further trading until the news became public., The Complaint charges Shlansky with trading on the basis of material, nonpublic information in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Shlansky, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, agreed to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest totaling $39,249 and a civil penalty of $38,681.

Amore then directed day traders at A.B. Watley, Inc. (A.B. Watley), a broker-dealer subsidiary of A.B. Watley Group, to trade ahead of these block orders.  Amore engaged in this fraudulent scheme from at least June 2002 through September 2003.  , The Commission filed its complaint against:, The complaint alleges the following:, Between at least June 2002 through September 2003, Amore, Casbarro, Ghysels, Mahaffy, and OConnell participated in a fraudulent scheme to profit by trading ahead of customer orders broadcast over squawk boxes at Citigroup, Lehman, and Merrill Lynch.  Traders at Citigroup, Lehman, and Merrill Lynch routinely announced block orders over their firms squawk boxes, which broadcasted this information to brokers in the retail branch systems of Citigroup, Lehman, and Merrill Lynch respectively.  Casbarro, Ghysels, Mahaffy, and OConnell routinely placed an open phone line connected to A.B. Watleys headquarters next to their employers squawk boxes., The traders at A.B.

First American, an Arizona vision care company, overstated its assets and net income in reports filed with the Commission for its 1999 fiscal year and the second quarter of its 2000 fiscal year by, primarily, overstating its accounts receivable.   The Commission also has issued orders in two related administrative proceedings against Eardley and John V. Back, Jr. (formerly of KPMG LLP), who was the audit engagement partner responsible for First Americans fiscal year 1999 audit.  , The Commissions complaint alleges that in October 1998, Behrmann learned from KPMG, First Americans independent auditors, that the companys accounts receivable had not been reconciled for at least a year and were out of balance with the general ledger.  At about the same time, Eardley, the companys recently hired CFO, became aware of the accounting irregularity and also brought it to Behrmanns attention.  Rather than address the problem, Behrmann directed Eardley to focus on other unrelated projects and Eardley complied.  On October 19, 1999, Behrmann and Eardley signed First Americans 1999 Form 10-KSB filed with the Commission knowing that the accounts receivable ledgers and the general ledger had not been reconciled and without regard for whether this significant accounting issue would have a material impact on the companys financial statements.  The statements included with the filing, as signed by Behrmann and Eardley and filed with the Commission, overstated the companys reported receivables by $892,000 or 59 percent.  But for the overstatement, the companys $693,000 reported pre-tax income for 1999 would have been a $199,000 loss. , The Commissions complaint further alleges that in early March 2000, KPMG was preparing a restatement of the companys 1999 Form 10-KSB and the first quarter 2000 Form 10-QSB and recommended that the company obtain a five-day extension to file its second quarter 2000 Form 10-QSB because the financials for the second quarter would be affected by the restatement.  At a March 13, 2000 Board of Directors meeting, Behrmann recommended that the Board ignore the KPMG recommendation and file the second quarter 10-QSB as-is.  As a result, First Americans second quarter 2000 Form10-QSB filed with the Commission overstated income by 46 percent., In a related settled administrative proceeding, John Back, the KPMG audit engagement partner responsible for the 1999 audit of First American, consented, without admitting or denying the Commissions findings, to entry of a Commission order permanently denying him the privilege of practicing or appearing before the Commission as an accountant pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the Commissions Rules of Practice.  The Commissions Order finds that Back knew, or should have known, that First Americans accounts receivable balances had not been reconciled and that neither Back, nor anyone he supervised, performed the work necessary to reconcile the balances in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards (GAAS).  The Order finds that Back falsely represented that KPMGs audit had been performed in accordance with GAAS and that First Americans financials complied with generally accepted accounting principles.  As a result, the Commission found that Back engaged in improper professional conduct pursuant to Rule 102(e)(1)(ii) of the Commissions Rules of Practice., <img alt=* border=0 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif/><a href=/litigation/complaints/comp19336.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>, <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19336.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Additionally, the Final Judgment provides for disgorgement and the imposition of a civil penalty in amounts to be determined by the Court upon the SECs motion., The SECs complaint alleges Madey and two other defendants, Sheldon and Peter Krieger,  as principals of a hedge fund called KFSI Equity Fund, L.P. (KFSI Fund), misappropriated approximately $3.7 million of the $7.5 million the KFSI Fund raised.  The defendants raised money from approximately 45 investors by claiming the KFSI Fund would generate profits by trading in securities.  The SECs complaint also alleges in early 2000, the defendants began diverting money in the KFSI Fund to pay for the operations of Krieger Financial Services, Inc. (Krieger Financial), a broker-dealer the defendants controlled.  The SECs complaint claims the defendants concealed their misappropriation of funds and trading losses in the KFSI Fund by issuing false KFSI Fund account statements., For additional information, see Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr19187.htm>19187</a> (April 15, 2005)., <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19338.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The Anticevic account engaged in a series of highly profitable trades in out of the money call options of Reebok International Ltd. (Reebok) just prior to Reeboks August 3, 2005 announcement that it had agreed to be acquired by adidas-Salomon AG.  Yesterday, the Court entered a Preliminary Injunction against Anticevic which, among other relief, continues the asset freeze., On August 18, 2005, the Commission also filed an amended Complaint and obtained Temporary Restraining Orders and other relief against eight other defendants, including residents of the United States, Croatia and Germany trading through several domestic and off-shore accounts.  Among others, the amended Complaint charged Anticevics nephew, David Pajcin of Clifton, N.J., who is a former broker, and alleged that Pajcin placed or directed some of the Reebok trades, and tipped other defendants who placed Reebok trades. , Also charged were:, Henry Siegel (Siegel), a resident of Pomona, New York., Monika Vujovic (Vujovic), a resident of New York, New York., Elvis Santana (Santana), a resident of Brooklyn, New York., Zoran Sormaz (Sormaz), a resident of Zagreb, Croatia., Perica Lopandic (Lopandic), a resident of Reinbek, Germany., Ilija Borac (Borac), a resident of Zagreb, Croatia., Certain Unknown Persons trading in an account at an Austrian broker, Direktanlage.at AG (Direktanlage)., As alleged in the amended Complaint, the defendants acted in concert or under a common direction in placing the Reebok trades, and collectively netted a profit of over $6 million.  , The Commissions amended Complaint alleges the following:	, On August 1 and 2, 2005, through four domestic accounts, Anticevic, Siegel, Vujovic, and Santana purchased a total of 4,097 Reebok out of the money call options.  Collectively, these accounts comprised nearly 80% of the buy volume in Reebok call options on those days.  All positions in each account were liquidated after the acquisition announcement on August 3, 2005.  In total, the domestic trading netted profits exceeding $4 million.  , On those same days, through foreign accounts maintained at the same broker, Anticevic, Sormaz, Lopandic and Borac purchased the equivalent of 145,240 shares of Reebok common stock.  Each of those accounts sold all of its Reebok shares on August 3, 2005.

Baker consented to the final judgement without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions Complaint.  The Commission had previously obtained judgments against four former employees of Robotic  former CFO, Frank D. Edwards, former Corporate Controller Laurence D. Cohen, former V.P. of Worldwide Sales Mark A. Tatkow, and Curtis W. Howes., In its Complaint, the Commission alleged that during its fiscal year 2000, Robotics ACIM division improperly recorded revenue from approximately 36 purported sales to distributors totaling approximately $4.73 million in order to meet its revenue and sales goals.  According to the Complaint, between December 1999 and September 2000, ACIM negotiated numerous purported sales to its distributors and customers which contained non-standard terms that deferred, conditioned or even negated the distributors obligations to pay for the ACIM products.  Recognizing revenue from these transactions was contrary to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). , According to the Complaint, Baker negotiated two of the improper transactions with ID Integration, Inc., one of Robotics distributors.  The improper transactions Baker negotiated, coupled with the other consignment transactions, resulted in Robotic materially overstating its revenue by 13.5% and its net income by 2.1% for fiscal year 2000.  In his Consent to Final Judgement, Baker, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, agreed to pay a civil monetary penalty of $20,000, and be permanently enjoined from violating Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder. , The Commission also previously instituted and settled cease-and-desist proceedings against Robotic, ID Integration, and the President of ID Integration, Gary Moe.

Creative Host is a San Diego-based airport concessionaire.

These included:  1) causing Kirkpatricks clients to buy and control 90% of Creative Hosts shares; 2) engaging in high-pressure sales tactics; 3) using his employers affiliation with Mutual of Omaha Insurance Company to gain client trust; 4) refusing to execute clients orders to sell Creative Host shares; 5) encouraging customers to obtain credit on their Creative Host shares in order to release funds with which to buy additional shares without explaining the risks of that credit; 6) hiring promoters to tout the shares on the Internet;  7) delaying submission of client orders toward the end of the trading day to increase demand at the end of the day; 8) helping his employer lead the bid prices placed for Creative Host shares, and 9) orchestrating prearranged trades.  As a result of these actions, Muth received $950,562 in ill-gotten commissions and $546,781 in ill-gotten trading profits, $463,030 of which was received through co-defendant Door Chair, Ltd., an entity Muth controls.

The Complaint alleges that from the first quarter of 2000 through the fourth quarter of 2001, at Schiff and Lanes direction, Bristol-Myers stuffed its distribution channels with excessive amounts of its pharmaceutical products ahead of demand to meet the Companys internal earnings targets and the consensus estimate of Wall Street securities analysts, and improperly recognized revenue from $1.5 billion of such sales to its two largest wholesalers.  According to the Commissions Complaint, when Bristol-Myers results still fell short of its targets and the consensus estimate, at Schiffs direction, the Company used cookie jar reserves to further inflate its earnings.  The Complaint also alleges that at Schiffs direction, and as a result of the channel-stuffing, Bristol-Myers also underaccrued for Medicaid and prime vendor rebate liabilities.  As a result of its channel-stuffing and improper accounting measures, Bristol-Myers reported results that met or exceeded the consensus estimate every quarter during the scheme.  The Complaint alleges that Schiff signed numerous periodic reports and registration statements in connection with a $5 billion securities offering in September 2001 that failed to disclose the scheme.  Schiff and Lane also made misstatements in conference calls with securities analysts that concealed Bristol-Myers channel-stuffing activities and the extraordinary buildup in excess wholesaler inventory.   , The Commissions Complaint charges Schiff with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder, and aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder.

According to the Commissions complaint, former Chief Executive Officer Charles C. Conaway and former Chief Financial Officer John T. McDonald are responsible for material misrepresentations and omissions about the companys liquidity and related matters in the Managements Discussion and Analysis (MD&amp;A) section of Kmarts Form 10-Q for the third quarter and nine months ended October 31, 2001, and in an earnings conference call with analysts and investors.  , The Commission alleges that, in the MD&amp;A section, Conaway and McDonald failed to disclose the reasons for a massive inventory overbuy in the summer of 2001 and the impact it had on the companys liquidity.  For example, the MD&amp;A disclosure attributed increases in inventory to seasonal inventory fluctuations and actions taken to improve our overall in-stock position.  The Commission alleges that this disclosure was materially misleading because, in reality, a significant portion of the inventory buildup was caused by a Kmart officers reckless and unilateral purchase of $850 million of excess inventory.  According to the complaint, the defendants dealt with Kmarts liquidity problems by slowing down payments owed vendors, thereby effectively borrowing $570 million from them by the end of the third quarter.  According to the complaint, Conaway and McDonald lied about why vendors were not being paid on time and misrepresented the impact that Kmarts liquidity problems had on the companys relationship with its vendors, many of whom stopped shipping product to Kmart during the fall of 2001.  Kmart filed for bankruptcy on January 22, 2002.  , The Commissions complaint, which was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, charges Conaway and McDonald with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and aiding and abetting violations of Sections 10(b) and 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 13a-13, and 12b-20 thereunder by Kmart, and seeks as relief permanent injunctions, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, civil penalties and officer and director bars.  , The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the United States Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Michigan and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  , The SECs Kmart investigation is continuing., <img alt=* border=0 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif/><a href=/litigation/complaints/comp19344.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>, <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19344.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Further, in a separate administrative proceeding, the Commission today barred English from the securities industry.  , The Commission originally sued Gruttadauria in February 2002 for perpetrating a massive fraud over a fifteen-year period against scores of his customers.  In June 2002, the Commission filed an amended complaint alleging that English aided and abetted Gruttadaurias scheme.  In the amended complaint, the Commission alleged that English knowingly provided substantial assistance to Gruttadauria by, among other things, assisting in the preparation of false account statements, providing false information to clients regarding the values of their accounts, processing withdrawal requests for clients whose accounts had been depleted, and facilitating unauthorized transfers of funds.  , The final judgment entered on August 17, 2005 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio permanently enjoins English from future violations of Sections 17(a)(1), (2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Levine, whose age and residence are not known; and James Joseph Conway, 50, of San Pedro, California.

The defendants tell investors that they use investor funds to purchase, build and refurbish assisted living facilities for retirees, and that no management fees will be taken until the facilities are profitable.  The complaint further alleges that the defendants repeatedly emphasize the key role of the associated law firm in the assisted living center project, including the fact that until the assisted living centers generate a profit, the defendants will pay the 25% annual return from other sources, such as the law firms revenues.  Contrary to these representations, investor funds were not segregated and used as represented.  Instead the defendants have made payments, out of the account in which investors deposited their funds, totaling over $3.75 million to themselves, and over $850,000 back to investors as purported interest. , The Commissions complaint alleges that all of the defendants violated the securities registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Ruth, age 64, of Boca Raton, Florida, and an entity that he controls, Par Three Financial, Inc., a Nevada corporation operating in Boca Raton, Florida.  The Commissions complaint, filed today in United States District Court in Miami, alleges that, since approximately November 2003, the defendants have sold more than $8 million in securities in connection with a purported program to lend monies to check cashing/payday loan stores.  The defendants represent that Par Three loans money to these check cashing stores at rates of interest sufficiently high to allow it to pay its investors returns of 2% per month or more., The complaint alleges that, in reality, Par Three is not profitable and is operating an undisclosed Ponzi scheme-using new investor monies to make the interest payments to existing investors-in violation of the federal securities laws.  The complaint further alleges that the defendants have misappropriated investor funds to purchase a yacht, automobiles, jewelry, and several parcels of real property, and to make undisclosed payments to sales agents.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendants failed to disclose that Ruth is a control person of Par Three and that, in 2000, Ruth was convicted of a felony in connection with an investment scheme substantially similar to the Par Three scheme.  Finally, the complaint alleges that the defendants engaged in an unlawful unregistered securities offering by selling Par Threes securities to at least 120 investors nationwide through advertising in newspapers and Internet publications.  , Acting on the Commissions lawsuit, the Honorable Linnea R. Johnson, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Florida, granted the Commissions application for a temporary restraining order against the defendants and issued orders freezing the defendants assets, appointing a temporary receiver over the assets of Par Three, prohibiting the destruction of documents by the defendants, granting expedited discovery, and requiring accountings from the defendants.  The Court appointed Michael I. Goldberg, Esq. as the temporary receiver.  The Court ordered the temporary restraining order and asset freeze to remain in effect until September 6, 2005.  The Court will determine the date that it will hold a hearing on the Commissions motion for a preliminary injunction and appointment of a permanent receiver at a future time.  In addition to emergency relief, the Commissions complaint seeks from each defendant preliminary and permanent injunctions, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty., The Commissions complaint alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act., <img alt=* border=0 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif/><a href=/litigation/complaints/comp19348.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>, <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19348.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Snyder (Snyder), Chief Financial Officer, H. Dane Reynolds (Reynolds), Treasurer (and successor Chief Financial Officer), C. Burt Duren (Duren), and Controller, R. Carey Johnson (Johnson)., The Commissions complaint alleges that, during the period from late 2002 through December 2003, Snyder, Reynolds, Duren, and Johnson caused One Price to misrepresent in its Commission filings that it was in compliance with its credit facility, on which the company relied to provide cash for its operations.  The complaint further alleges that One Price was actually in default because the defendants caused the company to artificially inflate its inventory levels, which collateralized its debt, in weekly reports to its lender.  The complaint also alleges that One Price filed false and misleading periodic reports with the Commission because the inflated inventory levels were included in the financial statements that were filed with those reports., The Commissions complaint charges Snyder, Reynolds, and Duren with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting One Prices violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder.

For the same reason, the Court did not order Curtis to pay a civil money penalty.  The Court ordered Irni to pay $200,000 representing disgorgement of his ill-gotten gain, and prejudgment interest, obtained as a result of his alleged conduct, but waived payment of that amount based upon Irnis sworn representations of his financial condition.

The Commissions Complaint alleges that, from 1994 through 1996, Curtis and others exercised undisclosed control over three public companies, Windswept Environmental Group, Inc., ICIS Management Group, Inc. and Pilot Transport, Inc.  Using that control, they caused these companies to issue more than eight million shares of stock, in most cases for little or no consideration, to various nominees, and then caused over five million shares of that stock, all of which was unregistered or improperly registered, to be sold to the public.  The scheme generated illicit proceeds of more than $8 million.  Vinci, Noel and other brokers retailed the fraudulently issued stock to the public and received undisclosed kickbacks.  Irni participated in arranging and making the undisclosed kickback payments various brokerage firms to retail the stock to the public., Previously, defendants Timothy Masley, Jonathan Lyons, Leo Mangan, James W.

FOUNDER AND THREE OTHER FORMER TOP OFFICERS SETTLE SEC FRAUD ACTION FOR $30.8 MILLION</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that, on August 26, 2005, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois entered final judgments as to defendants Dean L. Buntrock, Phillip B. Rooney, Thomas C. Hau, and Herbert A. Getz.  The settling defendants, who consented to the Judgments without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, were senior officers of Waste Management, Inc.:  Dean L. Buntrock was Waste Managements founder, chairman of the Board of Directors, and chief executive officer during most of the relevant period; Phillip B. Rooney was president and chief operating officer, director, and CEO for a portion of the relevant period; Thomas C. Hau was vice president, corporate controller, and chief accounting officer; and Herbert Getz was senior vice president, general counsel, and secretary.  The Judgments permanently bar Buntrock, Rooney, Hau, and Getz from acting as an officer or director of a public company, enjoin them from future violations of the antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws, and require payment of $30,869,054 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  , The complaint in this action charged Buntrock, Rooney, Hau, Getz, and two other former top officers of Waste Management with perpetrating a massive financial fraud lasting more than five years.  The Commission alleged that, beginning in 1992 and continuing into 1997, defendants engaged in a systematic scheme to falsify and misrepresent Waste Managements financial results with profits being overstated by $1.7 billion.  The fraud resulted in a restatement in February 1998, which at the time was the largest restatement in history., According to the complaint, the scheme was accomplished through false and misleading disclosures and a variety of non-GAAP accounting practices designed to defer current period expenses whenever possible.  For example, the Company manipulated its calculation of depreciation expense by repeatedly extending the useful lives and overstating the salvage value of its trucks and containers, thus reducing periodic depreciation expenses.  The Company also failed to write off impaired assets carried on its balance sheet, improperly capitalized interest and other current period expenses, understated its income tax expenses, under-accrued reserves, misapplied acquisition accounting principles, and improperly reversed reserves into income.  All of these practices boosted current period earnings by reducing current period expenses.  , The Judgments permanently bar Buntrock, Rooney, Hau, and Getz from acting as an officer or director of a public company and enjoin them from violating, or aiding and abetting violations of, Sections 10(b) and 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 promulgated thereunder, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.  The Judgment as to Hau additionally enjoins him from aiding and abetting violations of Section 13(b)(2)(A) of Exchange Act, and from violating Exchange Act Rules 13b2-1 and 13b2-2., The Judgments also require payment of over $30 million in total, comprised of $16.4 million in disgorgement, $10.4 million prejudgment interest, and $4 million in civil penalties.  The disgorgement includes approximately $6.3 million in earnings-based performance bonuses from all settling defendants, $5.9 million in Buntrock and Haus retirement benefits based upon the earnings-based bonuses, $3.5 million in losses avoided by Buntrock and Rooney from selling stock during the fraud, and $700,000 in tax benefits realized by Buntrock from gifting stock that was inflated by the fraud.  The breakdown of the monetary relief is as follows:, Additionally, Getz agreed to settle a related Rule 102(e) administrative proceeding to be instituted by the Commission by consenting to the entry of an order suspending him from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an attorney for five years.  , The Commissions litigation is continuing as to James E. Koenig Waste Managements former chief financial officer and executive vice president.  The other senior officer named in the complaint, Bruce D. Tobecksen, settled in September 2004.

However, according to the complaint, Selden knew, but failed to disclose, material negative information about the pivotal clinical trial and the FDA application, including that: (1) the pivotal clinical trial had failed to meet the primary objective that Transkaryotic and the FDA had agreed would be necessary to demonstrate Replagals clinical benefit for pain relief; (2) the FDA had informed Transkaryotic on several occasions beginning at least as early as January 2001 that the pivotal trial was a failed study, that the studys primary analysis had failed, and that the FDA recommended additional clinical trials; and (3) beginning in 2001, Transkaryotic had informed the FDA, based on the FDAs criticisms of its clinical pain results, that it did not intend to seek approval for Replagal based on a claim that the drug relieved the pain of Fabrys Disease.  The complaint alleges that when Transkaryotic finally disclosed some negative information about the FDA application after the close of markets on October 2, 2002, the announcement caused the companys stock price to plummet over $20 per share, from a closing price of $33.25 per share on October 2 to $12.75 per share on October 3.  According to the complaint, prior to the October 2002 disclosure, Transkaryotics stock price had been kept at artificially high levels by the misleading statements and omissions about the Replagal clinical trials and FDA application, and Selden benefitted from the artificially high prices by selling 90,000 shares of Transkaryotic stock between May 2001 and February 2002.  By selling this stock at the time he did, rather than after the negative information became public in October 2002, Selden avoided a loss of $1,664,000. , The Commissions complaint charges Selden with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting Transkaryotics uncharged violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13 thereunder.  The Commission is seeking injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and an order barring Selden from serving as an officer or director of a public company., <img alt=* border=0 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif/><a href=/litigation/complaints/comp19357.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>, <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19357.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Soto (Soto), a former Morgan Stanley DW, Inc. (Morgan Stanley) registered representative, to twelve years in prison for his involvement in a fraudulent scheme in which he raised millions of dollars.  Judge Cerezo ordered Soto to pay a restitution of more than $25 million for the benefit of defrauded investors., Soto is a defendant in a pending civil action filed by the SEC on February 11, 2004, in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico.  The SECs complaint alleged that Soto, while employed at Morgan Stanley, raised at least $50 million by telling investors that he would invest their funds in low risk mortgage-backed securities issued by the Government National Mortgage Association (commonly-called Ginnie Maes), but instead diverted the investors money to accounts in the names of false companies he controlled.  The complaint further alleged that Soto used the funds for personal use and to engage in speculative and risky trading, including short sales.  The SEC has already obtained a temporary restraining order, a preliminary injunction and asset freeze.  The SECs litigation against Soto is continuing., On February 19, 2004, Soto was arrested in San Juan, Puerto Rico.

Trugman, the former chairman and chief executive officer of Del Global Technologies Corp., Inc. (Del), a company based in Valhalla, New York.   The Commissions complaint, filed June 1, 2004 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleged that Trugman (along with five former officers and/or directors of Del) participated in a multi-year financial fraud at Del between 1997 and 2000.  Trugman consented to the entry of a final judgment against him without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint., On August 23, 2005, the Honorable Colleen McMahon, U.S. District Judge for the Southern District of New York, entered a final judgment that requires Trugman to pay $885,000 in disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, $255,000 in prejudgment interest thereon, and a $110,000 civil penalty, for a total of $1.25 million.  The final judgment also enjoins Trugman from (i) violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Exchange Act Rules 13b2-1 and 13b2-2, (ii) aiding and abetting  violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and (iii) controlling any person (pursuant to Exchange Act 20(a)) that violates these provisions.  Additionally, the final judgment permanently bars Trugman from acting as an officer or director of a public company., The Commissions complaint alleged, among other things, that Trugman orchestrated a financial fraud at Del that resulted in Del materially overstating its reported revenues and caused Del to make numerous material misrepresentations in Commission filings and in press releases.  According to the complaint, Del routinely engaged in improper revenue recognition when it held open quarters, prematurely shipped products to third-party warehouses, and recorded sales on products that Del had not yet manufactured. The complaint also alleged that Del improperly accounted for inventory by recording obsolete inventory at full value and overstating certain engineering work in process values. In addition, the complaint alleged that Del improperly characterized certain ordinary expenses as capital expenditures. As alleged in the complaint, these actions contravened Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and resulted in the overstatement of Dels reported pre-tax income by at least $3.7 million (110%) in fiscal year 1997, $5.2 million (161%) in fiscal year 1998, and $7.9 million (466%) in fiscal year 1999 - and allowed Del to represent that its performance was on par with internal and external expectations in the first three quarters of fiscal year 2000, when in fact those expectations outpaced the companys actual performance by a wide margin., The complaint further alleged that Trugman and others engaged in a cover-up to prevent Dels outside auditors from discovering the fraud.  Del kept two sets of books (one set for its auditors and one correct set) and falsified documents such as shipping logs, quality control records, and accounts receivable documents to hide its fraudulent accounting practices from its outside auditors. , For additional information, see Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18732.htm>18732</a> (June 1, 2004), <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19360.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Johnson consented to the entry of a final judgment, subject to the courts approval, in which he is permanently enjoined from further violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and agreed to pay disgorgement of his and his sons trading profits, plus prejudgment interest and a one time civil penalty totaling $786,449., The Commissions complaint alleges that on October 31, 2003, Johnson contacted the then Chairman of PMAs Board of Directors regarding an adverse analyst report he had received about PMA.  In response to Johnsons inquiry about the financial health of PMA, the then Chairman informed Johnson that PMA was not doing well financially, would be discontinuing its payment of a common stock dividend and increasing carried loss reserves at its reinsurance subsidiary, PMA Reinsurance.

The complaint also alleges that on July 23, 2004, Thottam purchased 200 call options on IndyMac common stock while aware of IndyMacs nonpublic earnings information.

The First Amended Complaint alleged that Lech knew that the investor funds that he received from McNaughton were raised from investors and that McNaughton told the investors that their funds were being invested by Lech in stock options.  Instead of investing the funds, Lech transferred some of the investors funds back to McNaughton to pay other investors their monthly interest.  Lech also used some investor funds to pay his personal expenses.

Both entities were formerly located in Jenkintown, Pennsylvania.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the Complaint, Kogan and Laucius have consented to the settlement terms described below., The Commissions Complaint alleges that Kogan perpetrated a fraudulent scheme to misappropriate more than $5.6 million from more than 80 investors who were customers of Penn Financial and Kogan &amp; Company.  From as early as 1999 and continuing until March 2003, Kogan, while not licensed to sell securities, falsely held himself out as being associated with Penn Financial to deceive investors into investing funds with him.  Laucius aided and abetted Kogans fraudulent scheme by providing Kogan with access to Penn Financials facilities as well as its customer accounts.  In particular, Laucius improperly provided Kogan with access that Penn Financial had, as an introducing broker, to its clearing brokers computer system, which gave Kogan the means to conduct his scheme., The Complaint further alleges that, using this access, Kogan engaged in unauthorized transactions while telling investors that their funds were secure.  Kogan used the funds he stole to trade in the market, to repay earlier investors, and to pay his own personal expenses.  In order to conceal his conduct, Kogan gave investors false monthly account statements purporting to show that their funds had been invested as agreed and were making profits., The Complaint alleges that Kogan violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that Laucius aided and abetted violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Complaint seeks permanent injunctions against both defendants, and disgorgement, together with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against Laucius.  Both defendants have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from engaging in the above violations.  Laucius has also been ordered to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $141,669, but payment of all but $90,000 is waived, and no civil penalties are imposed, based on his financial condition.  Kogan has previously pled guilty to criminal charges arising out of the fraud described in the Complaint.

Vassallo and Presto, which purported to be an international telecommunications company positioned to become Latin Americas Premier Integrated Communications Provider, raised over $11 million from the sale of Presto securities.  , The Commissions complaint, filed on January 27, 2004 in federal court in San Diego, alleged that the defendants induced more than 800 investors in 42 states to invest in Presto with promises that the company had significant business relationships with AT&amp;T, Sprint, MCI, and Qwest.  These four telecommunications companies had purportedly expressed interest in acquiring Presto or in making capital investments in the company.  Investors were told that Presto was a partner to and had alliances with Cisco Systems and Unisys.  Investors were also told that the U.S. Commerce Department was lobbying Mexican telecommunications regulators on Prestos behalf, and that their funds would be used to build and operate a telecommunications network in Mexico.  According to the complaint, these representations were false.  The complaint further alleged that Presto failed to disclose to prospective investors that the license its affiliated entity received from the Mexican government in 1998 was, in fact, the subject of revocation proceedings that commenced in 2001.  Additionally, the complaint alleged that while Vassallo and others represented that investor funds would be used to pay Prestos business expenses, primarily fiber optics and equipment, only 16% of investor and company funds were used for equipment and fiber, and Vassallo misappropriated at least $1.2 million of investor and company funds for personal expenses.  These expenses include jewelry, luxury automobiles, a down payment on an expensive home, mortgage payments, home improvements, political and charitable contributions, and school tuition for his children.  The court appointed Thomas F. Lennon as permanent receiver over Presto. , On August 24, 2005, the District Court entered final judgments of permanent injunction and other relief against Presto and Vassallo.  The judgments enjoin Presto and Vassallo from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and the securities registration provisions of Section 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act.  The judgment against Vassallo orders him to disgorge to the receiver $1,263,658.79, representing the amount of his ill-gotten gains as a result of the conduct alleged in the complaint, plus pre-judgment interest of $23,638.97.  Vassallo was also ordered to pay civil penalties in the amount of $120,000.  Vassallo was further ordered to pay the costs, fees, and expenses incurred by the receiver in the amount of $601,784.77.  The judgment against Presto was entered with the consent of the receiver.  It specifies that pursuant to one or more plans of distribution to be submitted by the receiver to the court, the funds and assets of the receivership estate, if any, will be distributed to investors less court-approved fees and expenses.  , The final judgments against Presto and Vassallo conclude the Commissions action.  Administration of the receivership estate will continue., For further information, see Litigation Release Nos. 18554 (January 28, 2004), 18616 (March 9, 2004), and 18858 (August 26, 2004)., <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19368.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

BOGLE, PETER EMMANUEL, AND MIA VENTURE CAPITAL LLC FOR A MARKET-MANIPULATION SCHEME </h2>]","[On September 7, 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas (Houston Division) against Houston-based MegaMania Interactive, Inc.; its CEO, George W. Bogle, Jr., 46; Peter Emmanuel, 43; and Mia Venture Capital LLC, a Florida-based private company controlled by Emmanuel.  MegaMania is a software and website-design company whose common stock trades under the ticker symbol MNIA in the Pink Sheets.  The SEC alleged violations of the federal securities laws against each of the defendants, claiming, among other things, that they illegally profited from a scheme to inflate MegaManias stock price in a fraudulent promotional campaign in 2003.   , The SECs complaint alleges that, in August and September 2003, Emmanuel, operating through Mia Venture Capital, distributed hundreds of thousands of unsolicited faxes and millions of spam emails that touted MegaManias stock and directed recipients to a MegaMania research report on an Internet website operated by Emmanuel.  Bogle hired Emmanuel to carry out the distribution in exchange for 750,000 shares of MegaMania stock.  The faxes, emails, and research report contained numerous false and misleading statements about the company.  For example, they claimed, that MegaMania achieves profitability with Less than 1000 Managed Service Clients and that its revenue would steadily grow to $225 million in revenue within 5 years.  They also repeated false statements by Bogle contained in contemporaneous MegaMania press releases, which claimed that the company had received funding commitments totaling $400,000.  Finally, they rated MegaMania as Our Most Aggressive Stock Buy Recommendation with a target share price of $5, an increase of approximately 900% over the prevailing price.  In reality, MegaMania had no funding commitments and had never achieved profitability, and the revenue and share-price projections had no reasonable basis., During the fraudulent promotional campaign, MegaManias stock price increased by over 120%, and its trading volume increased dramatically.  Concurrently, Bogle sold approximately 118,000 MegaMania shares for about $92,000 through the account of GLM Technologies LLC, a private company owned and operated by his brother Timothy L. Bogle, 42, of West Bloomfield, Michigan.  Timothy Bogle transferred the proceeds from these sales to MegaMania.  Emmanuel sold approximately 452,000 MegaMania shares into the market for proceeds of approximately $364,950.  , The SECs complaint alleges that MegaMania, George Bogle, Emmanuel, and Mia Venture Capital violated the anti-fraud and securities-registration provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.   The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, and a civil money penalty against each defendant and further seeking as to George Bogle and Peter Emmanuel a penny-stock bar., In a related action, the SEC issued a cease-and-desist order against Timothy L. Bogle and GLM Technologies, LLC, finding that they violated the securities-registration provisions of the federal securities laws in connection with the unregistered distribution of MegaManias stock.  Timothy Bogle and GLM Technologies both agreed to the entry of the order, without admitting or denying the substantive findings therein., <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19369.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Covington, of Eminence, Kentucky, the former President and CEO of Farmers Deposit Bank (Farmers), a subsidiary of Premier Financial Bancorp, Inc. (Premier), a public company located in Huntington, West Virginia.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the Complaint, Covington has consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from engaging in the violations set forth below, ordering him to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $150,000, and imposing an officer and director bar., The Commissions Complaint alleges that, from 2001 until 2003, Covington engaged in a variety of fraudulent acts designed to conceal mounting loan losses at Farmers from Farmers board of directors and auditors, from Premiers management and board of directors, and from federal and state banking regulators.  Among other things, Covington concealed substantial loan losses at the bank by recording loans under fictitious or misleading names and using the proceeds to keep earlier loans current; altering documents presented to Farmers board of directors; altering loan documents to assign a later due date, thus making the loans appear current, a practice known as bump-dating; structuring loans by dividing them into smaller amounts to avoid meeting the minimum loan amount required for review by Farmers auditors and board of directors; recording fictitious payments on loans; reassigning loan payments to unrelated accounts; and releasing collateral securing loans without requiring payment of the debt., The Complaint further alleges that Covingtons conduct caused Farmers to report false financial information to Premier.  As a result, Premier filed quarterly and annual reports with the Commission containing materially false and misleading financial statements in 2001, 2002 and 2003.  Specifically, Premiers net income for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001 was overstated by 94 percent, and its net loss for 2002 was understated by 63 percent., The Complaint alleges that Covington violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder, and that he aided and abetted violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.

The Final Consent Judgment permanently enjoins Uniprime from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Final Consent Judgment also requires Uniprime to pay disgorgement in the amount of $127,201, and the Court waived payment of the remaining ill-gotten gains and does not impose a civil penalty based upon Uniprimes current financial condition and demonstrated inability to pay. , Previously, on March 23, 2004, Judge Kram entered an Order granting the Commissions motion for default and summary judgment and imposed a final permanent injunction and other relief against Alfred J. Flores, the other defendant in this action.  Judge Kram enjoined Flores from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Order also directs Flores to pay disgorgement in the amount of $11,000, plus prejudgment interest in the amount of $4092.87, and directs Flores to disgorge the 200,000 shares of restricted stock that he received from Uniprime.  The Order also directs Flores to pay a $110,000 civil penalty and bars Flores from serving as an officer and director of a public company.  , The Commission commenced this action by filing its Complaint on August 13, 1999 against Uniprime and Flores alleging that both fraudulently described Flores as an immunologist who developed an HIV treatment named Plasma Plus.  Specifically, the Complaint alleged that Uniprime and Flores made material misrepresentations and omissions in statements to the public concerning Flores Plasma Plus treatment.  Between June 16, 1999 and August 6, 1999 Uniprime and Flores issued three false press releases and participated in an interview that was aired on Bloomberg News, claiming, among other things, that Plasma Plus was successfully tested on persons with full-blown AIDS in Madrid; that the Government of Spain submitted documentation to Uniprime verifying the test results; and that Flores graduated from universities in the United States and Spain.

In selling the notes, the Defendants made, and continue to make, materially misleading misrepresentations and omissions concerning investment risk and the nature of NJ Affordables business.  The Commission alleges that NJ Affordable and Puff guaranteed investors high rates of return, between 15% and 20%, based on promises that NJ Affordable and Puff would use the investors money to fund the purchase, renovation, and resale of real property.  The Defendants failed to disclose to investors that they could not pay such high rates of return, are funding payments to existing investors by soliciting new investor money, and are generating fictitious revenue by selling their properties to insiders, investors, and affiliated entities.  Moreover, the Commission alleges that NJ Affordable and Puff failed to tell investors that the investment is not as secure as promised because NJ Affordable and Puff routinely inflate the value of the property upon which NJ Affordable granted mortgage interests., The Complaint charges NJ Affordable and Puff with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder., In its emergency enforcement action, the Commission is seeking, among other emergency relief, a temporary restraining order (i) freezing the assets of NJ Affordable and Puff; and (ii) appointing a temporary receiver over NJ Affordable.

Kenney, Jr., the Chief Executive Officer and a former Director of WRC Media, Inc. (WRC), in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.  WRC sells educational materials for the kindergarten through high school market and had $152 million of publicly traded debt securities registered with the Commission until July 2005 when WRC repurchased its debt securities. , The Commissions complaint alleges that Kenney orchestrated WRCs fraudulent recognition of $1.2 million in revenue from a purported fourth quarter 2002 sale of educational software to the Monroe City, Louisiana School District.  At the time, WRC was millions of dollars behind its fourth quarter 2002 revenue expectations and was in danger of defaulting on its public debt covenants.  The complaint alleges that to facilitate the fraud, Kenney procured an unauthorized sales contract from the superintendent of the Monroe City School District that was contingent upon approval by the entire school board.  According to the complaint, the contract failed to reflect the school board contingency and omitted the standard representation by the superintendent that he was authorized to bind the school district and that all requirements necessary for authorization had been satisfied.  The complaint further alleges that Kenney concealed the contingency from WRCs internal accountants and independent auditors so they would not reject fourth quarter 2002 revenue recognition.  As a result, the complaint alleges that WRC filed financial reports with the Commission, certified by Kenney, that materially misstated its fourth quarter results.  After learning that the school district would not proceed with the transaction, Kenney permitted WRC to record a bad debt reserve for the purported Monroe receivable in the first quarter of 2003, when it should have restated fourth quarter 2002 results.  In March 2004, WRC restated its fiscal 2002 results to correct for the improper accounting related to the Monroe transaction., Due to Kenneys actions, the complaint alleges that WRC Media filed materially false and misleading periodic and current reports with the Commission.

Roke consented to the entry of the final judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint., On September 29, 2004, the Commission filed a complaint against Roke alleging that she was involved in two schemes at AMS which caused AMS to fraudulently overstate its earnings.  First, through Rokes involvement, AMS improperly recognized revenue on a greater number of print and mail advertising vehicles than AMS had in fact produced and distributed for its publisher clients.  Second, Roke participated in a scheme to increase AMSs income by directing AMS personnel to not inform retailers of credits due to them for certain advertising and promotional services that the retailers provided.  Instead of contacting the retailers and reconciling amounts, AMS improperly reversed the liability and thereby decreased expenses and increased its income.  Roke profited from her participation in the fraudulent schemes from her receipt of annual bonuses and sales of AMS stock.

Specifically, the Complaint alleges that in April 2003, the FDA placed a clinical hold barring Biopure from conducting clinical trials of Hemopure in trauma settings such as emergency rooms, because of safety concerns about Hemopure.  As alleged, during the next eight months, the company concealed the imposition of the clinical hold while making public statements about its plans to obtain approval for trauma uses of Hemopure.  In addition, according to the Complaint, in July 2003 the FDA informed Biopure that it had not approved Biopures application for use of Hemopure in orthopedic surgery, and instead conveyed serious concerns about whether the materials Biopure had submitted in support of its application were reliable and questioning the safety of Hemopure.  Biopure, however, issued public statements beginning on August 1, 2003 describing the FDAs communication as good news, causing its stock price to increase by over 20%.  The Complaint alleges that Biopure continued to make misleading statements until December 2003.  During this period, Biopure raised over $35 million from investors.  The Complaint further alleges that as the true status of Biopures efforts to obtain FDA approval gradually became public, through a series of incomplete and misleading disclosures between late October and the end of December 2003, the companys stock price plummeted almost 66% from its August 1 price., According to the Complaint, Moore, the former CEO, personally made and approved misleading statements; Richman, the former officer responsible for FDA relations, made and provided information for misleading statements; and Kober, who continues to serve as Biopures General Counsel, drafted and approved misleading statements.

The Commission alleges that NJ Affordable and Puff guaranteed investors high rates of return, between 15% and 20%, based on promises that NJ Affordable and Puff would use the investors money to fund the purchase, renovation, and resale of real property.  The Defendants failed to disclose to investors that they could not pay such high rates of return, are funding payments to existing investors by soliciting new investor money, and are generating fictitious revenue by selling their properties to insiders, investors, and affiliated entities.  Moreover, the Commission alleges that NJ Affordable and Puff failed to tell investors that the investment is not as secure as promised because NJ Affordable and Puff routinely inflate the value of the property upon which NJ Affordable granted mortgage interests., The Complaint charges NJ Affordable and Puff with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder., <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19377.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

According to the complaint, the defendants, among other things, obtained false and misleading side letters from certain Fleming vendors to support improper accounting entries that inflated Flemings earnings.  These transactions were the subject of settled enforcement actions the Commission brought against Fleming and several of its vendors and vendor employees on September 14, 2004.  See In the Matter of Fleming Companies, Inc., Lit. Rel.

The complaint also alleges that Shapiro and Murphy inflated earnings by executing large quarter-end inventory purchases solely to generate discounts that Fleming could immediately recognize as earnings, to help meet Wall Street analysts earnings expectations.  Fleming failed to disclose that these purchases were part of an intentional scheme to inflate earnings.  In addition, Shapiro improperly inflated Flemings 2001 earnings by directing the release of extensive accounting reserves, without proper justification or disclosure. Finally, Dahlen helped Fleming report misleading same store sales numbers by repeatedly changing the methodology behind the calculation, without disclosure to the public, and approving financing transactions that were disguised as sales., <p align=center>*			*			*, <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19380.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Saris entered a Partial Judgment of Default Against defendant Pembridge Group, Ltd. for engaging in a scheme to manipulate the securities of the former Imagis Technologies, Inc. (currently named Visiphor Corporation), a Canadian software company quoted on the OTC-Bulletin Board.  The Partial Judgment of Default permanently enjoined Pembridge from further violations of the general and tender offer anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws, ordered the payment of civil monetary penalties of $550,000 and ordered Pembridge to pay disgorgement in an amount to be determined by the Court at a later date.  The Partial Default Judgment was based on Pembridge’s failure to answer or otherwise defend itself against the allegations contained in the Commission’s Complaint.  , On November 1, 2004, the Commission filed civil fraud charges against Treyton L. Thomas and Pembridge.  The Complaint alleged that from at least 1999 through 2002, Thomas generated several false press releases in which he claimed to be the founder and chairman of Pembridge, a purported multi-faceted investment firm that managed several hundred million dollars and provided growth capital to formative companies.  In fact, it is alleged, Pembridge was simply a front that Thomas used to gain credibility and further his fraudulent scheme.  , The Complaint alleged that on March 6, 2002, Thomas caused Pembridge to publically announce a fraudulent cash tender offer for all of Imagis’ outstanding stock at over $4.00 per share (almost double  the price at which Imagis’ stock was trading in previous months).  Directly following Pembridge’s announcement the price of Imagis’ stock went up to a 52-week high of $3.40.   In fact, as alleged, neither Thomas nor Pembridge controlled or had access to hundreds of millions of dollars let alone the resources necessary to buy out Imagis’ shareholders. , The SEC further alleged in the complaint that prior to announcing the false tender proposal, Thomas had arranged for an offshore entity – known as Indo Sakura Trust – to acquire over 100,000 warrants of Imagis stock.  Shortly before the fraudulent March 6 tender offer announcement, Indo Sakura converted 70,000 warrants to shares and, a few days after the bogus release, Indo Sakura exercised its remaining 35,000 warrants.  Pembridge also acquired warrants to purchase 50,000 shares of Imagis stock at $2.20 (CDN) a share.  The Complaint alleges that the defendants’ scheme artificially inflated the value of Indo Sakuras Imagis stock, as well as the securities held directly by Pembridge and its purported clients., For more information see <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18957.htm>Litigation Release No. 18957</a> (November 3, 2004) ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19382.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The Employee is an accountant at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond who had access to Bed Bath &amp; Beyonds earnings and revenue information prior to its public dissemination.  On the basis of the information he received from the Employee, Cohen effected unlawful trades in his own brokerage accounts, his wifes account, his business accounts, and his business partners account prior to these public announcements.

Treadwell of Savannah, Georgia, Ricky D. Sluder of Whitehouse, Texas, Larry C. Saturday of Savannah, Georgia, and Arnulfo M. Acosta of Hildago County, Texas, for their participation in a scheme to solicit money from members of the public, ostensibly for participation in high-yield trading programs and venture capital investments.  The indictment charges each defendant with wire fraud and conspiracy., According to the indictment, the defendants used companies named Learn Waterhouse, Inc., a Texas corporation, Wealth Builders Club, Inc. and Qwest International, Inc., both Nevada corporations, to fraudulently solicit over $50 million from members of the public.  The indictment alleges that the defendants induced people to invest by falsely representing and causing others to represent that investors’ money would be used for investments that would generate returns ranging from 2% to 50% per month or more.  The indictment further alleges that only a small fraction of the over $50 million raised was ever placed in any investments, and those investments generated almost no returns.  Instead, the defendants used money received from new investors to make payments to earlier investors.  The indictment alleges that the defendants converted millions of dollars of investors’ funds to their own personal use. , The indictment follows the Commission’s complaint filed in federal court in San Diego on October 12, 2004 against Treadwell, Sluder, Saturday, Acosta, and Learn Waterhouse alleging that they had raised millions from 1700 investors in a nationwide Ponzi scheme.  On November 1, 2004, Thomas Lennon was appointed as the permanent receiver over Learn Waterhouse, and given authority over all of its assets.  The court also ordered the defendants to repatriate all assets from abroad, and issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting all of the defendants from future violations of the antifraud and registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  , On February 23, 2005, the court issued an order finding Treadwell to be in civil contempt for violating prior orders of the court by (1) failing to provide an accounting and other financial information to the Commission, (2) failing to cooperate with the court-appointed receiver, (3) withdrawing money from a bank account that was subject to the court’s orders that froze all of the defendants’ assets, (4) offering and selling new securities under the guise of a legal defense fund, and (5) continuing to make false representations regarding Learn Waterhouse and the securities that it had sold.  The court’s contempt order found that Treadwell violated the court’s preliminary injunction order of November 1, 2004, as well as the temporary restraining order of October 12, 2004., In addition to the relief already obtained, the Commission seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement and civil penalties from all of the defendants., For further information, see Litigation Release Nos. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18932.htm>18932</a> (October 14, 2004), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18959.htm>18959</a> (November 4, 2004), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr19059.htm>19059</a> (February 1, 2005), and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr19142.htm>19142</a> (March 17, 2005).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19384.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The Commission’s complaint alleged that Steckler participated in placing a $7 million order with Legato on behalf of Steckler’s employer, which was subject to a separate, undisclosed “side” agreement that gave his employer the right to cancel the order.  As a result, Legato materially overstated its financial results for its third quarter ending September 30, 1999., Simultaneous with the filing of Steckler’s consent to the Final Judgment, the Commission instituted a cease-and-desist order against Steckler committing or causing future violations of Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rules 10b-5, and 13b2-1, thereunder, and from causing future violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-13 thereunder.

Goodman, age 41, of North Andover, Massachusetts, plead guilty to an eleven count indictment charging him with three counts of investment adviser fraud, three counts of securities fraud, and five counts of wire fraud that was being prosecuted by the United States Attorneys Office in Boston, Massachusetts. , At the plea hearing, the prosecutor told the court that between February and August 2000, Goodman obtained and then misappropriated $700,000 through two fraudulent investment schemes offered through his investment advisory business, New England Capital Advisory Group, LLC., The prosecutor also stated that first scheme involved a fictitious initial public offering pool (the IPO Pool).  Goodman collected $500,000 from two investors after falsely representing that he would use their funds to obtain stock in initial public offerings underwritten by five investment banks during a specified period. Goodman falsely claimed that his firm would and had opened accounts at each of the five investment banks and that because of his special relationship with each investment bank, the accounts would receive allotments of shares in the IPOs the banks underwrote.  Goodman told the investors that he would be able to sell the IPO shares immediately at a profit, with minimal risk.  In fact, neither Goodman nor his firm established any such accounts with the investment banks, and when he received the funds from the investors, he did not invest the funds in IPOs.  Instead, he used the funds to engage in day trading, to pay other clients, and to pay himself. , The prosecutor noted that second scheme involved a false arbitrage opportunity in the internet company, Lycos, Inc. (Lycos).  In that scheme, Goodman falsely represented to one of the IPO Pool investors that he has created an investment strategy in which New England Capital would buy stock in Lycos and use options to minimize the risk that Lycos stock would decline in value.  Goodman collected an additional $200,000 from that investor.  Goodman, however, did not invest the money as he represented.  He had no arbitrage strategy.  He did not even buy Lycos stock with the investors $200,000.  Instead, as he had done with the IPO Pool funds, he used the funds to pay other clients and to pay himself., Judge Woodlock scheduled sentencing for December 5, 2005 at 2:30 p.m. Goodman faces a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment and a $1 million fine on each securities fraud count; 5 years imprisonment and a $10,000 fine on each investment adviser fraud count; and 5 years imprisonment and a $250,000 fine on each wire fraud count. , The criminal indictment followed the Commissions civil case against Goodman related to the same events.  On September 29, 2004, the District Court for the District of Massachusetts entered a final judgment against Goodman in the Commissions civil injunctive action finding that he violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Advisers Act and imposing a $220,000 civil penalty. , For further information, please see: Litigation Release No. 16875 (January 30, 2001); Investment Advisers Act of 1949 Release No. 2313 (October 13, 2004); Investment Advisers Act of 1949 Release No. 2330 (November 19, 2004); and Litigation Release No. 19097 (February 23, 2005)., <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19386.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

According to the complaint, from at least February 2001 through at least March 2003, Eisemann and Montaino solicited investors by making a series of false or misleading statements including, among other things, that Hermans Sports would be imminently conducting an initial public offering with the assistance of investment banks, at prices well above the price offered in the Hermans Sports private placement.  In addition, Eisemann sent investors versions of a private placement memorandum and other documents containing misrepresentations about the Hermans Sports offering, materials which Montaino knew, or was reckless in not knowing, were being sent.

Moyes, chairman and chief executive officer of Swift Transportation Co., Inc., for insider trading in the stock of Swift.  Swift is one the largest U.S. trucking companies with over 20,000 employees and revenues of $3 billion.  Moyes agreed to pay approximately $1.25 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest and penalties to settle this matter., The Commissions complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona, alleges that Moyes bought 187,000 shares of Swift stock on the two trading days before Swifts May 24, 2004 public announcement that the company projected better than expected second quarter earnings, and that Swifts board had authorized a $40 million stock repurchase plan.  Swifts share price rose 20% the day after the announcement.  Moyes unrealized profit from the trades was over $622,000., The complaint alleges that Moyes attended a May 20, 2004 board meeting at which Swifts CFO presented better than expected second quarter 2004 earnings estimates.  During the May 20 meeting, the board also authorized a $40 million addition to Swifts ongoing $100 million stock repurchase plan.  The Commissions action alleges that Moyes breached his fiduciary duty to Swift by purchasing 87,000 Swift shares on May 21 and 100,000 Swift shares on May 24 on the basis of the material, nonpublic information concerning the earnings projections and stock buyback plan., Swift timely filed the required statements of change in beneficial ownership (known as Form 4s) with the SEC reflecting Moyes stock purchases.  Upon learning of Moyes trades, Swifts independent directors took corrective action, including implementing a stricter insider trading policy and instituting a pre-clearing process for all trades by company insiders.  Moyes voluntarily escrowed funds equal to his putative profits in a trust controlled by the independent directors.  Moyes stepped down as president of Swift in November 2004 and has agreed to relinquish his position as chief executive officer in December 2005., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Moyes consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Moyes also agreed to pay disgorgement of his unrealized profit of $622,131, plus $14,974 in prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $622,131., <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19389.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The judgment also orders Lessinger to pay a civil penalty of $20,000 and permanently bars him from participating in any penny stock offerings.  Lessinger consented to entry of the final judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint.  , In its complaint, filed on April 16, 2004, the Commission alleged, among other things, that in March 1999, Lessinger opened Preferreds Pompano Beach branch office and -- despite Preferreds prohibition against soliciting transactions in penny stocks -- approved the Pompano Beach branch offices request to solicit transactions in the securities of Orex Gold Mines Corporation.  The complaint alleged that Preferreds Pompano Beach branch office operated as a classic boiler room with no meaningful supervision or controls imposed by Lessinger.  The Commissions complaint further alleged that Preferreds brokers engaged in various sales practice abuses while selling Orex stock, made false and misleading statements about Orex, failed to make the required penny stock disclosures to customers concerning Orex, and otherwise engaged in a variety of conduct which operated as a fraud and deceit on investors.  See Litigation Release No. 18669 (April 19, 2004).  , As a result of the conduct described in the complaint, the Commission charged Lessinger with violating NASD Conduct Rule 3010, and, based on his liability as a control person pursuant to Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), for violations by certain co-defendants of Exchange Act Sections 10(b) and 15(g) and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 15g-2, 15g-4 and 15g-5.  , The final judgment permanently enjoins Lessinger from violating the foregoing provisions of the federal securities laws and NASD Conduct Rules and permanently bars him from participating in any penny stock offerings.

During the time period referenced in the Commissions complaint, Cornerstone was headquartered in Watsonville, California and sold retail propane and traded other wholesale energy commodities.  The Commissions complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, alleges that these five individuals were responsible for Cornerstones reporting of materially false financial results in Commission filings and press releases for the period June 2000 through September 2001., The Commissions complaint alleges that, during Cornerstones 2000 and 2001 fiscal years, the defendants caused Cornerstone to file financial statements that were materially inaccurate and unreliable in light of Cornerstones failure to properly track its assets and liabilities.  The complaint further alleges that the defendants failed to make other required disclosures in Cornerstones filings, and that they concealed Cornerstones fundamental accounting errors from the companys outside auditors.  According to the complaint, Cornerstone eventually wrote off $9.8 million of unsubstantiated balances at fiscal    year-end 2001 as a result of its accounting errors, but Baxter and Nye mischaracterized the nature of this adjustment in order to hide the companys past accounting failures from investors.  , The Commissions complaint charges Baxter, Goedde and Nye with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Metropolitan filed for bankruptcy in February 2004, devastating nearly 10,000 investors throughout the Pacific Northwest who had invested approximately $450 million in the once high-flying real estate company.  , The SECs civil complaint, filed in the Western District of Washington (Seattle), alleges that Metropolitans management falsified the companys 2002 financial results by reporting profits from circular real estate sales where Metropolitan purported to sell property to buyers who, in fact, received all of the money to pay for the purchase from Metropolitan or its affiliates.  The fraud made Metropolitan appear profitable - facilitating further sales of its bonds and preferred stock to investors - when in reality the company was encountering its third straight year of mounting losses and verging on financial collapse.  Named in the complaint are former Chief Executive Officer C. Paul Sandifur, Jr., 63, of El Centro, California; former executive Thomas G. Turner, 54, of Sparks, Nevada; and former Controller Robert Ness, 41, of Bellevue, Washington; as well as former Vice President Thomas R. Masters, 54, of Spokane, Washington, who is alleged to have participated in one of the fraudulent transactions., According to the Commissions complaint, the bogus deals - known internally as rabbits (as in, pulling a rabbit out of a hat) - all materialized in the final days of Metropolitans fiscal year 2002, allowing the company to report a profit rather than the loss it had anticipated.  In the largest of these deals, Metropolitan reported a $10 million gain by completely financing the purchase of property by customer Trillium Corporation, a private company based in Bellingham, Washington.  In order to evade accounting principles prohibiting companies from reporting profits from such sales, Metropolitan and Trillium agreed to make it appear that the property was being purchased by an unrelated third party, Jeff Properties - in reality a shell company set up by an eighteen year old high school student, the son of a Trillium creditor, in exchange for a motorcycle.  In addition to charges against Metropolitans officers, the Commissions complaint levels fraud charges against Trillium, its President and CEO David Syre, 64, of Bellingham, Washington, and Trillium creditor Dan Sandy, 50, of Rochester, Washington.  , Among other claims, the Commissions complaint alleges that by engaging in the conduct described above, each of the defendants committed or aided and abetted violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and aided and abetted Metropolitans violations of reporting requirements.  Specifically, the complaint alleges that Sandifur, Turner, Ness and Masters directly violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint also alleges that Sandy, Syre, Trillium, Turner, Ness and Masters aided and abetted Metropolitans violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  All of the defendants are alleged to have aided and abetted Metropolitans violations of the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 thereunder, and Sandifur, Turner and Ness are also alleged to have aided and abetted Metropolitans violations of Rule 13a-13 under the Exchange Act.  Further, Sandifur, Turner, Masters and Ness are alleged to have violated Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder, and aided and abetted Metropolitans violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act.  The complaint alleges that Sandifur, Turner and Ness violated Exchange Act Rule 13b2-2, and that through their certifications of Metropolitans 2002 year-end false financial statements, Sandifur and Ness violated Exchange Act Rule 13a-14.  Finally, the complaint charges Sandifur as a control person for Metropolitans violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder., The Commissions action seeks civil monetary penalties and injunctive relief from all defendants, as well as disgorgement from Sandifur, Turner, Ness and Masters, and orders barring Sandifur, Turner and Ness from serving as officers or directors of public companies., In a separate action, the Criminal Division of the United States Department of Justice and the Spokane Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation announced the filing of criminal charges against Thomas Turner.   , The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Securities Division of the Washington Department of Financial Institutions and the Washington State Attorney Generals Division of Consumer Protection in this matter., <img alt=* border=0 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif/><a href=/litigation/complaints/comp19394.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>, <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19394.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The courts entry of preliminary injunction, which was consented to by the defendant, prohibits Johar, from engaging in future violations of the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 pending the resolution of the Commissions action. The Preliminary Injunction also freezes Johars assets, limits his spending of newly acquired funds to $1,000 per week, requires him to submit an accounting of assets, and to return any funds sent overseas., The Commissions amended complaint, filed on September 14, 2005, alleges that beginning in October 2000, Entrust, through Mathur and Johar, raised more than $16 million from approximately twenty investors.  The complaint alleges, however, that Entrust, Mathur and Johar dissipated nearly all of their clients assets through undisclosed trading losses in Entrusts brokerage accounts, unauthorized use of investor funds to support Entrusts operating expenses, and blatant misappropriation of client funds for personal use.  The Commissions complaint also alleges that Entrust, Mathur and Johar transferred at least $1 million in investor funds to AMR Realty.  The Commission alleges AMR Realty has no legitimate interest in those funds and that it should not be allowed to retain them.  The Court entered a temporary restraining order and asset freeze against Mathur and Entrust and an asset freeze against AMR Realty on April 12, 2005., For more information see [SEC v.

Tyler.  The Commission had charged the defendant with securities fraud in connection with fraudulently marketed viatical interests.  Tyler was indicted in July 2004 by a federal grand jury on securities fraud and wire fraud charges for the same conduct.  On May 19, 2005, after pleading guilty to the charges in the indictment, Tyler was sentenced to a term of eight years in federal prison, plus three years supervised release, and was ordered to make restitution in the amount of $23,571,847., Previously, the Commission filed a civil suit against Tyler on February 11, 2002.  In its complaint, the Commission alleged that Tyler raised at least $30 million from investors, and personally realized over $5.2 million in undisclosed commissions, by fraudulently enticing more than 480 mostly elderly investors into purchasing investments issued by his company, Advanced Financial Services, Inc.  According to the complaint, Tyler deceived the elderly investors with false guarantees about the investments liquidity, above-market interest rates and fixed maturity dates. Tyler used investors funds to buy viaticals, which rendered the guarantees false because viaticals are illiquid investments with no fixed maturity dates and uncertain rates of return.  Tyler hid the fact that the underlying viaticals could not fulfill the promises that he had made to investors and that the investors had to rely on him and his company to carry through on the promises of guaranteed returns, fixed maturities and liquidity. Two weeks before the Commission filed its suit, Tyler and his company both filed for bankruptcy., Tyler consented to the entry of a final judgment enjoining him from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and also directing him to comply with a cease-and-desist order that the Commission previously issued against him in May 2001.  Further, Tyler agreed to an order finding him liable for disgorgement in the amount of $5,232,099 plus pre-judgment interest in the amount of $750,672.  Tyler was ordered to pay only $1,796,000 of this amount, representing the value of the assets recovered by the receiver appointed in the case, in light of his criminal sentence and order of restitution.

The Default Judgment enjoins Lee and Kim from violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and Section 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Additionally, the Default Judgment provides for disgorgement and the imposition of civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the Court upon the SECs motion., The SEC commenced this action by filing its complaint on March 2, 2005, against various hedge funds, investment advisers and the hedge funds and investment advisers principals, Lee and Kim, among others.  The complaint alleged that from approximately 1999 to March 2005, the Defendants raised at least $81 million from investors nationwide by boasting annualized returns of 125 to 150% over the last several years and by sending false account statements to investors showing similar gains.  According to the complaint, the hedge funds were suffering tremendous trading losses and only about $11 million remained of the more than $81 million that investors put into the hedge funds., The complaint charged the Defendants with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

(CKK)</h2>, <h2>U.S. District Court Finds Robert Radano and Washington Investment Network Violated Federal Securities Laws; Court Orders Injunctions and Penalties</h2>]","[On September 22, 2005, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia found that Robert Radano and Washington Investment Network (WIN) committed fraud by failing to disclose to WINs clients that the Securities and Exchange Commission had barred Steven Bolla, the firms co-founder, from associating with an investment adviser.  The Court also found that Radano and WIN permitted Bolla to violate the SEC order barring Bolla.  The Court entered final judgments against Radano and WIN, both of Bethesda, Maryland, permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud and investment adviser bar provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers Act).  The judgment also imposes penalties of $15,000 against Radano and $50,000 against WIN., Following a bench trial, the Honorable Colleen Kollar-Kotelly held that Radano and WIN committed securities fraud by failing to disclose to the firms clients that, in June 2000, the SEC had barred Bolla from associating with any investment adviser based on his role in an earlier securities fraud.  See SEC v. James L. Foster et al., Litigation Release No. 16567 (May 30, 2000); In the Matter of James L. Foster et al., Securities Exchange Act Release No. 42863 (June 20, 2000).  Following the imposition of the bar, Bolla continued to associate with WIN by managing the firms finances, serving as the point of contact for WIN clients, and providing investment advice to WIN clients.  , Judge Kollar-Kotelly held that as a principal of WIN, Radano had a duty to inform the firms clients that the SEC had barred Bolla from acting as an investment adviser.  Radanos statements to WINs clients that Bolla was out of the office or had left the firm were, according to Judge Kollar-Kotelly, simply insufficient and -- without more -- constitute material omissions.  By failing to make the appropriate disclosures to WINs clients, Radano and WIN violated Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Advisers Act., Judge Kollar-Kotelly also ruled that Radano and WIN violated Section 203(f) of the Advisers Act by allowing Bolla to associate with WIN in violation of the SEC bar order.  , Judge Kollar-Kotelly found that, at the time they formed WIN in 1998, Radano and Bolla believed the SEC would likely bar Bolla from associating with any investment adviser.  Judge Kollar-Kotelly found that WIN was established as a front for Mr. Bolla to continue to operate with his wife as a mere nominee [owner] to officially mask his true interest and control.  , Judge Kollar-Kotelly further found that after the SEC had barred Bolla, Radano took instructions from Bolla regarding client accounts, permitted Bolla to remain a point of contact for WIN clients and allowed Bolla to continue concealing his association with the firm by using his wife as a nominee.  Judge Kollar-Kotelly held that Radanos actions and omissions, individually and on behalf of WIN, permitted Bolla to continue associating with WIN in violation of his bar., In addition to Radano and WIN, the SECs complaint charged Steven and Susan Bolla with various violations of the federal securities laws.  See SEC v. Steven M. Bolla, Washington Investment Network, Susan Bolla and Robert Radano, Litigation Release No. 17642 (July 31, 2002).  After filing the complaint, the SEC settled its charges against Steven and Susan Bolla, and Judge Kollar-Kotelly entered final judgments on July 27, 2004 permanently enjoining Steven and Susan Bolla from violating certain provisions of the federal securities laws, and requiring Steven Bolla to pay $175,000.

Lawler (Lawler), the former Director of Manufacturing at Penny Curtiss, the bakery manufacturing subsidiary of The Penn Traffic Company (Penn Traffic), with orchestrating and carrying out a scheme to fraudulently manipulate Penn Traffics books and records.   , The Complaint alleges that Lawler, as the highest-ranking Penny Curtiss employee, made, and directed Penny Curtiss employees to make, improper accounting adjustments to Penny Curtiss books and records so that Penny Curtiss would meet or come close to meeting internal sales targets set forth by management.  In the most significant of the falsified adjustments, Lawler made and directed his subordinates to make fraudulent entries on Penny Curtiss general ledger that overstated inventory.  Penny Curtiss general ledger was incorporated in Penn Traffics books and records and, as a result, its public financial statements.  By reducing the costs of goods sold, these false entries had the effect of overstating Penn Traffics Earnings Before Income, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA), as well as its net income.  As a result of Lawlers willful misconduct, Penn Traffic overstated more than $11 million of income and issued restated financial results for a three year period.   , The Commission alleges that, as a result of the foregoing, Lawler violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder, and aided and abetted Penn Traffics violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder., Lawler has agreed to a resolution of this matter, subject to the Courts approval.

Impath was a public company that provided laboratory services used in the treatment of cancer.  Impath filed for bankruptcy protection in September 2003 and is currently in liquidation.  The SECs complaint alleges that from 1999 until 2003, the defendants engaged in fraudulent accounting practices and committed other violations of the federal securities laws.  As a result of the accounting fraud, Impath falsely reported multimillion dollar profits when it had actually suffered huge losses.  To meet financial projections and boost Impaths stock price, the defendants made, or directed others to make, phony accounting entries that artificially increased revenue and improperly reduced operating expenses., Since the Commission filed its complaint in March 2005, the Honorable Jed S. Rakoff, United States District Judge for the Southern District of New York, has entered partial final consent judgments imposing a range of injunctive relief against the following defendants:, Each of these defendants consented to the foregoing relief without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions complaint.

The Commissions complaint also alleged that certain former senior officers and/or directors of Del participated in a multi-year financial fraud at Del between 1997 and 2000.  Michael consented to the entry of a final judgment against him without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint., On September 19, 2005, the Honorable Colleen McMahon, U.S. District Judge for the Southern District of New York, entered a final judgment permanently enjoining Michael from violating the books and records, internal controls, and lying-to-auditors provisions of the federal securities laws (Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) Section 13(b)(5) and Exchange Act Rules 13b2-1 and 13b2-2).  The final judgment also permanently bars Michael, pursuant to Exchange Act Section 21(d)(5), from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and requires him to pay a $20,000 civil money penalty.  , The Commissions complaint alleged, as to Michael, that near the end of Dels 2000 fiscal year, Dels CFO attempted to improperly capitalize certain general expenses to an unrelated Del acquisition of a subsidiary.  According to the Commissions complaint, when Dels auditors requested back-up documentation concerning these expenses as part of its final audit fieldwork, Dels CFO, with Michaels assistance, generated a confirmation letter falsely stating that Michael, a CPA, had performed accounting work directly related to the acquisition.  The complaint further alleged that Michael, who knew that the confirmation letter was false and suspected that Dels CFO might be engaged in wrongdoing, signed and returned the false confirmation letter.  Within days of Michael submitting the confirmation letter, according to the Commissions complaint, Dels outside auditors discovered the fraudulent accounting scheme and an internal investigation was initiated., In a prior action unrelated to Michaels conduct at Del Global, on April 14, 1999, the Commission permanently suspended Michael (and his accounting firm) from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant.  See Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Release No. 41284; Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release No. 1125., Michael was the last defendant in the Commissions litigation arising out of the Del financial fraud.

The United States Attorneys Office for the District of Massachusetts has also brought related criminal insider trading charges against Shengnan Wang and Hai Liu., According to the Commissions complaint, on May 4, 2004, just after the market closed, Rhode Island-based Citizens Financial Group, Inc., a subsidiary of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group, PLC, announced that it planned to acquire Charter One in a cash transaction for $44.50 per share.  Charter Ones stock closed at $35.95 per share that day (May 4), and closed at $43.86 per share on May 5, 2004, the first trading day after the announcement, a rise of $7.91 per share, or over 22%.  The Commissions complaint alleges that in late April and early May 2004, Shengnan Wang, then an employee of Citizens, learned that Citizens was performing final due diligence for the acquisition of a Cleveland, Ohio-based bank.  According to the complaint, Wang conveyed certain material, non-public information relating to Citizens planned acquisition to her husband, Hai Liu, and to Michael Tom, a former employee of Citizens who ran a hedge fund in which Wang and her husband had invested approximately $60,000.  , The complaint alleges that between April 29, 2004 and May 4, 2004, Michael Tom purchased numerous Charter One call options, which increase in value with a rise in the stock price, for his personal account and for his hedge fund, GTC Growth Fund.

(Jag Media), for making unregistered sales and transfers of securities of the company in violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act).  , The Commissions complaint alleges that a privately-held company, of which Valinoti was an officer, reverse merged with a publicly-traded shell company in March 1999 to become JagNotes.com (subsequently renamed Jag Media).  The complaint further alleges that an officer of the publicly-traded shell company arranged for 250,000 shares of the shell company to be sold to Valinoti in connection with the merger.  According to the complaint, the sale of 250,000 shares to Valinoti was not registered with the Commission, as required under Section 5 of the Securities Act.  , The Commissions complaint further alleges that Valinoti improperly realized $1.83 million by selling 130,000 of his 250,000 shares on the Nasdaq over-the-counter bulletin board (OTCBB) between March and April 1999.  The complaint also alleges that, between April and June 1999, Valinoti: (i) transferred 112,000 of his 250,000 shares as consideration for an ownership interest in another company; and (ii) transferred an additional 6000 shares to a public relations firm as compensation for services rendered to JagNotes.com.

In selling the notes, the Defendants made, and continue to make, materially misleading misrepresentations and omissions concerning investment risk and the nature of NJ Affordables business.

The Defendants failed to disclose to investors that they could not pay such high rates of return, are funding payments to existing investors by soliciting new investor money, and are generating fictitious revenue by selling their properties to insiders, investors, and affiliated entities.

Brown.  On June 21, 2002, the Commission filed accounting fraud charges in federal district court in the Middle District of Pennsylvania against Brown and two other former senior executives of Rite Aid, the nationwide drug store chain based in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.  On September 30, 2005, the Hon. Sylvia H. Rambo signed a final judgment, to which Brown consented without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint.  The Commissions case had been stayed pending the outcome of related criminal actions filed by the United States Attorney for the Middle District of Pennsylvania against Brown and others.  Brown, who was convicted in October 2003 of criminal charges involving his conduct while at Rite Aid, was sentenced in October 2004 to ten years in prison and ordered to pay a $20,000 fine.  , In its civil action, the Commission charged that Brown, Martin L. Grass, Rite Aids former chief executive officer, and Frank M. Bergonzi, Rite Aids former CFO, were responsible for one of the most egregious accounting frauds in recent history.  The Commission alleged that Brown and the others conducted a wide-ranging accounting fraud scheme that resulted in the significant inflation of Rite Aids net income in every quarter from May 1997 to May 1999. The Commission also charged Brown and Grass with concealing certain related party transactions that enriched Grass at shareholder expense, and charged Grass with fabricating Board committee minutes in order to support a lie he told in connection with obtaining a loan critical to keeping Rite Aid in business.  After the discovery of improper and unsubstantiated accounting transactions, in July and October 2000 Rite Aid restated cumulative pretax income by a massive $2.3 billion dollars and cumulative net income by $1.6 billion dollars.  Rite Aids restatement was, at the time, by far the largest financial restatement ever by a public company.  The Commissions subsequent investigation into the reasons for the restatement culminated in its charges against Brown and the others.          , The final judgment bars Brown from acting as an officer or director of a public company.  In addition, Brown is permanently enjoined from future violations of the antifraud, reporting, books and records, internal controls, proxy, and other provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, specifically Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder, and, as a controlling person pursuant to Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2), and 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 14a-9(a).  The judgment further provides that the Commissions claim for disgorgement of ill-gotten gains and prejudgment interest is waived due to Browns inability to pay, and no civil penalty is imposed in view of Browns personal financial condition.    , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19409.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

MURRAY, DEFENDANTS</u>, Civil Action File No. 05-CV-4643 (E.D.N.Y.).      , The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced the filing of a civil injunctive action against a Garden City, New York, registered broker-dealer, its Chief Executive Officer, and an unregistered former associate of the broker-dealer for engaging in a scheme to defraud multiple mutual fund companies in connection with market timing activities undertaken by certain of the broker-dealers customers.  The fraudulent scheme involved the use of multiple, cloned brokerage accounts to market time mutual funds that limited or otherwise restricted market timing.  Specifically, throughout at least 2003, the defendants masked the volume and frequency of their customers trading activity in mutual funds by placing their customers trades through multiple, cloned accounts.  These accounts, which in many instances bore branch office identifiers and registered representative codes that had nothing to do with any of the broker-dealers market timing customers, allowed the broker-dealers market timing customers to disguise their identities, elude the attention of the mutual funds so-called market timing police, and avoid having their further trading in those mutual funds halted or otherwise restricted., , Named in the Commissions complaint are:, <b>Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum, Inc.</b> (EKN), a registered broker-dealer and member firm of the NASD, which is located in Garden City, New York;, <b>Anthony Ottimo</b> (Ottimo), age 66, a resident of Plainview, New York, and EKNs Chief Executive Officer; and, <b>Brendan E. Murray</b> (Murray), age 43, a resident of Patchogue, New York, and, at all relevant times, an unregistered associate of EKN., The complaint alleges that the defendants scheme allowed EKNs market timing customers to place hundreds of market timing trades in at least nine mutual fund companies.  By use of the multiple accounts, with multiple branch office identifiers and multiple registered representative codes, defendants made it appear as if all the mutual fund orders being submitted by EKNs four market timing customers were coming from many different customers, trading through different EKN branch offices, and being assisted by numerous EKN registered representatives.  In fact, all four of these customers did business only through EKNs Garden City, New York office, and were assisted by only one EKN registered representative, Ottimo., By their conduct, the defendants allowed their market timing customers to extract millions of dollars from the mutual funds the customers market timed, and the defendants reaped at least $230,000 in commissions and fees as a result of the scheme., The complaint charges EKN, Ottimo, and Murray with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint further charges EKN with violations of Section 15(b)(7) of the Exchange Act, and Section 15(c)(1) of the Exchange Act and Rule 15b7-1 thereunder, and Ottimo and Murray with aiding and abetting these violations.

Specifically, beginning in May 2001 and continuing through December 2002, Swickle solicited investments in UCG through an unregistered offering of securities.  In connection with the offering, Swickle circulated private placement memoranda to prospective investors that contained material misrepresentations, and omitted material facts, about the identity of UCGs officers and directors, Swickles background, and UCGs and Swickles use of corporate funds.  In addition, Swickle made oral misrepresentations to potential investors about UCGs plans to conduct an initial public offering and about the price levels that UCG stock would achieve once it became publicly traded.  , Defendant UCG failed to respond to the Commissions complaint, and defendant Swickle failed to defend the action.

Parson, a former Andersen audit manager, and Brendon P. McDonald, a former Andersen experienced senior accountant, for fraud in connection with Andersens fiscal year 2000 audit of American Tissue, Inc., a manufacturer of tissue and paper products that filed for bankruptcy in 2001.  The Commission previously filed a separate federal civil action against American Tissue and three of its principal officers for fraud.  <i>SEC v. American Tissue, Inc., et al.</i>, Civil Action No. 03-1162 (E.D.N.Y., filed March 10, 2003), Litigation Release No. 18022, Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release No. 1735.  That action has been stayed pending sentencing of the three officers in a related criminal proceeding.  , Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Parson and McDonald have agreed to settlements with the Commission that impose injunctions, civil penalties, and suspensions from appearing or practicing before the Commission as accountants.  Gold has not reached a settlement with the Commission., The Commissions complaint alleges:, During its fiscal year 2000, American Tissue fraudulently inflated reported assets and earnings by improperly capitalizing $15.6 million of previously expensed supplies and overvaluing its finished goods inventory by at least $12.5 million.  Gold and Parson supervised, reviewed and approved Andersens audit of American Tissues fiscal year 2000 financial statements.  McDonald supervised and participated in the audit.  The defendants failed to request sufficient accounting documentation to verify the financial information provided by the company or to conduct required testing of American Tissues finished goods inventory figures.  Consequently, they knew or were reckless in not knowing that American Tissues finished goods inventory was overstated.  Nevertheless, they issued an unqualified audit report on the companys fiscal 2000 financial statements, failing to exercise the due professional care and skepticism required by generally accepted auditing standards.  All three defendants also knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that supplies that American Tissue used in its manufacturing processes had been improperly classified as inventory instead of as expenses., The Commissions complaint further alleges that, in July 2001, when the defendants learned their fiscal 2000 American Tissue audit had been selected for a peer review by another accounting firm, they intentionally altered audit work papers in an attempt to conceal the failures of their audit work.  In September 2001, when the defendants learned that another accounting firm had discovered that the company had overvalued inventory and would have to restate financial results for fiscal 2000, they destroyed documents and e-mails in a further attempt to conceal their audit failures., For all three defendants, the Commissions complaint seeks (1) permanent injunctions against violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and against aiding and abetting violations of Section 15(d) of that Act and Rules 12b-20 and 15d-1 thereunder and (2) civil money penalties., The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Office of the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York in this matter., <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19417.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Boyle, a former partner with KPMG LLP, agreed to settle the SECs charges against him in connection with his role as the relationship partner on the audits of Xerox Corp. from 1999 through 2000.  Boyle consented to the entry of a final judgment in the SECs civil litigation against him pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.  The final judgment, which is subject to approval by the Honorable Denise L. Cote, orders Boyle to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $100,000 and also orders that Boyle be permanently enjoined from violating the provision of the federal securities laws that requires reporting of likely illegal acts to a companys audit committee, its board of directors and ultimately to the Commission (Section 10A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). , Boyle also consented to the issuance of an SEC Order based on the entry of the injunction in the federal court action that will suspend him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an accountant for a period of one year.  Boyle consented to the entry of the injunction, penalty and SEC Order without admitting or denying the SECs findings. , As alleged in the SECs federal court complaint, in the course of serving as the relationship partner for Xerox during 1999 and 2000, Boyle was told by the audit engagement partner that Xerox was engaged in improper accounting and that KPMG had a professional obligation to communicate these concerns to the Xerox Audit Committee.  Despite these warnings, Boyle did not report these likely violations to the Xerox Audit Committee or take other steps required by Section 10A of the Exchange Act when Xerox management did not correct the violations.  Boyle retired from KPMG in 2003. , The SECs civil fraud injunctive action against four other KPMG audit partners involved in the 1997 - 2000 Xerox audits is ongoing.  See Litigation Release No. 17954 / January 29, 2003 /Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release No. 1709 / January 29, 2003; Litigation Release No. 18389 / October 3, 2003., Previously, on April 19, 2005, KPMG agreed to settle the SECs charges against it in connection with the audits of Xerox from 1997 through 2000. See Litigation Release No. 19191 / April 19, 2005/Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release No. 2235 / April 19, 2005. As part of that settlement, KPMG consented to the entry of a final judgment that required it to pay disgorgement of $9,800,000 (representing its audit fees for the 1997-2000 Xerox audits), prejudgment interest thereon in the amount of $2,675,000, and a $10,000,000 civil penalty, for a total payment of $22.475 million.  The final judgment also ordered KPMG to undertake a series of reforms designed to prevent future violations of the securities laws.  In addition, the SEC entered an Order finding that KPMG permitted Xerox to manipulate its accounting practices to close a $3 billion gap between actual operating results and results reported to the investing public from 1997 through 2000.  These undisclosed actions overstated Xeroxs true equipment revenues by at least $3 billion and overstated its true earnings by approximately $1.5 billion during the four-year period.  The Order found that throughout this period KPMG failed to comply with generally accepted auditing standards and allowed Xerox to utilize accounting actions that did not comply with generally accepted accounting principles.  By doing so, KPMG allowed Xerox to manipulate its accounting practices to distort the companys financial results, failed to insist that Xerox disclose those practices and their financial impacts in the companys annual and quarterly reports, and allowed Xerox to falsify its books and records and to fail to maintain adequate internal controls over its accounting.    , On April 11, 2002, the Commission brought an injunctive action against Xerox based on some of the same allegations of accounting fraud as are alleged against the KPMG defendants, as well as other allegations.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, Xerox consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoined the company from violating the antifraud, reporting and record keeping provisions of the federal securities laws.  Xerox also paid a $10 million civil penalty, agreed to restate its financial statements and agreed to hire a consultant to review the companys internal accounting controls and policies.  <i>Securities and Exchange Commission v.

See Litigation Release No. 17465 / April 11, 2002 / Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release No. 1542 / April 11, 2002., On June 5, 2003, the Commission also brought an injunctive action against six former senior executives of Xerox - Paul A. Allaire, G. Richard Thoman, Barry D. Romeril, Philip D. Fishbach, Daniel S. Marchibroda, and Gregory B. Tayler -- based on some of the same allegations of accounting fraud as are alleged against the KPMG defendants, as well as other allegations.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, each of these six former senior executives consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoined them from violating the antifraud, reporting and record keeping provisions of the federal securities laws.  Together, they paid over $22 million in penalties, disgorgement and interest.  That final judgment also barred Allaire, Thoman, Romeril and Fishbach from serving as officers and directors of public companies for certain periods - Allaire (5 years), Thoman (3 years), Romeril (permanently) and Fishbach (5 years).  In addition, Romeril and Tayler agreed to the entry by the Commission of an Order pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the Commissions Rules of Practice that suspends each of them from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an accountant.  This Order suspended Romeril permanently and suspended Tayler for three years with a right to apply for reinstatement after the three-year period.  <i>Securities and Exchange Commission v. Paul A.

Ware, a defendant in a $16.5 million offering fraud that the SEC halted in January 2004, was sentenced to incarceration for period of 14 years and seven months, followed by three years of supervised release, based upon his guilty plea to charges of mail fraud, money laundering and obstruction of justice brought by the United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of Florida (USAO).  In addition, the Court also ordered Ware to pay $11.6 million in restitution to victims of the scheme., Wares sentence was based on criminal charges arising primarily from the same misconduct that led to the SECs action.  According to an Information filed by the USAO, from approximately 2001 to January 2004, Ware, as president and chief investment officer of W.L. Ware Enterprises and Investments, Inc., doing business as Ware Enterprises and Investments, Inc. (Ware Enterprises), solicited investors to invest in Ware Enterprises Dreamkeeper Program.

The Commissions Complaint, filed in the Southern District of New York, alleges that Sihpol played a key role in enabling Canary Partners LLP (Canary), a hedge fund customer of BAS, to engage in late trading in shares of mutual funds sold by BAS and others.  Late trading refers to the practice of placing orders to buy or redeem mutual fund shares after the time as of which a mutual fund has calculated its net asset value (NAV) (usually as of the close of trading at 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time), but receiving the price based on the prior NAV already determined as of that day.  Sihpol enabled Canary to place orders to buy or redeem mutual fund shares that were received by and cleared through BAS until 6:30 p.m., but that received the price previously determined as of 4:00 p.m. that day (rather than the price determined as of 4:00 p.m. the next day).  In the process, Sihpol falsified, altered, destroyed, or evaded the creation of, books and records that BAS was required accurately to create, maintain and preserve.  , The Complaint charges Sihpol with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting and causing BASs violations of Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 17a-3 and 17a-4 thereunder, and seeks a final judgment ordering Sihpol to pay a civil monetary penalty.

The indictment alleged that Jung falsely represented his trading performance to prospective investors in the hedge fund, and that after investing, Jung misappropriated the investors assets to collateralize his own securities trading unrelated to the fund, and to pay for ETJ Partners expenses.  The indictment charged that Jungs fraudulent activities caused 55 investors to lose more than $21 million.  , In June of 2001, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil complaint against Jung and ETJ Partners in connection with the scheme described above, charging Jung and ETJ Partners with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.

Sacane (the founder and managing member or director of Durus and Durus N.A.); and J. Douglas Schmidt (the chief operating officer and chief compliance officer of Durus).  The Commissions complaint, filed in federal district court in Connecticut, charges the defendants for their involvement during 2002 and 2003 in fraudulent schemes concerning the purchase and sale of the common stock of two biotechnology companies:  Esperion Therapeutics, Inc. and Aksys Ltd.  Once the defendants schemes were exposed in July 2003, the complaint alleges that: Aksys closing stock price fell 43%, from $15.01 to $8.49, which resulted in lost market capitalization value of approximately $193,753,595; and, Esperions closing stock price fell 23.5%, from $19.88 to $15.20,  which resulted in lost market capitalization value of approximately $137,601,201.  , The Commissions complaint alleges that the defendants manipulated the price of both Esperion and Aksys stock by making regular and substantial purchases of both stocks through the hedge funds that they managed and concealing these purchases by failing to file various forms and schedules with the Commission as required by the federal securities laws and making false filings with the Commission.  According to the complaint, Sacane also made misrepresentations to officers of Esperion and Aksys about the stock purchases, made misrepresentations to Sacanes former employer about purported non-public information Sacane possessed about both companies in order to prevent the former employer from selling Aksys and Esperion stock.  The Complaint further alleges that Sacane and Durus later sold stock of both companies without disclosing their ownership position as required by the federal securities laws.  The Commissions complaint alleges that the defendants undisclosed purchases of Esperion and Aksys stock artificially inflated the price of both stocks by creating the appearance of a greater demand for the stocks than actually existed in the market.  According to the complaint, from November 2002 through July 2003, Esperions stock price more than tripled from $5.65 per share to approximately $20 per share, and Aksys stock price quadrupled from $3.65 per share to approximately $15 per share.

WHITTIER AND THE WOOD RIVER HEDGE FUNDS ALLEGING FRAUD</h2>, <h2>DEFENDANTS CONSENT TO PRELIMINARY RELIEF INCLUDING THE APPOINTMENT OF A RECEIVER FOR THE TWO HEDGE FUNDS</h2>]","[The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission today filed an emergency action against John H. Whittier, Wood River Capital Management, LLC, Wood River Associates, LLC, Wood River Partners, L.P and Wood River Partners Offshore, Ltd.  The SECs complaint alleges that the defendants repeatedly made material misrepresentations regarding the oversight and diversification of two hedge funds managed by Whittier--Wood River Partners, L.P. and Wood River Partners Offshore Ltd.  , The complaint alleges from February 2003 to the present, investors placed tens of millions of dollars in Wood River Partners, L.P. based on promises that the fund would be broadly diversified and closely watched by an auditor.  Instead, Whittier failed to have any audits conducted, allowed only a few employees to have access to the funds portfolio and proceeded to amass an extraordinary position in one small-cap stock.  By July 2005, that one security, the common stock of EndWave Corporation, accounted for more than sixty-five percent of Wood River Partners claimed $265 million assets under management.  This concentration in one stock vastly exceeded the ten percent cap on individual long positions set forth in the funds offering memoranda.  Wood River Partners purchased so many shares of EndWave stock that at one point the fund owned more than forty-five percent of that issuers outstanding shares.  But until last week, the Defendants never disclosed the size of their position in EndWave.  The Defendants filed neither the stock ownership reports that were required to be filed when the funds position exceeded five percent of the issuers outstanding shares, nor the reports required to be filed when the funds position exceeded 10 percent.  , During the summer of 2005, Whittier launched a new hedge fund-Wood River Partners Offshore.  By September, this fund also had an overwhelming concentration in EndWave.  Whittier made similar misrepresentations about the diversification of this new fund, and similarly failed to disclose that he had placed the majority of its assets into one small-cap stock.  , Since mid-July 2005, the price of EndWaves common stock has declined substantially.  As a result, the value of the assets held by Wood River Partners, L.P. and Wood River Partners Offshore, Ltd. has decreased significantly.  , The Commission alleged that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and the antifraud and ownership reporting provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act).  The complaint also charges Defendants Whittier, Wood River Associates, and Wood River Capital Management with violations of the antifraud provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  For permanent relief, the Commission requested injunctions against future violations, disgorgement, prejudgment interest and civil penalties as to all defendants.   , Simultaneous with the filing of the Commissions complaint, Defendant Whittier consented on behalf of himself and the Wood River entities to preliminary injunctions against future violations, an asset freeze as to the Wood River entities, an accounting and a partial asset freeze from Whittier, restraint from destruction of evidence, and the appointment of a receiver for the Wood River entities., The particular violations alleged in the complaint are, as to all defendants: Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. § 77q(a); Sections 10(b), 13(d), 16(a) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 78j(b), 78m(d), and 78p(a), and Rules 10b-5, 13d-1, 13d-2, 16a-2 and 16a-3, 17 C.F.R. §§ 240.10b-5, 240.13d-1, 240.13d-2, 240.16a-2, and 240.16a-3; and as to Defendants Wood River Capital Management, LLC, Wood River Associates, LLC and John Hunting Whittier Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, 15 U.S.C. § 80b-6(1) and (2).    , <img alt=* border=0 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif/><a href=/litigation/complaints/comp19428.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>, <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19428.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

In addition to the injunctive relief, the court ordered Desjardins to pay disgorgement, including prejudgment interest, of $3,057,466.27 and a civil penalty of $2,332,455.41.  Brouillette was ordered to pay disgorgement of $84,126.22, including prejudgment interest, and a penalty of $1,000,000; Jiwan was ordered to pay disgorgement of $130,374.96, including prejudgment interest, and a penalty of $440,000 and Koehn was ordered to pay disgorgement of $47,033.16, including prejudgment interest, and a penalty of $330,000.  On October 5, 2005, the court issued another final judgment against Alnoor Jiwan, Ronald D. Brouillette and Brian A. Koehn that included the same relief granted in the September 12, 2005, judgment as to each of the defendants and additionally enjoined Brouillette from violating the broker registration provisions of the federal securities laws.  , In its Complaint, the Commission alleged that Desjardins, Jiwan, Brouillette and Koehn, along with co-defendant, Robert S. Zaba, engaged in a fraudulent scheme to sell the stock of Pay Pop, Inc. (Pay Pop), a now defunct telecommunications company.  The scheme included creating purportedly free trading Pay Pop stock (i.e., legend-free stock certificates that created the false impression that the stock complied with U.S. registration requirements), issuing a series of materially false and misleading public statements and selling Pay Pop shares to unsuspecting investors., The Commissions Complaint alleged that purportedly free trading Pay Pop stock was secured through a series of bribes paid to Jiwan, who was a senior manager of Pay Pops transfer agent, CIBC Mellon Trust Company (CIBC Mellon). In exchange for the bribes, the Complaint alleged, CIBC Mellon issued Pay Pop stock certificates free of any restrictive legends, without requiring proof that the Pay Pop shares were subject to a registration statement filed with the Commission or exempt from such registration. The Complaint alleged that by the end of the fraudulent scheme, approximately 98 million Pay Pop shares were illegally issued and distributed to the public. , The Commissions Complaint also alleged that defendants Desjardins and Zaba made a series of material misrepresentations and omissions regarding Pay Pop to create continued demand for Pay Pop stock. As alleged in the Complaint, at Desjardins and Zabas direction, Pay Pop issued a series of press releases that falsely reported multi-million dollar investment bank financings that did not exist, the purchase and sale of valuable Caribbean beach resort property that never occurred, the growth in Pay Pops client base and revenue in the face of business decline, the signing of material contracts that never existed, and the successful expansion into new business territories that were either never pursued or recently abandoned. As further alleged in the Complaint, Koehn, who was not an accountant, created fictitious audited financial statements that grossly inflated Pay Pops assets. , The Complaint alleged that Brouillette sold Pay Pop stock for the benefit of Desjardins and Zaba. According to the Complaint, Brouillette did this through, among other things, trading of Pay Pop stock through a series of nominee accounts, systematic unauthorized trading in his customers accounts and knowingly making various false and misleading statements to his customers about Pay Pops business prospects. After being terminated by his brokerage firm and being barred from acting as a registered representative by NASD, the Complaint alleged that Brouillette continued to act as an unregistered securities broker., As a result of the scheme, the Complaint alleged that Zaba and Desjardins made over $3 million from the sale of Pay Pop stock.  , The court permanently enjoined Desjardins, Jiwan, Brouillette and Koehn from violating Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Garian allegedly falsely told investors that he would use their money to purchase various securities for their accounts; had an inside line to upcoming hot IPOs, particularly for Internet and other technology-related companies; and could deliver large profits quickly.  Garian and NIE furthered their scheme by sending investors false monthly account statements that represented that NIE was purchasing large volumes of IPO shares and other securities on their behalf and making large profits from Garians trading activities.   In actuality, the indictment alleges, NIE did not own the type and quantity of securities that were identified on the investors account statements. Rather, Garian fraudulently misappropriated investor funds for his own personal use and to pay the operating expenses of NIE.  The indictment further alleges that when NIE collapsed in 2001, investors lost approximately $5 million., On February 7, 2003, the Commission filed a complaint against Garian and NIE based upon the same fraudulent scheme that is the subject of the current indictment.  Garian and NIE had targeted members of Glendales large Armenian-American community, many of whom had never invested in the stock market.

Moses of securities fraud and perjury.  <i>U.S v. Timothy C. Moses</i>, Case No. 1:04-CRT-508-CAP (N.D.Ga.) Moses is the former Chairman, CEO and President of International BioChemical Industries, Inc. (IBCL), a publicly-held biotechnology company based in Norcross, Georgia that, prior to its bankruptcy in 2004, manufactured and sold antimicrobial products used as disinfectants.  , The Commission previously sued Moses and IBCL, and suspended trading in IBCLs stock, in February 2003, after Moses issued a series of press releases that falsely suggested that the federal government was interested in buying IBCLs anthrax remediation product.  In truth, the FBI had contacted IBCL solely for investigative reasons, trying to ascertain whether IBCL or any of its personnel had access to anthrax spores or whether the company could benefit commercially from future anthrax contaminations.  Moses press releases led to a sharp increase in IBCLs stock price, with over 118 million shares being traded over the six days following the first press release, causing approximately $2.2 million of investor losses.  .During this time, Moses dumped approximately 1 million of his IBCL shares., In the Commissions lawsuit, the Court entered consent orders on February 21, 2003 that permanently enjoined IBCL and Moses from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and required Moses to disgorge his ill-gotten gains.  The Commission referred the case to the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Northern District of Georgia for possible criminal prosecution after Moses perjured himself in his deposition.  Specifically, Moses testified that he was unaware that the sales of his IBCL shares had occurred, claiming that he had given his broker discretion to sell those shares. , Related Litigation Releases:, No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17971.htm>17971</a> / February 6, 2003<br/>No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17991.htm>17991</a> /  February 21, 2003, <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19446.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Kraemer, et al.,</i> (United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island, C. A. No. 01-CV-358 ML).</h2>, <h2>FEDERAL COURT ISSUES JUDGMENT IN MANGANESE MINE STOCK FRAUD CASE.</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that, on October 12, 2005, the Honorable Mary M. Lisi of the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island entered a Final Judgment of Permanent Injunction and Other Relief (final judgment) against Robin L. Sampson.  The final judgment, entered by consent, enjoins Sampson from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and bars him from participating in any offering of penny stock.  In addition, the final judgment requires Sampson to pay $15,000 in disgorgement plus $10,492 in prejudgment interest.  The Court further ordered that payment of the disgorgement obligation plus prejudgment interest thereon would be waived and that no civil monetary penalty would be imposed against Sampson based on representations made in his Statement of Financial Condition., On July 30, 2001, the Commission filed a complaint alleging that, between January 1997 and March 2000, Sampson, along with William E. Kraemer, Donald E. McCourt and George T. Helm, Jr., engaged in a $240,000 fraudulent offering scheme.  According to the Commissions complaint, Kraemer, McCourt, Helm and Sampson defrauded 14 investors out of approximately $240,000 by inducing them to invest in Prexomet Corp., a now defunct Smithfield, Rhode Island-based corporation.  The complaint alleged that, beginning in January 1997, the defendants told prospective investors that Prexomet owned a valuable Arizona manganese mine and offered them an opportunity to purchase Prexomet stock at $1 per share.  The complaint further alleged that the defendants also told the investors that Prexomet would soon go public through an initial public offering (IPO) and that they would earn a 400% return on their investments within several months.  According to the complaint, these statements were false because neither Prexomet, nor any of the defendants, ever owned a mine and none of the defendants ever took any step to conduct an IPO or expended any funds for that purpose.  Instead, the complaint asserted, the defendants diverted most of the funds they raised for their personal benefit.  The Commission further alleged that, once some of the investors began raising questions about their investments, the defendants began making false lulling statements, from as early as April 1997 and continuing through at least March 2000, about how the investors would soon receive their promised 400% returns.  According to the complaint, none of the investors ever received back any portion of the funds raised by the defendants., The Commissions case against defendant Kraemer was resolved through the September 18, 2002 entry of a default judgment that enjoined him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and that required him to pay $192,163 in disgorgement, $87,082 in prejudgment interest and a $192,163 civil penalty.  In a related administrative proceeding, on April 10, 2003, ALJ Brenda P. Murray issued an order, by default, barring Kraemer from participating in any offering of penny stock., The Commissions case against defendant McCourt was resolved through the December 1, 2004 entry of a judgment, by consent, that enjoined him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, that barred him from participating in any offering of penny stock, and that required him to pay $9,430 in disgorgement, $5,272 in prejudgment interest and a $25,000 civil penalty.  , The Commissions case against defendant Helm was resolved through the August 1, 2001 entry of a judgment, by consent, that enjoined him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and that required him to pay a $20,000 civil penalty.  In a related administrative proceeding, on September 28, 2001, the Commission issued an order, by consent, barring Helm from participation in any offering of penny stock and barring him from association with any broker or dealer with the right to reapply for association after three years., For further information, see Lit.

Stapleton, a former stockbroker and retired U.S. Army Sergeant.  The Commissions complaint, originally filed on October 1, 2004, alleged that, while he was working as a stockbroker in Germany, Stapleton fraudulently misappropriated at least $253,252 from three U.S.-citizen investor victims working in the U.S. Department of Defense community there, and sent the funds to an account he controlled in Springfield, Illinois.  , On October 21, 2005, the Hon. Jeanne E. Scott, United States District Judge for the Central District of Illinois, entered a Judgment of Permanent Injuction and Other Relief against Stapleton that (i) permanently enjoins him from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; (ii) orders him to fully cooperate in asset discovery; and (iii) provides that the amount of civil penalties, disgorgement and prejudgment interest will be determined by the Court at a subsequent hearing, during which the allegations of the Complaint will be accepted as and deemed true by the Court.  Stapleton consented to the entry of the Judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions Complaint., Also today, based upon the entry of the injunction, the Commission instituted and simultaneously settled an administrative proceeding pursuant to Section 15(b)(6) of the Exchange Act.  Stapleton consented, without admitting or denying the Commissions factual findings, to an order barring him from association with any broker or dealer.  , At a hearing held in a related criminal proceeding on October 14, 2005, also before Judge Scott, Stapleton was sentenced to a term of 28 months in prison based on his conviction for mail fraud arising from the same underlying conduct alleged in the Commissions complaint.  (Stapleton had entered a guilty plea to the mail fraud charge on June 9, 2005.)  Judge Scott also ordered Stapleton to pay criminal restitution totaling $262,101 to the three victims of the fraud.    , The Commissions complaint alleged that Stapletons victims included an active-duty U.S. Army Sergeant, a U.S. Defense Department civilian schoolteacher and a civilian employee of a U.S. defense contractor, all of whom resided in Germany.  The complaint alleged that Stapleton was associated with Nalico Equity Corporation, which is a U.S.-registered broker-dealer having offices in Texas and in Europe, at the time of his offending conduct.  The complaint further alleged that, in each instance, after persuading the victim to give him funds for investment, Stapleton invested only a portion of the funds as instructed, misappropriating the rest.  Stapleton, the complaint further charged, supplied phony account statements to two of his three victims for several years thereafter to conceal his theft.  Finally, the complaint alleged that Stapleton fled Germany in August 2001 when questions were raised concerning funds that appeared to be missing from his automobile insurance business; and that Stapleton subsequently resided in El Paso, Texas and worked at an automobile dealership there.

(Ardent Domestic) and Ardent Research Partners, Ltd. (Ardent Offshore) (collectively, the Ardent Funds).  The Commissions previously-named defendants are Northshore Asset Management, LLC (Northshore), Saldutti Capital Management, L.P. (SCM), Kevin Kelley (Kelley), Robert Wildeman (Wildeman), Glenn Sherman (Sherman), and the Ardent Funds., On February 16, 2005, the Commission filed <u>SEC v.

Consequently, the Ardent Funds became illiquid and were unable to meet investor redemption requests.  The First Amended Complaint adds securities fraud claims against Saldutti, the Ardent Funds founder and investment adviser, and Ballew, Northshores former CFO., The First Amended Complaint alleges that Saldutti made material misrepresentations and omissions to Ardent Funds investors regarding both Northshores relationship to the Ardent Funds and Salduttis transfers of tens of millions of dollars of Ardent Funds cash to Northshore and Northshore-related entities.  The First Amended Complaint further alleges that Northshore CFO Ballew participated in the fraudulent scheme concocted by the previously-named defendants.  In addition, the First Amended Complaint alleges a new offering fraud claim against Sherman, one of the originally-named defendants., The First Amended Complaint charges all defendants with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The First Amended Complaint also charges that Northshore, SCM, and Saldutti violated Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Advisers Act, or, in the alternative, that Saldutti aided and abetted Northshore and SCMs  violations of those provisions.  Finally, the First Amended Complaint charges Sherman and Saldutti with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933. , On February 25, 2005 and March 10, 2005, the Court granted the Commissions motion for a preliminary injunction enjoining all previously-named defendants from violating the federal securities laws, freezing their assets (subject to certain limited exceptions), and appointing a receiver for defendants Northshore, SCM, and the Ardent Funds. , The Commission expresses its appreciation to the United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York for its assistance in the investigation of this matter., <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19449.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The Commission alleges that the defendants fraudulently stole the confidential information from the website of Business Wire, a leading commercial disseminator of news releases and regulatory filings for companies and groups throughout the world, and since January 2005 have made at least $7.8 million in illegal profits., Acting on the Commissions request for emergency relief, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York today issued a temporary restraining order which, among other things, freezes the defendants assets and orders the repatriation of funds taken out of the United States., The Commissions complaint alleges that, in June 2004, Lohmus became a client of Business Wire for the sole purpose of gaining access to Business Wires secure client website.  Once defendants had access, they surreptitiously utilized a software program, a so-called spider program, which provided unauthorized access to confidential information contained in impending nonpublic press releases of other Business Wire clients, including the expected time of issuance., The complaint further alleges that the information fraudulently stolen by the defendants has allowed them to strategically time their trades around the public release of news involving, among other things, mergers, earnings, and regulatory actions.  Using several U.S. brokerage accounts, the defendants have bought long or sold short the stocks of the companies whose confidential press release information they have stolen, and purchased options to increase their profits., Named in the Commissions complaint are the following defendants:, Lohmus Haavel &amp; Viisemann, headquartered in Tallinn, Estonia, is an investment bank established in 1999.  Lohmus, which also has offices in Latvia and Lithuania, provides corporate financing, private equity, asset management, investment services, and structured financing services to the Eastern European market., Oliver Peek, age 24, is a citizen of Estonia currently residing in Tallinn.  Peek is employed by Lohmus and works for its investment services team., Kristjan Lepik, age 28, is a citizen of Estonia currently residing in Tallinn.  Lepik is a partner at Lohmus., As a result of the defendants conduct, the Commission alleges that the defendants violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The indictment charged that from December 2000 to February 2001, Yoder raised approximately $637,603 from investors in All the Way to the Top, a so-called loan program in which he promised guaranteed monthly returns of 40 to 50 percent.  According to the indictment, Yoder told investors that their investment was safe and risk-free and misrepresented the use of investor funds.  Contrary to his representations, Yoder spent a significant portion of investor funds on personal expenses, including a Mercedes SUV and a motorcycle.  Investors received neither the interest that was promised them, nor did they recover their principal investment.  If convicted on all counts, Yoder could receive a maximum penalty of 55 years in prison and fines of $2,225,000.  Yoder, age 28, resides in Goshen, Indiana., The criminal charges against Yoder come just six months after the Commission obtained a final judgment of permanent injunction and order of disgorgement of ill-gotten gains and civil penalties totaling $504,991.70 in its civil lawsuit against Yoder.

All of the individuals charged, Brian Crowley, Robert Henuset, Ritchie Langfield, Frank Lysiak, Ernie Rosenberg, Dale Schulz, and Larry Stone, were employees of or agents for vendors that supplied U.S. Foodservice., The Commissions complaints allege that U.S. Foodservice personnel contacted vendors and urged them to sign and return the false confirmation letters.  In some cases U.S. Foodservice pressured the vendors; in other cases they provided side letters to the vendors assuring the vendors that they did not owe U.S. Foodservice the amounts reflected as outstanding in the confirmation letters.  The letters clearly stated that the confirmations were being used in connection with the annual audit and the letters directed the defendants to return the confirmations directly to the companys auditors.  , Each of the individuals aided and abetted the fraud by signing and sending to the companys independent auditors confirmation letters that they knew materially overstated the amounts of promotional allowance income paid or owed to U.S. Foodservice.  The amounts overstated in the confirmations were often inflated by millions of dollars and by more than 100%., All seven have each agreed to settle the Commissions action, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, by consenting to permanent injunctions and payment of a $25,000 penalty.  Also today, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York announced criminal charges in this matter against all seven individuals for conspiracy to falsify books and records.  , The complaints allege that U.S. Foodservice engaged in a scheme to report earnings equal to or greater than its targets, regardless of the companys true performance.  U.S. Foodservice inflated its promotional allowance income by at least $700 million for fiscal years 2001 and 2002 and thereby caused Ahold to report materially false operating and net income for these periods.  The annual audit confirmation process at U.S. Foodservice was systematically corrupted to help keep the fraud from being discovered., On January 13, 2005, the SEC filed enforcement actions against nine other individuals alleging they aided and abetted the same financial fraud by signing and returning materially false audit confirmations.

ZILLI FOR ACCOUNTING FRAUD</h2>, <h2>ZILLI SETTLES AND CONSENTS TO PERMANENT FRAUD INJUNCTION, PERMANENT OFFICER AND DIRECTOR BAR, AND PAYMENT OF OVER $144,000</h2>]","[Today the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a settled enforcement action against David G. Zilli, the former Chief Financial Officer of Bon Secours Cottage Health Services (Cottage Health), for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  Cottage Health is a subsidiary of a Maryland-based non-profit hospital and healthcare company called Bon Secours Health System, Inc. (Bon Secours) which issues corporate bonds, in part through public offerings.  The Commission alleged in its complaint that, during Bon Secours fiscal years 1998 through 2003, Zilli engaged in an extensive scheme of fraudulent accounting practices that created the false appearance of steady earnings growth at Cottage Health.  According to the complaint, Zillis fraud was accomplished through bogus manual journal entries that overstated the value of numerous assets and the operating income of Cottage Health and understated its liabilities.  As a result of Zillis fraudulent scheme, Bon Secours financial statements were cumulatively misstated by an aggregate amount of $117 million during the period between 1998 and 2003.  In February 2004, Bon Secours restated its 2002 consolidated financial statements to correct the impact of Zillis fraudulent accounting over the relevant periods.  , As alleged in the complaint, Zilli was the Vice President-Finance and CFO of Cottage Health from September 1998 through June 2003.  During that time, Zilli supervised Cottage Healths accounting department and was responsible for the creation of the financial statements of the subsidiary.  On a periodic basis, Zilli generated Cottage Healths financial statements and forwarded them to the finance department of Bon Secours where they were consolidated with those of the other subsidiaries to create Bon Secours annual consolidated financial statements.  Bon Secours included the consolidated financial statements in various public bond offerings that it made to investors.  , According to the complaint, from 1998 through 2003, the accounting department prepared preliminary financial statements for Cottage Health and forwarded them to Zilli for review.  Zilli, on numerous occasions, independently devised complex adjusting manual journal entries to the preliminary statements, lacking any support or accounting basis.  The accounting department then finalized the monthly reports for Cottage Health after making the adjustments that Zilli had instructed the accounting personnel to make.  The Commission alleges that the adjustments made by Zilli artificially and fraudulently boosted Cottage Healths income in each period.  As alleged, Zilli created the fraudulent journal entries to derive the specific income amount that he wanted to book for the particular period in order to ensure that Cottage Healths reported performance figures met its financial targets.  The complaint further alleges that Zillis fraudulent accounting resulted in the overstatement of three general categories of Bon Secours assets:  accounts receivable, fixed assets and inventory.  According to the complaint, Zillis misstatements materially inflated Bon Secours increase in unrestricted net assets, the equivalent of net income for a non-profit enterprise, by approximately the following amounts:  (a) $20.1 million or 75% in fiscal year 2000; (b) $15.4 million or 31% in fiscal year 2001; and (c) $17.9 million or 270% in fiscal year 2002.  The complaint further alleges that the misstatements overstated Bon Secours income from operations by approximately the following amounts:  (a) $22.9 million or 106% in fiscal year 2000; (b) $20.6 million or 51% in fiscal year 2001; and (c) $21.9 million or 42% in fiscal year 2002.  , Zilli, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, consented to the entry of the final judgment which permanently enjoins him from violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In addition to the injunctive relief, under the terms of the final judgment, Zilli will pay $144,513 in disgorgement.  Based on Zillis Sworn Statement of Financial Condition and other documentation, the Commission did not seek a penalty.  The disgorgement amount shall be deemed satisfied upon his payment of that same amount in criminal restitution against Zilli in a parallel criminal action also filed today in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland.  In the event that Zilli is ordered to pay an amount less than $144,513 in criminal restitution, the disgorgement amount that Zilli has agreed to pay in settling the Commissions complaint is equal to $144,513, less the amount of criminal restitution.  Under the terms of the final judgment, Zilli also will be barred permanently from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  Zillis settlement with the Commission is subject to court approval., The Commission acknowledges the assistance in its investigation by the United States Attorneys Office for the District of Maryland and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service., <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19455.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

In total, Fuks and Ben-Yehuda will pay $2,770,687 to settle the Commissions case against them.  , The Commission originally filed insider trading charges against Fuks and Ben-Yehuda on March 9, 2005 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and filed an amended complaint today.  In its amended complaint, the Commission charges that on the evening of December 26, 2001, ImClones then CEO Samuel D. Waksal privately learned in advance of any official notice or public announcement that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) would reject consideration of ImClones application to approve its primary product, a cancer treatment called Erbitux.  On December 27, Waksal tipped Ben-Yehuda, who then passed the news onto Fuks.  That same day, before this news became public and while in possession of this material, non-public information, Ben-Yehuda sold over $73,000 and Fuks sold over $5 million of ImClone stock.  ImClone received written notification of the FDAs decision in the afternoon on December 28, and publicly announced the FDAs decision in a press release at about 6:00 p.m. that day.  This news prompted ImClones stock price to drop 16%, from $55.25 to $46.46, by the close of the next trading day, December 31.

The Commissions first amended complaint (the complaint) alleged that since at least 1994, Presto has been operating as an unregistered investment company in violation of Section 7(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the Investment Company Act).  The complaint sought an order requiring National Presto to either register with the Commission as an investment company or in the alternative, to restructure its securities holdings or take such other steps such that National Presto shall come into compliance with the Investment Company Act.  The complaint also sought an order of permanent injunction enjoining National Presto from offering, selling or purchasing securities or engaging in any business in interstate commerce while in violation of Section 7 of the Investment Company Act.  , Judge Norgle granted the Commissions motion for summary judgment and denied National Prestos cross motion for summary judgment.  Judge Norgle ruled that National Presto was an investment company within the meaning of Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act and that no statutory exemption applied to National Presto.  Judge Norgle found that investment securities as a percentage of National Prestos total assets ranged from approximately 61% to 92% during the relevant time period and that National Presto was not primarily engaged in a business other than investing.  Accordingly, National Presto was an investment company during the relevant time period and should have been registered with the Commission as an investment company and complied with the provisions of the Investment Company Act.

Luciano consented to the Final Judgment without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions complaint, except as to jurisdiction.  , In the civil injunctive action, filed by the Commission on September 15, 2003, the Commission alleged that from 1999 until March 2003, Luciano and his former co-defendants engaged in a scheme to defraud investors through the offer and sale of interests in two unregistered hedge funds.  The complaint alleged that, as part of the scheme, the defendants promised to put investors money into day-trading funds supposedly making from 20% to 120% annually, when in fact, the defendants were misappropriating a large portion of the funds for their personal use and to repay investors who demanded their money.  The complaint further alleged that the defendants concealed their scheme by creating and distributing fictitious monthly account statements and other documents which reported false balances and false profits.  The complaint alleged that, of $4.5 million invested by over 100 investors, the defendants invested only $1.5 million, $685,800 of which was lost through trading.  Under the Final Judgment, Luciano is permanently enjoined from violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  , The Commission also announced today that on October 17, 2005, the Commission issued an Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Section 203(f) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (the Order).

In addition, the Complaint alleges that Conway altered documents to cover-up his misrepresentations.  , According to the Complaint, in an October 26, 2005 consented-to tape-recorded conversation with a partner of Groundswell Partners, Conway admitted that he lost a large amount of money in the Fund and, in an effort to make up the loss, deviated from the Funds original investment strategy without notifying investors.  The Complaint also alleges that Conway admitted in the tape-recorded conversation that, in an effort to conceal the loss, he altered Fund-related documents, including financial statements, profit and loss spreadsheets and account statements sent to investors.  The Complaint also alleges that Conway admitted in the tape-recorded conversation that the altered account statements falsely inflated the amount of assets in the investors accounts.  According to the Complaint, Conway admitted in the tape-recorded conversation that, although the altered Fund-related documents indicate that the Fund should have approximately $43 million in assets, the Funds true value is currently only approximately $14 million.

TheCommission alleged in its complaint that the defendants falsely promised members of theCambodian immigrant community guaranteed monthly returns that would pass on to futuregenerations.  The complaint alleged that the defendants emphasized their shared Cambodianheritage with their victims, and written solicitation documents drew a parallel between investing inWMDS and fulfilling the American dream, stating that WMDS urges you to sign up now or youwill miss your best chance of fulfilling your American dream.  In fact, according to the complaint,the defendants were operating a fraudulent pyramid scheme and ceased making the promisedmonthly payments recently., According to the Commissions complaint, Seng Tan, Christian Rochon and James Bunchan andthe two Massachusetts corporations which they controlled, WMDS, Inc., and One Universe Online,Inc. (also known as 1UOL) operated a scheme that raised at least several million dollars fromhundreds of investors, mainly members of the Cambodian immigrant community.  Tan and Rochonare residents of Massachusetts.  Bunchan is a resident of Florida.  The Commissions complaintalleged that, for an investment in WMDS of approximately $26,000, Tan and WMDS promisedinvestors that the corporations would make an initial lump sum payment to them of approximately$2,400, and thereafter would pay the investor $300 per month for life, a monthly payment thatwould then purportedly pass on to the investors children.  Investors were told that their monthlypayments would increase if they invested more money or if they recruited additional investors.  Infact, according to the complaint, the defendants ceased making the promised monthly payments inapproximately June 2005., The Commission alleged in its complaint that the defendants violated anti-fraud provisions of thefederal securities laws, specifically Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) ofthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Commission also alleged thatthe defendants violated the registration provisions of the securities laws, namely Sections 5(a) and5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933.  In response to the Commissions request for emergency relief,the Honorable Reginald C. Lindsay, United States District Judge for the District of Massachusetts,issued a temporary restraining order prohibiting the defendants from directly or indirectlycontinuing to violate the federal securities laws, and froze most of the defendants assets.

Conn.)      , The Securities and Exchange Commission filed an enforcement action on November 15, 2005, charging six individuals and four companies with securities fraud and other violations in connection with a scheme to pump and dump the stock of PacketPort.com, a company based in Norwalk, Connecticut.  The SEC alleges that three PacketPort.com officials and two stock touters, aided and abetted by a registered representative, executed the pump and dump, which obtained more than $9 million in illicit proceeds., The Complaint alleges that Ronald Durando, a 48-year-old resident of Nutley, New Jersey, privately acquired a majority stake in an insolvent public company, then called Linkon.  His stake in Linkon consisted of restricted shares.  With the help of his colleagues, Gustave Dotoli, a 70-year-old resident of Nutley, New Jersey, and attorney Robert H. Jaffe, a 69-year-old resident of Mountainside, New Jersey, Durando took control of Linkon and changed its name to PacketPort.com.  Durando became president and CEO, and Jaffe and Dotoli became directors.  Durando, Jaffe, and Dotoli laundered restrictive legends from Durandos share certificates so that the restricted shares could be passed off to the public as free trading.  Durando then paid IP Equity, Inc., a private California corporation that operated an Internet-based stock newsletter, and its principals, M. Christopher Agarwal and Theodore Kunzog, to publish false publicity and bogus recommendations about PacketPort.com in order to pump up the stock price.  The share price more than quadrupled following the false publicity, rising from about $4.75 to a high of about $19.50., The Complaint alleges that Durando, Dotoli, Jaffe, and IP Equity dumped PacketPort.com shares into the pumped-up market in an unregistered distribution, obtaining more than $9 million in illicit proceeds.   Registered representative William Coons III was Durandos and IP Equitys broker and was the principal outlet for the fraudulent sales., The Complaint alleges that Durando, Dotoli, and Jaffe concealed the fraud and their short swing profits by, among other acts, failing to make required disclosures and selling through nominees.  They failed to file required forms reflecting changes in ownership, including forms that would have revealed their short-swing profits.  They also caused PacketPort.com to file quarterly and annual reports that contained false financial information and that failed to report  the insiders beneficial ownership or past failures to report beneficial ownership., The Complaint also names as defendants two corporations that Durando controlled and used in executing the fraud.  Durando used his wholly-owned company, PacketPort, Inc. to acquire stock and transfer shares to other defendants.  Durando used Microphase, Inc., of which he is COO, as his nominee in the illegal sales.  By selling through Microphase, Durando concealed the fact that he, PacketPorts CEO and majority shareholder, was dumping stock., The Complaint alleges that all defendants violated the registration provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1993 (Securities Act); that all defendants except Coons directly violated the antifraud provisions of Securities Act Section 17(a) and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act (Exchange Act); that  Durando, Jaffe, Dotoli, Agarwal, Kunzog, and Coons aided and abetted direct violations of the Exchange Act antifraud provisions; that Agarwal, Kunzog, and IP Equity violated the antitouting provision of Section 17(b) of the Securities Act; that Durando, Jaffe, Dotoli, and PacketPort, Inc. violated the disclosure provisions of Securities Act Section 16(a) and Rule 16a-3; and that Durando, Jaffe, Dotoli, PacketPort.com, and PacketPort, Inc. violated and/or aided and abetted the violations of various reporting, disclosure, and books and records provisions of Securities Act Section 13 and associated rules., <img alt=* border=0 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif/><a href=/litigation/complaints/comp19465.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>, <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19465.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Franklin and Samuel Wolanyk liable for securities fraud.  The SEC had charged Franklin, Wolanyk, Dieter Raabe, and four entity defendants under their control, with operating a pump and dump scheme beginning in 1997 and continuing into 1998 that produced more than $4 million in profits.  The SECs complaint, filed January 14, 2002, alleged that Franklin set up an internet website, Red Hot Stocks, to tout stocks that he would acquire cheaply (through private offerings, open market purchases and consulting fees).  According to the complaint, Franklin then sold those shares after their price increased following overly optimistic and misleading profiles on the companies which appeared on the Red Hot Stocks website.  The SECs complaint alleged that Wolanyk operated Red Hot Stocks, authored and distributed the profiles and also owned and sold some of the stocks that were touted.  , After a three-week trial presided over by U.S. District Judge Dana M. Sabraw, the jury found that Franklin violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder with respect to seven stocks and Wolanyk violated these provisions with respect to 13 stocks.  The jury also found that Franklin and Wolanyk violated the antitouting provision of Section 17(b) of the Securities Act.  The jury further found Franklin liable for violations of the registration provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act, and as a control person of two of the entity defendants.    , Previously, on November 13, 2002, a final judgment of permanent injunction was entered against Raabe, who consented to the injunction, without admitting or denying the SECs allegations.  The court will determine the amount of Raabes disgorgement and any civil money penalty following the resolution of the SECs action against Franklin and Wolanyk.  On March 13, 2003, a final default judgment was entered against one of the entity defendants, Vector Keel Ltd.  On June 20, 2003, final default judgments were entered against the other three entity defendants, Avalon Trust, Initial Public Offering Consultants, Inc. and Net Income.

Cummings of the Northern District of Texas, Lubbock Division, entered orders freezing the assets of, and granting other relief against, Jonathan Dwane Jody Nelson, age 36, the former chief financial officer of Snyder, Texas-based Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc.  Patterson-UTI, whose common stock trades on the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol PTEN, is the second-largest owner of land-based drilling rigs in North America.  Nelson had abruptly resigned from the company on November 3, 2005, citing unspecified personal reasons., In its emergency lawsuit, the SEC alleged that Nelson, who resides in Dallas, Texas, orchestrated a massive phony-invoice scheme to embezzle more than $69 million from Patterson-UTI over five years.  The SEC also named as relief defendants five Nelson-controlled companies alleged to have received proceeds from the scheme:  XIT Land &amp; Energy, Inc. (XIT), Chisum Travel Center, Ltd., Z8 Properties, Ltd., Three Stars Aviation, LLC, and Chisum Coach, Ltd., The SECs complaint alleges that Nelson created false invoices that caused Patterson-UTI to pay millions of dollars to XIT, a company he secretly controlled that was not a legitimate Patterson-UTI vendor.  To accomplish his scheme, Nelson circumvented Patterson-UTI internal controls by, among other things, forging another company officials initials on payment documents.  According to the complaint, Nelson finally confessed to Patterson-UTI on November 9 that he embezzled approximately $29 million, but company records show that he actually stole $69,434,342 from January 2001 through October 2005.  To hide his scheme, Nelson, among other things, made false written representations to Patterson-UTIs independent auditor about the accuracy of the companys financial statements and signed false public certifications attesting to the truthfulness of the companys quarterly and annual SEC reports., As the complaint alleges, Nelson transferred the embezzled funds from an XIT bank account to other entities he controlled, including Chisum Travel, Z8 Properties, Three Stars Aviation and Chisum Coach.  The SEC contends that Nelson used these funds to purchase an airplane, an airfield, a cattle ranch, homes, vehicles and a full-service truck stop, among other things.  The SEC named XIT and these other entities as relief defendants solely to secure equitable relief to prevent them from dissipating or hiding the fruits of Nelsons wrongdoing. , The SECs complaint alleges violations of the antifraud, proxy-solicitation, record-keeping, reporting, internal controls, lying-to-accountants and report-certification provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically:  Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), 13(b)(5), and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-14, 13b2-1, 13b2-2, and 14a-9 thereunder.  The courts order immediately freezes the assets of and appoints a receiver over Nelson and the relief defendants, and requires Nelson and the relief defendants to account for all proceeds stolen from Patterson-UTI, prohibits the destruction of documents and expedites discovery.  In addition, the SEC seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions against Nelson, as well as disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, civil penalties and a bar against him ever serving as an officer or director of another public company.

Johnson, formerly a senior research analyst and managing director of Robertson Stephens Inc., a now-defunct broker-dealer, liable on four counts of securities fraud.  The Commission had charged Johnson with failing to disclose in research reports that he wrote and in media statements that he made regarding two public companies that he a substantial financial interest in impending mergers that the companies had announced.  The Commission also had charged Johnson with having issued false and misleading Buy recommendations in 2001 for another public company that were inconsistent with his privately-held belief., The Commission presented evidence that in 1999 and 2000 Johnson provided positive research coverage on Redback Networks, Inc., and Sycamore Networks, Inc., after they had announced proposed mergers with private companies.  Johnson praised both mergers in his research reports and media statements, but failed to disclose his serious conflicts of interest.  Specifically, in both cases, he owned stock in the private companies that would be exchanged for public company shares if the mergers were completed, creating multimillion-dollar windfalls for Johnson. In issuing his research reports and making public statements concerning the proposed mergers, Johnson never disclosed his personal holdings in the private companies or the magnitude of his financial interest in the outcome of the mergers., The Commission also presented evidence that, in January 2001, Johnson spoke privately about Corvis Corporation, another company that he covered, to a Robertson Stephens committee that was responsible for making investment decisions for a group of partnerships in which Johnson and other senior Robertson Stephens executives were investors.  The Commission presented evidence that, in response to a question, Johnson told the committee that he would not buy Corvis stock at the prevailing market price, but would buy it at approximately half of that price.  Johnsons statements to the committee directly contradicted his existing Buy recommendation on Corvis.  In addition, the day after he made his private recommendation to the committee, Johnson sold nearly all of his Corvis stock.  Two days after his stock sale, Johnson issued another research report reiterating his buy recommendation on Corvis, but failed to disclose that he had sold his Corvis stock two days earlier. Three days after he issued that report. Johnson sold his remaining shares of Corvis stock., After a two week trial, presided over by U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan, the jury found that Johnson had violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, which are general antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.

The Commissions Complaint, filed in the case on December 19, 2001, alleged that Save the World Air, Inc. (STWA), Muller, and Billy Blackwelder (Blackwelder), the companys marketing consultant, engaged in a fraudulent scheme to manipulate the market for stock in STWA, a public company controlled by Muller.  Muller, who is an Australian citizen and resident, served as the president and CEO of STWA during the relevant time period. , The Court found that, beginning in February 1999, Muller carried out a fraudulent worldwide promotional campaign to disseminate false and materially misleading information about STWAs product, the Zero Emission Fuel Saver Device (ZEFS Device), a device Muller claimed would reduce toxic exhaust emissions and improve fuel economy in motor vehicles.  Among other things, the Court found that Muller made materially false claims about the testing, compatibility, and marketing of the ZEFS Device.  At the same time, Muller privately sold millions of shares of restricted STWA stock at substantial profits to himself.  The Court further found that Muller misrepresented a purported licensing deal and caused STWA to falsely record and report revenues of $125,000 in connection with that deal.  Also, Muller failed to report his sales of company stock in required filings with the Commission.   , The Court held that Muller violated the antifraud and reporting provisions of the federal securities laws and ordered him permanently enjoined from future violations, barred for twenty years from serving as a director or officer of a public company, and liable for $7.5 million in illicit gains (plus prejudgment interest) and $100,000 in civil penalties.  The Court also ordered the disgorgement of any STWA stock currently owned by Muller and directed STWA to cancel any issued and outstanding shares of STWA stock currently owned by Muller.   , Previously, on June 27, 2002, the Court entered a final judgment against STWA, which consented to a permanent injunction against violating the antifraud and reporting provisions of the securities laws.

(ATGF) and Amerindo Technology Growth Fund II, Inc. (ATGF II).  , The Commission filed its initial complaint on June 1, 2005 against Vilar, Tanaka and Amerindo US alleging that they defrauded a client, L.C., by misappropriating funds she invested in the Amerindo Venture Fund LP, a limited partnership that was purportedly being organized to qualify and be operated as a Small Business Investment Company.  , The amended complaint expands upon these allegations and includes allegations against the following additional defendants:, The amended complaint alleges that Amerindo US, Amerindo UK and Amerindo Panama (collectively, Amerindo), Vilar, Tanaka and other affiliated entities, including Techno Raquia, defrauded individuals and entities who invested in GFRDAs.  Vilar and Tanaka, as well as other Amerindo employees, solicited clients to invest funds in GFRDAs, a product in which Amerindo guaranteed that investors would earn a fixed rate of return per year on their investment, and would receive their principal at maturity.  Amerindo represented to investors that it would invest the majority of their funds in short-term debt instruments and invest the remaining portion of their funds in equities.  After individuals and entities invested funds in the GFRDAs, however, Vilar, Tanaka and Amerindo failed to invest the funds in accordance with the representations to investors.  Rather, Vilar and Tanaka largely invested in equity securities, such as emerging technology and biotechnology stocks.  Moreover, especially during the post-2000 bear market, these equity investments did not perform well and Amerindo was often unable to pay GFRDA investors their promised returns, or to return investors principal at maturity.  Consequently, when investors sought to redeem their GFRDAs, Amerindo generally either refused to honor redemption requests, or redeemed the GFRDAs with other investors funds taken from unrelated brokerage accounts in, for example, the name of AMI, ATGF and/or ATGF II., Additionally, the amended complaint alleges that Vilar, Tanaka and Amerindo defrauded investors who invested in two offshore hedge funds, ATGF and ATGF II.  According to offering circulars, ATGF and ATGF II planned to invest in emerging growth companies.  Rather than using investor funds solely to invest in such companies securities, however, Tanaka directed ATGF and ATGF II to transfer investor funds from the funds brokerage accounts to other accounts for Vilars and Tanakas own business and personal benefit.  , The Commissions amended complaint alleges that, based on the foregoing, Amerindo US, Amerindo Panama, Amerindo UK, Vilar, and Tanaka violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In addition, the amended complaint alleges that AMI, Techno Raquia, ATGF and ATGF II aided and abetted violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The amended complaint further alleges that Amerindo US, Amerindo Panama and Amerindo UK violated, and Vilar, Tanaka, AMI, ATGF, ATGF II, and Techno Raquia aided and abetted violations of, Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

In fact, according to the Commissions complaint, Allixon failed to comply with any of the requirements of Rule 504 that would permit the issuance of unrestricted shares.  Silver Lake and Crescendo then transferred the shares into the name of Temple Securities, and Knipe and Temple Securities began selling the shares into the United States in August 2005.  The sales began on August 29, 2005.

Hochfeld and his wholly-owned management company, Hochfeld Capital Management, LLC (HCM).  The complaint alleges that Hochfeld committed violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  Hochfelds misconduct occurred while he was a research analyst at First Montauk Securities Corp. (First Montauk), a registered broker-dealer.  In his capacity as a research analyst, Hochfeld followed companies in the enterprise software sector and regularly authored research reports which were distributed to First Montauks institutional customers., The complaint alleges that Hochfelds violations resulted from his directed trading of securities in contradiction to advice he gave in his research reports, a fraudulent conduct that is commonly referred to as scalping.  According to the complaint, at the same time he was an analyst for First Montauk, Hochfeld also managed and directed trading for a private hedge fund called Hepplewhite Fund L.P. (Hepplewhite) through HCM.  The complaint alleges that between March 27, 2003 and December 15, 2003, Hochfelds research reports failed to disclose that Hepplewhite maintained positions in the stocks that were the subjects of Hochfelds research reports.  The complaint further alleges that the reports failed to disclose that on numerous occasions, Hochfeld caused trades to be made in the subject stocks immediately after the issuance of the reports, contrary to the information or recommendations in the reports., The complaint alleges that, as a result of the foregoing, Hochfeld and HCM violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, Hochfeld and HCM have consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws.

The final judgment enjoined Franklin from violating the anti-fraud and broker-dealer registration provisions of the federal securities laws, and ordered Franklin to disgorge $214,310.34 (including prejudgment interest).  Franklin consented to entry of the final judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint.   In addition, the Commission entered an order on November 29, 2005, upon Franklin’s consent, permanently barring him from association with a broker-dealer or investment adviser., The judgment ends the Commission’s litigation against Black and Franklin, who were accused of defrauding dozens of their athlete-clients, most of whom were professional football players.  , The Commissions complaint, filed in February 2000, alleged that Black and Franklin acted as investment advisers and unregistered broker-dealers, made materially false or misleading statements and omissions to clients concerning the purchase and sale of securities, and misappropriated or diverted client funds for non-investment purposes<b><i>.   </i></b>The complaint alleged that both men, among other things, advised clients to invest in high-yield promissory notes that purportedly funded a car title loan company.  In reality, these notes were part of a Cayman Islands-based Ponzi scheme.  The complaint further alleged Black and Franklin skimmed some of clients’ supposed profits for themselves.  The Commissions complaint charged Black and Franklin with multiple violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933; Sections 10(b), 15(a), and 15(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rules 10b-5 and 15c1-2 thereunder. , Black and Franklin were convicted on criminal charges stemming from the same underlying conduct that formed the basis for the Commission’s civil complaint.  Franklin pleaded guilty and was sentenced in July 2002 to serve 54 months in prison and ordered to pay $5.8 million in restitution.

Houston-based ISVG is a non-reporting public company whose common stock trades on the Pink Sheets and is purportedly in the business of providing global positioning system and navigational technologies for commercial transportation application.  The SEC sued ISVG and Rowton for violating the antifraud and securities registration provisions of federal securities laws, and Loev for violating the securities registration provisions.  , Loev has agreed to settle the SEC’s suit by consenting to the entry of an order permanently enjoining him from violating the securities registration provisions, ordering him to disgorge $25,785.50, plus interest, and imposing a $25,000 civil penalty.  The order also prohibits Loev from, a) issuing any legal opinions that the securities of any issuer are exempt from the securities registration provisions of the federal securities laws pursuant to Rule 504 of Regulation D, and 2) accepting securities of any issuer whose securities are quoted on the Pink Sheets in consideration for legal or consulting services rendered., The SEC’s complaint alleges that during 2003, ISVG and Rowton engaged in a “pump and dump” scheme in which millions of unregistered ISVG shares were sold into an inflated market created by a series of false and misleading press releases, promotional “fax blasts” and spam email.  According to the complaint, these promotional materials contained unfounded revenue projections and materially false and misleading information regarding purported acquisitions of, and agreements with, third parties, and the company’s status as a reporting company with the Commission.  It is alleged that ISVG and Rowton realized over $70,000 in unjust profits from the scheme. , According to the complaint, Loev, a Houston securities attorney, issued several letters to ISVGs transfer agent opining that ISVG’s securities offering was exempt from registration under SEC Rule 504 and certain Texas rules and that over 25 million ISVG shares, representing virtually the entire public float, could be issued without a restrictive legend.  Loev also received approximately 5 million shares in the unregistered ISVG offering in payment of attorney and consulting fees, and sold certain of these shares in the open market for approximately $25,000 in net proceeds.  , The SEC’s complaint alleges that ISVG and Rowton violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Mass)      , The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it obtained preliminary injunctive relief against all five defendants in an emergency enforcement action filed by the Commission on November 15, 2005 in federal district court in Massachusetts.  On November 23, 2005, the Honorable Reginald C. Lindsay, United States District Judge for the District of Massachusetts, entered an order granting preliminary injunctions, asset freezes, and other relief against James Bunchan, Christian Rochon, WMDS, Inc. and One Universe Online, Inc.  On December 2, 2005, Judge Lindsay entered an order granting a preliminary injunction, an asset freeze, and other relief against the remaining individual defendant, Seng Tan., The Commission alleged in its complaint that the defendants operated a fraudulent investment scheme in which they falsely promised members of the Cambodian immigrant community guaranteed monthly returns that would pass on to future generations.  The complaint alleged that the defendants emphasized their shared Cambodian heritage with their victims, and written solicitation documents drew a parallel between investing in WMDS and fulfilling the American dream, stating that WMDS urges you to sign up now or you will miss your best chance of fulfilling your American dream.  In fact, according to the complaint, the defendants were operating a fraudulent pyramid scheme and ceased making the promised monthly payments recently.  According to the Commissions complaint, the defendants operated a scheme that raised at least several million dollars from hundreds of investors, mainly members of the Cambodian immigrant community.  In papers filed in support of the preliminary injunctions the Commission informed the Court that (a) fifty-eight alleged victims have been identified and interviewed by the Commission thus far; (b) records seized from the defendants indicate that at least 300-400 people invested in WMDS; (c) the total amount of money invested by the fifty-eight alleged victims identified to date exceeds $8.8 million; (d) the net losses suffered by those fifty-eight alleged victims exceeds $5.6 million; and (e) the amounts of monies invested by other potential victims, and the losses suffered by them, have not yet been quantified.  The Commission alleged in its complaint that the defendants violated anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Commission also alleged that the defendants violated the registration provisions of the securities laws, namely Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933., In addition to the civil complaint filed against them by the Commission, all three individual defendants have been arrested by federal criminal authorities in connection with the scheme described above.  The arrests were made pursuant to a criminal complaint and  arrest warrant obtained by the Office of the United States Attorney for the District of Massachusetts.  The arrest warrants were executed by special agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  Defendants Tan and Bunchan have been ordered detained pending trial in the criminal matter by United States Magistrate Judges in Boston, Massachusetts and Miami, Florida, respectively.  Defendant Rochon was released pending trial after a bail hearing in which a Magistrate Judge imposed various conditions on an unsecured bond., For further information, see Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr19464.htm>19464</a>  (November 16, 2005), <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19483.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Herula and Watch Hill Capital Management LLC, both defendants in a fraud action filed by the Commission on July 31, 2002.  The Commission alleged in its complaint that Herula, Watch Hill and others participated in a fraudulent offering of securities that raised at least $40 million from investors in July 2002.  In the consent judgments, the Honorable Jeffrey S. White permanently enjoined Herula and Watch Hill from future violations of certain antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  In addition, on November 30, 2005, the Commission dismissed its action as to Relief Defendant Mary Lee Capalbo., The Commission alleged in its complaint that Herula is the registered agent and manager of Watch Hill.  According to the Commissions complaint, Watch Hill and others, aided and abetted by Herula, falsely promised investors exorbitant returns, such as a 100% return per week, through a fraudulent prime bank trading program.  The complaint further alleged that, in the span of several weeks in July 2002, Herula and others spent at least $4 million in investor funds on personal and luxury items such as cars, jewelry, and large hotel bills., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, Herula and Watch Hill consented to the final judgments entered by the Court.  The judgment as to Herula permanently enjoined him from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1940 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The judgment as to Watch Hill permanently enjoined it from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the final judgment as to Herula, in a related criminal action arising from the conduct in this matter (United States v. Dennis S. Herula, Case Number 02-CR-485-02-RB (D. Colo.)), he was ordered on February 11, 2005 to pay full restitution in the amount of $3,945,189.07 to the victims of his fraud and to be incarcerated for 188 months.  In addition, the Court in the Commissions action had previously entered judgments by default against two other defendants, Claude Lefebvre and RMO Assets Management SA, in which they were ordered to pay a total of almost $6 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  The Court also returned directly to investors over $13 million that was frozen by the Court when the Commission first filed its action.  Lefebvre is now in prison serving a 20 year sentence after being convicted of related criminal charges in December 2004., In addition, on November 30, 2005, the Commission entered into a stipulation of dismissal with Relief Defendant Capalbo, thereby dismissing the Commissions claim as to her., For further information, please see Litigation Rel.

(CKP).  On December 2, 2005, the Court entered a final judgment by consent against CKP.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions March 24, 2004 Complaint charging CKP with filing an annual report and an amended annual report containing materially false and misleading financial statements in May 2003, CKP and Kushner have agreed to settle all charges asserted by the Commission.  See Litigation Release No. 18638 (March 25, 2004).  CKP consented to issuance of an order imposing a fraud injunction and requiring certain remedial undertakings, and Kushner consented to issuance of an order imposing a fraud injunction and a $60,000 civil penalty, and permanently barring him from serving as an officer or director of a public company., As alleged in the SECs Complaint, on May 20, 2003, CKP filed a Form 10-KSB for the year ended December 31, 2002, which falsely represented that two separate audit firms had issued unqualified reports approving the firms financial statements.  In fact, the audit was not yet complete, and neither auditor had yet issued a report or consented to the filing of the Form 10-KSB.  The Complaint alleges further that the financial statements misstated, among other things, the companys total assets by over 100%, but that Kushner executed the certification required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act that they fairly presented the companys financial condition.  On May 23, 2003, the company filed an amended Form 10-KSB which disclosed that the auditors had not consented to the May 20 filing, but, the Complaint alleges, the audit was still not complete as of May 23 and the financial statements which accompanied that filing were also materially false and misleading.  Further, according to the Complaint, the company failed to devise and maintain internal controls sufficient to ensure that transactions were recorded accurately., CKP, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions Complaint, consented to entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it from violating Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20 and 13a-1 thereunder; and ordering it to implement certain remedial undertakings.  The remedial undertakings include appointment of new Chief Executive and Financial Officers, creation of an independent audit committee and majority independent board of directors, and retention of an independent consultant to analyze the companys internal accounting controls, recommend improvements and oversee implementation of those improvements.  These undertakings represent an unusual departure from the Commissions policy of limited intrusion into corporate governance, but were required by the unique facts of this case:  the companys current two person board of directors consists of its Chairman, President and CEO Kushner who will now be barred from serving as an officer or director of any public company, and its Principal Financial and Accounting Officer James DiLorenzo who is a defendant litigating similar charges of fraud brought by the Commission.  Further, Kushner and DiLorenzo collectively are beneficial owners of 45% of the companys outstanding voting shares., Kushner, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions Complaint, consented to entry of a final judgment:  (1) permanently enjoining him from violating Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5 and 13a-14 (the Sarbanes-Oxley certification provision), aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 thereunder, and controlling others in the commission of the aforementioned violations; (2) ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $60,000; and (3) permanently barring him from serving as an officer or director of a public company., <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19485.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

In September 2005, Goodman plead guilty to an eleven count indictment charging him with three counts of investment adviser fraud, three counts of securities fraud, and five counts of wire fraud that was being prosecuted by the United States Attorneys Office in Boston, Massachusetts.   In addition to the term of incarceration, Goodman was ordered to pay restitution of $800,000 and sentenced to two years supervised release., At the September 2005 plea hearing, the prosecutor told the court that between February and August 2000, Goodman obtained and then misappropriated $700,000 from two investors through two fraudulent investment schemes offered through his investment advisory business, New England Capital Advisory Group, LLC. Goodman defrauded a third investor out of $100,000, which conduct was not charged in the indictment but did form part of the basis of the restitution order. , The criminal indictment followed the Commissions civil case against Goodman related to the same events.

Victims were told that they would acquire an ownership interest in an internet based technological company.  According to the indictment, Nathanson first claimed that the private internet company was about to conduct an initial public offering, but later told investors that the company had instead elected to pursue merger negotiations with a large, unnamed publicly-held company.  Nathanson claimed that he could not disclose the identity of the private internet company due to the existence of a confidentiality agreement., The indictment further alleges that Nathanson, rather than investing in a private internet company, used investor monies to finance the unprofitable business operations of Nathansons golf companies, Giant Golf Company and Play Big Enterprises, Inc.  The indictment also alleges that Nathanson used investor funds to pay for extravagant personal expenses, including gambling expenses, and the payment for three houses located in Orange County, California., The criminal indictment followed the Commissions civil case against Nathanson.

Additionally, the Final Judgment imposes a $120,000 civil penalty against Smith, and permanent injunctions against Smith, Continental and Scioto.  The final judgment also requires relief defendants BSA and BSIB to disgorge funds that Continental and Scioto had improperly transferred to them.  Previously, on September 27, 2005, the court had granted summary judgment in favor of the SEC on the issue of liability, finding Defendants liable for fraud., The Commission commenced this lawsuit on August 10, 2004, alleging that from July 2002 until August 2004, Smith raised approximately $2.1 million through private securities offerings for two companies that he founded and controlled: Continental and Scioto.  The SEC alleged that Smith and the companies told investors, both orally and in offering and marketing materials provided to investors, that most of the money raised would be used to buy stock in small community banks.  Instead, most of the money was spent for other purposes, including to pay expenses for Smiths other businesses, as well as Smiths own personal expenses, including his personal credit card charges, house payments and a car purchase., In its September 27, 2005 summary judgment ruling, the Court found that Smith, Continental and Scioto made material misrepresentations to investors concerning the use of proceeds from the offerings, in violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In addition to his direct liability, Smith was also held liable for the violations of the Exchange Act by Continental and Scioto as a control person under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act., In its Final Judgment, the Court ordered Defendants Continental and Scioto to disgorge the total amount of investor funds that they had fraudulently raised from their private offerings, plus prejudgment interest. Specifically, Continental was ordered to pay $1,409,149 and Scioto was ordered to pay $885,048.  The Court held Smith jointly and severally liable for the entire amounts of disgorgement and interest owed by Continental and Scioto, pursuant to Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, which requires control persons to be held jointly and severally liable for the liability of the persons or entities they control.  The Court additionally ordered Smith to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $120,000.  The Court also entered permanent injunctions against all three defendants prohibiting future violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws set forth at Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Court also ordered relief defendants BSA and BSIB, two other entities controlled by Smith, to disgorge all amounts that had improperly been transferred to them by Smith from of the proceeds of the Continental and Scioto offerings.  BSA was ordered to pay a total of $679,009 and BSIB was ordered to pay $313,012, which amounts include prejudgment interest., The Commission thanks the Ohio Department of Commerce, Division of Securities for its assistance in this matter., <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19490.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Walker signed the Order of Final Judgment against Defendant Stanley R.

The Courts Final Judgment follows the Order entered on October 31, 2005, granting the Securities and Exchange Commissions request for disgorgement and civil penalties, and granting in part the Commissions request for an injunction, based on Medleys liability for selling securities to the public in unregistered transactions.  As the Court found earlier this year, Medley was liable for unregistered sales of securities he received as payment for his role in so-called reverse mergers and the ensuing public distributions of the securities of three issuers, M&amp;A West, Inc., Virtual Lender.Com, Inc. and Digital Bridge, Inc.  , In determining in its October 31, 2005 Order that Medley should pay second-tier civil penalties, the Court found that Medley had used shell companies he had established and another individuals name to shield his own involvement in the illegal securities transactions.  The Court further found that civil penalties would make Medley think twice before pursuing a questionable business practice and may deter others from similarly breaking the law.  The Court also relied upon this evidence of Medleys purposeful conduct, as well as his repeated violations, in determining to enter a five-year injunction against Medley. , The Commission continues to litigate its case against the other defendants., Related Litigation Releases Nos. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17118.htm>17118</a> and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr19233.htm>19233</a>, <!--Link to complaint--><!--<img src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif border=0 alt=*>  <a  href=/litigation/complaints/comp19464.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>-->, <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19481.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Midkiff of Forest Lake, Minnesota and his entity, Joshua Tree Group LLC (Joshua Tree), charging that the defendants are engaged in an ongoing fraudulent high yield investment scheme by which they raised approximately $36 million since July 2004.  The Court granted a temporary restraining order, asset freeze and other emergency relief against defendants Correll, TC&amp;Co., Net Worth Group. Thompson, TNT, Johnson, Gowdey, Midkiff and Joshua Tree., In its complaint, the Commission alleges that the defendants are offering and selling interests in purported foreign and international bank deposit programs (collectively Bank Deposit programs) promising four to 12 percent monthly returns without risk to their investment principal.  The Commission also alleges that investors send or wire their money to TNT or to one of Corrells entities -- Net Worth Group or TC&amp;Co, and that all of the funds are then transferred to a Horizon Establishment bank account controlled by Correll.  According to the complaint, investors are told that Correll, the money manager, forwards investor funds to Cardno, who deposits them in an offshore reserve account; Cardno, identified as the trader, with exclusive contracts with international banks, supposedly uses the monies in the reserve account to participate in trading programs and loan programs.  In reality, according to the complaint, the Bank Deposit program does not exist and none of the investors funds are sent to Cardno, his entities or to any offshore account for investment.  Instead, as set forth in the complaint, all of the investor funds are commingled among various Correll-controlled accounts, and the investment returns paid to investors are Ponzi payments, i.e., they derive from the proceeds of more recent investors., The Commission also names in its complaint, as relief defendants, Banner Shield, LLC, Hospitality Management Group, Inc., Creative Wealth Ventures, LLC and JTA Enterprises based on their alleged improper receipt of investor funds.

Nuvo has since filed for bankruptcy., According to the complaint, Schmidt told investors their investments would finance particular new Nuvo locations, when in reality Schmidt spent the money to prop up the failing business, pay executives (including $680,000 to himself), and pay preexisting investors to maintain an illusion of profitability.  Schmidt also provided investors with false income statements showing the retail locations to be substantially more profitable than they actually were., The complaint further alleges that Nuvo’s former Chief Operating Officer Norman Valine, 39, of Las Vegas, Nevada, and a Nuvo co-owner Gary Gelnette, 51, of Concord, California, raised money from new investors even after suspecting that Schmidt may have embezzled funds and falsified financial records.  Specifically, the complaint alleges that in late 2004, Gelnette, a former pastor, helped raise $1.35 million from a former parishioner, while Valine reaped $138,000 in commissions by selling Nuvo interests to four additional investors., The Commission’s complaint alleges that Schmidt, Gelnette and Valine violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The complaint alleges that:, Heil and Jenkins each have agreed to settle the complaint by consenting, on a neither admit nor deny basis, to the entry of an injunction based on the anti-fraud, books and records, internal controls and electronic signature provisions of the federal securities laws.

Action No. 4:05-MC-043-Y/Northern District of Texas (Fort Worth Division)      		  , On December 14, 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed an action in Fort Worth federal district court to enforce subpoenas issued to attorneys David Chesnoff and Chaka Henry of the Las Vegas firm Goodman &amp; Chesnoff, P.C.  The Commission alleges that Henry, on behalf of Goodman firm client Doyle Brunson, prepared and delivered an unsolicited offer to buy WPT Enterprises, Inc., the publicly traded owner of the World Poker Tour, at a high premium over its then-market value.  Shortly thereafter, the Commission contends, a public relations firm Brunson hired, and a website he endorses, announced the offer publicly.  The Commission asserts that publication of this offer, widely covered in the media, triggered a steep rise in WPTs stock price on record trading volume., As the Commission alleges, however, the Goodman firm and Brunson immediately stopped responding to WPTs requests for information about the offer.  Instead, shortly after delivering the offer, the Goodman firm, at Chesnoffs instruction, abruptly withdrew from the engagement.  When WPT publicly disclosed Brunson and his law firms unresponsiveness, its stock price sharply declined, costing investors tens of millions of dollars in lost market value.  Brunsons offer eventually expired by its terms., The Commission is formally investigating whether Brunsons offer and its publication violated federal securities laws, including the antifraud provisions of Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  As part of its investigation, the Commissions staff subpoenaed documents and testimony from Chesnoff and Henry.  However, Brunson, who has invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and declined to testify in the investigation, directed the Goodman attorneys to withhold certain documents and not to testify on critical aspects of the offer, under the attorney-client privilege and work product doctrine.  The Commissions subpoena enforcement action seeks to set aside these privileges on various legal grounds, including the crime-fraud exception, and to compel Chesnoff and Henry to provide the requested documents and testimony.

Peffer of Newburyport, Massachusetts, a defendant in a civil injunctive action filed by the Commission on November 4, 2003.  The Commission alleged that Peffer, a former registered representative of broker-dealer Prudential Securities, Inc., committed fraud in connection with his market timing trades in dozens of mutual funds.  The final judgment enjoined Peffer from future violations of the federal securities laws and ordered him to pay over $50,000 in disgorgement and post-judgment interest., The Commission filed its complaint against Peffer, four other former Prudential Securities registered representatives, and their former branch manager, on November 4, 2003, and amended its complaint on July 14, 2004.  The amended complaint alleged that Peffer was part of a two-person group of registered representatives, known as the Peffer Group, that defrauded mutual fund companies and the funds shareholders by placing thousands of market timing trades worth more than $300 million for two customers from at least January 2001 through September 2003.  According to the amended complaint, Peffer knew that the mutual fund companies monitored and attempted to restrict excessive trading in their mutual funds.  The amended complaint alleged that, to evade those restrictions when placing market timing trades, Peffer Group members disguised their own identities by establishing multiple broker identification numbers and disguised their customers identities by opening numerous customer accounts for what were, in reality, only two customers., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions amended complaint, Peffer consented to the judgment entered by the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, which permanently enjoins him from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The judgment holds Peffer liable for $408,904 in disgorgement and $39,384 in pre-judgment interest, but waives payment of all but $50,000 of that amount plus post-judgment interest of $1,734.41 and does not impose a civil monetary penalty based on Peffers sworn representations of his financial condition.

The Commission alleges that from approximately April 2001 to the present, David Lund, age 32, of Huntington Beach, California, and his companies, Investors Guild, Inc. and Investors First Financial Services, Inc., raised $10.7 million mainly from elderly and retired individuals by selling them ownership interests in three California entities-Credit First Fund, LP, Credit First, LLC, and Credit First Income Plus, LLC (collectively Credit First).  Lund, Investors Guild, Investors First Financial Services, and Credit First currently operate from the same location in Anaheim Hills, California, and are named defendants in the Commissions action., According to the Commissions complaint filed yesterday in federal district court, the defendants represented to investors that they would use the investor funds to purchase distressed debt, which Credit First would collect on or resell at a profit.  The defendants also represented that Credit First would pay the investors a monthly return of one to three percent on their investment from Credit Firsts operations.  The Commission alleges that, in reality, Credit First was not profitable and that Lund was, in fact, operating a Ponzi scheme-using new investor monies to pay the promised returns to existing investors-in violation of the federal securities laws.  The complaint further alleges that the defendants have profited from this scheme by receiving various fees totaling approximately $1.5 million paid out of the investor funds.  Finally, the complaint alleges that the defendants engaged in an unlawful unregistered securities offering by selling Credit Firsts securities to at least 233 investors nationwide through general solicitations., Acting on the Commissions lawsuit, the Honorable Dale S. Fischer, United States District Judge for the Central District of California, granted the Commissions application for a temporary restraining order against the defendants and issued orders freezing the defendants assets, prohibiting the destruction of documents by the defendants, and granting expedited discovery.  The Court also appointed Thomas F. Lennon, Inc. as the temporary receiver over the assets of Credit First, Investors Guild, and Investors First Financial.  The Court ordered the temporary restraining order and asset freeze to remain in effect until December 23, 2005, on which date the Court will hold a hearing on the Commissions motion for a preliminary injunction and appointment of a permanent receiver at 3:00 p. m.

The subpoenas sought documents and testimony from Zinn, Tanika, and Dynamic regarding, among other things, whether certain individuals and entities associated with a Shell Creation Group manipulated or attempted to manipulate the share price of certain shell companies.  To date, the investigation has revealed, in part, that certain members of the Shell Creation Group assisted in the financing and promotion of several companies, including National Storm Management, Inc.

These companies, which trade on the over-the-counter market, have been the recent subjects of widespread fax blasts and spam emails touting the value of their securities in the wake of Hurricane Katrina., The Commissions application alleges that Zinn, Tanika, and Dynamic have not complied with the subpoenas issued by the Commission.  In its application, the Commission argues, among other things, that Zinn, Tanika, and Dynamic have no valid basis for their failure to comply., This is the second subpoena enforcement proceeding arising out of this investigation.

In the complaint, the Commission alleges that Herwitz purchased Sirius stock on September 30, 2004, after learning in confidence from his Mahoney Cohen colleague, who is Stern’s longtime accountant, that Stern had received an offer from Sirius and that the parties were negotiating.  The Commission alleges that Stanyer purchased Sirius stock on October 5, 2004, after learning in confidence from a senior Sirius executive that Sirius had signed an agreement with Stern.  Finally, the Commission alleges that, based on this conduct, Herwitz and Stanyer violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5.  Both Herwitz and Stanyer have consented to full disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, penalties, and antifraud injunctions. Stanyer has also consented to a bar from serving as an officer or director of a public company. , Specifically, the Commission’s complaint alleges:, Herwitz and Stanyer have agreed to settle the Commission’s claims by consenting to the entry of separate judgments that permanently enjoin each of them from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.

Indiana 2002).</h2>, <h2>District Court Affirms Jury Verdict, Enters Disgorgement, Civil Penalty and Injunction Orders Against Former Presidents of Church Extension of the Church of God, Inc. and United Management Services, Inc.</h2>]","[The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) today announced that in two separate rulings entered on December 14 and 15, U.S. District Court Judge David F. Hamilton, in the Southern District of Indiana, affirmed a jury verdict reached in July 2004 finding James Perry Grubbs (Grubbs) and Shearon Louis Jackson (Jackson) liable for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, and imposed monetary and injunctive remedies against each of them.  The Court also entered separate final judgments against Mr. Grubbs and Mr. Jackson, permanently enjoining both from future securities law violations and from future violations of federal securities laws and from service as officers or directors of issuers of federally registered securities and federally regulated broker-dealers, ordering disgorgement of $44,500 plus interest by Mr. Grubbs and $37,000 plus interest by Mr. Jackson, and imposing third tier civil penalties of $120,000 on Mr. Grubbs and $90,000 on Mr. Jackson., The Commission commenced this action on July 22, 2002, charging Church Extension of the Church Of God, Inc. (Church Extension) and United Management Services, Inc. (UMS) and the former presidents of those entities, Grubbs and Jackson, with engaging in a fraudulent scheme from approximately 1996 to the time of the lawsuit, through which Church Extension raised $85 million from the sale of investment notes to thousands of individuals throughout the country, most of whom were members of the Church of God, a Christian denomination headquartered in Anderson, Indiana.   Church Extension was a not-for-profit corporation set up by the Church of God to help finance the construction and expansion of local churches.  The Commission alleged that in connection with the offer and sale of investment notes, defendants repeatedly made material misrepresentations and omitted to state material facts in Church Extensions solicitation and offering circulars, concerning, among other things, the primary use of investment note proceeds and the financial conditions of Church Extension and UMS. The complaint alleged that during the period from 1996 to 2002, instead of using investment note proceeds primarily to fund church loans as stated in the offering circulars, Church Extension departed from its original focus and instead used the note proceeds to fund speculative non-church real estate transactions and to make interest and principal payments to prior noteholders.  The SEC also alleged that Grubbs and Jackson caused Church Extension and UMS to overstate dramatically the companys financial condition in its offering circulars through the overvaluation of properties it received in connection with these real estate transactions that were used to give Church Extension a misleading appearance of solvency.  By the spring of 2001, Church Extension owed noteholders more than $80 million, but was actually insolvent., After an eight-day trial in 2004, the jury found in favor of the Commission on all of its claims, and determined that Grubbs and Jackson each violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, codified at Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder., The disgorgement amounts ordered by the Court represent one-half of each defendants base salaries for 2001, based on the Courts reasoning that, but for the securities violations, Church Extension would have collapsed earlier, so the violations enabled defendants Grubbs and Jackson to continue their employment., Church Extension and UMS previously settled the Commissions charges against them on July 31, 2002, consenting to the entry of permanent injunctions prohibiting future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Church Extension and UMS also agreed to pay disgorgement of approximately $81 million.  In consenting to the entry of the civil injunctions and disgorgement, Church Extension and UMS neither admitted nor denied the allegations of the Commissions Complaint.  In connection with this settlement, on July 31, 2002, the Court appointed Jeff J. Marwil, a partner at the law firm of Jenner &amp; Block in Chicago, Illinois, as an independent Conservator in this case.  The Conservators mandate is to protect the interest of investors who invested or reinvested in the note program.  Since his appointment, Mr. Marwil has liquidated and distributed to investors assets totaling in excess of $25 million, and has also commenced independent lawsuits against various officers, directors and third parties who were involved in the transactions giving rise to the SECs lawsuit. At the trial, the Conservator estimated that investor losses will exceed between $20 million and $40 million., For further information, please see Litigation Release Numbers <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18790.htm>18790</a> (July 23, 2004) [jury verdict against Grubbs and Jackson], <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17966.htm>17966</a> (February 4, 2003) [order approving plan for note-holder repayment and related relief], <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17656.htm>17656</a> (August 5, 2002) [final judgment entered against Church Extension and UMS] and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17623.htm>17623</a> (July 22, 2002) [complaint filed]., <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19500.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Compania Internacional Financiera S.A. and Yomi Rodrig, Civil Action No. 05-CV-10634 (SDNY) (LAK)</i>, On December 19, 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC or the Commission) filed a settled civil action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Compania Internacional Financiera S.A., a European investment vehicle, and its sole owner Yomi Rodrig, charging them with violating Rule 105 of Regulation M and Section 10(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act).  Rule 105 prohibits covering a short sale with securities obtained in a public offering when the short sale occurs during a specific restricted period (usually five business days) before the pricing of the offering.  Section 10(a) prohibits effecting a short sale of a security registered on a national securities exchange in contravention of the Commissions rules and regulations.  Compania and Rodrig have agreed to settle the lawsuit by consenting, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, to the entry of an order permanently enjoining them from future violations of Rule 105 and Section 10(a) of the Exchange Act, ordering them to disgorge more than $4.8 million in trading profits plus prejudgment interest, and imposing a civil money penalty of $1.4 million., According to the Commissions complaint, beginning as early as January 2002 through at least March 2005, Compania, under the control and at the direction of Rodrig, used securities purchased from underwriters participating in at least eighty-five (85) public offerings to cover shares Compania had sold short during the restricted period set by Rule 105.  Compania typically conducted its short selling on the day of the pricing of the public offering or one or two days earlier.  In each offering, the offering price was set on the pricing day, and was usually set at a discount to the last reported sale price of the stock on the pricing day.  Accordingly, by short selling just before pricing, Compania often sold shares short at prices higher than the price it would later pay for the shares in the offering.   The Commission alleges that Compania made profits of more than $4.7 million from these short sales.  The Commission further alleges that in connection with at least forty-nine (49) of the eighty-five (85) offerings, Companias illegal trading involved exchange traded securities and violated Section 10(a) of the Exchange Act., If the settlement is approved by the Court, the disgorgement and penalty would be the largest ever recovered in a SEC enforcement action involving violations of Rule 105., The Commission acknowledges the assistance and cooperation of the National Association of Securities Dealers., <img alt=* border=0 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif/><a href=/litigation/complaints/comp19501.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>, <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19501.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

(Lucent).  In its Complaint filed on May 17, 2004 and amended on September 30, 2005, the Commission alleged that on September 30, 2000, Lucent and BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc. (BellSouth) entered into a software pooling agreement, called LOA 105, which obligated BellSouth to pay Lucent $95 million by April 1, 2001 for software that it had to select by September 30, 2002. To induce BellSouth to enter into LOA 105, Bratten agreed to provide BellSouth with a $20 million credit and a 2 percent price discount (valued at $1 million). Bratten failed to notify Lucents CFO structure that he had agreed to the credit and discount as part of a software pooling transaction. In addition, on October 10, 2000, Bratten executed a letter to BellSouth that falsely represented that the credit and discount had been granted on that date rather than in September. The letter was drafted by Elliott, who knew that Bratten had granted the credit and discount in September as an inducement for BellSouth to enter into LOA 105. As a result of their fraudulent conduct, Lucent violated GAAP by recording the entire $95 million as revenue and operating income, rather than $74 million., Bratten, a sales Vice President at Lucent, failed to notify Lucents CFO structure that he had agreed to a $20 million credit and a 2 percent price discount as part of a software pooling transaction entered into by Lucent and BellSouth Telecommunications Inc. (Bellsouth) on September 30, 2000.  In addition, on October 10, 2000, Bratten executed a letter to BellSouth that falsely represented that the credit and discount had been granted on that date rather than in September.  The letter was drafted by Elliott, a Senior Manager at Lucent who knew that Bratten had granted the credit and discount in September as an inducement for BellSouth to enter into the software pooling agreement.  As a result of their fraudulent conduct, Lucent materially overstated pre-tax income in its financial statements filed with the Commission in a form 8-K on October 24, 2000., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions Complaint, Bratten and Elliott each consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and from circumventing or knowingly failing to implement internal controls or directly or indirectly falsifying, or causing to be falsified, a book or record, specifically, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder.  The Court also enjoined Bratten and Elliott from aiding and abetting the periodic reporting, internal controls, and books and records provisions of the Exchange Act, specifically, Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-11 thereunder, and ordered Bratten to pay a $40,000 civil penalty and Elliott to pay a $25,000 civil penalty.

Dowdell, et al.</i>, Civil Action No. 3:01CV00116 (W.D. Va.) (Honorable James H. Michael, Jr.)      	  , The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on December 14, the Honorable Judge Norman K. Moon, U.S. District Court Judge for the Western District of Virginia, Charlottesville Division, entered a final judgment against Kenneth G. Mason, an attorney residing in Wilmette, Illinois, for his role in a massive international Ponzi scheme orchestrated by Terry Dowdell that raised more than $70 million from investors in the U.S. and abroad.  Dowdell previously pled guilty to criminal charges of securities fraud, wire fraud and money laundering stemming from this scheme.  On July 21, 2004, Dowdell was sentenced to 15 years in jail for his conduct in the illegal scheme., The judgment against Mason, to which he consented without admitting or denying any of the allegations in the complaint, requires him to pay disgorgement of $540,105, plus $99,928 in prejudgment interest.  This amount constitutes all of the commissions that Mason received in connection with his introduction of investors to this fraudulent program  The court also imposed a permanent injunction prohibiting future violations of anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws, contained in Sections 17(a)(1), (2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934  and Rule 10b-5 thereunder., The SECs enforcement action, commenced on November 19, 2001, arose out of a fictitious investment program that Dowdell operated through Vavasseur Corporation, a Bahamian company controlled by Dowdell.  Investors in this program (the Vavasseur Program) were required to sign an investment contract with Vavasseur.  The contract falsely represented that investor funds would be maintained in a bank account registered as Vavasseur Corp. for the benefit of (Client name), and committed Vavasseur: to use its best efforts to achieve anticipated profits. . . in an amount equal to or exceeding Four Percent (4%) of the Clients funds under management for each week in which trading occurs.  [Vavasseur] shall use its best efforts basis to cause trading of Clients funds in a minimum of forty weeks during each fifty-two week Agreement term.  According to the contract, this would result in annualized gross return of 160%., As Dowdell admitted in this action, and the Court has previously found, there were no trades or investments made by Vavasseur.  Instead old investors were paid their purported profits from new investor funds in typical Ponzi scheme fashion.  In the course of perpetrating this fraud, millions of dollars of investors funds were misappropriated by Dowdell and the marketers of the Vavasseur Program., Mason introduced the first two investors into the program, one of whom was Birgit Mechlenburg, a recidivist securities law violator who had previously been sanctioned by the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Mechlenburg became one of the principal marketers of the Vavasseur program, raising more than $13 million from investors in the United States and Europe.  Mechlenburg was also named in this action, and the Court entered a default judgment against her in May 2003, ordering her to pay approximately $1.6 million in disgorgement plus a civil penalty., Additional information concerning the SECs lawsuit against Dowdell can be found in Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17242.htm>17242</a>, November 19, 2001; Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17454.htm>17454</a>, April 2, 2002; Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17553.htm>17553,</a> June 10, 2002; Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17880.htm>17880</a>, October 10, 2002; Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17881.htm>17881</a>, October 10, 2002; Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17905.htm>17905</a>, December 19, 2002; Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17999.htm>17999</a>, February 26, 2003; Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18029.htm>18029</a>, March 11, 2003; Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18198.htm>18198</a>, June 20, 2003; and Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18143.htm>18143</a>, May 19, 2003., Additional information on how prime bank and other banking-related investment schemes work can be found at the SECs Prime Bank Fraud Information Center (<a href=/divisions/enforce/primebank.shtml>http://www.sec.gov/divisions/enforce/primebank.shtml</a>) in the enforcement section of the SECs Web site, at the Receivers website, located at http://www.dowdell-receivership.com., <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19503.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Bates of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia entered a final judgment against Richard Glen Spradling (Spradling), a Houston-area penny stock promoter and author of various investment newsletters and websites, including Market News Alert and investmentreport.com., In its Complaint, the Commission alleged that, through his newsletters and websites, Spradling illegally touted stocks without adequately disclosing the amount and nature of his compensation.  In fact, Spradlings compensation most often came from the very companies he promoted or persons associated with the companies that he promoted.  The Complaint also alleged that Spradling scalped stocks he promoted by selling into the demand that his newsletters and website promotions created.  Specifically, the Commissions Complaint alleged that between April 2001 and September 2003, Spradling promoted more than 44 penny stock issues by faxing newsletters to hundreds of thousands of individuals.  The Complaint further alleged that Spradling received compensation in the form of stock for at least 36 of the penny stocks he promoted and that he sold at least 32 of the stocks during the promotion of the stock.  By his conduct, Spradling yielded net proceeds of over $1.6 million.  In addition, the Commission alleged in the Complaint that Spradling falsely stated that Market News Alert is an independent research firm with paid subscribers.  In fact, the production and dissemination of each newsletter was paid for by the subject company or a related promoter and Spradlings newsletter had no paid subscribers.  The Complaint also alleged that Spradling disseminated fraudulent annual revenues and revenue forecasts on behalf of at least one company., The Final Judgment permanently enjoins Spradling from violating Section 17(b) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

According to the complaint, Franklin then sold those shares after their price increased following overly optimistic and misleading profiles on the companies which appeared on the Red Hot Stocks website.

Massimi and Bret A. Grebow through a hedge fund, HMC International, LLC (HMC or the Fund) (collectively, the Defendants).  The Commission also charged Jaime Elliott, Massimis wife, as a Relief Defendant., The complaint alleges that from late 2001 to the present, Massimi, the Funds manager, and Grebow, the Funds trader, raised approximately $12.9 million from approximately 80 investors through a fraudulent offering of investments in HMC, and that Massimi and Grebow misappropriated more than $5.2 million of these investor funds for their own use.  The Commission alleges that Massimi and Grebow materially misrepresented the Fund as a pooled investment vehicle that engaged in low risk day trading.  Furthermore, Massimi and Grebow sent investors false monthly account statements that portrayed their investments as profitable when, in reality, Grebow was systematically looting the Funds trading account and Massimi was continually benefiting from lucrative profit distributions and unauthorized expenses that he paid to himself and Grebow from new investor funds.  Massimi also falsely assured investors that he was a hands-on manager, who maintained diligent oversight of the Funds assets and trading.  The Commission further alleges that, recently, as Massimi faced increasing investor concerns about the Funds legitimacy and government inquiries into his misconduct, Massimi diverted assets to others, including the Relief Defendant, to shield them from investors and government authorities., The complaint charges the Defendants with violating 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint further charges Massimi and Grebow with violating Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act, and, in the alternative, Grebow with aiding and abetting Massimis violations of the Investment Advisers Act., In its emergency enforcement action, the Commission is seeking, among other emergency relief, a temporary restraining order freezing the assets of the Defendants and certain assets of the Relief Defendant.  In addition to this emergency relief, the Commission also seeks orders enjoining the Defendants, preliminarily and permanently, from committing future violations of the foregoing federal securities laws, and a final judgment ordering the Defendants and the Relief Defendant to disgorge ill-gotten gains and ordering the Defendants to pay civil penalties.

Ohio) (December 21, 2005)</h2>, <h2>SEC Sues NCFE Executives for Role in $2.6 Billion Fraud</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, alleging that Lance Poulsen, principal and former Chief Executive Officer of National Century Financial Enterprises, Inc. (NCFE), Donald S. Ayers, principal and former Chief Operating Officer of NCFE, Rebecca S. Parrett, principal and former Director of NCFEs Accounts Receivable Servicer Department, and Randolph H. Speer, former Chief Financial Officer of NCFE, participated in a scheme to defraud investors in securities issued by subsidiaries of NCFE, NPF VI and NPF XII (the Programs).  , The complaint alleges that NCFE, a private corporation located in Dublin, Ohio, through wholly owned subsidiaries purchased medical accounts receivable from health-care providers and issued notes that securitized those receivables.  From at least February 1999 to October 2002, the subsidiaries offered and sold at least $3.25 billion in total notes through fifteen private placements to institutional investors.  In October 2002, NCFE suddenly collapsed when investors discovered that the companies had hidden massive cash and collateral shortfalls from investors and auditors.  The collapse caused investor losses exceeding $2.6 billion and approximately 275 health-care providers were forced to file for bankruptcy protection.  , The complaint further alleges that pursuant to the representations in the offering documents and the Program agreements, the Programs were required to maintain certain reserve-account balances and medical accounts receivable as collateral to secure the notes.  Nevertheless, Poulsen, Parrett, Ayers and Speer depleted the Programs reserve accounts and collateral base by advancing at least $1.2 billion from the Programs funds to health-care providers without receiving eligible receivables in return.  These advances were essentially unsecured loans by the Programs to distressed or defunct health-care providers - many of which were wholly or partly owned by NCFE, Poulsen, Parrett and/or Ayers.  , According to the complaint, Poulsen, Parrett, Ayers and Speer concealed their fraud from investors and others by: (1) repeatedly transferring funds between the subsidiaries bank accounts to mask cash shortfalls of as much as $350 million; (2) recording $1 billion or more in non-existent or ineligible medical accounts receivable on the subsidiaries books; (3) creating and distributing false offering documents, false monthly investor reports, and false accounting records to trustees, investors, potential investors, and auditors; and (4) misrepresenting the status of the Programs cash accounts and collateral base to investors and others. , In the complaint, the Commission seeks to: (1) permanently enjoin each Defendant from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder; (2) permanently bar each Defendant from serving as an officer or director of a public company; and (3) order each Defendant to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil monetary penalty, in amounts to be determined., The Commission has obtained judgments against three other former NCFE executives: Sherry Gibson, former Executive Vice President of Compliance of NCFE; John Snoble, former Vice President and Controller; and Brian Stucke, former Associate Vice-President for Business Services.  Each of these individuals has consented to a permanent injunction prohibiting them from violating the federal securities laws; an order barring him or her from serving as an officer or director of a public company; and disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty, in amounts to be determined.  , Moreover, each of these three former NCFE executives has pled guilty in federal district court in Columbus, Ohio to criminal charges arising from the scheme to defraud.  Gibson pled guilty to conspiracy to commit securities fraud and was sentenced to four years in federal prison, followed by three years of supervised release.  Gibson is currently serving her prison sentence at the Lexington Federal Medical Center in Kentucky and is scheduled to be released on March 28, 2008.  Stucke pled guilty to conspiracy to commit securities fraud and Snoble pled guilty to money laundering conspiracy; both are awaiting sentencing.  , The Commission thanks the United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of Ohio, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service and the United States Postal Service for their assistance in this investigation.  , The Commission is continuing its investigation in this matter., , <img alt=* border=0 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif/><a href=/litigation/complaints/comp19509.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>, <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19509.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Brent William Federighi and Michael Carl Hoffman</i>, United States District Court for the Northern District of California, Civil Action No. C 05-05305 MMC      	  , The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed civil fraud charges against two former San Francisco hedge fund managers. The SEC alleges that the fund managers defrauded scores of mutual funds and their shareholders of approximately $49 million when they placed thousands of illegal late trades after the close of the market, which enabled the managers to trade based on after-market events while still obtaining the prices in effect before the market closed. According to the Commission, the fund managers also fraudulently engaged in market timing, by which they placed frequent short-term trades prohibited by the mutual funds and burdened other shareholders with unfair costs as a result., The Commissions complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, names Brent W. Federighi, 34, and Michael C. Hoffman, 42, both of San Francisco, in connection with their conduct between 2000 and 2002 on behalf of the Ilytat hedge fund, which they co-managed and which closed in August 2002, and in connection with Federighis conduct from September 2002 to October 2003 in managing the Gage Capital hedge fund after Ilytat closed.  In May 2001, Ilytats domestic and offshore funds had a total of approximately $130 million in assets, and when Gage closed in 2003 it had approximately $55 million in assets in its domestic and offshore funds., According to the Commissions complaint, Federighi and Hoffman deliberately exploited a loophole in their brokers mutual fund order entry system to place over 3,000 fraudulent late trades (representing over 80% of their hedge funds mutual fund trades) in over 400 different mutual funds, allowing them to obtain better prices for their mutual fund shares than other investors received.  The late trading by Federighi and Hoffman caused losses of approximately $49 million to other mutual fund investors through the hedge funds improper receipt of stale fund prices.  Some trades were placed as late as 5:45 p.m. (Eastern Time), or 1.75 hours after the time as of which the mutual funds prices were set., In addition, Federighi and Hoffman allegedly engaged in short-term trading in mutual funds, in violation of the mutual funds rules.  When the mutual funds discovered this improper market timing, they restricted or barred Ilytat and Gage from investing in the funds.  Federighi and Hoffman then allegedly used deceptive techniques to conceal the hedge funds identities in order to continue market timing those funds.  Among other things, Ilytat and Gage placed trades using multiple, non-consecutively numbered accounts to conceal their identities from the funds., Specifically, the complaint alleges that by engaging in the conduct described above, Hoffman and Federighi violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Advisers Act of 1940, and Section 37 of the Investment Company Act., The Commission seeks to enjoin defendants from committing future violations of these provisions, disgorgement of all ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil monetary penalties., <img alt=* border=0 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif/><a href=/litigation/complaints/comp19510.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>, <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19510.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

(Roanoke), based in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, David L. Smith, Jr., Roanokes chairman, chief executive officer and president and a resident of Roanoke Rapids, North Carolina, Thomas L. Bojadzijev of Orlando, Florida, and Barrett R. Clark of San Diego, California.  The complaint alleges that the defendants participated in a scheme to illegally raise money for themselves by using Form S-8 registration statements.  The complaint also names Sussex Avenue Partners LLC (Sussex) of Carlsbad, California as a relief defendant., According to the complaint, from 2003 through October 2004, Smith had Roanoke issue over one billion shares, pursuant to several Form S-8 registration statements, to Bojadzijev and Clark, purportedly to compensate them for services provided to Roanoke.  The complaint alleges that Bojadzijev and Clark raised over $7 million in liquidating these shares and funneled over $4 million to Smith, who used the funds for his own personal spending.  Form S-8 registration statements permit the issuance of stock to consultants in certain circumstances to compensate them for legitimate services rendered.  S-8 stock, however, cannot be used by the issuer, such as Roanoke, to raise capital for its control persons.  The complaint also alleges that Smith caused Roanoke to issue a series of false and misleading press releases while Bojadzijev was selling stock into the market., The SECs complaint alleges that the defendants violated the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Whelan was named in a seven count indictment charging him with perjury, obstruction of justice and providing false statements in connection with a deposition provided to the Commission in the SEC v. Cook matter., The SEC v. Cook case involved an emergency action brought by the Commission in March 1999 to halt an ongoing Ponzi scheme centered around the offer and sale of non-existent prime bank securities issued by Dennel Finance Limited.  After obtaining a TRO to halt the Dennel scheme, the Commission staff learned that certain individuals affiliated with Dennel were conducting a nearly identical fraud under a new name, Resource Development International, LLC.  The Commission brought a second emergency action in March 2002 against Resource Development and others to end the related scheme, alleging that the defendants raised approximately $98 million from more than 1300 investors nationwide using fraudulent statements regarding the purported investment in bank trading programs and annual rates of return of 48 to 1220 percent..  William Whelan was not a defendant in the SEC v. Cook matter, but was named as a defendant in the SEC v. Resource Development litigation., Whelan, a licensed insurance agent, was sued by the Court-appointed Receiver in the SEC v. Cook case after he was identified as facilitator who received commissions from the offer and sale of the fraudulent Dennel program.  The Commission and Receiver jointly deposed Whelan in SEC v. Cook in August 2000 and Whelan was questioned about his involvement in other high-yield, prime bank programs, including, specifically, the Resource Development program., In the plea agreement, Whelan admits that, during his deposition, he testified falsely numerous times about his role in the Resource Development program.  Whelan testified that he had never received any commissions for offering or selling any high-yield bank debenture-type program other than the Dennel program.  Whelan further testified that he had never seen documents relating to the Resource Development program.  In addition, Whelan testified that he had never heard of an entity called Resource Development.  In the plea agreement, Whelan admits that, contrary to his testimony, he had, in fact, been offering and selling the fraudulent Resource Development program for several months prior to his testimony, had received commissions for selling the Resource Development investment, and had utilized the documents disseminated by Resource Development in the course of selling the program., The three perjury counts subject Whelan to a potential prison sentence of as many as 15 years and a potential fine of as much as $750,000.

On the Commissions application, the Court issued a Temporary Restraining Order; Order Freezing Assets, and Prohibiting the Destruction of Documents; and Order to Show Cause why a Preliminary Injunction Should Not Issue (Order)., In its Complaint, the Commission alleges that from approximately November 2001 through the present, Silva, Allied, and two defunct entities known as Sunrise Energy, Inc. and Blue Marlin Energy, Inc., defrauded investors of over $5 million through the sale of unregistered securities.  The securities were purportedly sold to invest in oil and gas operations.

He faces up to 20 years in prison and a $5,000,000 fine on the securities fraud charge, and up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine on each wire fraud charge.  From about October 1999 to March 2004, Stockett devised a pump and dump scheme to defraud individuals of money and property by inducing them to invest in a company called Hightec and its wholly-owned subsidiary U.S. Cement, both controlled solely by Stockett.  The scheme involved the dissemination of false and misleading positive information about the companies through an internet site, press releases, emails and infomercials.  These false and misleading advertisements stated that U.S. Cement had an established cement distribution network, access to millions of dollars in financing, and prominent retail customers., As a part of the scheme, from August 2000 to September, Stockett and another individual induced a Canadian couple to loan Stockett approximately $700,000 to purchase cement and a warehouse for U.S. Cement.  They loaned the money based on the false misrepresentations and omissions made about U.S. Cements ability and capability to purchase, import and distribute cement.  Within weeks of receiving the monies from the Canadian couple, Stockett had purchased a $750,000 residence in Henderson, Nevada, a Jaguar automobile, and other items of luxury, and paid monies toward the purchase of a boat in the Virgin Islands., The Commission filed a civil complaint against Stockett in April 2002 alleging that he orchestrated a fraudulent scheme regarding Hightec and The S.I.N.C.L.A.R.E. Group, Inc., a second former publicly traded company he controlled, in which Stockett, among other things, issued numerous false press releases and other public statements concerning the companies and unlawfully sold his restricted shares of Hightec stock in unregistered transactions.  A final judgment in the Commissions litigation was entered against Stockett on March 4, 2004, permanently enjoining him from violating numerous provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, prohibiting him from acting as an officer or director of a public company, ordering disgorgement and prejudgment interest totaling $1,836,181.56, and ordering a civil penalty of $120,000.  After Stocketts scheme to defraud was uncovered, he fled from the United States to St. Maarten, Netherlands Antilles, and later to Costa Rica.  Stockett was indicted on the criminal charges in August 2003, and arrested in Costa Rica in February 2004.
