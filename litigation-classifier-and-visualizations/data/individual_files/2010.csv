Â Wade consented to the entry of the injunctive relief, the disgorgement amount, and the prejudgment interest without admitting or denying the allegations of the Complaint., The Complaint against Wade charged him with violating a Commission Order issued in 2003 prohibiting him from participating in any offering of a penny stock (the âPenny Stock Barâ). Â The Complaint alleged, specifically, that Wade violated the Penny Stock Bar by: (1) selling 1,154,196 shares of Bio Solutions Manufacturing, Inc (âBio Manufacturing), to foreign investors on or about May 15, 2006; (2) inducing, as President of Bio Solutions Franchise, Inc.

No. 07 CV 1774 (S.D.N.Y.), an insider trading case the Commission filed against fourteen defendants on March 1, 2007. The final judgment against Okada successfully concludes this litigation, as the Court has previously entered final judgments against the other defendants., The Commissionâs complaint alleged two related insider trading schemes in which Wall Street professionals serially traded on material, nonpublic information tipped, in exchange for kickbacks, by insiders at UBS Securities LLC and Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., Inc. The complaint alleged that in the first scheme, from 2001 through 2006, Mitchel S. Guttenberg, an executive director in the equity research department of UBS, illegally tipped material, nonpublic information concerning upcoming UBS analyst upgrades and downgrades. The complaint alleged that in the second scheme, in 2005 and 2006, Randi Collotta, an attorney who worked in the global compliance department of Morgan Stanley, illegally tipped material, nonpublic information concerning upcoming corporate acquisitions involving Morgan Stanleyâs investment banking clients. As alleged in the complaint, Okada was a downstream tippee in both schemes., Okada consented to the entry of a final judgment which (i) permanently enjoins him from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and (ii) orders disgorgement of $327,191, but waives payment of all except $45,000 based on his demonstrated inability to pay. In a related administrative proceeding, Okada consented to the entry of a Commission order barring him from future association with any broker, dealer, or investment adviser. In a parallel criminal case, Okada previously pled guilty to charges of securities fraud and conspiracy to commit securities fraud and was sentenced to three years probation, a $300,000 fine, and forfeiture of $7,375. <i>U.S. v. Ken Okada</i>, No. 1:07-CR-144 (S.D.N.Y.)., Final judgments ordering injunctive relief, disgorgement, and/or civil penalties have now been entered against all fourteen defendants originally charged in this case. In related administrative proceedings, all ten individual defendants who worked in the securities industry (as well as two additional securities industry professionals who engaged in related misconduct) have been barred from future association with any broker, dealer and/or investment adviser. Additionally, in related criminal cases prosecuted by the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Southern District of New York, all nine individual defendants (and two other individuals) have been convicted of felony charges and received sentences that have included forfeiture, fines, and/or prison terms., The Commission thanks the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Southern District of New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation for their assistance and cooperation in connection with this matter., For further information, see Litigation Release Nos. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20022.htm>20022</a> (March 1, 2007), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20367.htm>20367</a> (November 20, 2007), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20725.htm>20725</a> (September 18, 2008), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21086.htm>21086</a> (June 16, 2009), and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21244.htm>21244</a> (October 8, 2009)., ]"

The SEC obtained a court order at that time freezing all of Salehâs trading profits., Under the terms of the settlement filed today in federal court in Dallas, the SEC plans to ask the court to appoint a third party to recommend a distribution plan for Salehâs illegal profits. The SEC also will ask the court to impose a financial penalty against Saleh.

Bayly (âBaylyâ), former global head of investment banking at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., Inc. (âMerrill Lynchâ)., On March 17, 2003, <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18038.htm>the Commission charged Bayly and three other former executives of Merrill Lynch</a> with aiding and abetting Enron Corp.âs earnings manipulation. That action remains stayed against Baylyâs co-defendants pending resolution of a parallel criminal prosecution. On March 17, 2003, <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18038.htm>the Commission also sued and simultaneously settled all of its Enron aiding-and-abetting charges against Merrill Lynch</a>, which was enjoined from violating the federal securities laws and paid $80 million in financial sanctions for distribution to injured investors through the Commissionâs Enron Fair Fund., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissionâs complaint, Bayly has now been permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions, as well as from aiding and abetting violations of the periodic reporting, books-and-records, and internal controls provisions; barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years; and ordered to pay $300,001 in disgorgement and civil money penalties for deposit into the Commissionâs Enron Fair Fund., As alleged in the Commissionâs complaint, Bayly substantially assisted Enronâs sham sale of an interest in certain Nigerian barges during late 1999. Although the interest in these barges purportedly passed to a special purpose entity in which Merrill Lynch invested equity capital, Bayly had received an oral commitment from Enronâs then-Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Fastow, that Merrill Lynch would be repaid within six months at a specified rate of return. In substance, this side agreement transformed what was supposed to be an equity investment into a bridge loan with a fixed interest rate. The complaint alleged that Bayly helped enable this sham âsaleâ on Enronâs interest in the Nigerian barges so as to maintain favorable relations with Enron. By participating in the arrangement â which allowed Enron fraudulently to record $28 million in revenue and $12 million in pre-tax income â Bayly aided and abetted Enronâs violations of the federal securities laws., For more information, see Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18038.htm>18038</a> (March 17, 2003)., ]"

(âEngineered Supportâ or the âCompanyâ), resolving the Securities and Exchange Commissionâs (âCommissionâ) charges against Shanahan Sr. for options backdating filed in July 2007. According to the Complaint, from 1997 through 2002, Shanahan Sr. participated in a fraudulent scheme to grant undisclosed, in-the-money stock options to himself and other Engineered Support employees by backdating Company stock option grants to coincide with historically low closing prices of Engineered Supportâs common stock. In addition, the Complaint alleged that Shanahan Sr. cancelled previously issued Engineered Support stock options that had fallen out-of-the-money and reissued the options with a new backdated grant date and exercise price, bringing those options back in-the-money. The Complaint also alleged that Shanahan Sr. improperly issued additional Engineered Support stock options to nonemployee directors beyond what they were authorized to receive under the Companyâs shareholder-approved stock option plans. The Complaint further alleged that Shanahan Sr. and others caused Engineered Support to make material misrepresentations and to omit statements of material fact regarding Engineered Supportâs stock option grants in its filings with the Commission., According to the Complaint, Engineered Support employees received approximately $20 million of improper in-the-money benefit from the backdating, $15 million of which went to top executives and directors., Without admitting or denying the Commissionâs allegations, Shanahan Sr. has consented to a permanent injunction from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b), 13(b)(5), and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ), and Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, 13b2-1, and 14a-9 thereunder, and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 thereunder.

The District Court sentenced Shanahan Sr. to three years probation, and ordered him to pay restitution of $7,871,662.50 and a $40,000 criminal fine., The Commissionâs litigation continues against Michael F.

Â The district courts order enjoins Alexander, CJB, and Regis Filia from violating Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 by engaging in the offer or sale of securities as to which no registration statement has been filed or in effect. Â The orders were based upon the defendants sales of the securities of thirteen public companies between March 2006 and March 2008. Â The order also enjoins the defendants from acting as unregistered brokers or dealers in violations of Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

The complaint alleged that these activities constituted a scheme to evade the registration provisions of the federal securities laws, and that the defendants acted as underwriters because they acquired the shares with a view to distribute them to other investors.

The Commissions complaint alleges that Elkinson, of Framingham, Massachusetts, lured at least 130 investors to invest approximately $28 million with him through his d/b/a Northeast Sales, which he operated out of his home., The Commissions complaint alleges that since at least 1997, Elkinson offered and sold unregistered securities in the form of promissory notes. According to the complaint, Elkinson falsely told investors that he was in the business of brokering contracts on behalf of a Japanese firm that manufactured uniforms (such as police uniforms and prison uniforms) to be sold to large purchasers such as state and local governments (and even the U.S. Olympic Committee) and that investors money would be used to help finance specific uniform contracts. The investors received promissory notes signed by Elkinson, with terms that generally required payment within 300 to 330 days and with an interest rate that ranged from 9% to 13%. According to the complaint, however, Elkinson had no relationship with a Japanese uniform manufacturer, and there were no contracts to purchase uniforms. The Commission alleges that, while some investors did receive payments of principal and interest, those payments were made using funds obtained from other investors, and Elkinson was able to keep the scheme going as long as most of the investors kept rolling over their investments. In reality, according to the complaint, Elkinson used most of the investors money for his own personal purposes, including gambling., The Commissions complaint alleges that Elkinson violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The Honorable Joseph L.

The Commission also seeks the entry of a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus pre-judgment interest, and the imposition of civil monetary penalties against Elkinson., Elkinson was arrested on January 5, 2010 by Federal Bureau of Investigation and was charged criminally by the United States Attorneys Office for the District of Massachusetts.

Labry, a resident of Newport Beach, California, and his Costa Mesa, California-based entity, Cherokee Gas Systems, Inc., for perpetrating an ongoing oil and gas offering fraud that raised at least $1.4 million from investors throughout the United States and Canada. The court entered an order halting the alleged fraud and freezing the assets of Labry and Cherokee., The SECs complaint alleges that from December 2008 to the present, the Defendants have been engaged in a fraudulent scheme whereby they solicit investors through cold-calling to invest in an unregistered oil and gas offering. The complaint alleges that Labry, using Cherokee investor monies, purchased dialing software that can automatically place outbound calls from a pre-loaded database of numbers. In these calls, Cherokee representatives allegedly offer investors the opportunity to purchase units in oil and gas wells purportedly owned by Cherokee located on Walters Field in Oklahoma, for $25,000 per unit. According to the complaint, Cherokee representatives tell investors that they will start receiving returns on their investments, paid monthly, within 45 to 60 days of the investment. The complaint alleges that Defendants represent projected minimum monthly returns of $725 per $25,000 unit purchased, or about a 35% annual return. According to the complaint, investor monies are not invested in oil and gas production and investors are not receiving returns. Instead, the SEC alleges that Labry has misappropriated investor funds for his own personal use. Of the $1.4 million raised so far, Labry has withdrawn $268,800 in cash, cashed $148,126 in cashiers checks made out to SCS and expended another $466,283 to purchase cashiers checks made payable to various individuals., The complaint further alleges that the Cherokee offering materials are almost identical to the offering materials previously disseminated by an entity Labry controlled, Iron Horse Petroleum, Inc., which had offered similar oil and gas interests in Walters Field in Oklahoma. Five states have issued administrative orders prohibiting Labry and/or Iron Horse from offering or selling securities based on findings that Labry and/or Iron Horse were offering and selling unregistered securities., In its lawsuit, the SEC obtained an order (1) freezing the assets of Labry and Cherokee; (2) appointing a temporary receiver over Cherokee; (3) preventing the destruction of documents; (4) granting expedited discovery; (5) requiring accountings from Labry and Cherokee; and (6) temporarily enjoining Labry and Cherokee from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and temporarily enjoining Cherokee from future violations of Sections 5(a) and (5) of the Securities Act. The SEC also seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against Labry and Cherokee.

According to the SEC complaint, in a particularly egregious example of Salutrics fraudulent conduct, Salutric misappropriated over $400,000 from a 96-year-old client who resides in a nursing home and suffers from dementia., At the SECs request for emergency relief, the Hon. William J. Hibbler, United States District Court, Northern District of Illinois, issued a temporary restraining order against Salutric and an order freezing all assets under the control of Salutric, in addition to granting other emergency relief., According to the allegations in the SEC complaint, Salutric misappropriated client funds by making unauthorized withdrawals from his clients accounts at another financial institution that served as the custodian of client assets for Results One. To perpetrate his scheme, in a number of instances, Salutric forged client signatures on written withdrawal request forms and submitted the signed written requests to the account custodian. According to the SEC complaint, once client funds were withdrawn from Schwab, Salutric directed the funds to a number of entities related to Salutric including: approximately $259,000 to two local restaurants (one of which is partially owned by Salutric); approximately $610,000 to a film distribution company (Salutric previously co-produced a film called Madison with links to this company); and approximately $321,000 to Salutrics church (Salutric is the treasurer for his church and has signatory authority over the churchs bank account).

The complaint also alleged that May and E-M promised returns in the form of monthly payments to investors for a period as long as 12 to 14 years, and guaranteed that investors, at a minimum, would receive the promised payments for approximately the first 20 to 24 months after they invested., The SECs complaint further alleged that, in reality, the LLCs did not have any telecommunication contracts with the establishments identified in offering materials provided by May and E-M. To further their alleged scheme, May and E-M provided some investors with copies of fictitious contracts with various hotels and casinos. Some of which included the names of purported hotel executives who did not exist. The SECs complaint alleged that the defendants conduct violated antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws., In October 2009, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan filed an indictment against May, charging him with 59 felony counts of mail fraud. If found guilty on all counts, May faces a statutory maximum sentence of 20 years incarceration on each count of the indictment.

The court ordered Market 99 Ltd and Milligan to each pay third-tier civil penalty of $120,000.

The court ordered Griffdom Enterprise to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest totaling $2,007,649, and a third-tier civil penalty of $120,000. The court also barred Milligan and Brola from acting as officers or directors of public companies. The court also permanently barred these defendants from participating in the offering of penny stocks., In its complaint, the Securities and Exchange Commission alleged that Brola sought to create a publicly-trading company which would sell used automobiles over the Internet and raise funds to operate by selling its shares to investors. Milligan became president and CEO of the shell corporation and changed its name to eCarfly, Inc. Milligan subsequently caused eCarfly to issue shares to the defendants, who sold them to the public when no registration statement was in effect for their sales. To create public demand for its stock, eCarfly issued numerous false and misleading press releases about its business operations, which were drafted and distributed by Milligan and Brola. The complaint alleged that, among other things, the press releases falsely claimed that eCarfly had partnerships with major national automobile dealers, that it was operating an internet automobile sales business, that it had substantial expertise in the automotive industry, and that it was opening a finance division. The press releases also allegedly made projections concerning eCarflys revenues and the price for its stock, which lacked any reasonable basis., The Commissions claims against the remaining defendants, Ryan M.

(NewPoint), John Farahi and Gissou Rastegar Farahi (the Farahis), and Elaheh Amouei (collectively, the defendants) to halt the fraudulent, unregistered offering and sale of securities by defendants and to prevent the dissipation of investor funds. The court entered an order halting the alleged fraud and freezing the defendants assets and those of relief defendant, Triple J Plus, LLC (Triple J), an entity controlled by the Farahis., The SECs complaint alleges that the defendants engaged in an unregistered offering fraud targeting the Los Angeles Iranian-American community. According to the complaint, most investors learned of NewPoint, a corporation controlled by the Farahis, through a daily finance radio program that John Farahi hosts on a Farsi language radio station in the Los Angeles area. The SEC alleges that investors were typically solicited to invest in the debentures by the Farahis and/or Elaheh Amouei, NewPoints controller, after making an appointment to discuss investment opportunities offered by NewPoint. The SECs complaint alleges that since at least 2003, NewPoint has offered and sold more than $20 million worth of debentures to more than one hundred investors., The complaint alleges that the defendants misled investors by falsely telling investors that the NewPoint debentures were low-risk. According to the complaint, many investors were also falsely told that they were investing in FDIC insured certificates of deposit, government bonds, and/or corporate bonds issued by companies backed by funds from the Troubled Asset Relief Program, also known as TARP. The SEC alleges that in reality the vast majority of the money raised was actually transferred to accounts controlled by the Farahis, including an account at relief defendant Triple J to, among other things, fund the construction of the Farahis multi-million dollar personal residence in Beverly Hills, California and to engage in risky options futures trading in the stock market in which the Farahis lost more than $18 million in 2008 and the beginning of 2009., Finally, the SEC alleges that since approximately June 2009, John Farahi and Amouei have made further misrepresentations to investors in an effort to lull them into keeping their money with NewPoint. Investors have allegedly been told that their money is safe and that they are guaranteed to get the entirety of their investment back â despite the fact that NewPoint lacks sufficient funds to make all investors whole. The SEC alleges that John Farahi has also paid back some investors on a selective basis while failing to return money to other investors who have asked for a return of their investment. The SEC also alleges that Amouei has falsely told some of the investors who have not received a return of their investment that NewPoint was unable to return their money because the Commission has frozen NewPoints financial accounts., In its lawsuit, the SEC obtained an order (1) freezing the assets of NewPoint, the Farahis, and Triple J; (2) appointing a temporary receiver over NewPoint and Triple J; (3) preventing the destruction of documents; (4) requiring accountings from NewPoint, the Farahis, and Triple J; and (5) temporarily enjoining NewPoint, the Farahis, and Amouei from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC also seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions and civil penalties against the defendants and disgorgement with prejudgment interest against NewPoint, the Farahis, and Triple J. A hearing on whether a preliminary injunction should be issued against the defendants and whether a permanent receiver should be appointed is scheduled for January 15, 2010 at 10:00 a.m., <b>See Also:</b> <a href=/litigation/complaints/2010/comp21369.pdf title=>SEC Complaint</a> ]"

Wagner, former Vice President of Corporate Communications at Indevus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (now known as Endo Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), a biotechnology company based in Lexington, Massachusetts. Wagner has agreed to pay a total of over $130,000 in disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties to settle the charges., The Commissions complaint, filed in federal district court in Boston, Massachusetts, alleges that Wagner sold shares of Indevus stock upon learning material non-public information that would have a negative effect on Indevuss stock price. According to the Commissions complaint, on June 4, 2008, Indevus announced that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had expressed concerns about a potential side effect of a drug for which Indevus was seeking FDA approval, and, as a result, the approval process would be delayed by at least 18 months. On the date of the announcement, the closing price of Indevus stock fell $2.84 per share from the prior days closing price of $4.10 per share to $1.26 per share, a decline of 69%. The complaint alleges that Wagner and others at Indevus first learned of the FDAs concerns on May 30, 2008, and, on the same day, Wagner entered an order to sell all of his Indevus holdings. The complaint further alleges that, later that day, and again on June 2, 2008, Wagner executed short sales of Indevus stock. A short sale is a sale of shares that the seller does not own but commits to buying at a later date with the expectation that the share price will drop, thereby allowing the seller to buy shares to cover the transaction at a lower price and earn a profit. Wagner purchased shares of Indevus stock to cover his short sales two days after the announcement., Wagner has agreed to settle this matter, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, on the following terms. He has consented to the entry of a permanent injunction prohibiting him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Additionally, Wagner will disgorge ill-gotten gains of $64,190.46, plus prejudgment interest thereon of $4,741.57, and he will pay a civil monetary payment of $64,190.46., The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority in this matter., <b>See Also:</b> <a href=/litigation/complaints/2010/comp21370.pdf title=>SEC Complaint</a> ]"

The agency earlier charged the bank with misleading investors about billions of dollars in bonuses that were being paid to Merrill executives. That complaint was amended in October to add a charge for Bank of Americas failure to comply with certain affirmative disclosure obligations under the federal proxy rules., The Commissions proposed second amended complaint alleges that Bank of America learned prior to the Dec. 5, 2008, shareholder meeting vote that Merrill Lynch experienced a net loss of $4.5 billion in October and estimated that it had experienced billions of dollars of additional losses in November. The actual and estimated losses together represented approximately one-third of the value of the merger at the time of the shareholder meeting and more than 60 percent of the aggregate losses Merrill Lynch sustained in the preceding three quarters combined., The SECs proposed second amended complaint, which the court made public today, alleges that Merrills slumping performance represented a fundamental change to the financial information that Bank of America provided shareholders in a Nov. 3, 2008 proxy statement to solicit their votes for approval of the Merrill Lynch merger on terms that had principally been negotiated in September 2008. In connection with the merger, Bank of America also publicly filed a registration statement in which it represented that it would update shareholders about any fundamental changes in the information previously disclosed., The SECs proposed complaint would allege that Bank of America erroneously and negligently concluded that no disclosure concerning these extraordinary losses was required as shareholders were called upon to vote on the proposed merger with Merrill Lynch. The Commission also would allege that the lack of any disclosure about the losses deprived shareholders of up-to-date information that was essential to their ability fairly to evaluate whether to approve the merger on the terms presented to them. According to the proposed complaint, Bank of Americas failure to disclose this information violated its undertaking to update shareholders concerning fundamental changes to previously disclosed information, and rendered its prior disclosures materially false and misleading., In the course of discovery in the pending case against Bank of America and earlier investigation, the Commissions staff reviewed tens of thousands of pages of records, including e-mail and other electronic communications relating to the merger. SEC staff took testimony or conducted investigative interviews of dozens of witnesses, including senior executives, internal counsel, and external counsel of both Bank of America and Merrill Lynch. Pursuant to a stipulation and order entered by the court in October 2009, Bank of America waived all claims of privilege relating to the proxy disclosures made in connection with the merger and several other subjects in order to permit the SEC to conduct a thorough investigation of these subjects, including the actions, advice and communications of counsel., According to the SECs proposed complaint, Bank of America executives at various times discussed the firms disclosure obligations with internal and external counsel. These executives are not alleged to have deliberately concealed information from counsel or otherwise acted with scienter or intent to mislead. Nor is any counsel alleged to have acted with scienter or intent to mislead. For these reasons, the SECs proposed complaint does not seek charges against any individual officers, directors or attorneys. SEC staff has advised the Commission that, after a careful assessment of the evidence and all of the relevant circumstances, it has determined that charges against individuals for their roles in connection with proxy disclosure are not appropriate., The SECs proposed second amended complaint adds an allegation that Bank of America has violated Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule 14a-9 by failing to make any disclosure to its shareholders of the losses that Merrill Lynch incurred in the two-month period leading to the Dec. 5, 2008 shareholder vote. The filing of the proposed second amended complaint is subject to the approval of the Honorable Jed S. Rakoff, before whom the case is pending. The Commissions authorization of the proposed second amended complaint concludes the investigation of its staff concerning the disclosures made in connection with the solicitation of proxies supporting Bank of Americas merger with Merrill Lynch., The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the U.S. Attorneys Offices for the Southern District of New York and Western District of North Carolina, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Office of The Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program., <b>See Also:</b> <a href=/litigation/complaints/2010/comp21371.pdf title=>SEC Complaint</a> ]"

Nadel., The SEC alleges that Neil V. Moody and his son, Christopher D. Moody, distributed materials to investors that overstated the historical returns and asset values of three hedge funds they managed and controlled: Valhalla Investment Partners, L.P.; Viking IRA Fund, LLC; and Viking Fund, LLC (the Moody Funds). Under an arrangement the Moodys had with him, Arthur Nadel provided all of the investment advice to the Moodys three hedge funds., According to the SECs complaint, filed in federal court in Tampa, Florida, from at least 2003 through December 2008, Neil and Christopher Moody disseminated to investors and prospective investors offering materials, account statements, and newsletters that misrepresented the Moody Funds historical investment returns and overstated their asset values by as much as $160 million. The Moodys made these representations to investors based on grossly overstated performance numbers that Nadel created and provided to them. The Moodys failed to independently verify the accuracy of the performance figures they received from Nadel and relied exclusively on Nadels information despite multiple red flags that should have caused them to question his figures., The complaint also alleges that the Moodys misled investors regarding their role in managing the assets of the Moody Funds by claiming that they controlled all of the investment and trading decisions. In truth, Nadel controlled nearly all of the Moody Funds investment and trading activities with no meaningful supervision or oversight by the Moodys., The SEC has charged the Moodys with securities fraud and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of illegal gains and financial penalties. Without admitting or denying the SECs allegations, the Moodys have consented to permanent injunctions against future securities fraud violations. The Moodys also consented to the entry of a Commission order that will bar them for five years from associating with any investment adviser., ]"

(NCFE); Donald Ayers, NCFEs former Chief Operating Officer and a former member of its board of directors; Randolph Speer, NCFEs former Chief Financial Officer; and Rebecca Parrett, NCFEs former Director of Accounts Receivable and also a member of the board of directors, resolving the Commissions charges that they orchestrated a fraud on institutional investors in securities issued by subsidiaries of NCFE., The final judgments, issued by Judge James L. Graham of the U. S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio on January 8, 2010, permanently enjoin Poulsen, Ayers, Parrett and Speer from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and permanently bar each of them from serving as an officer or director of a public company.

Myers, Florida; and Speer, formerly of Fayetteville, Georgia, consented to entry of final judgments without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. The court entered the final judgment against Parrett, formerly of Carefree, Florida, in absentia, because she is a fugitive from justice., On December 21, 2005, the Commission filed its civil action against Poulsen, Ayers, Parrett and Speer, alleging that they participated in a scheme to defraud investors in securities issued by subsidiaries of NCFE. See Litigation Release No. 19509 (December 21, 2005). The complaint alleges NCFE subsidiaries, known as programs, purchased medical accounts receivable from healthcare providers and issued notes that securitized those receivables. From at least February 1999 through October 2002, the programs raised at least $3.25 billion from the offer and sale of notes through private placements that were exempt from registration. Under the pertinent agreements, the programs were required to maintain specified reserve account balances and certain balances of medical accounts receivable as collateral to secure the notes. NCFE directors and officers depleted the programs reserve accounts and collateral base by advancing at least $1.2 billion from the programs funds to healthcare providers without receiving eligible receivables in return. These advances were essentially unsecured loans by the programs to distressed or defunct healthcare providers-many of which were wholly or partly owned by NCFE or its principals. The complaint further alleges NCFE officials misrepresented the status of the programs reserve accounts and collateral base to investors and concealed the reserve account and collateral shortfalls by creating or allowing the creation of false offering documents, monthly investor reports, and accounting records. When investors discovered the reserve account transfers and collateral shortfalls in late 2002, NCFE and the programs stopped providing funding to healthcare providers and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. As a result, approximately 275 healthcare providers were also forced to file for bankruptcy protection. NCFE and its programs have subsequently been liquidated., In a related criminal matter, a jury in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio had earlier convicted Poulsen, Ayers, Parrett and Speer for criminal violations, including securities fraud, based on the same facts underlying the Commissions civil action. On August 6, 2008, the court sentenced Ayers to 15 years in prison and Speer to 12 years in prison. On March 27, 2009, the court sentenced Poulsen to 30 years in prison and sentenced Parrett in absentia to 25 years in prison. Poulsen, Ayers, Parrett and Speer were also held jointly and severally liable to pay $2.38 billion in restitution to the victim investors., The Commission thanks the United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of Ohio and the Federal Bureau of Investigation for their assistance in this significant securities fraud investigation., ]"

On September 30, 2009 the U.S. Attorneys Office filed a criminal Information against Rennie, a licensed securities broker, charging that he defrauded investors by selling approximately $3.2 million in purported investments in federally subsidized real estate developments, among other things, and used the investors funds to pay his own expenses and debts. Rennie is scheduled for sentencing in front of U.S. District Judge Edward F. Harrington on April 13, 2010., The Commission previously filed a civil injunctive action against Rennie based on similar conduct on January 23, 2009. According to the Commissions complaint, from early 2007 through early 2009, Rennie made misrepresentations to several of his clients about investing their money in risk-free federal housing certificates that paid up to 12% per year, tax free, and were offered by a real estate investment company based in Boston. In fact, however, the complaint alleges that the investments were completely fictitious and that Rennie had no relationship with the real estate investment company whose name he used. According to the Commissions filings, Rennie defrauded clients who were elderly, including an 89 year old man. The filings allege that Rennie induced some clients to cash out their investments in annuities, incurring substantial surrender charges, in order to invest in his fraudulent program. According to the complaint, Rennie used investor proceeds to pay personal expenses, including a gym membership and liquor, grocery, shoe and department store purchases, and withdrew thousands of dollars in cash from the account where investor funds were sent., On May 18, 2009, the Commission obtained a final judgment by default against Rennie in which he was enjoined from future violations of the securities laws and ordered to pay disgorgement in the amount of $3,678,377, representing profits gained as a result of the conduct alleged in the Commissions Complaint, prejudgment interest in the amount of $30,653, and a penalty of $500,000., On May 29, 2009, the Commission instituted administrative proceedings against Rennie based on the entry of the final judgment by default in the civil injunctive action to determine what, if any, remedial action was appropriate and in the public interest. On August 12, 2009, Administrative Law Judge James T. Kelly issued an order by default barring Rennie from association with any broker or dealer or investment adviser., For further information, please see: Exchange Act Release No. <a href=/litigation/admin/2009/34-60482.pdf>60482</a> (August 12, 2009), Exchange Act Release No. <a href=/litigation/admin/2009/34-60007.pdf>60007</a> (May 29, 2009), Litigation Release Nos. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21043.htm>21043</a> (May 18, 2009), and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr20865.htm>20865</a> (January 23, 2009)., ]"

Middlebrooks of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida found Jamie L. Solow in contempt of court for failing to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of over $3.4 million ordered to be paid in a securities fraud case brought against him by the SEC. The sanction for Solows contempt is that on January 25, 2010, he must report to the U.S. Marshals Office to be taken into custody and incarcerated until he complies with the Courts order to pay., Following a nine-day trial in January of 2008, a jury found Solow liable for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), and for aiding and abetting violations of the net capital, books and records, and reporting provisions committed by one of his former firms, Archer Alexander Securities Corp. (Archer Alexander). The Commissions complaint alleged that in 2003, while associated with Archer Alexander, Solow engaged in a fraudulent trading scheme involving inverse floating rate collateralized mortgage obligations (inverse floaters), a highly complex, risky, and volatile type of mortgage-backed security derivative. The Commissions complaint also alleged that during 2003 to 2006, while associated with Archer Alexander and another registered broker, dealer, SAMCO Financial Services, Inc., Solow sold inverse floaters to retail investors with conservative to moderate investment objectives or low net worth for whom these complicated, volatile, and risky securities were unsuitable. Many of Solows customers, including numerous elderly or retired investors, incurred heavy or total losses when they liquidated their accounts or were unable to meet margin calls involving the inverse floaters., In its Order of Civil Contempt, the Court found that rather than pay the amounts ordered to be paid in the final judgment entered against him, Solow engaged in a purposeful campaign of asset dissipation by transferring his assets to his wife. Between January 2008 (the month in which his jury trial commenced) and April 2008 (several months after the jurys verdict against him), Solow and his wife liquidated securities accounts totaling over $1.5 million. Some of those funds were used to pay asset protection attorneys retained by Mrs. Solow a mere four (4) days after the jury verdict was entered against her husband. Moreover, in March 2008, Solow signed a $5.2 million mortgage on his residence in Hillsboro Beach. The proceeds of the mortgage were used to fund a CD now held by a Cook Islands trust for the benefit of Mrs. Solow. Notwithstanding these transfers, Solow claims to be a ward of his wife even though the Solows accumulated wealth has been derived exclusively from income earned by Mr. Solow alone. Finding that Mr. Solows inability to pay the judgment was self-created, the Court noted that Solow still lives a luxurious lifestyle, enjoying the benefits of the money he has made over the years, yet he refuses to repay the victims of his fraud. Such a situation cannot stand., Separately, the SEC filed a complaint for fraudulent transfer and foreclosure of equitable liens against Mrs. Solow that is also currently pending before Judge Middlebrooks.

Marquardt with insider trading in the shares of the Evergreen Ultra Short Opportunities Fund (the Ultra Fund), a mutual fund that invested primarily in mortgage-backed securities. At the time of his trading, Marquardt was the Senior Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer for operations of Boston-based Evergreen Investment Management Company, LLC (Evergreen), the investment adviser to the Ultra Fund. Among other things, Marquardt has agreed to pay approximately $40,000 to settle the charges., The Commissions complaint alleges that, on June 11, 2008, Marquardt learned that the Ultra Fund might soon reduce the value it assigned to several of its mortgage-backed securities holdings, a move that would likely decrease the Funds per-share net asset value (NAV) and might cause the Fund to close. The complaint further alleges that, on the next day, June 12, 2008, Marquardt redeemed all of his Ultra Fund shares and caused a family member to do the same. Over the next several days, the Fund did, in fact, decrease the value it assigned to its holdings, triggering significant reductions of the Funds NAV. On June 19, 2008, Evergreen publicly announced that the Ultra Fund would be liquidated. The Commissions complaint alleges that, by redeeming their Ultra Fund shares prior to the closing of the Fund on June 19, Marquardt and his family member avoided losses of approximately $4,803 and $14,304, respectively., To settle the Commissions charges, Marquardt consented, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Marquardt also agreed to pay $19,107 in disgorgement, representing the losses that he and his family member avoided, $1,242 in prejudgment interest, and a $19,107 civil penalty. In separate administrative proceedings to be instituted after the entry of the permanent injunctions, Marquardt has also consented to be barred from association with any broker, dealer or investment adviser, with a right to reapply after two years., The Commissions action against Marquardt follows the Commissions enforcement action against Evergreen and an affiliated distributor, filed in June 2009, in which the Commission charged Evergreen with violating the federal securities laws in connection with, among other things, overvaluing holdings in the Ultra Fund from February 2007 to June 2008. Evergreen agreed to pay more than $40 million to settle those charges., The SEC acknowledges the assistance of Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts William F.

Senior officials at Gen Re helped AIG structure the two sham transactions. The contracts show reinsurance transactions that appeared to transfer risk to AIG, but the transactions did not transfer risk., The complaint further alleges that Gen Re separately entered into a series of sham reinsurance contracts with Prudentialâs property and casualty division from 1997 to 2002. The contracts had no economic substance and purpose other than to allow Prudential to build up and then draw down on an off-balance sheet asset or âfinite bankâ parked with Gen Re. As a result of the sham transactions, Prudential improperly recognized more than $200 million in revenues in 2000, 2001, and 2002. Gen Re received fees totaling $8.1Â million for structuring and executing the scheme with Prudential., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Gen Re has consented to a judgment enjoining it from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and directing it to pay $12.2 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest. The settlement is subject to court approval., In determining to accept Gen Reâs settlement offer, the SEC took Gen Reâs remediation efforts and cooperation into account. Among the efforts SEC considered: Gen Reâs comprehensive, independent review of its operations conducted at the outset of the governmentâs investigations the results of which were shared with investigators; Gen Reâs substantial assistance in the governmentâs successful civil and criminal actions against individuals involved in the scheme with AIG; and Gen Reâs internal corporate reforms designed to strengthen oversight of its operations. Those reforms entail dissolving a subsidiary involved with the AIG transactions, appointing an independent director to its Board of Directors, forming a committee consisting of senior managers to review and approve complex transactions, requiring legal review of proposed finite or loss mitigation contracts, and fortifying its internal audit functions and underwriting rules., The SEC previously charged AIG with securities fraud and improper accounting, and the company settled the charges by paying more than $800 million among other remedies. The SEC also previously charged AIG former chairman MauriceÂ R. âHankâ Greenberg and former chief financial officer HowardÂ I. Smith, as well as former senior executives of Gen Re for their roles in connection with the scheme with AIG.

Braver has agreed to settle the case, without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations., The Commissions complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that from October 2006 to November 2007, Braver was a salesman at Rabinovich &amp; Associates, LP, an unregistered investment company and broker-dealer (sometimes referred to hereafter as the Fund or the firm) that operated out of a storefront boiler room in Brooklyn, New York.

Braver allegedly raised at least $157,000 of that, and received approximately $49,800 in salary and commissions in connection with his fraudulent offer and sale of interests in the Fund. The complaint further alleges that in soliciting investors, Braver misrepresented the Funds track record and performance, falsely represented to investors and prospective investors that Rabinovich &amp; Associates had a Wall Street address and touted Alex Rabinovichs purported trading acumen while failing to disclose that Rabinovich had been barred by the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) from associating with any NASD-member broker-dealer., As a result of his conduct, the complaint alleges that Braver violated Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act, and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder., Without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, Braver has agreed to settle the charges by consenting to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from further violations of the foregoing provisions, and ordering him to pay disgorgement of $49,800 plus prejudgment interest thereon of $4,109.83, but waiving payment of those amounts and not imposing a civil penalty based upon Bravers sworn representations of his financial condition., The Commission previously brought an action against, Rabinovich &amp; Associates, Alex Rabinovich and Lovaglio, SEC v.

Assurant, Inc.</i>, Civil Action No. 10-Civ.-0484 (MGC) (SDNY)</h2>, <h2>SEC Charges Assurant, Inc. With Improper Reinsurance Accounting</h2>]","[, On January 21, 2010, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York charging Assurant, Inc., a publicly-traded insurance company, with violating corporate reporting, books and records and internal controls provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act). Assurant has offered to settle the charges by consenting, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining Assurant from violating these Exchange Act provisions and imposing a civil penalty in the amount of $3.5 million., The Commissions complaint alleges that Assurant improperly accounted for a $10 million recovery it obtained under a reinsurance policy in the aftermath of the 2004 Florida hurricane season. The complaint alleges that Assurant booked the $10 million payment as a bona fide reinsurance recovery when, in fact, the payment was, and should have been booked as, the return of a deposit under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). As a result, Assurant materially overstated the net income that it reported for the quarter ended September 30, 2004 to the public and in Commission filings., The Commissions complaint specifically alleges as follows: Assurant failed to properly account for $10 million that one of its business segments (Assurant Solutions) obtained from American Re-Insurance Company (Am Re), a private reinsurer, in the third quarter of 2004 under a reinsurance policy that originated in 1992 and was renewed annually through 2004. The arrangement between Assurant (through its subsidiaries that comprise Assurant Solutions) and Am Re consisted of the formal reinsurance treaty documents (<i>i.e.</i> the written policy contract) and an oral side-agreement, which the parties referred to as their handshake agreement., Although the terms of the written treaty transferred the risk of certain losses from Assurant Solutions to Am Re under certain conditions, the terms of the so-called handshake agreement negated the transfer of risk. Pursuant to this handshake agreement, Assurant Solutions agreed that if the total amount of claims paid by Am Re exceeded the total amount of premiums paid by Assurant Solutions over the life of the treaty, Assurant Solutions would reimburse Am Re for the difference. In return, Am Re agreed that if the total amount of premiums paid by Assurant Solutions exceeded the total amount of claims paid by Am Re, Am Re would return the difference to Assurant Solutions., Assurant accounted for the Am Re treaty improperly by using principles of reinsurance accounting instead of deposit accounting. Under reinsurance accounting, the reinsured is permitted to offset relevant losses in the amount of the probable recovery under a reinsurance agreement, which reduces the impact of those losses on the reinsureds income statement. Under deposit accounting, the payment by the reinsurer is treated as the return of a loan or deposit and cannot be used to offset losses on the income statement. Because the handshake agreement between Assurant and Am Re, and in particular its pay-back provision, negated risk transfer, GAAP required the use of deposit accounting and not reinsurance accounting for the premiums paid and any recoveries made under this particular treaty., After the 2004 Florida hurricane season, Assurant booked a $10 million claim payment made by Am Re as a reinsurance recovery rather than the return of a deposit, thereby reducing the adverse impact of the hurricane losses incurred by Assurant Solutions on Assurants reported financial results. By improperly booking the $10 million payment using reinsurance accounting instead of deposit accounting, Assurant overstated its net income for the quarter ended September 30, 2004 by $6.41 million, or 9.4%. Assurant misstated its financial results for the third quarter of 2004 to the public in two Forms 8-K, filed on November 4 and December 22, 2004, and in a Form 10-Q filed on November 12, 2004., Assurant is charged in the SECs complaint with violating Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-11 and 13a-13. In offering to settle these charges, Assurant has consented, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it from violating the foregoing Exchange Act provisions and imposing a civil penalty in the amount of $3.5 million. The determination of this penalty amount took into account, among other things, the companys failure fully to comply with Commission subpoenas on a timely basis.

(East Delta), Victor Sun, David Amsel and Mayer Amsel in United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, alleging that they violated the Federal securities laws in a scheme to manipulate the market for the securities of East Delta. According to the complaint, from 2004 through at least 2006, the Defendants pumped up the volume of market activity of East Delta stock, issued false press releases and illegally sold East Delta shares that they had received from East Delta at little or no cost. The fraudulent proceeds from this scheme totaled more than $1,400,000., The complaint alleges that from 2004 through at least 2006, Mayer Amsel, a consultant to East Delta, engaged in wash sales, matched orders, and other manipulative trading to give the market the false impression that there was real demand for East Delta shares. During this period, East Deltas share price generally moved upward from around $.25 in early 2004 to a high of just above $1 in September 2005 and February 2006. The complaint further alleges that David Amsel, Mayer Amsels brother and the companys investor relations contact, gave Mayer full authority to trade in his Canadian and U.S. brokerage accounts that Mayer Amsel used to conduct his manipulative trading of East Delta stock. According to the complaint, the purportedly free trading shares Mayer Amsel used to conduct his manipulation came both from East Delta via an improper registration statement on Form S-8, as well as from millions of shares that CEO Victor Sun secretly controlled in the name of others. The complaint also alleges that David Amsel and Victor Sun, as the manipulative trading was ongoing, prepared and caused East Delta to issue and file materially false and misleading and touting press releases and Commission filings about East Deltas mining business. The complaint alleges that David and Mayer Amsel together earned at least $800,000 from the fraudulent scheme, and that Sun earned at least $600,000. In addition, the complaint alleges that East Delta has failed entirely to file its required annual report for 2008 and quarterly reports for the first three quarters in 2009 to the Commission., The Commissions complaint alleges that East Delta, Sun and the Amsels violated or aided and abetted violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Sections 10(b) and 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 12b-20 and 13a-1. The complaint alleges that East Delta also violated Exchange Act Rule 13a-13, and that Sun violated Exchange Act Section 16(a) and Rules 13a-14 and 16a-3. It seeks a judgment permanently enjoining Defendants from violating these securities laws, requiring an accounting and the payment of disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, requiring the payment of civil monetary penalties, barring Sun and the Amsels from participating in future penny stock offerings, and barring Sun and David Amsel from serving as an officer or director of a registered issuer., Separately, on January 13, 2010 the Commission suspended trading in East Delta securities for failure to file periodic reports, and today ordered that administrative proceedings be instituted to determine whether to revoke or suspend the registration of the securities of East Delta., The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the British Columbia Securities Commission, the Quebec Autorite des Marches Financiers and FINRA in its investigation., For further information, see Release No. <a href=/litigation/suspensions/2010/34-61341.pdf>34-61341</a>, Jan. 13, 2009, and Release No. <a href=/litigation/admin/2010/34-61423.pdf>34-61423</a>, January 26, 2010, and Complaint, Securities and Exchange Commission v.

The insider trading now alleged in the Commissions enforcement action cumulatively generated more than $52 million in illicit trading profits or losses avoided. The SAC also recounts details of an illicit payment scheme between Rajaratnam and Kumar, in which Rajaratnam paid Kumar for material non-public information that Rajaratnam then used to trade on behalf of his hedge fund, Galleon Management, LP (Galleon), generating almost $20 million in illicit profits. From 2003 to October 2009, Rajaratnam paid Kumar $1.75 to $2 million for inside information, and Kumar reinvested some of those funds in a nominee account at Galleon, earning, together with the profits on such reinvestments, a combined total of roughly $2.6 million for his participation in the scheme. The SAC adds a claim relating to these allegations against Kumar for violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act)., The SECs initial Complaint, filed on October 16, 2009, alleged that six individuals, including Rajaratnam and Kumar, and two hedge funds, engaged in widespread and repeated insider trading that generated over $25 million in profits. Rajaratnam is the founder and a Managing General Partner of Galleon, a New York hedge fund which at the time had billions of dollars under management. When the complaint was filed, Kumar, a friend of Rajaratnams and a Galleon investor, was a director at the global consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Co. (McKinsey). The Commissions complaint alleged that Rajaratnam unlawfully traded based on inside information involving eight different companies. It further alleged that Kumar acquired material non-public information while working as a McKinsey consultant and passed that information to Rajaratnam, who traded on it. The complaint charged Rajaratnam and Kumar with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Rajaratnam with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act.

Wehrs (Wehrs) and Maryland Title and Escrow Co., Inc. (MTE), a title and escrow company Wehrs owns and operates, alleging an offering fraud in which Wehrs persuaded at least 13 investors to participate in a purported FDIC-insured fund. Wehrs resides and MTE is headquartered in Annapolis, MD. The SEC also submitted for the Courts consideration a proposed settlement., Simultaneous with the filing of the SEC action, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the District of Maryland filed a criminal information charging Wehrs with wire fraud arising out of the same conduct that is the subject of the Commissions Complaint., The SECs Complaint alleges that through at least July 2009, Wehrs acted as an investment adviser and fraudulently induced at least 13 investors to provide him with at least $1.96 million for investment into a purported FDIC-insured money market fund that Wehrs guaranteed would pay 10.85 percent interest annually. The SEC alleges that, at times, Wehrs also represented to potential investors that the investment he offered was affiliated with American Funds, the mutual fund company. In fact, these representations were false., Instead, according to the Commissions Complaint, Wehrs misappropriated and used the investment principal for personal and business reasons, including: (1) to day trade funds in a brokerage account in the name of his business, MTE; (2) to support his home improvement company, Show-Me, Inc. (3) to make escrow payments for his title company; (4) to buy real estate and personal property; (5) to vacation in the British Virgin Islands; and (6) to make Ponzi-like payments to investors., The SEC Complaint further alleges that to conceal his fraudulent scheme, Wehrs fabricated and issued account statements to investors on his businesses letterhead purporting to show investors balances in their accounts and the interest gained on their investments. The scheme appears to have depleted substantially all of the investors monies., The Complaint alleges that Wehrs and MTE violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The Complaint also alleges that Wehrs and MTE violated Sections 206(1), (2), and (4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers Act) and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder. The Commission seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties., Without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, Wehrs consented to entry of a permanent injunction from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), (2), and (4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder. Wehrs has also consented to the entry of a follow-on administrative order in a separate administrative proceeding by the Commission, without admitting or denying the findings therein, that will permanently bar him from association with an investment adviser based on the anticipated entry of the injunction. This proposed settlement, which has been submitted to the Court for its consideration, does not include disgorgement, prejudgment interest, or civil money penalties based upon the federal criminal forfeiture or restitution orders and federal criminal statutory penalties that Wehrs is subject to in the parallel criminal proceeding., The Commission acknowledges the assistance and cooperation of the United States Attorneys Office for the District of Maryland, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Maryland Attorney Generals Office, and the Maryland Insurance Administration., <b>See Also:</b> <a href=/litigation/complaints/2010/comp21399.pdf title=>SEC Complaint</a> ]"

According to the complaint, the defendants raised approximately $2 million from investors, purportedly for the development and marketing of childrens books., The SEC alleges that Winning Kids and Hainsworth defrauded investors by offering and selling unregistered securities through a series of private offerings, which they marketed primarily through radio advertisements. The SEC also charged sales agents Robert Comiskey, Edward Tamimi, and Victor Selenow for their role in the scheme., According to the SECs complaint, the defendants misrepresented to investors that the company was already established, expanding nationally, and starting an acceleration phase of extraordinary growth. In reality, Winning Kids generated almost no revenue from the sale of its books or any other products from 2004 through 2008. The complaint also alleges the defendants provided investors with baseless profit projections of 300 percent annual returns at a time when the company was not even actively attempting to commercially sell and distribute the books.

According to the complaint, the actions of Czarnik allowed three stock promoters â Ryan Reynolds, Jason Wynn and Carlton Fleming â to purchase millions of shares of stock in three penny stock companies for pennies per share, hype the companies through promotional mailers and other advertising, and illicitly sell their shares to the public for millions of dollars in profits. The Commission alleges that because the shares were not registered, Reynolds, Wynn and Fleming were able to deprive the investing public of important information about the actual financial condition and business operations of the companies., According to the SEC, Czarnik purportedly served as counsel to the companies â My Vintage Baby, Inc., Alchemy Creative, Inc., and Beverage Creations, Inc. â and issued legal opinion letters and other documents proclaiming improper registration exemptions under Rule 504 of Regulation D. In these documents, Czarnik falsely represented that Reynolds, Wynn and Fleming intended to hold, rather than illegally distribute, shares of My Vintage Baby, Inc., Alchemy Creative, Inc. and Beverage Creations, Inc. in the public market. The SEC alleges that Czarnik knew or was reckless in not knowing that Reynolds, Wynn and Fleming intended to distribute the stock because he received emails describing the distribution plan and saw other indications of their promotional and trading activities., The SEC alleges that by the above-mentioned conduct, Czarnik served as a necessary and substantial participant in unregistered offerings of stock, and as such, violated the registration provisions of the Securities laws, Sections 5(a) and (c) of the Securities Act of 1933. The SEC also alleges that by his fraudulent statements in the opinion letters and other associated documents, Czarnik violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The order of permanent injunction against all of the defendants was entered on January 25, 2008., The Court made significant findings of fact and conclusions of law in the final judgment against Jeffery and Repke. Specifically, the Court concluded that the defendants falsely represented to investors that they would receive a return of from 3 to 6% per month, misrepresented that their principal was protected and never left the escrow account; and that Jeffery and Repke failed to disclose that they made loans to themselves from the investor proceeds. The Court also concluded that the defendants transferred the majority of the funds to Exodus Equities, Inc.

21408,2010,"[<h2>U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION</h2>, <h2>Litigation Release No. 21408 / February 4, 2010</h2>]","[, <b>SEC Charges State Street for Misleading Investors About Subprime Mortgage Investments</b>, The Securities and Exchange Commission (âCommissionâ) today filed a settled civil action charging Massachusetts-based State Street Bank and Trust Company (âState Streetâ) with securities law violations for misleading investors during the subprime mortgage crisis in 2007 about the extent of subprime mortgage-backed securities held in certain funds under its management, and then selectively disclosing more complete information about subprime investments to certain investors.Â  Investors in the funds lost over $60 million during the subprime market meltdown in mid-2007.Â  State Street has already paid back over $300 million to harmed investors, and has agreed to pay over $300 million more to settle the SECâs action, all of which will be returned to investors., The Commissionâs complaint alleges that State Street established the Limited Duration Bond Fund (âthe Fundâ) in 2002 and marketed it as an âenhanced cashâ investment strategy that was an alternative to a money market fund for certain types of investors.Â  By 2007, however, the Fund was almost entirely invested in subprime residential mortgage-backed securities and derivatives that magnified its exposure to subprime securities.Â  The SEC alleged that State Street continued to describe the Fund to prospective and current investors as having better sector diversification than a typical money market fund, while failing to disclose the extent of the Fundâs concentration in subprime investments.Â , According to the complaint, beginning in July 2007, State Street sent investors a series of misleading communications concerning the effect of the turmoil in the subprime market on the Fund and other State Street funds that invested in the Fund.Â  At the same time, State Street provided certain investors with more complete information about the Fundâs subprime concentration and other problems with the Fund.Â  These other investors included clients of State Streetâs internal advisory groups, which provided advisory services to some of the investors in the Fund and the related funds.Â  According to the Commissionâs complaint, State Streetâs internal advisory groups subsequently decided to recommend that all their clients redeem from the Fund and the related funds.Â  The pension plan of State Streetâs publicly-traded parent company (State Street Corporation) was one of those clients.Â  The SEC alleged that State Street sold the Fundâs most liquid holdings and used the cash it received from these sales to meet the redemption demands of better informed investors, leaving the Fund and its remaining investors with largely illiquid holdings., Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, State Street consented to the entry of a final judgment ordering it to pay a civil penalty of $50 million, disgorgement of $7,331,020, and $1,019,161 in prejudgment interest.Â  These amounts will be paid into a Fair Fund and for the benefit of harmed investors, together with an additional amount of $255,240,472 that State Street has agreed to pay to compensate harmed investors.Â  State Street also gets credit for having already paid over $340 million to some harmed investors through settlements of private actions, resulting in total compensation to injured investors of $663,191,540. Â , Additionally, State Street agreed to retain an Independent Compliance Consultant to conduct a comprehensive review of the companyâs disclosures, compliance and other policies and procedures for its pooled investment strategies., The Commission today also instituted related cease-and-desist proceedings against State Street concerning the same conduct.Â  In connection with these proceedings, State Street agreed to an order requiring it to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Section 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) the Securities Act of 1933.Â  For further information, please see Securities Act Release No. <a href=/litigation/admin/2010/33-9107.pdf>33-9107</a> (February 4, 2010)., The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the Massachusetts Securities Division, and the Massachusetts Attorney Generalâs Office, each of whom filed related actions against State Street., The Commissionâs investigation is ongoing., <b>See Also:</b> <a href=/litigation/complaints/2010/comp21408.pdf title=>SEC Complaint</a> ]"

The Commissions complaint, filed as an emergency enforcement action on January 7, 2010, alleges that Elkinson, of Framingham, Massachusetts, lured at least 130 investors to invest approximately $28 million with him through his d/b/a Northeast Sales, which he operated out of his home., The Commissions complaint alleges that since at least 1997, Elkinson offered and sold unregistered securities in the form of promissory notes. According to the complaint, Elkinson falsely told investors that he was in the business of brokering contracts on behalf of a Japanese firm that manufactured uniforms (such as police uniforms and prison uniforms) to be sold to large purchasers such as state and local governments (and even the U.S. Olympic Committee) and that investors money would be used to help finance specific uniform contracts. The investors received promissory notes signed by Elkinson, with terms that generally required payment within 300 to 330 days and with an interest rate that ranged from 9% to 13%. According to the complaint, however, Elkinson had no relationship with a Japanese uniform manufacturer, and there were no contracts to purchase uniforms. The Commission alleges that, while some investors did receive payments of principal and interest, those payments were made using funds obtained from other investors, and Elkinson was able to keep the scheme going as long as most of the investors kept rolling over their investments. In reality, according to the complaint, Elkinson used most of the investors money for his own personal purposes, including gambling., The Commissions complaint alleges that Elkinson violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The Honorable Joseph L. Tauro issued a preliminary injunction against further violations of the securities laws, an order freezing Elkinsons assets and all proceeds of the misconduct held by others, an order prohibiting the acceptance of additional investor funds, and an order prohibiting the alteration or destruction of relevant documents., Elkinson was arrested on January 5, 2010 by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and was charged criminally by the United States Attorneys Office for the District of Massachusetts.

The SECs complaint alleges that from approximately January 2005 until March 2007, the Defendants spearheaded a scheme to defraud the banks and their depositors by secretly using relatives and business entities as nominees to acquire stock in those conversions in contravention of the offering terms and applicable banking regulations. Over the course of the fraudulent scheme, the Defendants reaped $659,512 in ill-gotten profits from secondary market sales of the fraudulently obtained stock., The SECs complaint alleges that the defendants sought to circumvent federal and state banking regulations that prohibit the depositors of the converting banks from either transferring ownership of their stock subscription rights, or entering into any agreement regarding the sale or transfer of shares purchased in the offering. The SEC alleges that the Defendants and their nominees opened accounts at seven mutual savings banks and when the banks undertook a conversion the Defendants secretly purchased the bank stock through their nominees, controlled the sale of these shares, and retained most of the trading profits. The SECs complaint further alleges that the Defendants directed the nominees to submit stock order forms in which they falsely certified they were purchasing the stock for their own account and had no agreement to transfer shares or the proceeds of their sale to anyone else. The Defendants scheme limited the amount of stock available to other depositors., The SECs complaint, which was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, alleges that Samuel and Joyce Vitale violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Samuel and Joyce Vitale have consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from committing future violations of the above provisions, and orders them to pay $757,179 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and $150,000 in civil penalties each., <b>See Also:</b> <a href=/litigation/complaints/2010/comp21411.pdf title=>SEC Complaint</a> ]"

Horn, a doctor of ophthalmology, is both an employee of LCA and the owner of the Illinois professional corporation that operates LCA facilities in the Chicago area., The SECs complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, alleges that, between December 2005 and August 2006, Horn traded on the basis of material, non-public information when he made six separate purchases of LCA call and put options, resulting in illicit gains of approximately $869,629. Horn also traded on the basis of material, non-public information when he decided to exercise LCA stock option grants and sell the stock, resulting in a loss avoided of approximately $533,603., According to the SEC complaint, Horn traded on the basis of information contained in LCAs internal Eyes by Laser Reports, which provided non-public information regarding LCAs total number of laser eye surgeries performed and revenue generated from these procedures. These reports also allowed him to successfully predict whether LCAs earnings would miss or beat LCAs previous earnings guidance previously provided to the public., The SEC complaint further alleges that, because Horn had material nonpublic information about LCA, Horn <em>never</em> lost money on any of his multiple trades in LCA options, despite his complete lack of prior experience in options trading. Moreover, according to the complaint, Horn was able, with great precision and agility, to switch his trades between calls and puts, predicting that LCAs earnings would either beat or miss its targets, and thus that the price of LCA stock would either rise or fall, and remarkably made the correct decision every time., The complaint alleges that, during sworn testimony before the SEC, Horn provided numerous false explanations for his timely trading in LCA securities., According to the SEC complaint, Horn violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The complaint alleges that Scoppetuolo, a World Fuel executive, tipped his best friend, Tocci, the companyâs former Chief Financial Officer, about material, non-public information related to its earnings. The complaint alleges that Tocci then used that information to purchase put options in World Fuel and to sell and short its stock before both earnings announcements.

At the same time, Greenstone and Miwa fraudulently pumped the market for Greenstone stock by issuing a series of false and misleading press releases and hiring third-party stock promoters to circulate many of these statements on the internet and via email. On June 18, 2008, as part of its Anti-Spam Initiative, the SEC suspended trading in Greenstones securities., The SEC alleges that from approximately 2006, Defendants arranged for Greenstone to issue stock to certain entities that Pierson, Starczewski, Morelli, Overcash, and Painter controlled, for further sale to the general public, all through unregistered securities transactions. At various times over the next two years, Pierson, Starczewski, Morelli, Overcash, and Painter widely marketed and sold the Greenstone shares to the public, illegally using the sale proceeds to finance Greenstones business activities and directly for Defendants own personal benefit. At the same time, defendants Greenstone, Miwa, Frohling, Pierson, Starczewski, and Overcash engaged in a fraudulent scheme to cover up these illegal stock sales, including providing Greenstones stock transfer agent with false and misleading legal opinions and preparing back-dated and otherwise false promissory notes., In addition, according to the SECs complaint, Greenstone and Miwa intentionally prepared and disseminated to the public a long series of materially false and misleading press releases announcing fictitious Greenstone business transactions and otherwise creating the false appearance of a thriving company. Acting with Miwas knowledge and consent, Starczewski, Overcash, and Painter also hired a multitude of stock promoters to tout Greenstone (and its stock price) through widely-distributed internet campaigns. Often these materials repeated the false and misleading claims set out in the companys press releases, while failing to disclose that Greenstone had paid for the campaigns with its illegal stock issuances., The SEC further alleges that Defendants sold the illegally issued Greenstone shares to the public, reaping proceeds in excess of $1.3 million between September 2006 and June 2008. Moreover, a portion of these sales were directed back to Greenstone., The complaint also names as relief defendants thirteen companies controlled by the defendants and through which the defendants directed their illegal public sales of Greenstones stock., The SECs complaint alleges that all defendants violated Sections 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the Securities Act) and that Greenstone, Miwa, Starczewski, Overcash, Pierson, and Frohling violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Natt, 54, of Palos Verdes Estates, Calif., and his Palos Verdes Estates, Calif.-based company, Pacific Asian Atlantic Foundation (PAAF), for offering billions in fraudulent PAAF bonds from late 2006 through 2009. The complaint alleges that the defendants created the false impression that the bonds were genuine debt securities by drafting and disseminating fraudulent offering memoranda that misrepresented, among other things, PAAFs assets and financial condition, its ability and intent to pay the principal and interest on the bonds, the riskiness of the offering, and PAAFs intended use of the bond proceeds. The complaint further alleges that Natt and PAAF attempted to legitimize the bonds by obtaining corporate bond identification numbers from the CUSIP Service Bureau based upon PAAFs misleading offering memoranda. According to the complaint, the defendants took these actions to ensure that registered broker-dealers and other financial institutions would accept the worthless bonds and deposit them into accounts held by PAAF., The complaint further alleges that Natt made four separate attempts to deposit the bonds at various registered broker-dealers. Once deposited into a PAAF brokerage account, Natt intended that the bonds either be used as collateral for loans or sold into the market. To induce these broker-dealers to accept the bonds for deposit into PAAFs account, the complaint alleges that Natt falsely claimed that the bonds were valid debt securities issued by PAAF in a private placement offering. The complaint alleges that Natt sent several of the broker-dealers PAAFs misleading bond offering memoranda, which included PAAFs false financial statements claiming assets of $5.3 billion, and the CUSIP Service Bureau information. When Natts efforts at the broker-dealers failed, Natt caused PAAF to issue bonds with a total purported face value of $97 billion to various third parties. The SEC alleges that Natt instructed those parties, who acted as middle-men on behalf of PAAF, to offer the bonds to financial institutions to obtain lines of credit or sell the bonds into the market. Natt promised to split any returns obtained from the bonds up to 50% between the third parties and PAAF.

Finally, the judgment imposes civil penalties of $2,000,000 against Suman of $1,000,000 against Rahman., The Commissions complaint, filed on July 24, 2007, alleged that Suman and Rahman traded on material, nonpublic information involving MDS, Inc.s impending tender offer for the shares of Molecular Devices Corp., then based in Sunnyvale, California, in late January 2007. The court found that Suman learned about secret merger negotiations through access he had to electronic data in his job as an information technology specialist at Ontario-based MDS. In particular, Suman was able to read the contents of confidential e-mails and other electronic data without detection. By January 23, 2007, Suman had learned enough to start conducting Internet searches for the internal corporate code name for the MDS-Molecular merger as well as for Molecular Devices itself. Shortly after running those searches, Suman called Rahman, who was then living in Utah, and spoke to her for an unusually long time., Between Jan. 24 and Jan. 26, 2007, Suman and Rahman bought 12,000 Molecular shares and 900 Molecular call options. Some of these purchases were financed with a margin loan of approximately $200,000, and the couple previously did not have a position in Molecular securities. On Jan. 29, 2007, MDS and Molecular jointly announced the tender offer for Moleculars shares. The stock price immediately rose from almost $24 to roughly $35, generating trading profits to Rahman and Suman of more than $1 million., See also: <a href=http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20203.htm>LR 20203</a> (July 24, 2007), ]"

Loomis told investors they were investing in safe âliquid high-yield accountsâ that would earn 12 percent returns guaranteed by a third party. The SECâs complaint alleges that Loomis and Hagener instead used the money primarily to prop up Loomisâ other failing businesses. The SEC further alleges that Loomis paid himself hundreds of thousands of dollars from companies that received investor money and Hagener received more than $190,000 for managing the funds even though he was misappropriating investorsâ money to fund other businesses., According to the SECâs complaint, filed in federal court in Sacramento, Loomis attracted investors to âLoomis Wealth Solutionsâ seminars held in 2007 and 2008 through newspaper advertisements and direct mailings. Loomis solicited seminar attendees to invest in two investment funds called the âNaras Secured Funds,â claiming the funds would make short-term secured loans to homebuyers, yielding 12 percent returns to investors. The SEC alleges that, contrary to Loomisâ promises, the loans were primarily used to pay such operating expenses as payroll, utilities, and travel expenses for several other businesses owned by Loomis, and to prop up a related real estate scheme. The SEC also alleges that the loans were not secured by real estate deeds of trust as Loomis had claimed. Hagener allegedly facilitated the scheme by transferring investorsâ money to accounts that he knew were being used to fund the other businesses. Hagener also allegedly sent investors fake account statements falsely stating that their investments had earned 12 percent returns., In its federal court action against Loomis, Hagener, Loomis Wealth Solutions, LLC (âLWSâ), and Lismar Financial Services, LLC (âLismarâ), the SEC alleges Loomis, LWS, Hagener and Lismar violated Sections 5(a), (c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (âSecurities Actâ) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Madoff Investment Securities LLC (BMIS) and oversaw the firmâs accounting and securities clearing functions for at least 30 years.Â  The SEC alleges that Bonventre knew that billions of dollars in investor funds were not being used to purchase securities on behalf of investors.Â  The SEC further alleges that Bonventre made at least $1.9 million in illicit personal profits from the scheme through fake, backdated âtradesâ in his own investor account at BMIS., According to the SECâs complaint, Bonventre was responsible for the firmâs general ledger and financial statements that were materially misstated because they did not reflect the manner in which investor funds were maintained and used.Â  Bonventure ensured that BMIS financial reports did not reflect the firmâs massive liabilities to investors or the corresponding assets received from investors.Â  To hide the fact that BMIS normally operated at a significant loss, the firm used more than $750 million in investor funds to artificially improve reported revenue and income., The SEC alleges that Bonventre also helped Madoff, his lieutenant Frank DiPascali, Jr., and others orchestrate lies to investors and regulators when investment advisory operations at BMIS came under review.Â  With Bonventreâs assistance, they made serial misrepresentations to external reviewers by manufacturing reams of false reports and data., The SEC further alleges that Bonventre personally siphoned $1.9 million from the scheme by directing that profits from fake, backdated trades be put into his own investor account at BMIS.Â  One of these trades was backdated by 12 years.Â  Bonventure instructed another fake, backdated trade in a handwritten note to a BMIS employee that read: <i>âHi â¦ As per our phone conversation, I need a long term capital gain of $449000.-- on an investment of $129000- for a sale proceed of $578000.--Â  Iâll be back in NY on March 30th but if you need to speak to me before then, call meâ¦.Â  Thanks[,] Dan.âÂ </i>, This is the SECâs seventh enforcement action in the Madoff fraud since the scheme collapsed in December 2008.

Haleâfor their respective roles in an alleged pattern of insider trading and tipping in the securities of four public companies over a 22-month period that yielded illegal profits totaling $210,580.62. The four public companies involved are Crocs, Inc., YRC Worldwide, Inc., Spectralink Corporation and SigmaTel, Inc. All four defendants have agreed to settle the Commissions charges without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions Complaint, and their settlement papers have been submitted to the Court for its consideration. Separately, a fifth individual, Tara R. Eisler, was named in a related administrative proceeding instituted and simultaneously settled today., According to the Complaint, which was filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, Foley served as an employee benefits specialist at Deloitte between July 2005 and May 2007, and learned, through his work on Deloitte client engagements, material, non-public information concerning (i) Crocs first earnings release after going public; (ii) a potential acquisition of YRC by a third party (that ultimately was not consummated); and (iii) the acquisition of Spectralink, via tender offer, by another public company. According to the Complaint, Foley traded in all three issuers securities based on this material, non-public information through nominee accounts; Foley also tipped his friend Vernier concerning all, and Grassian concerning part, of this information; and both men traded on Foleys communications., The Complaint further alleges that Grassian later reciprocated by, in turn, tipping Foley concerning the acquisition of SigmaTel by Freescale Semiconductor, Inc., after learning of that pending acquisition from his friend and former colleague, Hale, who worked on the acquisition for Freescale. According to the Complaint, Grassian traded on Hales tips for himself, and also passed them on to Foley, who, in turn, both traded in SigmaTel for himself, and also tipped Vernier and recommended SigmaTel to others, who likewise traded. The Complaint further alleges that Vernier substantially assisted Foleys insider trading violations as to Crocs by allowing Foley to trade in Crocs securities through Verniers account, while knowing of or recklessly disregarding Foleys breaches of duty to Deloitte and to Crocs. Finally, the Complaint alleges that, since Crocs was a Deloitte audit client and Foley served on the Crocs audit team at the time of his Crocs trading and tipping, Foley also committed, and caused his firm to commit, an auditor-independence violation, and caused related issuer-reporting violations by the issuer., According to the Complaint, by their conduct each defendant violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; defendants Foley, Grassian and Vernier also violated Exchange Act Section 14(e) and Rule 14e-3 thereunder; defendant Vernier aided and abetted Foleys violation of Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; defendant Foley violated, and aided and abetted and caused Deloittes violation of, Rule 2-02(b) of Regulation S-X; and Foley also aided and abetted and caused Crocs violation of Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rule 13a-13 thereunder.

Sentencing is scheduled for May 7, 2010. Georgiou faces a maximum sentence of 165 years in prison and $21.25 million in fines., The Commission previously filed a civil injunctive action against Georgiou based on similar conduct. According to the Commissionâs complaint, from 2004 through September 2008, Georgiou, who controlled the publicly-traded stock of each company, manipulated the market for the purpose of artificially inflating each companyâs stock price or to create the false appearance of an active and liquid market. In order to do so, Georgiou used many nominee accounts that he either directly or indirectly controlled at offshore broker-dealers and banks, and used a variety of manipulative techniques, including matched orders and wash sales. The Complaint alleges that ultimately, Georgiou realized at least $20.9 million in ill-gotten gains from his manipulation schemes through sales of artificially inflated stock and by using the artificially inflated stock as collateral to fraudulently obtain âmarginâ and other cash loans from Bahamian brokerage firms. The Commissionâs action, filed in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania on February 12, 2009 seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement, prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and a penny stock bar against Georgiou.

(Verint) alleging a fraudulent scheme involving certain improper accounting practices. The Complaint alleges the misconduct began as early as 1998, when Verint was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Comverse Technology, Inc. (Comverse), and continued after Verint became a publicly traded company, while still majority-owned by Comverse, in 2002. In addition, the Commission today instituted administrative proceedings against Verint to determine whether the registration of each class of its securities should be revoked or suspended for a period not exceeding twelve months for its failure to file required periodic reports for over four years., In its settled Complaint, filed today in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, the Commission alleges:, From 1998 through at least January 2003, Verint improperly established and maintained and/or released reserves as necessary to (i) meet its financial objectives, (ii) build a stockpile of reserves prior to becoming a public company for future earnings management purposes, and (iii) to ensure greater public demand and a better price for its follow-on offering in June 2003. These improper accounting practices did not conform to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)., On May 16, 2002, Verint commenced its initial public offering (IPO) of 4.5 million shares of common stock at a price of $16 per share. Its balance sheet held approximately $6.5 million excess reserves at the time. Its Form S-1 registration statement reported historical earnings and loss figures that had been materially altered by its historically improper reserve accounting. On June 13, 2003, Verint commenced a follow-on offering for 5 million shares of common stock at a price of $23 per share. Its Form S-3 registration statement reported materially misleading earnings and loss figures, including for the period after the IPO, as a result of its improper accounting for reserves., In the two years subsequent to its follow-on offering, Verint overstated its pre-tax income and would not have met Wall Street analysts consensus earnings estimates but for its improper reserve accounting., The Complaint alleges that as a result of this misconduct, Verints books and records falsely and inaccurately reflected, among other things, the Companys liabilities, expenses, net income, and general financial condition through at least the fiscal year ended January 31, 2005. The Complaint also alleges that Verint failed to maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide assurances that its reserve activity was recorded as necessary to permit the proper preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP., Without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions Complaint, Verint has consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it from violating the antifraud, reporting, record-keeping, and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws. Specifically, the proposed final judgment against Verint would permanently enjoin it from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Exchange Act Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13. In accepting the settlement offer, the Commission considered, among other things, Verints remediation and cooperation in the Commissions investigation. The settlement is subject to the approval of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York., Separately, the Commission today issued an Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings and Notice of Hearing Pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 against Verint, to determine whether the registration of each class of its securities should be revoked or suspended for a period not exceeding twelve months based on its failure to file required periodic reports. The Division of Enforcement alleges that Verint has failed to comply with Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder by failing to file an annual report on either Form 10-K or Form 10-KSB since April 25, 2005, or quarterly reports on either Form 10-Q or Form 10-QSB since December 12, 2005.

Ross Owen Haugen</i>, Civil Action No. 1:09-CV-0129 (ND Ga.)</h2>]","[, The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) announced today that the Honorable Orinda D. Evans, United States District Judge for the Northern District of Georgia, entered final judgment on February 17, 2010 (with a later amendment thereto) against defendant Ross Owen Haugen (Haugen) of Minneapolis, Minnesota. The judgment arises from an order granting the Commissions motion for summary judgment against Haugen, which also ordered that he pay disgorgement in the amount of $1,242,742.79, with prejudgment interest thereon in the amount of $125,316.63. The amended final judgment dated February 25, 2010, further ordered Haugen to pay a civil penalty in the amount equal to his ordered disgorgement. Haugen had previously been permanently enjoined from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, in an order entered on February 5, 2009., The Court made significant findings of fact and conclusions of law in the final judgment and amended final judgment against Haugen. Specifically, the Court concluded that Haugen engaged in fraud in connection with sales of securities interests in four offerings identified as Coadum Capital Fund 1, LLC (Coadum 1), Coadum Capital Fund II, LP (Coadum II), Coadum Capital Fund III, LP (Coadum III) and Mansell Acquisition Company LP (MAC). Approximately $30 million was raised from investors in the four offerings from early 2006 through January 2008. The Court also concluded that Haugen while acting as vice president of sales and marketing for Coadum Advisors, Inc. (Coadum), served as the primary salesman for the offerings on behalf of Coadum and Mansell Capital Partners III, LLC (Mansell)., In its final judgment, the Court found that Haugen directly solicited and sold more than 50% of the Coadum securities in the offerings. The private placement memoranda for the four offerings (PPMs), all of which made similar representations, described an investment objective involving risk-controlled strategies consisting of purchasing AA or better rated securities at one price, and simultaneously selling the securities at a higher price, generating a profit on the price difference, which Coadum and Mansell referred to as commercial trading programs. Coadum and Mansell invested the majority of the funds through a Malta based investment platform which in turn invested the funds in related entities which never began operation or provided any returns. Further, Coadum and Mansell falsely represented in monthly account statements to investors that the investors had been earning approximately four percent per month and that all or most of the investors principal was in escrow. The Court found that Haugen told investors, falsely, that their investment principal was risk free, insured and never left the escrow account or was otherwise guaranteed against loss. In fact, Haugen knew that investors funds were being invested in off-shore trading programs. Moreover, although the PPMs represented that no commissions were paid on the investments and that the promoters were compensated based on a percentage of earnings, Haugen personally was paid substantial commissions from investor funds prior to earnings on those funds, which never occurred. This is a companion case to <i>SEC v. Coadum Advisors, Inc., et al.</i>, Civil Action File No. 1:08-CV-0011-ODE (N.D.

Cantens and Teresita Cantens, alleging that they conducted a $135 million Ponzi scheme and affinity fraud targeting Cuban-American investors, primarily from South Florida., The SECs complaint alleges that the Cantens, founders and co-owners of Royal West Properties, Inc. (Royal West), a Miami-based real estate developer, defrauded more than 400 investors by offering promissory notes claiming annual returns of 9 to16% purportedly backed by recorded mortgage assignments. Since 1993, the Cantens funded Royal Wests real estate business by offering investors no-risk promissory notes. The Cantens assured prospective investors as to the safety of their principal and interest by touting Royal Wests successful real estate business and promising to collateralize investor funds with recorded mortgage assignments. They further assured prospective investors by claiming they were personally worth over $65 million and, as to some investors, executing personal guarantees., The complaint alleges that, contrary to these claims, Royal West was not generating sufficient revenues to repay principal and interest to investors and, since at least 2002, the Cantens were operating a Ponzi scheme, raising new investor funds to pay earlier investors. Moreover, since at least 2005, Royal West failed to record approximately one-third of the mortgage assignments. Finally, the Cantens misappropriated approximately $20 million of investor funds to pay themselves lavish salaries, to fund unrelated personal business ventures, and to pay their children and grandchildren., The SECs complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, charges the defendants with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Noble is the founder, Chairman, and former Chief Executive Officer of American Equity, a full service underwriter of fixed annuity and life insurance products through its wholly-owned life insurance subsidiaries. Waugaman is American Equitys current Chief Executive Officer and former Chief Financial Officer and General Counsel., The SECs complaint, filed in federal court in Des Moines, alleges that in September 2005, American Equity acquired, for $1, American Equity Investment Service Company, a financing company wholly-owned by Noble. The complaint alleges that this acquisition conferred significant benefits on Noble, which Noble, Waugaman, and American Equity inadequately disclosed. The complaint alleges that, among other things, American Equity disclosed that, immediately prior to the acquisition, Noble received a $2.5 million distribution from the acquired company, but American Equity did not disclose that the acquired company had a large deficit at the time of the distribution. The complaint further alleges that American Equitys acquisition of Nobles company effectively relieved Noble of substantial potential personal liability for the acquired companys debts. According to the complaint, American Equitys 2006 proxy statement disclosure about the acquisition was materially misleading because it failed to fully disclose these financial benefits to Noble. The complaint also alleges that American Equitys proxy statement disclosure relating to Nobles compensation, which described Noble as modestly compensated and unwilling to accept additional salary or bonus, was materially misleading in light of the significant benefits he received from American Equitys acquisition of the company owned by Noble., American Equity, Noble, and Waugaman settled the charges without admitting or denying the allegations of the SECs complaint. Under the settlement, Noble, Waugaman, and American Equity agreed to be permanently enjoined from committing future violations of the provisions of the federal securities laws that prohibit materially false or misleading statements or materially misleading omissions in proxy statements.

According to the complaint, Mitchell met with the clients, and encouraged them to take their retirement pensions as a lump sum payment, rather than a monthly annuity. The complaint alleges that Mitchell advised MPWs clients to invest their retirement money in a promissory note offered by the AAA Trust and AB3. The complaint further alleges that the promissory note offering carried fixed interest returns ranging between 10-15% per year for 3-6 year terms. The complaint alleges that Mitchell made various claims to investors as to how he could generate such large returns, including investing in stocks, bonds, and real estate., The Commissions complaint, which was filed in federal court in Los Angeles, alleges that, rather than making any actual investments, Mitchell and the other defendants in fact operated a Ponzi scheme, in which new investor money was used to pay interest to existing investors. The complaint alleges that between April 2009 and December 2009, the AAA Trust raised approximately $1.4 million from 6 investors. According to the complaint, $1.1 million of these funds were used to pay interest to existing investors, and another $300,000 was diverted to MPW, which Mitchell used to pay his living expenses.

Â Beginning in or around the summer of 2006, Morton solicited individuals to invest in one of several companies he and his wife, Melissa Morton, controlled â defendants Vajra Productions, LLC, 27 Investments, LLC, and Magic Eight Ball Distributing, Inc. (referred to herein as the Entities and, along with Morton, referred to as the Defendants) â under the umbrella of the Delphi Associates Investment Group (Delphi Investment Group). Â According to the Commissionâs complaint, in soliciting these individuals, Morton claimed that he would use his psychic expertise to provide investment guidance to his investing team, and he falsely touted his historical success in psychically predicting the various rises and falls of the market. Â Morton further claimed that he would use the pooled funds to trade in foreign currencies and distribute pro rata the trading profits among the investors. Â However, according to the complaint, Morton lied to investors about his past successes, and about key aspects of the Delphi Investment Group, including the use of investor funds and the liquidity of the funds, and that the profits in the accounts were audited and certified. Â All together, Morton fraudulently raised more than $6 million from more than 100 investors for the Delphi Investment Group. Â , According to the Commissionâs complaint, Morton used his monthly newsletter, his website, his appearances on a nationally syndicated radio show called Coast to Coast AM, and appearances at public events, to promote his psychic abilities. Â Morton made numerous materially false representations relating to his psychic abilities in order to solicit investors for the Delphi Investment Group. Â For example, Morton wrote to potential investors in his July 20, 2006 newsletter that: âI have called ALL the highs and lows of the market, giving EXACT DATES for rises and crashes over the last 14 years.â Â (emphasis in original.) Â The Commission alleges that this assertion, like others Morton made in soliciting investors, is false., Further, according to the complaint, Morton, who did not seek accreditation status from the Delphi Investment Group investors, placed investor funds in the bank accounts of one of the Entities, and that Morton and/or Melissa Morton, commingled the investorsâ funds among the Entitiesâ accounts. Â Additionally, according to the complaint, while Morton promised investors that all of their funds would be used to trade foreign currencies, in fact, he invested only about half of the funds with foreign currency trading firms. Â Unbeknownst to the investors, instead of investing all of the funds into foreign currency trading firms, Morton, and/or Melissa Morton, diverted some of the investor funds. Â For instance, the Mortons diverted at least $240,000 of investor funds to their own nonprofit religious organization, Prophecy Research Institute (PRI). Â Melissa Morton and PRI are named as relief defendants (Relief Defendants) in the complaint., The Commissionâs complaint charges each of the Defendants with violations of Â Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Â The complaint further charges that the Relief Defendants were unjustly enriched by receiving investor funds. Â The complaint seeks a final judgment permanently restraining and enjoining the Defendants from future violations of the above provisions of the federal securities laws. Â The complaint further seeks a final judgment ordering the Defendants, jointly and severally, to disgorge their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, ordering the Relief Defendants to disgorge their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and ordering the Defendants to pay civil penalties.

Â Holohan is a former employee of a vendor that supplied U.S. Foodservice., The Commissionâs complaint alleges that Holohan aided and abetted the financial fraud by signing and returning materially false audit confirmations. Â The Commissionâs complaint further alleges that U.S. Foodservice personnel contacted Holohan and urged him to sign and return the false confirmation letters to the auditors for U.S. Foodservice. Â At the time, U.S. Foodservice was a subsidiary of Royal Ahold (Koninklijke Ahold N.V.).

The Commissions complaint alleges that Kathleen S. Dobens and Charles T. Dobens, husband and wife business partners from Duxbury, Massachusetts, together with another business partner, Joseph A. Roche of Braintree, Massachusetts, defrauded approximately 60 investors who invested approximately $3.5 million beginning as early as 2007., The Commissions complaint alleges that the individual defendants established four entities through which they operated. These entities, which were each operated out of the Dobens home and are each named as defendants in the case, are Silex Group, LLC, Preakness Apartments I &amp; II, LLC, Cherry Hills Apartments of Fort Worth, LLC, and Clear River Partners, LLC., The Commissions complaint alleges that in February 2009, the individual defendants created Silex to solicit investors money with false promises of secured investments and guaranteed annual returns of 9% or 12%. According to the complaint, Silex and the individual defendants used a website and a series of other oral and written representations to solicit investments. The website claimed, among other things, that Silex owned over $20 million in real estate assets and would pool investors money to invest in multi-family housing assets. In reality, Silex never owned any real estate assets and the funds raised for Silex were diverted to repay an earlier Silex investor, for personal expenses of the individual defendants, and for expenses for other entities owned and controlled by the individual defendants (including three entities charged by the Commission as relief defendants: East Coast Investment Solutions, LLC; Dobens Company, LLC; and Crosscreeks Apartments II, LLC). The complaint also alleges that Silex commingled funds with relief defendant Crosscreeks Apartments I., The Commissions complaint also alleges that the individual defendants operated earlier real estate investment frauds using the other entity defendants that they created. According to the complaint, during 2007 and 2008, the individual defendants, acting through Clear River Partners, solicited investors in Preakness Apartments, an entity that owned an apartment complex in Lexington, Kentucky, and Cherry Hills Apartments, an entity that owned an apartment complex in Forth Worth, Texas. The complaint alleges that investors in those entities were misled to believe that they stood to gain substantial profits. For example, according to the complaint, investors in Preakness Apartments were told that they would receive a yearly return of 9% on their investment, and investors in Cherry Hills Apartments were told that they would earn a 123% return in five years. In fact, according to the complaint, neither investment was profitable. The complaint alleges that Cherry Hills Apartments was foreclosed upon and auctioned off in January 2010, and that during that same month, defendant Roche was soliciting investors for additional funds just to keep Preakness Apartments afloat for the year, promising investors a premium if they put more money into Preakness Apartments., The Commissions complaint alleges that defendants Kathleen S. Dobens, Charles T. Dobens, Joseph A. Roche, Silex Group, LLC, Preakness Apartments I &amp; II, LLC, Cherry Hills Apartments of Fort Worth, LLC, and Clear River Partners, LLC, violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

In each instance, Unger had the nominees falsely represent to the converting banks that the nominees were purchasing the stock for their own accounts, and that they had no agreement or understanding regarding the sale or transfer of the stock. In fact, the nominees were purchasing the stock with funds provided mostly or wholly by Unger and with the understanding that, once the stock was received, most or all of the stock or the proceeds from its sale would be transferred to Unger. The illegal profits from the fraudulently obtained stock amounted to approximately $227,589.

U.S. District Judge James D. Whittemore will determine remedies and sanctions at a later date., Mrakuzic was the only one of the seven defendants whom the Commission sued in May 2008 to take the case to trial. The other six defendants resolved the action earlier. The Commissions evidence at trial showed Mrakuzic and the other defendants engaged in a complex scheme from June through August 2005 to create and sell shares of Global Development and Environmental Resources Inc., a purported environmental remediation company that was based in Las Vegas, Nevada., The evidence showed the scheme involved creating a promissory note convertible into Global Development shares that were fraudulently backdated to avoid the holding requirements for restricted stock under Rule 144. The defendants then arranged a forged assignment of the note to three foreign entities, one of which was under Mrakuzics control and two others where he secretly owned brokerage accounts. The third step in the scheme was to convert the note into unrestricted shares., The last step involved the defendants promoting the stock by arranging for Global to issue press releases that contained false and misleading information relating to the companys purported clients, pending contracts and revenue projections. The resulting inflated market allowed Mrakuzic to sell the shares through the foreign entities for profits in excess of $6 million., The other defendants, Global Development, Carmine J.

The Commissions complaint alleges that from March 2004 through December 2005, Salvatore Zangari (Zangari), a former stock loan trader at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., Inc. (Morgan Stanley) and Banc of America Securities, LLC (Banc of America), received well-over $100,000 in cash kickbacks from a Brooklyn, New York stock loan finder in exchange for sending stock loan orders to brokerage firms that paid the finder for purportedly locating the stocks., The defendant named in the Commissions complaint is:, <b>Zangari</b>, age 33, of New York, New York. For eleven years, from 1998 to 2009, he was employed as a stock loan trader at several major Wall Street brokerage firms where he was responsible for negotiating, arranging and entering into stock loan transactions on behalf of the firms. Most recently, from October 2006 to July 2009, Zangari worked as a stock loan trader at UBS Securities, LLC. Prior to UBS, he worked at Banc of America from May 2005 to October 2006, and before that, at Morgan Stanley from August 1998 to May 2005. During the course of his employment in the securities industry, Zangari held Series 7 and 63 professional licenses., The Commissions complaint specifically alleges as follows:, For nearly two years, from March 2004 through December 2005, Zangari participated in a cash kickback scheme while arranging daily stock loan transactions for Morgan Stanley and Banc of America. Zangari received well over $100,000 in cash from a stock loan finder located in Brooklyn, New York in exchange for sending Morgan Stanley and Banc of America stock loan orders to other brokerage firms that paid the finder a fee for purportedly locating the securities being borrowed and loaned. The finder shared part of the fees he received on the transactions with Zangari by paying him thousands of dollars in cash each month. Zangari used a portion of the kickback money as a down-payment to purchase an apartment in New York City. Zangaris misconduct defrauded and otherwise harmed Morgan Stanley and Banc of America because he purposely arranged stock loan transactions on their behalf at borrowing and lending rates that were designed to generate finder fee payments rather than to maximize the firms profits., Zangari is charged with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and, in the alternative, with aiding and abetting others violations of certain of these provisions.

Lapine consented to the entry of judgment without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions complaint except as to jurisdiction., The Complaint, filed September 27, 2001, alleged that Lapine, together with other senior executives, participated in a long-running fraudulent scheme to inflate the revenue and net income of HBO &amp; Company (HBOC), an Atlanta, Georgia-based vendor of health care technology that merged with McKesson in 1999. As part of this scheme, Lapine, the General Counsel of HBOC and later, of the health care technology unit of McKesson HBOC, took part in negotiating two large backdated transactions with side agreements containing cancellation contingencies that enabled the companies to recognize revenue in earlier reporting periods. Both of these practices failed to comply with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. The fraud enabled HBOC and McKesson HBOC to report falsely in press releases and in periodic reports HBOC filed with the Commission that the companies were having an unbroken run of financial success and had continually exceeded analysts expectations. However, when McKesson HBOC announced in April 1999 that the company was conducting an internal investigation into financial reporting irregularities, its shares tumbled from approximately $65 to $34, a drop that slashed its market value by more than $9 billion. The Commission also alleged that Lapine failed in his gatekeeper role during the multi-year long scheme., The final judgment against Lapine permanently enjoins him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-13 and 13b2-1 thereunder.

Durmaz and Robert C. Pribilski mass-mailed promotional materials to prospective investors and invited them to estate planning seminars held at country clubs and banquet halls. They gained retirees confidence in follow-up meetings and portrayed themselves as educated and experienced in foreign investments specifically tailored to the needs of seniors. Durmaz and Pribilski then pitched what they represented as safe, guaranteed investments in Turkish Eurobonds through the purchase of USARMS promissory notes that would earn annual returns between 8 and 11 percent., The SEC alleges that USARMS raised at least $20 million from more than 120 investors, but did not actually invest the money in Turkish Eurobonds as promised. Instead, returns were paid to earlier investors with funds received from new investors in Ponzi-like fashion.

Vianna, Jr., a former registered representative at a New York based broker-dealer named Maxim Group LLC (Maxim), diverted profitable trades from the account of a large Spanish bank, referred to in the Complaint as Customer A, to the account of Creswell Equities, Inc. (Creswell), a British Virgin Islands company. The Commissions complaint alleges that over $3.3 million in trading profits were diverted from Customer A to Creswell., The complaint alleges that 57 times between July 2007 and March 2008, Vianna simultaneously entered orders in the accounts of Customer A and Creswell to trade the same amounts of the same stock. Each time, he placed a buy order in one customers account and a sell order in the other customers account. When the market moved to make Customer As trade profitable and Creswells trade unprofitable, Vianna improperly misused his access to Maxims order management system to divert Customer As profitable trade to Creswell and Creswells unprofitable trade to Customer A by changing Maxims records to inaccurately reflect the account for which the orders were entered. However, when the market moved so that Creswells trade was profitable and Customer As unprofitable, Vianna let the trades remain as originally entered., The Commissions complaint charges Vianna with securities fraud in violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 and also charges Vianna with aiding and abetting violations by Maxim of the books and records requirements of Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 17a-3. The Commission seeks permanent injunctive relief from Vianna, as well as disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties., The Commissions complaint also charges Creswell as a relief defendant, and seeks disgorgement of Creswells illicit profits, plus prejudgment interest.

Verdiramo, Edward Meyer, Jr., and Victoria Chen</i>, Civil Action No. 10-CIV-1888 (S.D.N.Y.)</h2>]","[, The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Richard Verdiramo with securities fraud and violating the registration provisions of the federal securities laws in connection with a scheme to issue shares of RECOV Energy Corporation for his own personal benefit and to benefit his father, attorney Vincent L. Verdiramo, Esq. The SECâs Complaint charges Vincent Verdiramo with aiding and abetting his sonâs fraud. In addition, the SECâs Complaint alleges that Vincent Verdiramo, Edward Meyer, Jr., and Victoria Chen violated the securities registration provisions and that Meyer engaged in insider trading in connection with his sales of RECOV stock., The Complaint alleges that between February and August 2005, Richard Verdiramo, RECOVâs then Chairman, CEO, President, and CFO, directed RECOV to issue more than three million shares in unregistered, non-exempt transactions to Meyer, Chen, and others. According to the Complaint, the issuances to Meyer and Chen were made pursuant to a contract under which Richard and Vincent L. Verdiramo agreed to sell Meyer and Chen a controlling interest in RECOV. At the time of the contract, RECOV was involved in merger negotiations with a private company which had hired Meyer as a merger consultant. Although Richard Verdiramo directed RECOV to issue unregistered shares to Meyer, Chen and others purportedly in conversion of RECOV notes payable, the Complaint alleges that Meyer and others paid Richard and Vincent Verdiramo at least $350,000 for the shares; monies which should have gone to RECOV., The Complaint alleges that Vincent L. Verdiramo aided and abetted his sonâs fraudulent share issuance scheme by participating in negotiations regarding the sale and issuance of the shares, being a party to the contract with Meyer and Chen, and by using his attorney trust account to funnel the money Meyer and others paid for RECOV shares to a private company Richard and Vincent L. Verdiramo controlled., The Complaint alleges that after directing these issuances, Richard Verdiramo signed three RECOV periodic reports filed with the Commission in 2005 that he knew, or was reckless in not knowing, contained materially false and misleading statements about RECOVâs share issuances. As alleged, Richard Verdiramo falsely represented in these filings that RECOV had issued shares of common stock without restrictive legends in conversion of convertible notes payable and that the company had received an opinion from counsel that the shares could be issued without restrictive legends. The Complaint alleges that, in fact, Richard Verdiramo knew that the share issuances were not in conversion of convertible notes payable and were not supported by an attorney opinion., The Complaint also alleges that Richard Verdiramo made false statements in RECOV periodic reports regarding a large restricted stock issuance he made to himself in April 2005 and subsequently cancelled in September 2005. In addition, the Complaint alleges that Richard Verdiramo failed to file a Schedule 13D and Form 4 with the Commission regarding this issuance to conceal his seizure of control of RECOV. Â , The Complaint further alleges that Meyer, Chen, and Vincent Verdiramo all sold illegally issued shares of RECOV in unregistered, non-exempt transactions for proceeds of at least $220,000, $45,000, and $30,000, respectively.Â , Finally, the Complaint alleges that in August 2005, Meyer sold RECOV shares while in possession of material, non-public information about the status of RECOVâs merger negotiations with a private company for proceeds of more than $40,000 and avoided losses of approximately $14,000.Â , The Commissionâs Complaint alleges that Richard Verdiramo violated Section 5(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Sections 10(b), 13(b)(5), 13(d) and 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, 13d-1, 13d-2 and 16a-3 and that he aided and abetted RECOVâs violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13. The complaint alleges that Meyer violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that Vincent Verdiramo aided and abetted his sonâs violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. In addition, the complaint alleges that Vincent Verdiramo, Meyer, and Chen violated Section 5(a) of the Securities Act. The Commissionâs complaint seeks a permanent injunction, an accounting, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil monetary penalties, and a penny stock bar against each defendant. The Complaint also seeks penalties pursuant to the Insider Trading Sanctions Act of 1984 against Meyer, and an officer and director bar as to Richard Verdiramo., Meyer was the subject of a previous Commission action, which he settled in May 2002, by consenting to a permanent injunction against violations of the anti-fraud, anti-touting, and registration provisions of the federal securities laws, among other sanctions.

Judge Seeborg issued an order enjoining Clark from future violations of the anti-fraud, as well as broker-dealer and securities registration provisions of federal securities laws. Judge Seeborg further ordered Clark to disgorge $779,849.09, plus prejudgment interest of $107,858.14, and assessed a $130,000 civil penalty against Clark., The SECs complaint, filed July 27, 2009, alleged that AOB and several related entities raised more than $45 million from hundreds of investors in several states from mid-2004 to July 2007, through the unregistered offering and sale of promissory notes that in many cases paid interest of up to 5.5% per month. The complaint alleged that, although AOB purported to be in the business of making loans to companies in Asia, investor proceeds were used primarily to pay principal and interest on the notes, pay commissions to sales agents, and make undisclosed loans to entities affiliated with AOB. The SEC brought the scheme to a halt in July 2007, with the filing of an emergency action and the appointment of a receiver. [SEC v.

Lazzara, United States District Judge for Middle District of Florida, entered judgments against two stock promoters, Robert M. Esposito and Gregory A. King, in SEC v. Esposito, et al., No. 08 CV 494 T26 (M.D. Fla.), a fraudulent touting case the Commission filed on March 17, 2008. See Lit. Rel. No. 20499., In its complaint, the Commission charged that Esposito, King, and others participated in fraudulent touting scheme of the stock of Anscott Industries, Inc. The complaint alleged that in April 2003, Esposito, a penny stock promoter, orchestrated a reverse merger between Anscott (then a private company) and Liquidix, Inc., a public shell company which, after the merger, changed its name to Anscott. According to the complaint, Esposito received from the company 4 million shares of Anscott stock as compensation for arranging the reverse merger and for future stock promotion work. The complaint further alleges that a fraudulent Form S-8 registration statement was filed with the Commission for the 4 million shares of Anscott issued to Esposito, which improperly enabled Esposito to sell these shares to the public during the fraudulent touting scheme., As alleged in the complaint, after the reverse merger and the issuance of shares to Esposito, Esposito paid King, another penny stock promoter with whom Esposito had worked previously, to prepare and disseminate materially false and misleading tout sheets promoting Anscott stock. The Commission alleged that these tout sheets -- crafted to appear like independent investment newsletters and entitled the Wall Street Bulletin -- recommended Anscott as a strong buy, and were disseminated to the public through fax spamming from late May 2003 through July 2003., According to the complaint, these tout sheets, which King prepared, contained materially false and misleading representations about Anscotts products, business affiliations, and projected revenues. The complaint further alleged that these tout sheets failed to disclose, among other information, that Esposito, who was paid by the company to promote Anscott stock, was paying King to prepare and disseminate these newsletters, and that Esposito was selling his Anscott stock during the touting scheme contrary to the Wall Street Bulletins strong buy recommendation and price targets., During the touting campaign, the price of Anscotts stock rose from around $1.40 a share in mid-May 2003, to a high of $4.59 a share on July 11, 2003. The complaint alleged that Esposito sold shares of Anscott both during and after the touting campaign, realizing over $6.5 million in illicit profits., Esposito consented to the entry of a judgment that (a) permanently enjoins him from future violations of Sections 17(a), 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 13d-1 and 13d-2; and (b) permanently bars him from participating in any future penny stock offerings. King consented to the entry of a judgment that (a) permanently enjoins him from future violations of Sections 17(b) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5; and (b) permanently bars him from participating in any future penny stock offerings. The judgments further provide that, upon motion by the Commission, the Court later will determine issues relating to disgorgement and civil penalties., The Court previously entered final judgment against the other defendants in this case, Anscott and its CEO, Jack R. Belluscio, on October 27, 2008, which (1) permanently enjoined Anscott and Belluscio from future violations of Securities Act Sections 5(a) and 5(c) and Exchange Act Section 10(b); (2) permanently barred Belluscio from acting as an officer or director of a public company; (3) ordered Belluscio to pay a civil penalty of $240,000; and (4) ordered Anscott to pay a civil penalty of $1,200,000.

(the fund), a pooled investment vehicle or hedge fund managed by Kim through Spyglass., In its settled Complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, the Commission alleges that between in 2004 and 2006, Kim and Spyglass raised approximately $4.7 million from investors located primarily in Houston Texas using offering materials that contained misleading information relating to Kims education, business experience, and compensation. The SEC also alleges that Kim falsely told investors that he would pool their funds and employ an investment strategy of trading Collateralized Mortgage Obligations (CMO) and other securities, and that Kim would manage risk through a dynamic hedging strategy. Unfortunately, the SEC alleges, Kim and Spyglass failed to employ any hedging strategy to manage risk, and the fund incurred over $2 million in losses. Rather than disclose the losses to investors, the SEC alleges, Kim had Spyglass send false reports to investors indicating that the fund was profitable, and then Kim directed the fund to make approximately $1.7 million in Ponzi payments to investors. Finally, the SEC alleges that Kim misappropriated approximately $1.5 million of the hedge funds remaining assets to repay several outstanding personal obligations., Without admitting or denying the allegations contained in the Commissions Complaint, Kim and Spyglass have consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining them from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

Raval, former chairman of Infos audit committee, and Rajnish K. Das and Stormy L. Dean, Infos CFOs during the relevant period, allege that from 2003 through 2007, the Defendants caused Info to pay Gupta almost $9.5 million of unauthorized and undisclosed perquisites and to enter into $9.3 million of undisclosed related party transactions with Guptas entities., The Commissions complaints, filed in federal district court in Nebraska, allege that Gupta improperly used corporate funds for over $3 million of personal jet travel for Gupta and his family and friends to such destinations as South Africa, Italy, and Cancun; $2.8 million of costs associated with Guptas yacht; $1.3 million of personal credit card expenses; and costs associated with 28 club memberships, 20 automobiles, his homes around the country, and premiums for three personal life insurance policies. The Commission also alleges that Gupta failed to inform Infos other board members of the material fact that he had purchased shares of an Info acquisition target for his own benefit from which he obtained realized and unrealized ill-gotten gains., The Commission also alleges that from January 2005 through July 2006, Raval, Infos former audit committee chairman, failed to respond appropriately to various red flags concerning Guptas expenses and Infos related party transactions with Guptas entities. According to the complaint, Raval failed to take appropriate action regarding the concerns expressed to him by two Info internal auditors that Gupta was submitting requests for reimbursement of personal expenses. Additionally, the complaint alleges that notwithstanding his charge by Infos board in January 2005 to investigate potential improper payments to Gupta, Raval failed to take meaningful action to further investigate Guptas misconduct and omitted critical facts in his report to the board concerning Guptas expenses., The Commission also alleges that two of Infos former CFOs, Das and Dean, allowed Gupta to support his lavish lifestyle by rubber-stamping hundreds of Guptas expense reimbursement requests. According to the complaint, Das and Dean approved Guptas expense reimbursement requests despite the fact that the requests lacked sufficient explanation of business purpose and supporting documentation, even in the face of concerns raised by several Info employees. The complaint alleges that Das and Dean knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that Infos Commission filings materially understated Guptas compensation and failed to disclose properly related party transactions with Guptas entities.

Holwell, granted the Commissions request to freeze the Defendants assets pending a preliminary hearing, including an account that holds assets in excess of $500,000., The Commissions complaint alleges that BroCo Investments, Inc., its president Valery Maltsev, and/or individuals acting in concert with them hijacked the online brokerage accounts of unwitting investors using stolen usernames and passwords and subsequently placed unauthorized trades through the compromised accounts to manipulate the markets of at least thirty-eight issuers between August 2009 and December 2009. In almost every instance, prior to intruding into these accounts, the Defendants acquired positions in their own account. Then, just minutes later, without the accountholders knowledge, the Defendants, and/or individuals acting in concert with them, placed scores of unauthorized buy orders at above-market prices using the compromised accounts. After these unauthorized buy orders were placed, the Defendants sold the positions held in their own account at the artificially inflated prices. In other instances, the Defendants profited by covering short positions previously established in their account while placing unauthorized sell orders through the compromised accounts at substantially lower prices. This illicit account activity artificially affected the share price and trading volume for each of the thinly-traded issuers and enabled the Defendants to sell their holdings at a substantial profit, realizing at least $255,532 in ill-gotten gains., The Commissions complaint further alleges that the Defendants violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and seeks permanent injunctions against future violations by the Defendants and disgorgement of all ill-gotten gains, including prejudgment interest and civil penalties., The SECs Office of Investor Education and Assistance has previously issued an investor alert, available on the SECs website, which provides tips for avoiding becoming a victim of an online intrusion.

The Court concluded that in early 2000, Curshen knowingly or recklessly posted on various Internet sites baseless projections and other financial information about Freedom Golf, a now-defunct golf club manufacturer. The Court further found that Curshen knowingly failed to disclose that he was being paid to promote Freedom Golf and was selling the companys stock while touting the company., According to the Courts findings, Timothy Miles, a principal shareholder of Freedom Golf, arranged for the company to hire Carter Allen Jones and Curshen to promote Freedom Golf. Jones prepared an investor report touting Freedom Golf based on information provided by the companys president. The report contained factually baseless profit and revenue projections for Freedom Golf. Curshen posted a link to the report on Internet websites, despite knowing of the companys poor financial condition. Furthermore, the Court found Curshen posted numerous messages touting Freedom Golf on various Internet web sites without disclosing his receipt and sale of Freedom Golf stock in exchange for promoting the company., The final judgment enjoined Curshen from violations of Sections 17(a) and 17(b) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5, and barred him from participating in any penny stock offering.

Innospec, Inc.</i>, Civil Action No. 1:10-cv-00448 (RMC) (D.D.C.)</h2>]","[, The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a settled enforcement action on March 18, 2010, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia charging Innospec, Inc. (âInnospecâ), a specialty chemical company incorporated in Delaware with principal offices in the United States and the United Kingdom, with violations of the anti-bribery, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (âFCPAâ). Â Innospec has offered to pay $40.2 million as part of a global settlement with the Commission, the Department of Justice, Fraud Section (âDOJâ), the United Kingdomâs Serious Fraud Office (âSFOâ), and the U.S. Department of the Treasuryâs Office of Foreign Assets Control (âOFACâ).Â  This case is the first corruption-related settlement coordinated between the Commission, DOJ, and the SFO.Â , The SECâs complaint alleges that:, From 2000 to 2007, Innospec routinely paid bribes to sell Tetra Ethyl Lead (âTELâ), a fuel additive that boosts the octane value of gasoline, to state owned refineries and oil companies in Iraq and Indonesia.Â  TEL was a significant source of revenue for Innospec; however, TEL sales were declining due to the passage of clean air legislation in the U.S. and abroad.Â  Innospec also paid kickbacks to Iraq to obtain contracts under the United Nations Oil for Food Program (the âProgramâ). Innospecâs former management did nothing to stop the bribery, and in fact authorized and encouraged it.Â  In addition, Innospecâs internal controls failed to detect the illicit conduct, which continued for nearly a decade.Â  In all, Innospec made illicit payments of approximately $6,347,588 and promised an additional $2,870,377 in illicit payments to Iraqi ministries, Iraqi government officials, and Indonesian government officials in exchange for contracts worth approximately $176,717,341 in revenues and profits of $60,071,613.Â Â Â Â Â , From 2000 through 2003, Innospec obtained five Program contracts for the sale of TEL to the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and its component oil refineries (âMoOâ) and paid kickbacks equaling 10% of the contract value on three of the contracts and offered kickbacks on the remaining two contracts. Â Innospec increased its agentâs commission as a means to funnel the payments to Iraq.Â  Innospec artificially inflated its prices in the Program contracts and did not notify the UN of the kickback scheme.Â  When the Program ended shortly before Innospec paid the promised kickbacks on two of the contracts, Innospec kept the promised payments as part of its profit.Â , After the Program was terminated in late 2003, Innospec continued to use its agent in Iraq to pay bribes to Iraqi officials to secure additional TEL sales. Â From at least 2004 through 2007, Innospec made payments totaling approximately $1,610,327 and promised an additional $884,480 to MoO officials so as to garner good will with Iraqi authorities, obtain additional orders under a Long Term Purchase Agreement that was executed in October 2004 (the â2004 LTPAâ) and ensure the execution of a second LTPA in January 2008 (the â2008 LTPAâ). Â In an October 2005 e-mail to Innospec, Innospecâs agent informed a Business Director and an Executive that prior to opening a letter of credit for a shipment of TEL, Iraqi officials were demanding a 2% kickback.Â  The e-mail further stated that: âWe are sharing most of our profits with Iraqi officials. Otherwise, our business will stop and we will lose the market. We have to change our strategy and do more compensation to get the rewards.âÂ  The Business Director authorized the over $195,000 bribe, and in an e-mail discussing the wording of the invoice, the Business Director stated that âthe fewer words the better!âÂ , Innospec also paid lavish travel and entertainment expenses for MoO officials, including paying for a seven day honeymoon, supplying mobile phone cards and cameras, and paying thousands in cash for âpocket moneyâ to officials.Â  Innospec also paid bribes to ensure the failure of a 2006 field test of MMT, a fuel product manufactured by a competitor of Innospec. Â Finally, Innospec promised additional bribes of approximately $850,000 in connection with the 2008 LTPA, which was thwarted due to the U.S. governmentsâ investigation of the Iraq bribery., Innospec also had several schemes to pay bribes to Indonesian government officials from at least 2000 through 2005 to win contracts with state owned oil and gas companies.Â  Approximately $2,883,507 in bribes was funneled through an Indonesian agent.Â  One scheme involved bribes paid annually to a senior official at BP Migas; another involved âspecial commissionsâ paid to a Swiss account; and one involved a âone off paymentâ of $300,000.Â  Innospec paid bribes to officials to support efforts to maintain TEL sales in Indonesia at a time when Indonesia was planning to go unleaded.Â  In one instance, an official indicated that he would assist Innospec in obtaining TEL sales but that he wanted more than just âcentsâ in return.Â , Innospec violated Section 30A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by engaging in bribery of government officials in Iraq during the post-Oil for Food period and government officials in Indonesia.Â  Innospec violated Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act by failing to maintain internal controls to detect and prevent bribery of officials in Iraq and Indonesia as well as the illicit Oil for Food Program kickbacks.Â  Finally, Innospec violated Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act by improperly recording all of the illicit payments in its books.Â , Without admitting or denying the Commissionâs allegations, Innospec has consented to the entry of a court order permanently enjoining it from future violations of Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act; ordering it to pay $60,071,613 in disgorgement, provided that the Commission waive all but $11,200,000 of disgorgement and permitting payment in four installments based upon Innospecâs sworn Statement of Financial Condition; and ordering it to comply with certain undertakings regarding its FCPA compliance program, including an independent monitor for a period of three years.Â  Based on its financial condition, Innospec offered to pay a reduced criminal fine of $14.1 million to the DOJ and a criminal fine of $12.7 million to the SFO.Â  Innospec will pay $2.2 million to OFAC for unrelated conduct concerning allegations of violations of the Cuban Assets Control Regulations., The SEC acknowledges assistance in its ongoing investigation from the U.S. Department of Justice, Fraud Section, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the United Kingdom Serious Fraud Office, and the United States Department of Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control.Â Â , <b>See Also:</b> <a href=/litigation/complaints/2010/comp21454.pdf title=>SEC Complaint</a> ]"

Durmaz and Robert C. Pribilski mass-mailed promotional materials to prospective investors and invited them to estate planning seminars held at country clubs and banquet halls. They gained retirees confidence in follow-up meetings and portrayed themselves as educated and experienced in foreign investments specifically tailored to the needs of seniors. Durmaz and Pribilski then pitched what they represented as safe, guaranteed investments in Turkish Eurobonds through the purchase of USARMS promissory notes that would earn annual returns between 8 and 11 percent., The SEC alleges that USARMS raised at least $20 million from more than 120 investors, but did not actually invest the money in Turkish Eurobonds as promised. Instead, returns were paid to earlier investors with funds received from new investors in Ponzi-like fashion. Durmaz and Pribilski further misused investor funds to finance their other businesses and purchase such things as luxury automobiles, homes, vacations, and web-based pornography. They also wired investor money into bank accounts belonging to individuals living in Turkey who are named as relief defendants in the SECs case., USARMS and its securities are not registered with the SEC.

Corso, of Las Vegas, Nevada, and Brian K. Rabinovitz of Oak Park, California, in connection with an enforcement action filed in 2005 concerning a stock manipulation and accounting fraud scheme. The judgment against Corso, entered on March 18, 2010, permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud and auditor independence provisions of the federal securities laws. The judgment against Rabinovitz, entered on March 15, 2010, permanently enjoins him from violating the auditor independence provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $30,000., The Commissions civil injunctive action was filed on April 25, 2005, against Exotics.com, Inc., a Nevada corporation based in Vancouver, British Columbia, and 12 additional principal defendants and one relief defendant. The Commissions complaint alleged that, between at least 1999 and 2002, Exotics.com, which was then an Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board company in the business of operating adult Web sites, was the subject of a stock manipulation and accounting fraud perpetrated by, among others, its officers, attorneys and outside auditors. The complaint alleged, among other things, that Corso, Rabinovitz, and others engaged in conduct that resulted in Exotics.com filing materially false and misleading financial statements in its Commission filings. The complaint further alleged that audit staff under the supervision of Corso and Rabinovitz committed acts and/or omissions that caused them to become non-independent during audits of Exotics.com and that Corso and Rabinovitz approved the issuance of audit reports that were incorporated in Exotics.coms Commission filings. According to the complaint, the audit reports, among other things, falsely stated that the audits had been conducted by an independent auditor and in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards (GAAS). The Complaint also alleged that Rabinovitz and audit staff under his supervision engaged in a number of improper accounting practices that caused Exotics.coms financial statements to depart from generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, Corso and Rabinovitz consented to the entry of final judgments against them.

Vaughan also used another entity â Vaughan Capital LLC â to solicit investors for different types of real estate-related investments, such as buying residential properties at distressed prices. Vaughan relied entirely on new money raised from investors through both companies to fund Vaughan Companys ever-increasing obligations to note holders., The SEC also charged both of Vaughans companies in the enforcement action. Neither Vaughan nor his companies are registered with the SEC to offer securities under the federal securities laws., The Honorable M. Christina Armijo for the U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico granted the SECs request for a temporary restraining order and asset freeze against Vaughan and his companies., According to the SECs complaint, Vaughan defrauded approximately 600 investors, promising them high, fixed interest payments ranging from 10 to 25 percent over one to three years. He misrepresented that the aggregate principal on the Vaughan Company notes would not exceed a certain limit. Vaughan falsely claimed that the notes were secured by certain real estate and his personal wealth, and that Vaughan Company used investor funds to generate profits well in excess of its obligations on the notes., The SECs complaint alleges that Vaughans failing business accumulated losses totaling more than $61 million, and the $80 million in principal owed to investors is 20 times the claimed equity in the properties that were to secure the notes. The SEC also alleges that Vaughans net worth, which was supposed to provide protection to investors, is negative in value. In direct violation of promises made, Vaughan transferred almost all of the money he raised from Vaughan Capital investors to Vaughan Companys operating account. He then used those funds to cover Vaughan Companys obligations to promissory note holders and its ordinary business costs., The SECs complaint charges the defendants with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The defendants, all Russian citizens, repeatedly tipped and/or traded on misappropriated inside information to obtain approximately $1 million in illicit profits., According to the SECs Complaint, filed yesterday in federal district court in Manhattan, from at least July 2005 through the present, Poteroba, an investment banker in UBS Securities LLCs Global Healthcare Group in New York City, misappropriated from UBS highly confidential inside information about at least eleven impending acquisitions, tender offers, or other business transactions. UBS had been retained as a financial adviser in ten of these transactions, and had been confidentially solicited as a source of capital in the eleventh. The Complaint alleges that, in advance of each transaction, Poteroba tipped his friend and financial professional, Koval (a/k/a Alexei Koval), with inside information concerning the impending transaction. After receiving the inside information, Koval traded on all the deals and tipped Vorobiev, a friend of both Koval and Poteroba, who traded on four of the deals. Based on the information tipped by Poteroba, Koval and Vorobiev traded in stocks and options of the companies targeted for acquisition., According to the SECs Complaint, the scheme began in at least July 2005 when Koval and Vorobiev traded in advance of the acquisition of Guilford Pharmaceuticals Inc. by MGI Pharma, Inc. Using, among other means of communication, coded email messages that referred to securities as frequent flier miles and bonus miles, Poteroba urged Koval to purchase Guilford securities prior to the public announcement of the Guilford acquisition., With respect to subsequent transactions, the SECs Complaint alleges that Poteroba also supplied information to Koval using coded email messages that referred to securities or money as Macys wedding registry gifts or potatoes. For example, in discussing the need to purchase Molecular Devices Corporation securities prior to the imminent public announcement of its merger, Poteroba wrote to Koval, Let me know if youve started your wedding registry at Macys and Happy to talk about sales items and etc. . . . sale ends soon . . . so hurry up., The SECs Complaint further alleges that, during the course of the scheme, Koval used his home computer or cell phone to access and to trade in Vorobievs on-line brokerage account. Koval also made cash withdrawals from Vorobievs bank account using automated teller machines in Pasadena, California and Chicago, Illinois. In addition, Koval and Vorobiev conducted insider trading through brokerage accounts held in their own names. The Complaint also alleges that certain of the insider trading was also conducted through brokerage accounts held in the names of Tatiana Vorobieva, Vorobievs wife, and Anjali Walter, Kovals wife, and portions of the proceeds from the illicit trading were received by Vorobieva and Walter. Accordingly, Vorobieva and Walter are named as relief defendants in this action to recover investor assets now in their possession., According to the SECs Complaint, Poteroba misappropriated material, nonpublic information from UBS and illegally tipped Koval regarding: (1) Guilford Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; (2) ID Biomedical Corp.; (3) Molecular Devices Corp.; (4) ViaCell, Inc.; (5) Mindray Medical International Limited (trading was in Datascope Corp.); (6) Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; (7) Sciele Pharma, Inc.; (8) Indevus Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; (9) Advanced Medical Optics, Inc.; and (10) PharmaNet Development Group, Inc. In addition, Poteroba misappropriated and illegally tipped inside information that UBS obtained when it was solicited by Vestar Capital to provide funding for its proposed acquisition of Radiation Therapy Services, Inc., The SECs complaint charges the Defendants with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10-b5 thereunder, the general antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, and Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14e-3 thereunder, the tender offer fraud provisions.

Conway of the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida entered a Final Judgment of Permanent Injunction and Other Relief Against Defendant James H. Park. The final judgment enjoins Park from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. In addition to injunctive relief, the final judgment orders Park to pay disgorgement of $143,031, prejudgment interest of $13,763 and a civil penalty of $130,000. Park consented to the entry of the final judgment without admitting or denying any of the allegations in the Commissions complaint., The Commission commenced this action on July 1, 2009, by filing an action against Park for his alleged role in a fraudulent pyramid scheme. Wealth Pools International, Inc. (Wealth Pools) purported to be a multi-level marketing company selling a language tutorial DVD through a network of members around the world. The Commission alleged that in reality, it was a fraudulent pyramid scheme premised on the sale of memberships and thus destined to collapse, leaving the majority of investors with substantial losses. The complaint alleged that Park established the telemarketing sales force at Wealth Pools, headed the customer service department, and solicited investors into the fraudulent pyramid scheme. The complaint also alleged that while offering and selling Wealth Pools securities, Park misled investors about Wealth Pools business structure, the safety of the Wealth Pools investment, and the dilutive effect on the commissions from the addition of new investors., For further information, see <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21115.htm>LR-21115</a> / July 1, 2009., ]"

Sample, and J. Michael Broullire</i>, Civil Action No. 1:10-cv-00739 (BEL)(D. Md.)</h2>]","[, On March 25, 2010, the Commission filed a settled injunctive action in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland against the former CEO and President of TVI Corporation, Richard V. Priddy of Severn, Maryland; the former Executive Vice President of TVI, Charles L. Sample of Annapolis, Maryland; and their personal accountant, J. Michael Broullire of Bethesda, Maryland; for violating the antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws. The Commission alleged that, from 2003 through 2006, Priddy and Sample, in some instances aided by Broullire, engaged in multiple schemes to defraud TVI and its shareholders. The schemes involved undisclosed related party transactions and compensation. At the time, TVI was a public company based in Glendale, Maryland, but the Commission revoked TVIâs securities registration in a settled proceeding in 2009.Â , According to the Commissionâs complaint, in two schemes, Priddy and Sample had Broullire create corporate entities that purchased products from a supplier and then resold the products to TVI at significantly marked-up prices. Priddy also had TVI pay one of the entities a finderâs fee for a corporate acquisition even though the entity did nothing to earn the fee. The Commission alleged that Priddy, Sample, and Broullire had agreed to split the ill-gotten profits from their schemes 42.5%, 42.5%, and 15%, respectively. These related party transactions were not disclosed to TVI and, consequently, were not disclosed in TVIâs filings with the Commission., In another scheme, Priddy increased Sampleâs compensation and Sample kicked-back a portion of the increased compensation to Priddy in return. Neither Priddy nor Sample disclosed to TVI this arrangement or their actual compensation, and, consequently, TVI did not disclose their accurate compensation in its filings with the Commission or in its proxy statements., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissionâs complaint, Priddy and Sample have agreed to permanent injunctions from violating Sections 10(b) and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, and 14a-9 thereunder and from aiding and abetting violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 thereunder; Priddy also agreed to a permanent injunction from violating Rule 13b2-2 under the Exchange Act; and Broullire agreed to a permanent injunction from violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and from aiding and abetting violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 thereunder. Priddy and Sample each also agreed to a permanent officer and director bar. The settlements are subject to Court approval., In a related criminal case, the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the District of Maryland announced the filing of a criminal information charging the defendants with conspiracy to commit wire fraud in connection with the self-dealing scheme. Priddy and Sample each also are charged with filing a false federal income tax return. The offenses carry possible penalties that include imprisonment, fine, and restitution to the company., The Commission thanks the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the District of Maryland, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Department of the Treasury for their cooperation and assistance in connection with this matter., <b>See Also:</b> <a href=/litigation/complaints/2010/comp21462.pdf title=>SEC Complaint</a> ]"

Bailey, Gary C. Heath, and Florian R. Ternes â each participated in the pump-and-dump scheme, described in the original complaint, involving GH3 International, Inc. during 2006. The amended complaint alleges that Bailey and Ternes, who were officers of GH3 at the time, made hundreds of millions of GH3 shares available, through Heath, to Pawel Dynkowski and other defendants to liquidate in the market once they had pumped the stock through manipulative trading and false, misleading and touting press releases. Bailey and Ternes shared in the schemes proceeds of $747,609 and, when it was nearly over, sold almost a billion shares of GH3 on their own for proceeds of $272,000., The original complaint alleged that Dynkowski and seven others had manipulated the trading in four penny stocks: GH3, Asia Global Holdings, Inc., Playstar Corp., and Xtreme Motorsports of California, Inc. They did so by pumping the stocks through manipulative trading (using washed sales and matched orders) and false or misleading press releases. They then dumped on the market billions of shares of unregistered stock that they obtained from the issuers. Together, these schemes reaped more than $6.2 million in illicit proceeds., The amended complaint alleges that Bailey and Ternes violated Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and that Heath violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act.

Villalba, Jr., 47, of Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, with misappropriating approximately $6 million of client funds. The complaint alleges that Villalba solicited prospective clients through his former investment advisory business, Money Market Alternative, L.P. and affiliated entities, Money Market Alternative Ltd., Money Market Plus, and Hybrid Money Market Management LLC. The complaint alleges that Villalba touted an investment strategy he developed that he falsely claimed was conservative, relatively risk free and would preserve his clients principal capital while still earning them returns of 8% to 12% annually. To substantiate the safety of his investment strategy, the complaint alleges that Villalba falsely claimed that he placed stop orders approximately 2% above or below the entry price of the investments. The complaint also alleges that Villalba further enticed prospective clients by assuring them their money would only be used for investments in securities, including S&amp;P 500 Index contracts, treasury bills or interest earning money market accounts, and that his management fees would be limited to between 12% and 15% of the profits he generated on their behalf., According to the SECs complaint, from 1996 through June 2009, Villalba attracted over $39 million in client funds, and from 1998 through 2009, Villalba lost, through trading, over $17 million of his clients money. The SECs complaint also alleges that Villalba misappropriated client funds by (i) paying over $4.1 million for Villalbas management fees, salary and his companys overhead, (ii) purchasing over $700,000 in real property, (iii) investing over $1.2 million in two start-up coffee businesses Villalba owned, and (iv) making Ponzi-like payments. The complaint further alleges that Villalba, to hide his investment failures and his misappropriation of client funds, prepared and provided his clients with false quarterly accounts statements, which always showed that his clients accounts had overall increased in value. The complaint also alleges that Villalba provided one investor with falsified brokerage statements using the letterhead of a brokerage firm., The SECs complaint charges Villalba with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

The District Court, among other things, permanently enjoined Dorozhko from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and ordered the defendant to pay approximately $580,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty., On October 29, 2007, the Commission filed a Complaint alleging that just hours before the close of the market on October 17, 2007, Dorozhko, while in possession of material nonpublic information regarding the impending announcement of negative earnings by IMS Health, purchased 630 put options on the common stock of IMS Health. IMS Health planned to announce negative earnings via an investor relations service after the market closed on October 17. Earlier that day, Dorozhko secretly hacked into the investor relations firms secure computer network and unlawfully accessed IMS Healths earnings information. Within minutes of this hack, and just before IMS Healths scheduled earnings release, Dorozhko embarked on an aggressive buying campaign and was able to purchase the IMS Health put options. After the market closed, IMS Health reported third quarter earnings that were significantly below analysts consensus estimates and the previous years third quarter earnings. The next day, IMS Healths stock price fell 28% to an all-time low, and Dorozhko sold all of his IMS Health put options and realized profits of approximately $287,346., The Complaint alleges, among other things, that Dorozhko violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder by using fraudulent devices, schemes, or artifices, which may include, but are not limited to, hacking into computer networks or otherwise improperly obtaining electronic access to systems that contained information about IMS Healths imminent earnings announcement., On January 7, 2008, the District Court denied the Commissions motion for a preliminary injunction and concluded that Dorozhkos alleged stealing and trading or hacking and trading does not amount to a violation â¦ because Dorozhko did not breach any fiduciary or similar duty in connection with the purchase or sale of a security. <i>SEC v. Dorozhko</i>, 606 F. Supp. 2d 321, 324 (S.D.N.Y. 2008)., On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the District Courts decision holding that nothing in the U.S. Supreme Courts jurisprudence or prior decisions of our Court expressly imposes a fiduciary-duty requirement on the ordinary meaning of deceptive where the alleged fraud is an affirmative misrepresentation rather than a nondisclosure. <i>SEC v. Dorozhko</i>, 574 F.3d 42, 42 (2d Cir. 2009). The Second Circuit further held that computer hacking may be deceptive [even] where the hacker did not breach a fiduciary duty in fraudulently obtaining material, nonpublic information used in connection with the purchase or sale of securities and that misrepresenting ones identity in order to gain access to information that is otherwise off limits, and then stealing that information is plainly deceptive within the ordinary meaning of the word. <i>Id.</i> at 43, 51.

Criminal authorities arrested Nicholson and charged him with securities fraud, among other things, on the same day. Nicholson has been incarcerated since his arrest. The Commissions complaint alleges that Nicholson sold interests in eleven hedge funds based upon material misstatements and omissions about the funds investment success and size. While Nicholson had claimed to manage between $600 million and $900 million through Westgate, those claims were wildly overblown. Westgate did raise roughly $290 million from investors on the basis of material misstatements and omissions., Nicholson has pleaded guilty to charges in the parallel criminal action and is scheduled to be sentenced on June 30, 2010., The Commission acknowledges the assistance and cooperation of the United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation., For more information, see <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr20911.htm>Litigation Release No. 20911</a> (Feb. 25, 2009)., ]"

On each occasion Pirtle, a resident of Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, allegedly tipped Berrettini of Lake Forest, Illinois, about Philipsâ plans, and Berrettini purchased shares in the three companies. According to the first amended complaint, Berrettini earned an aggregate profit of $240,622 on his trades in Lifeline and Intermagnetics common stock when Philips announced it was acquiring those companies., The first amended complaint alleges that Pirtle received material, nonpublic information about Philipsâ acquisition plans and provided this information to Berrettini in breach of his fiduciary duties to his employer. The first amended complaint also alleges that Berrettini, as a long-time real estate broker and consultant to Philips, knew or reasonably should have known that Pirtle gave him the information in breach of Pirtleâs duties, and that trading on the information would violate Berrettiniâs own obligations to Philips. According to the first amended complaint, Pirtle and Berrettini had other side-dealings over an extended period of time, unbeknownst to and undisclosed to Philips. The other side-dealings allegedly included a series of transactions in which Berrettini purchased goods and services for Pirtle through cashierâs checks totaling approximately $226,000. The first amended complaint alleges that Pirtle and Berrettini violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Blood, of Scottsdale, Arizona, while serving as president and chief executive officer of former registered investment adviser, Capital Wealth Management, Inc. (âCWMâ), compiled a $10.2 million investment pool from twenty of his CWM clients and formed a hedge fund, ABC-CWM, Inc.Â  In recommending ABC-CWM to his clients, the complaint alleges that Blood represented to these clients that any investment opportunity that ABC-CWM made would be backed by a legitimate bank guarantee or other form of collateral.Â  Blood also allegedly represented that their principal would never be at risk and that he would not personally profit from any transaction he recommended to them other than his CWM management fee. Â , The complaint further alleges that in February 2009, Blood recommended that his clients loan the $10.2 million to Adelaide Partners, LLC, which in turn would invest with Amkel Capital, a purported financial services firm based in the United Kingdom.Â  According to the complaint, Blood represented to his clients that ABC-CWM would receive a bank guarantee in exchange for the $10.2 million loan and earn 20% per month for two months.Â  The complaint alleges that in recommending this investment, Blood breached his fiduciary duty to his clients by failing to disclose a side compensation agreement with Adelaide Partners wherein he would receive 85% of any excess profits resulting from the investment.Â  The complaint alleges that Blood then caused Adelaide Partners to transfer the $10.2 million to an Amkel Capital bank account in Switzerland without ever securing a bank guarantee or any other form of collateral.Â  Yet, according to the complaint, from February to April 2009, Blood falsely assured his clients that their funds were safe in an account under Bloodâs control.Â  The complaint claims that, in reality, Amkel Capital was a sham operation run by a convicted felon and that Bloodâs ABC-CWM clients have yet to receive the return of their $10.2 million investment.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â , Blood agreed to settle this matter without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.Â  Blood consented to a permanent injunction from further violations of Sections 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.

ORiordan consented to the entry of a judgment that, among other things, bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company and from participating in any offering of a penny stock. In a related federal criminal matter, ORiordan today was also charged with securities fraud by the United States Attorneys Office for the District of Massachusetts. If convicted, ORiordan faces up to 20 years imprisonment to be followed by up to 5 years of supervised release, and a $5 million fine., The Commissions Complaint, filed in federal district court in Massachusetts, alleges that ORiordan, then the president of Paradigm, signed a false Form D filed with the Commission in 2005 reporting that a private placement of Paradigm stock had occurred, when in fact the private placement never happened. Instead, according to the Complaint, Paradigms founder controlled the vast majority of the stock, and later sold it into the market without registering it with the Commission and after the stock price had been pumped by false and misleading statements. The Complaint alleges, among other things, that ORiordan helped to perpetrate the scheme to avoid registration by signing backdated stock certificates and assisted in preparing a list of purported accredited investors who, in fact, were nominee shareholders who had never paid for or received Paradigm stock and were under the control of Paradigms founder. In fact, according to the Complaint, the list of purported investors included the name of a deceased person. The Complaint alleges that Paradigms stock price increased from $2.85 per share to $3.15 per share over the two day period following an August 18, 2005 press release issued by Paradigm in which ORiordan made false and misleading positive statements concerning Paradigms sales revenues. The Complaint further alleges that ORiordan received shares from Paradigm which he sold between 2007 and 2009, after he had left the company, in unregistered transactions., ORiordan has agreed to settle this matter without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions Complaint.

Allen Stanfords alleged multi-billion dollar fraud scheme. The Receiver expects these funds to be returned to the receivership estate by June 2010., This recovery was accomplished by the extensive cooperation between SEC staff and other regulatory authorities in multiple jurisdictions and the court-appointed Receiver in the Commissions enforcement action against R. Allen Stanford and others. As a result of these efforts, the Receiver was able to close on a sales contract of certain Stanford-related entities located in Republic of Panama to third party purchasers, with the sale proceeds provided to the receivership estate., R. Allen Stanford is the sole stockholder of an entity that wholly owned a bank and brokerage business in Panama City, Republic of Panama, known as Stanford Bank (Panama) S.A. (SPB) and Stanford Casa de Valores, S.A. (SCV). On February 17, 2009, after the Commission filed its enforcement action against R. Allan Stanford and others, the Superintendencia de Bancos de PanamÃ¡, the Panamanian banking regulator, and the ComisiÃ³n Nacional de Valores, the Panamanian securities regulator, assumed control, operation and subsequent reorganization of SBP and SCV, with a perspective of bringing those entities under new ownership and reopening them, Ultimately, with the approval of the Superintendencia de Bancos de PanamÃ¡, the Receiver negotiated and concluded a contract to sell SBP, SCV and certain other assets in Panama to the third party purchasers. This contract specifically conditioned the sale on the approval of the U.S. Court, and the unfreezing of SBP accounts in foreign jurisdictions in which SBP depositor accounts were located. In order to help ensure that the sale would be made possible, Commission staff in the Office of International Affairs and in the Division of Enforcement worked closely with the Receiver and with authorities in Panama and other jurisdictions, including Switzerland and the United Kingdom., The sale of SBP and SCV was approved by United States District Judge David C.

In addition, the judgment dismisses the Commissions claims for permanent injunctive relief and a penny stock bar against HTD in light of the fact that the firm is in the process of winding down its affairs and will be dissolved. HTD consented to entry of the final judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint., The Commission commenced this action on February 3, 2009, when it filed an ex parte, emergency action alleging that four Chicago residents and their entities worked in concert with boiler room sales agents based in Europe to orchestrate a massive international boiler room scheme. The allegedly fraudulent scheme involved the sale of shares of U.S. penny stock issuers to investors located throughout Europe. Critical to the scheme was the fact that defendants never informed investors that more than 60% of their investment funds were used to pay sales commissions. From March 2007 until the filing of the Commission action, the scheme allegedly raised at least $44.2 million from at least 1,400 investors. On February 3, U.S. District Judge Joan Lefkow granted all emergency relief requested by the Commission., The Commission alleged in its original complaint that HTD, a Chicago law firm, acted as an escrow agent through its employee, Philip T. Powers. The Commission charged HTD solely with effecting transactions in, or inducing or attempt to induce, the purchase or sale of securities, without registering with the Commission as a broker or dealer, in violation of Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act)., In addition, Judge Lefkow granted the Commission leave to file an amended complaint naming Stephan von Hase (von Hase) and his entity, CTA Worldwide Services, SA (CTA) as defendants. The Commission alleges that von Hase and CTA participated in the boiler room scheme described in the original complaint by acting in concert with the remaining defendants. The amended complaint alleges von Hase and CTA entered into agreements with penny stock issuers to solicit foreign investors in exchange for commissions that collectively exceed 60% of the investor proceeds. Von Hase and CTA allegedly retained foreign sales agents to solicit investors and, through escrow agents, received approximately $16.7 million from investors without informing them of the exorbitant fees. The Commissions amended complaint alleges that von Hase and CTA violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder through their participation in the scheme and seeks an order of permanent injunction, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, civil penalties and a penny stock bar., For further information, see <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr20881.htm>LR-20881</a> (February 4, 2009)., ]"

The Commissions federal court complaint, filed on June 3, 2004, alleges that from 1998 until early 2003, Symbol and the eleven individual defendants engaged in fraudulent accounting practices aimed at falsifying Symbols reported financial results. The judgments and the administrative order imposed the following relief, to which both Borghese and DeGennaro consented without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions complaint and, in DeGennaros case, the findings in the administrative order:, Frank Borghese, formerly Symbols Senior Vice President of Worldwide Sales and Services, consented to a judgment, entered on February 22, 2010, that requires him to disgorge a total of $450,000 and waives imposition of a civil monetary penalty based on his demonstrated financial inability to pay additional amounts. The consent judgment also prohibits him from acting as an officer or director of a public company and permanently enjoins him from violating the relevant antifraud, corporate reporting, books and records and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws. Specifically, Borghese is permanently enjoined from violating, or aiding and abetting violations of, Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, and 13b2-1. The complaint alleges that, as head of sales, Borghese spearheaded Symbols various channel stuffing and other fraudulent revenue recognition practices., Michael DeGennaro, formerly Symbols Senior Vice President of Finance, consented to a final judgment, entered on April 6, 2010, that requires him to pay a civil penalty of $40,000. In addition, on April 2, 2010, the Commission issued an order finding that DeGennaro was a cause of Symbols violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act -- the corporate books and records and internal control provisions of the Exchange Act -- and directing DeGennaro to cease and desist from causing such violations in the future. The Commissions order finds that: (i) In 2000 and 2001, Symbol created and used certain restructuring charges and related reserves in contravention of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), causing Symbol to misstate its operating expenses and net income on its books and records and in its financial statements; and (ii) DeGennaro was one of the executives who determined how these charges were recorded, and he failed to take the requisite steps to ensure that the charges and the uses of associated reserves were properly recorded and accounted for in accordance with GAAP., Consent judgments were previously entered against each of the other ten defendants, with the exception of Tomo Razmilovic, Symbols former Chief Executive Officer. On December 23, 2009, the Court entered a default judgment against Razmilovic as a sanction for his refusal to appear for his court-ordered deposition in the United States. Razmilovic currently resides in Sweden and has been a fugitive from justice since being indicted on parallel criminal charges in the Eastern District of New York. The Court has commenced an evidentiary hearing to determine the relief to be imposed against Razmilovic pursuant to the default judgment. The Commission is seeking permanent injunctive relief, an officer-and-director bar, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, and civil monetary penalties. The hearing is scheduled to resume on May 10, 2010. The Commissions complaint alleges that Razmilovic orchestrated the fraud at Symbol to create the false appearance that Symbol was achieving the aggressive financial performance targets imposed by Razmilovic., The Commission acknowledges the assistance and cooperation of the United States Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service in this matter., ]"

Tencza, of Meridian, Idaho and formerly of Scottsdale, Arizona, and American Elder Group, L.L.C. (AEG), Tenczas business. The final judgment: (1) enjoined Tencza and AEG from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Rules 10b-5 and 10b-10 promulgated thereunder and enjoined Tencza from aiding and abetting violations of Rule 10b-10 of the Exchange Act; (2) ordered Tencza and AEG to pay disgorgement in the amount of $1,661,837.07, plus prejudgment interest of $759,082.71, for a total of $2,420,919.78; and (3) ordered Tencza to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $120,000 and AEG to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $600,000., The SECs complaint in this matter charges that Michael E. Kelly and 25 other defendants, including Tencza and AEG, participated in a massive fraud on U.S. investors that involved the offer and sale of securities in the form of Universal Leases. Universal Lease investments were structured as timeshares in several hotels in Cancun, Mexico, coupled with a pre-arranged rental agreement that promised investors a high, fixed rate of return. The SECs complaint alleges that from 1999 until 2005, Kelly and others, including Tencza and AEG, raised at least $428 million through the Universal Lease scheme from investors throughout the United States, with more than $136 million of the funds invested coming from IRA accounts. The SEC further alleges that a nationwide network of unregistered salespeople who sold the Universal Leases, including Tencza and AEG, collected undisclosed commissions totaling more than $72 million. The SEC also alleges that Kelly and others ran the scheme from Cancun, Mexico, through a number of foreign entities in Mexico and Panama. According to the SECs complaint, Kelly and others told investors that Universal Leases would generate guaranteed income through the leasing of investor timeshares by a large, independent leasing agent.

The Commissions complaint alleges that Scott D. Farah of Meredith, New Hampshire, and Donald E. Dodge of Belmont, New Hampshire, acting through their businesses, Financial Resources Mortgage, Inc. and C L and M, Inc., defrauded at least $20 million from at least 150 investors beginning as early as 2005., The Commissions complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire, alleges that the scheme involved raising investor money to fund purported loans to specific real estate construction projects and other businesses. According to the Commissions complaint, Scott Farah and his mortgage brokerage company, Financial Resources Mortgage, Inc. offered investors annual returns of 12% to 20% and falsely represented to investors that invested monies would be segregated and invested in the specific project that the investors had agreed to fund. The complaint alleged that Donald Dodge and his unlicensed loan servicing company, C L and M, Inc., serviced all loans brokered through Scott Farah and Financial Resources Mortgage, Inc. In reality, according to the Commissions complaint, the Defendants did not segregate investor money and used it for a variety of purposes not authorized by the offering documents, including paying returns to earlier investors, paying personal expenses, paying operating expenses of Financial Resources Mortgage, Inc. and C L and M, Inc., and donating money to the Center Harbor Christian Church, a church founded and owned by Scott Farahs father, and of which Scott Farah was treasurer. The complaint names the church as a relief defendant, and seeks the return of investor funds diverted to it., The Commissions complaint alleges that defendants Scott D.

For his crimes, Cook faces a potential maximum penalty of 20 years in federal prison on the mail fraud charge and five years on the tax evasion charge. His sentence will be determined at a future date. The U.S. Attorneys Office for the District of Minneapolis filed criminal charges against Cook on March 30, 2010., Cook is one of the defendants in a pending civil injunctive action filed by the SEC on November 23, 2009 in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota. The SECs action against Cook arises out of the same facts that are the subject of the criminal case. The SECs complaint alleges that from at least July 2006 through at least July 2009, Cook and co-defendant Patrick J. Kiley of Minneapolis, Minnesota, raised at least $190 million from at least 1,000 investors through the sale of unregistered investments in a purported foreign currency trading venture. According to the SECs complaint, Cook and Kiley pooled investors funds in bank and trading accounts in the names of entities they controlled. The SECs complaint alleges that the foreign currency trading they did conduct resulted in millions of dollars in losses, and they misused approximately one half of the investor funds raised to make Ponzi-like payments to earlier investors and pay for, among other things, Cooks gambling losses and the purchase of the historic Van Dusen Mansion in Minneapolis. The SECs complaint charges Cook and Kiley with violating Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission also filed an action on November 23, 2009, against Cook, Kiley and others for their roles in the scheme., On November 23, 2009, the Court entered a preliminary injunction order against Cook and froze all of his assets.

The final judgment: (1) enjoins the Levines, Copeland and Nu Star from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act); (2) enjoins the Levines and Nu Star from violating Section 5 of the Securities Act; (3) enjoins the Levines from violating Section 15(b) of the Exchange Act; (4) orders the Levines, Copeland and Nu Star to pay $2,593,712 in disgorgement plus $787,977 in prejudgment interest, for a total of $3,381,689; (5) orders the Levines, Copeland and Nu Star to pay a civil penalty of $120,000; (6) bars the Levines and Copeland from participating in an offer of a penny stock; and (7) bars the Levines from acting as officers or directors of publicly traded companies., The court issued the final judgment after granting the Commissions motion for summary judgment. In the motion for summary judgment, the Commission argued that from October 1, 2003 through December 31, 2005, the Levines and their associates worked with boiler rooms in Barcelona, Spain and set up their own boiler room in Santa Ana, California to sell various Pink Sheets stocks to innocent, overseas investors. The Levines were assisted in their endeavors by defendant Copeland, who introduced them to the individuals who operated the Barcelona boiler rooms and who assisted in setting up the Santa Ana, California boiler room., The Commissions motion for summary judgment argued that these defendants made numerous material misrepresentations and omissions in violation of the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws.

Nickles, age 53, of Dana Point, Calif., and his three companies, Innovative Advisory Services, Inc., Innovative Advisory Services LLC, and Island Trader LLC, all of which operate from the same location in Santa Ana, Calif. The complaint alleges that since March 2009, Nickles has raised approximately $3 million through advertisements in prominent newspapers for investments that are purportedly insured or U.S. Government guaranteed. In reality, Nickles did not invest the funds as promised., The SEC alleges that Nickles provided investors with false trade confirmations that identified securities he had not purchased or that were non-existent. In an effort to portray his business as legitimate, Nickles issued the confirmations through Island Trader, a regulated broker-dealer which had no dealings with Nickles or Innovative Advisory since March 2009. According to the complaint, through these confirmations, Nickles succeeded in giving investors the false impression that he was associated with a legitimate broker-dealer and that their investments were insured with the Securities Investor Protection Corp. He allegedly used the name Island Trader LLC for his non-regulated company in order to give further credence to his misrepresentations. The SEC also alleges that Nickles held himself out as a certified financial planner, when, in fact, he was not., The Honorable James V.

The Quadrangle defendants agreed to settle the SECs charges and pay a penalty of $5 million., The SEC previously charged Henry Morris, the top political advisor and chief fundraiser for former New York State Comptroller Alan Hevesi, and David Loglisci, the former New York State Deputy Comptroller, for orchestrating a fraudulent scheme that extracted kickbacks from investment management firms seeking to manage the assets of the New York State Common Retirement Fund. In todays complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, the Commission alleges that the Quadrangle defendants entered into undisclosed financial arrangements that benefited Morris and Loglisci in order to win investment business from the Retirement Fund., Specifically, the SEC alleges that the Quadrangle defendants secured a $100 million investment from the Retirement Fund only after a former Quadrangle executive arranged for a Quadrangle affiliate to distribute the DVD of a low-budget film called Chooch that Loglisci and his brothers had produced and after that executive agreed to pay more than $1 million in sham finder fees to Morris. The scheme corrupted the integrity of the Common Funds investment processes and resulted in the Retirement Funds assets being invested with the undisclosed purpose of enriching Morris and Logliscis brother., In settling the SECs charges without admitting or denying the allegations, Quadrangle Group LLC and Quadrangle GP Investors II, L.P. consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 and orders them to pay the financial penalty.

Long and Stanley M. Paulic â who formed and owned Integrity Financial AZ, LLC â and Walter W. Knitter and Robert C. Koeller â two salesmen who helped attract investors â raised more than $8 million between February 2008 and September 2009, in a fraudulent unregistered offering of promissory notes purportedly secured by real estate in Tonopah, Arizona, a town 55 miles west of Phoenix., The offering attracted at least 58 investors. More than half of the investors reside in northern Ohio, and several are associated with St. Pauls Croatian Church in Cleveland. The complaint alleges that Integrity Financial AZ, Long, Paulic, Knitter, and Koeller violated Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 15(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and seeks permanent injunctions from further violations of those provisions, as well as judgments ordering payment of disgorgement, with prejudgment interest thereon, and civil penalties against each of the defendants., The Commissions complaint alleges that the defendants promised investors guaranteed annual returns of between 10 and 20 percent and encouraged investors to use self-directed IRA, 401k, and other funds to build homes in Arizona that were to be inhabited by qualified tenants who could be converted to buyers. Investors were assured that their investments were secured, low risk, insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and protected by homeowners insurance. The complaint also alleges, however, that there was no FDIC or insurance protection for the investments., Instead, the investments bore considerable risk tied to the floundering Arizona real estate market, which has been hard hit by the recession and declining property values. The complaint further alleges that investors were told that 100% of their investments would go to build homes, although, in reality, only a fraction of the money was used for that purpose and the bulk of it was diverted to Longs other real estate interests; commissions and other payments made to the defendants; and Ponzi-scheme-like payments to earlier investors., <b>See Also:</b> <a href=/litigation/complaints/2010/comp21488.pdf title=>SEC Complaint</a> ]"

(GS&amp;Co) and a GS&amp;Co employee, Fabrice Tourre (Tourre), for making material misstatements and omissions in connection with a synthetic collateralized debt obligation (CDO) GS&amp;Co structured and marketed to investors. This synthetic CDO, ABACUS 2007-AC1, was tied to the performance of subprime residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) and was structured and marketed in early 2007 when the United States housing market and the securities referencing it were beginning to show signs of distress. Synthetic CDOs like ABACUS 2007-AC1 contributed to the recent financial crisis by magnifying losses associated with the downturn in the United States housing market., According to the Commissions complaint, the marketing materials for ABACUS 2007-AC1 â including the term sheet, flip book and offering memorandum for the CDO â all represented that the reference portfolio of RMBS underlying the CDO was selected by ACA Management LLC (ACA), a third party with expertise in analyzing credit risk in RMBS. Undisclosed in the marketing materials and unbeknownst to investors, a large hedge fund, Paulson &amp; Co. Inc. (Paulson), with economic interests directly adverse to investors in the ABACUS 2007-AC1 CDO played a significant role in the portfolio selection process. After participating in the selection of the reference portfolio, Paulson effectively shorted the RMBS portfolio it helped select by entering into credit default swaps (CDS) with GS&amp;Co to buy protection on specific layers of the ABACUS 2007-AC1 capital structure. Given its financial short interest, Paulson had an economic incentive to choose RMBS that it expected to experience credit events in the near future. GS&amp;Co did not disclose Paulsons adverse economic interest or its role in the portfolio selection process in the term sheet, flip book, offering memorandum or other marketing materials., The Commission alleges that Tourre was principally responsible for ABACUS 2007-AC1. According to the Commissions complaint, Tourre devised the transaction, prepared the marketing materials and communicated directly with investors. Tourre is alleged to have known of Paulsons undisclosed short interest and its role in the collateral selection process. He is also alleged to have misled ACA into believing that Paulson invested approximately $200 million in the equity of ABACUS 2007-AC1 (a long position) and, accordingly, that Paulsons interests in the collateral section process were aligned with ACAs when in reality Paulsons interests were sharply conflicting. The deal closed on April 26, 2007. Paulson paid GS&amp;Co approximately $15 million for structuring and marketing ABACUS 2007-AC1. By October 24, 2007, 83% of the RMBS in the ABACUS 2007-AC1 portfolio had been downgraded and 17% was on negative watch. By January 29, 2008, 99% of the portfolio had allegedly been downgraded. Investors in the liabilities of ABACUS 2007-AC1 are alleged to have lost over $1 billion. Paulsons opposite CDS positions yielded a profit of approximately $1 billion., The Commissions complaint, which was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges GS&amp;Co and Tourre with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C.

According to the complaint, Jinnah was nominally the sole officer and director of Exotics.com, but Mueller was de facto the companys top officer and was Jinnahs employer outside of Exotics.com.

Custable, Jr. Custable, a former resident of Glendale-Heights, Illinois, was the architect of a complex and wide-reaching fraudulent penny stock scheme that he orchestrated from November 2001 until the SEC commenced an emergency lawsuit in March 2003 and obtained a temporary restraining order shutting it down. The final judgment, to which Custable consented: (i) enjoins Custable from future violations of the antifraud and registration provisions contained in Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and at Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; (ii) enjoins Custable from future violations of the securities reporting provisions contained at Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13d-1 and 13d-2 thereunder; (iii) permanently bars him from participating in an offering of penny stock; (iv) orders him to disgorge $4,444,113 of ill-gotten gains plus an additional $1,981,736 of prejudgment interest; and (iv) orders him to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $120,000., The Commissions complaint alleged that Custable and others violated the registration, antifraud and reporting violations of the federal securities laws through the use of unregistered and fraudulent penny stock offerings. The complaint alleged that Custable accomplished this by obtaining and dumping massive quantities of improperly registered or unregistered shares of stock of at least seven different penny stock companies on the general public, generating net proceeds to Custable of at least $4.3 million. The complaint additionally alleged that Custable fraudulently concealed his ownership interest in the seven penny stocks by having various entities and persons he controlled engage in a host of securities transactions on his behalf. The complaint alleged that Custable obtained stock through fraudulent Form S-8 registrations (normally intended to allow distribution of securities to employees and consultants), fraudulent manipulations of Rule 144(k) holding requirements for resales of restricted stock, and through a scheme to counterfeit nearly half of the outstanding stock of one of these penny stock companies. The complaint alleged that the penny stock companies received substantial financing from Custable in exchange for providing these massive blocks of unregistered or improperly registered stock that Custable dumped on the market through various nominee accounts held in the names of persons or entities he employed or controlled., In addition to charging Custable and certain of his employees, the Commission also charged certain of the penny stock companies and their officers with securities fraud and registration violations, as well as certain individuals and entities employed or controlled by Custable. Custable has pled guilty to various federal charges arising out of his conduct in the scheme, and on June 9, 2009 was sentenced to a prison term of 21 years.

The SEC obtained an emergency court order to freeze the assets of the firm and individuals involved., The SEC alleges that Gryphon Holdings Inc., owner Kenneth E. Marsh, and the Gryphon associates induced investors to pay fees of up to $250,000 for securities recommendations that they falsely claim are based on sound research and successful strategies of trading experts with superior knowledge. In an effort to lend legitimacy to the firms advisory business, Gryphon touts trading experts with fake names who boast millions of dollars in trading riches as well as top-notch educational backgrounds and prominent experience at major Wall Street firms. Gryphon representatives even fabricated glowing testimonials from George Soros and purported clients who profited by trading securities the firm recommended., According to the SECs complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, investors who followed the guidance of Gryphons purported experts have suffered significant losses by trading on those tips or, in at least one instance, by allowing Gryphon to trade on their behalf., In addition to Gryphon and Marsh, the SECs complaint charges Baldwin Anderson and Robert Anthony Budion, both of Staten Island, N.Y., Jeanne Lada of Freehold, N.J., and James Levier of Beachwood, N.J., According to the SECs complaint, Gryphon obtained more than $17.5 million from its operations over the past three years. Gryphon and its associates made numerous material misrepresentations and omissions since at least 2007 to entice unsuspecting clients to purchase its services. Gryphons representatives used high-pressure tactics to obtain additional fees from clients to purportedly give those clients access to better yielding investment tips, even if Gryphon had not provided all the advisory services for which the client had already paid., The SEC specifically alleges that Gryphon falsely touted that it:, The SECs complaint alleges that Gryphon made these and many other material misrepresentations in the course of inducing clients to purchase investment services or providing personalized securities recommendations to clients., Gryphon markets itself as a publisher of financial information. Gryphon frequently posts investment tips on the Internet using at least 40 different monikers such as Wolves of Wall Street, Wall Streets Most Wanted, Pure Profit, and Mafia Trader. In reality, as alleged in the SECs complaint, Gryphons financial publications only serve as a vehicle to attract unsuspecting clients to pay fees for personalized investment recommendations, portfolio analysis, and money management services that Gryphon purportedly provided., The Honorable Jack B. Weinstein of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York granted the SECs request for a temporary restraining order and asset freeze against the Defendants and six others named as Relief Defendants: Richard Borrello, Nicole Marsh, Ginna Mungiovi, Michael Scarpaci, Dominic Spinelli, and Paul Stokes.

Shapiro With Operating a $900 Million Fraud and Ponzi Scheme</h2>]","[, The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it has filed an injunctive action against Nevin K. Shapiro, alleging that he conducted a $900 million offering fraud and Ponzi scheme targeting more than 60 investors nationwide., The SECs complaint alleges that from February 2003 through November 2009, Shapiro, the president, Chief Executive Officer and sole shareholder of Capitol Investments USA Inc., (Capitol), a Miami Beach, Florida-based grocery diverter, offered promissory notes claiming annual returns of 10 to 26% purportedly backed by purchase orders and receivables generated by Capitols food brokerage business. In reality, Capitol was operating at a loss since late 2004 with virtually no operations by 2005. Beginning in January 2005 through November 2009, Shapiro operated a Ponzi scheme using new investor funds to pay principal and interest to earlier investors., Grocery diverters like Capitol purchase lower-priced groceries in one region and re-sell them for a profit to another region, where prices are higher. According to the SECs complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, Shapiro used his business relationships and word of mouth to solicit investors by selling them short term promissory notes, telling them that he would use their funds as short term financing to purchase and resell groceries for Capitols business. Shapiro falsely touted Capitols financial success (as well as his own) and assured investors that their principal was secure because Capitol would not broker the sale of the goods without first obtaining a purchase order from a buyer. Shapiro also falsely told investors that Capitol would pay the principal and interest from the profits it received when it resold the goods. When investors raised questions about Capitols business, Shapiro showed them fabricated invoices and purchase orders for nonexistent sales., The SECs Complaint further alleges that Shapiro also misappropriated at least $38 million of investor funds to finance outside business ventures unrelated to the grocery business, including a sport representation business and real estate ventures, and to fund his lavish lifestyle. He also used investor funds to pay large commissions to individuals who attracted additional investors., The SECs complaint charges Shapiro with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, sworn accounting, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil money penalty against the defendant. The SEC coordinated the filing of these charges with the United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey who charged Shapiro today with securities fraud and money laundering. Shapiro surrendered this morning to special agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Internal Revenue Service criminal investigation unit.

Although the fund had total investments of $250,000, Neufeld and Paridon at one point claimed assets of $1.07 million.

In addition, according to the complaint, Paridon and Neufeld caused the fund to use a significant portion of its investor funds to purchase alleged debt securities issued by Paridon.

Today, the Honorable Denise Page Hood of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan granted the SECs request for a temporary restraining order and asset freeze against all three Defendants and set a hearing on the SECs Motion for a Preliminary Injunction for Tuesday, May 11, 2010., The SECs complaint alleges that Detroit-based Onyx Capital Advisors, LLC and its founder Roy Dixon, Jr., recently of Atlanta, Georgia, raised approximately $23.8 million from three public pension funds for a start-up private equity fund and then illegally withdrew money invested by the pension funds to cover personal and other business expenses. Assisting in the scheme was Dixons friend Michael A. Farr, also of Atlanta, Georgia, who controls three companies in which the Onyx Fund invested millions of dollars., In the complaint, the SEC alleges that shortly after the three pension funds made their first contributions to the Onyx Fund in early 2007, Dixon and Onyx Capital began illegally siphoning money. Dixon and Onyx Capital took more than $2.06 million from the Onyx Fund under the guise of excess or advanced management fees and Farr assisted in diverting nearly $1.05 million more from the Onyx Funds purported investments in the companies that he controlled., According to the SECs complaint, Onyx Capital invested more than $15 million from the Onyx fund in three related entities controlled by Farr â Second Chance Motors, SCM Credit LLC, and SCM Finance LLC. Farr diverted a portion of the pension fund investments in Farrs companies to 1097 Sea Jay, LLC, another entity that Farr controlled. Farr then withdrew large sums of cash and provided most of it to Dixon while retaining at least $229,000 for his own benefit. Farr also used Sea Jays bank accounts to make at least $522,000 in payments to construction companies performing work on Dixons house in Atlanta., The SEC further alleges that Dixon and Onyx Capital made numerous false and misleading statements to Onyx Capitals public pension fund clients. For example, one pension fund had concerns about Dixons inexperience in private equity. To allay these concerns and convince the pension fund to fund the investment, Dixon sent a letter falsely stating that a purported joint owner of Onyx Capital with substantial experience evaluating private equity investments would devote all of his efforts to the Onyx Fund. The letter contained a forged signature of that individual, who had reviewed certain investment opportunities for the Onyx Fund during his spare time but has never owned or been employed by Onyx Capital. He instead has been working full-time for another company since 1996., The SECs complaint alleges that Dixon and Onyx Capital violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder, and that Farr aided and abetted Dixons and Onyx Capitals violations of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act. In its complaint, the SEC seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains and civil monetary penalties., ]"

April 23, 2010)</h2>, <h2>SEC Charges Texas Registered Representative With Misappropriating Hundreds of Thousands of Dollars from Three Customers</h2>]","[, The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a settled civil injunctive action against Susan G. Slovak, a former Corsicana, Texas registered representative, accusing her of misappropriating hundreds of thousands of dollars from three customers. The Commission also instituted settled administrative proceedings against Slovaks former supervisor, Beth R. Chapman., The Commissions civil complaint, filed in federal district court in Dallas, alleges that, between 2005 and 2008, Slovak took more than $330,000 from an 83-year-old customer, by liquidating securities in his brokerage account and transferring the proceeds to her personal bank accounts. According to the complaint, Slovak used the proceeds to pay personal expenses. During the period of her misconduct, Slovak was associated with firms that are registered with the Commission as broker-dealers and investment advisers., The complaint further alleges that, in 2008, after exhausting almost all of the elderly customers liquid net worth, Slovak misappropriated an additional $144,000 from the accounts of two other customers, and transferred those funds to the elderly customers brokerage account. In August 2008, Slovak acknowledged her misconduct to her branch manager Chapman and, at Chapman insistence, repurchased securities in the customers accounts. However, according to the complaint, in order to obtain authorization for the repurchases of securities, Slovak made material misstatements and/or omissions to compliance staff and to one of the customers. In particular, she suggested that she had withdrawn the funds by mistake, rather than as a result of deliberate misconduct., The complaint alleges that, as a result of her misconduct, Slovak violated the antifraud provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers Act). Slovak has agreed to settle with the Commission without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint. She has consented to the entry of a permanent injunction prohibiting her from violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 206 of the Advisers Act. She has also agreed to pay a civil money penalty of $25,000 and has acknowledged that the Court will not be imposing a penalty greater than $25,000 based on her sworn representations concerning her financial condition. Finally, she has agreed to an administrative order barring her from association with any broker, dealer or investment adviser., In a separate administrative order issued today, the Commission found that Chapman also misled compliance staff about the circumstances of Slovaks misappropriation of customer funds. The Commission concluded that, as a result of these misleading statements, and her failure to take appropriate actions in response to Slovaks fraud, Chapmans supervisory response to Slovaks misconduct was not reasonable. The order bars Chapman from associating in a supervisory capacity with any broker, dealer or investment adviser, and requires her to pay a civil money penalty of $25,000. Chapman consented to the issuance of the order without admitting or denying the findings in the order., <b>See Also:</b> <a href=/litigation/complaints/2010/comp21502.pdf title=>SEC Complaint</a> ]"

Jasper, former Chief Financial Officer of Sunnyvale, Calif.-based Maxim Integrated Products, liable for securities fraud and other charges. The SEC sued Jasper (along with Maxim and its former CEO) in 2007, alleging that Jasper engaged in a scheme to backdate stock option grants to company personnel, allowing the company to conceal hundreds of millions of dollars of compensation costs and report dramatically inflated income to investors., Following an eight-day trial in U.S. District Court in San Jose, Calif., the eight-member jury found Jasper liable for, among other violations, fraud, lying to auditors, and aiding Maxims failure to maintain accurate books and records. The jury found for Jasper on certain remaining claims, including proxy rule violations., Â U.S. District Judge James Ware will determine remedies and sanctions at a later date. The SECs complaint seeks, among other things, disgorgement and repayment of bonuses, monetary penalties, and a bar from serving as an officer or director of a public company., According to the SEC, evidence introduced at trial established that Maxim, with Jaspers knowledge, routinely granted stock options by using hindsight to identify dates with historically low stock prices. Jaspers staff then drafted false documents to make it appear that the options had been granted on the earlier date. This practice allowed Maxim to conceal hundreds of millions of dollars in expenses that it was required to report in its SEC filings. The evidence further showed that Jasper, with awareness of the backdating practices, repeatedly signed and certified Maxims false quarterly and annual reports provided to the investing public., The SEC previously settled its charges against Maxim and former CEO John Gifford, with Gifford (since deceased) paying over $800,000 in disgorgement, interest and penalties., For more information, see <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20381.htm>Litigation Release No. 20381</a> [http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20381.htm] (Dec. 4, 2007)., ]"

A jury returned a verdict against Offill on January 28, 2010, finding him guilty of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and nine counts of wire fraud.

The Commissions complaint alleges that, from July 2006 to April 2009, TierOne raised almost $9.5 million from approximately 200 investors nationwide using incomplete and misleading offering documents. Among other things, the Commission alleges that TierOnes offering documents before June 2008 failed to mention Weavers FINRA disciplinary history, and did not disclose over $685,000 of loans TierOne made to Weaver and Celmer over the preceding three years. The complaint further alleges that offering materials exaggerated the status of the companys agreements with customers and other third parties and the proprietary nature of TierOnes software., Without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, TierOne, Weaver and Celmer settled the Commissions charges by consenting to entry of a final judgment enjoining them from violating Sections 5(a) and (c) and 17(a)(2) and (a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933, and against engaging any unregistered persons to offer or sell TierOne securities.

Action No. 1:10-cv-00513-NAM-RFT (filed May 3, 2010)</h2>, <h2>SEC Halts Albany-Area Ponzi Scheme Preying on Senior Citizens</h2>]","[, The Securities and Exchange Commission charged Matthew J. Ryan, a Troy, N.Y.- based financial professional, with operating a Ponzi scheme through American Integrity Financial Co. The SEC obtained an emergency court order to freeze the assets of Ryan and the other defendant, Prime Rate and Return, LLC, which also does business as American Integrity., The SEC alleges that since at least 2002, Ryan and Prime Rate have used American Integrity, an entity that exists in name only, to raise more than $6.5 million from investors â many of them in their 60s and 70s â by promising them guaranteed fixed rates of return ranging from 3.85% to 9% annually. Ryan obtained these investments by fostering the false impression that American integrity is a legitimate, substantial financial services firm, with numerous employees and for which he was merely an employee, and by offering safe, even guaranteed, investments, including qualified individual retirement accounts (IRAs). To perpetrate this fraud, Ryan used devices such as a phony Manhattan address, and fictitious names and titles of purported American Integrity employees, and he misrepresented to investors that their investments were safe and insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) and that American Integrity was qualified to offer IRAs and other tax-deferred investments., According to the SECs complaint, filed yesterday in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York, American Integrity is a classic Ponzi scheme. American Integrity is not even an entity, let alone an operating financial company and investments in it are not in any way insured. It is merely the name on a bank account that Ryan opened and controls. Ryan simply took investors money and deposited the money into the bank account. When he needed money to pay investors the returns he had promised or principal amounts they sought to withdraw, Ryan simply withdrew funds from the same bank account. He also used the investor funds to pay real estate lenders on properties he and Prime Rate owned and to pay for his own personal expenses, including luxury cars. As of March 31, 2010, it appears that American Integrity owed investors at least $3.5 million, while it had less than $8500 in cash on hand., In addition to violations of the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, the complaint charges that the defendants violated Section 5 of the Securities Act by illegally conducting an unregistered offering of securities. Ryan, age 45, is a resident of Troy, New York. According to the SECs complaint, for most of the relevant period, Ryan was a registered representative of a registered broker-dealer and operated out of a branch office of the broker-dealer located in Troy. Ryan also sometimes operated under the name Matthew J. Ryan &amp; Associates. Ryan is the founder, owner and sole managing member of Prime Rate., The Honorable Norman A. Mordue, Chief Judge of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York granted the SECs request for a temporary restraining order and asset freeze against the defendants and for a temporary receiver over Prime Rate and other emergency relief including expedited discovery and an order prohibiting the destruction of documents. Judge Mordue appointed Paul A. Levine, Esq., of Lemery Greisler, LLC, as the temporary receiver and scheduled a preliminary injunction hearing for May 13, 2010., The Commission seeks an order preliminarily, and a final judgment permanently, restraining and enjoining the Defendants from violations of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; an order freezing the assets of the Defendants during the pendency of the litigation pending further order of the court, and a final judgment ordering the defendants to disgorge their ill-gotten gains and pay prejudgment interest and imposing civil penalties under Section 20(d) of the Securities Act and Section 21(d)(3) of the Exchange Act., <b>See Also:</b> <a href=/litigation/complaints/2010/comp21511.pdf title=>SEC Complaint</a> ]"

Avery (Avery) and Lee E. Marks (Marks), raised more than $3.2 million between September 2007 and February 2010 through the fraudulent unregistered offering of REINs, which were sold on the internet at www.ndafinancial.com (the Website). The Website and other offering materials provided to investors contained numerous material misrepresentations regarding, among other things, the safety of investor proceeds, the gross value of NDAs assets, and NDAs gross revenues. The offering attracted at least 72 investors from across the United States., In its Complaint, the Commission alleges that NDA, Avery, and Marks violated Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule10b-5 thereunder and seeks permanent injunctions from further violations of those provisions., The Commission also announced today that the Honorable Timothy C.

The SEC alleges that Veugeler, through his company Seven Palm, promised financing to both companies in exchange for nearly all their purportedly unrestricted shares. Veugeler, among other things, entered manipulative trades in both companies stock, allowing Seven Palm to sell its stock holdings in both companies at artificially inflated prices., The SECs complaint further alleges that Cardiovascular Sciences and Hooper, Cardiovascular Sciencess president and CEO, disseminated false and misleading press releases and other correspondence to investors between October 2007 and February 2008. The complaint also alleges that Veugeler reviewed and discussed with Hooper a number of the false press releases and directed him to work with a third-party stock promoter to issue the press releases to the public., According to the SECs complaint, Veugeler engaged in manipulative practices aimed at misleading the market to increase and maintain artificially high prices so Veugeler could resell Seven Palms Cardiovascular and Emergent holdings for substantial gains., The SECs complaint further alleges that Veugeler devised a Cardiovascular promotional campaign to facilitate Seven Palms liquidation of its Cardiovascular shares and that many of the Defendants public misrepresentations and omissions concerned Seven Palm providing funding to Cardiovascular. The complaint alleges that public statements regarding Seven Palm providing funding to Cardiovascular were misleading because at the time they were made, Seven Palm had not provided any funding to Cardiovascular., As alleged in the SECs complaint, the defendants violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The Court stayed the effect of its orders to allow Graf and Pust an opportunity to comply with the Courts prior orders. The period for Graf to comply expired and he has been taken into custody. Pust has until May 10, 2010 to comply., The Courts orders to incarcerate Graf and Pust stem from subpoena enforcement actions that the SEC filed in federal court on March 1, 2010 against Graf and Pust alleging that they failed to comply with the SECs subpoenas. The SEC alleged that it issued subpoenas to Graf and Pust requiring them to provide testimony and documents related to a non-public investigation that the SEC was conducting into a possible fraudulent investment scheme. The SEC alleged that the possible scheme is the subject of an SEC Formal Order Directing Private Investigation entitled In the Matter of Rosand Enterprises, Inc. The Formal Order authorized SEC staff to investigate, among other things, whether anyone violated the federal securities laws in connection with the offer and sale of securities by Rosand. The SECs subpoena enforcement actions alleged that Rosand raised millions of dollars from investors for the stated purpose of constructing or rehabbing homes and then selling them for a profit. The SEC further alleged that it was informed that Graf served as the accountant for Rosand which paid at least $28,500 to Graf and that Pust raised investor funds for Rosand which paid at least $214,000 to Pust., The SEC alleged that Graf and Pust refused to provide testimony and documents or otherwise respond to the SECs subpoenas. On March 12th and March 15th, the Court ordered Graf and Pust, respectively, to comply with the SECs subpoenas by a certain date.

(Spongetech), affiliated company RM Enterprises International, Inc. (RM), Chief Executive Officer Michael Metter (Metter), Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Accounting Officer and Secretary Steven Moskowitz (Moskowitz), Jack Halperin (Halperin) and Joel Pensley (Pensley), two of Spongetechs former attorneys, and George Speranza (Speranza), a stock promoter, for their roles in a massive pump and dump scheme., The Commissions complaint alleges that:, Beginning as early as April 2007, and continuing to the present, Metter, Moskowitz, and Spongetech engaged in a scheme to increase demand illegally for, and profit from, the unregistered sale of publicly-traded stock in Spongetech, a company that sells soap-filled sponges. Metter, Moskowitz, and Spongetech accomplished this by, among other things, pumping up demand for Spongetech stock through false public statements about non-existent Spongetech customers, bogus sales orders, and phony revenue. They also repeatedly and fraudulently understated the number of Spongetechs outstanding shares in press releases and public filings. The purpose of flooding the market with false public information was to fraudulently inflate the price for Spongetech shares so Metter, Moskowitz, and Spongetech could then dump the shares by illegally selling them to the public through affiliated entities in unregistered transactions., Metter, Moskowitz, and Spongetech illegally distributed approximately 2.5 billion Spongetech shares in unregistered transactions through RM Enterprises and other affiliates, which acted as conduits for Metter, Moskowitz, and Spongetech to distribute restricted shares in unregistered transactions to the public. Metter, Moskowitz, Spongetech, and RM Enterprises used false and baseless attorney opinion letters rendered by Pensley and by Halperin to distribute shares of Spongetech to the public. Pensley and Halperin made false or misleading statements in their attorney opinion letters to Spongetechs transfer agents who then improperly removed the restrictive legends from Spongetech shares. Metter, Moskowitz, and Spongetech also used false and misleading attorney opinion letters, forged in Pensleys name and in the name of a fictitious lawyer, David Bomart, which Moskowitz transmitted and caused to be transmitted to Spongetechs transfer agents., Speranza participated in the fraud by, among other things, creating internet websites and virtual office space for the fictitious customers with which Spongetech claimed to be doing millions of dollars of business so that actual or prospective shareholders would believe the customers were legitimate. Metter, Moskowitz, and Spongetech also spent portions of their illicit profits to advertise with professional sports teams and events to support their claims that Spongetech was prosperous, such as highly visible sponsorship deals with professional teams in Major League Baseball, the National Football League, the National Basketball Association, the National Hockey League, and the United States Tennis Association., The Commission seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions against Spongetech enjoining it from violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-13, 15d-1, 15d-11, and 15d-13; and RM Enterprises enjoining it from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5., The Commission also seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions against Metter and Moskowitz enjoining them from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, 13b2-2 (Moskowitz only), and 15d-14, and Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, from aiding and abetting Spongetechs violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 15(d) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-13, 15d-1, 15d-11, and 15d-13; enjoining Speranza from violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5; and enjoining Pensley and Halperin from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5., The Commission further seeks civil penalties, disgorgement with prejudgment interest of all ill-gotten gains, and accountings from all defendants; asset freezes against Spongetech, RM Enterprises, Metter and Moskowitz; conduct-based bars against Halperin and Pensley; officer and director bars against Metter and Moskowitz; penny stock bars against Metter, Moskowitz, Speranza, Pensley and Halperin; as well as forfeiture proceedings against Metter and Moskowitz pursuant to Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002., Today, the United States Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York announced that it had arrested Metter and Moskowitz for conspiracy to commit securities fraud and obstruction of justice.

DiBella., The federal district court in New Haven, Conn., ordered the disbursement of the SEC Fair Fund, which was established after DiBella paid court-ordered disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and penalties assessed in an SEC enforcement action. On May 18, 2007, following a seven-day trial, a jury returned a verdict finding DiBella liable for aiding and abetting violations of various securities laws., In its 2004 complaint, the SEC alleged that DiBella and his consulting company, North Cove, participated in a fraudulent scheme with the former Treasurer of the State of Connecticut, Paul Silvester, concerning Silvesters investment of $75 million on behalf of the Connecticut Retirement and Trust Funds with investment advisor, Thayer Capital Partners. Although neither Mr. DiBella nor North Cove had any role in the investment of the funds with Thayer, and performed no meaningful work related to the investment, Silvester nevertheless requested that Thayer pay DiBella fees based upon a percentage of the total investment with Thayer.

Rex Andersen of Draper, Utah, a certified public accountant. The final judgment against Andersen, entered on May 4, 2010, is in connection with an enforcement action filed by the Commission in 2005 concerning a penny stock manipulation and accounting fraud. The final judgment permanently enjoins Andersen from violating the antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil money penalty totaling $126,219.04., The civil injunctive action was filed on April 25, 2005, against Andersen, Exotics.com, Inc., a Nevada corporation based in Vancouver, British Columbia, and 11 additional principal defendants and one relief defendant. The Commissions complaint alleged that, between at least 1999 and 2002, Exotics.com (formerly a corporate shell known as Hardrock Mines, Inc.) was the subject of a stock manipulation and accounting fraud. According to the complaint, Andersen performed audits of the 1999 and 2000 year-end financial statements of Hardrock Mines, Inc., but he lacked independence during the audits because he himself had prepared most of the clients books and records and its financial statements. The Commissions complaint further alleged that Andersen created the clients books and records in reliance on documents that he knew, or was reckless in not knowing, were fraudulent, and thereby caused the financial statements to depart from generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The complaint also alleged that Andersens firm thereafter issued audit reports falsely representing that the audits had been conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, and that the financial statements were presented in conformity with GAAP. The fraudulent audit reports provided by Andersen were incorporated in various public filings with the Commission made by Hardrock Mines and Exotics.com., The final judgment against Andersen permanently enjoins him from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Rule 2-02 of Regulation S-X.

Keating falsely promised investors exorbitant returns ranging from four to twelve times their investment. The complaint alleges that Keating agreed to use investor funds to purchase investment contracts involving scrap metal extracted from properties in Texas. Instead, he used the money to fund the purchase of a Texas paper mill by another Keating-affiliated company. Unbeknownst to the investors, Keating also allegedly committed the investors funds to pay a third-party debt on the same paper mill., The complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Utah, further alleges that Keating misrepresented that he personally invested millions of dollars in Paseo. Keating also allegedly gave investors the false impression that Torrey Pines, a registered broker-dealer, was involved in the Paseo offering when, in fact, it was not. The complaint further alleges that until at least November 2008, Keating continued to deceive investors with false assurances that they would receive a return on their Paseo investments., Keating agreed to settle this matter without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. Keating consented to a permanent injunction from further violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Furst (Furst), former senior investment banker at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., Inc. (Merrill Lynch) in charge of the Enron Corp. banking relationship., On March 17, 2003, the Commission charged Furst and three other former executives of Merrill Lynch with aiding and abetting Enron Corp.âs earnings manipulation. That action remains stayed against two of Furstâs co-defendants. On January 6, 2010, the Commission announced that it settled all of its charges against Furstâs other co-defendant, Daniel H. Bayly, former global head of investment banking at Merrill Lynch. On March 17, 2003, the Commission also sued and simultaneously settled all of its Enron aiding-and-abetting charges against Merrill Lynch, which was enjoined from violating the federal securities laws and paid $80 million in financial sanctions for distribution to injured investors through the Commissionâs Enron Fair Fund., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissionâs complaint, Furst has now been permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions, as well as from aiding and abetting violations of the periodic reporting, books-and-records, and internal controls provisions; barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years; and ordered to pay $300,001 in disgorgement and civil money penalties for deposit into the Commissionâs Enron Fair Fund., As alleged in the Commissionâs complaint, Furst substantially assisted Enron in two sham transactions during late 1999. The first transaction was an asset-parking arrangement, whereby on December 29, 1999, Enron entered into a sham âsaleâ of its interest in certain Nigerian barges so as to fraudulently record over $12 million in income. The âsaleâ was a sham since the risk and rewards of ownership in the barges never passed to Merrill Lynch because Enronâs then Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Fastow, guaranteed Merrill Lynch that it would not lose money and that it would be taken out of the deal within six months. The complaint alleged that Furst was aware of the nature of the barge transaction and was responsible internally at Merrill Lynch to have the transaction completed. Furst also helped enable this sham âsaleâ of Enronâs interest in the Nigerian barges so as to maintain favorable relations with Enron., In the second transaction, also closed on December 29, 1999, Enron agreed to pay Merrill Lynch a $17 million fee to enter into a virtually offsetting energy trade. The complaint alleged that Furst knew, among other things, that the transaction was essentially risk free to Merrill Lynch and had the purpose and effect of inflating Enronâs reported income by approximately $50 million in 1999, and that such earnings were necessary for Enron to meet earnings and award bonuses to senior management. Furst also knew that Enron was contemplating unwinding the energy trade transaction after obtaining its earnings benefit. After the transaction was completed and Enron reported its inflated earnings, Enron and Merrill Lynch unwound the transaction on June 30, 2000, and Enron received $8.5 million, half of its original fee. By participating in the barge and energy trade transactions â which resulted in Enronâs recognition of over $60 million in income for the fourth quarter of 1999 â Furst aided and abetted Enronâs violations of the federal securities laws., For more information, see <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18038.htm>Litigation Release No. 18038</a> (March 17, 2003)., ]"

McCall was charged in a previously-filed action with securities fraud in connection with a financial reporting fraud at McKesson HBOC, Inc. (now, McKesson Corporation), a Fortune 100 company headquartered in San Francisco, California. McCall consented to the entry of judgment without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions complaint except as to jurisdiction., The complaint, filed June 4, 2003, alleged that McCall, together with other senior executives, participated in a long-running fraudulent scheme to inflate the revenue and net income of HBO &amp; Company (HBOC), an Atlanta, Georgia-based vendor of health care technology that merged with McKesson in 1999. McCall, the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of HBOC and then Chairman of McKesson HBOC, personally took part in negotiating at least two contracts with side letter agreements containing cancellation contingencies, one of which was also backdated. As a result of the scheme, according to the complaint, the companies were able to recognize revenue in earlier reporting periods. These practices failed to comply with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles., The complaint alleged that the fraud allowed HBOC and McKesson HBOC to report falsely in press releases and in periodic reports HBOC filed with the Commission that the companies were having an unbroken run of financial success and had continually exceeded analysts expectations. However, when McKesson HBOC announced in April 1999 that the company was conducting an internal investigation into financial reporting irregularities, its shares tumbled from approximately $65 to $34, a drop that slashed its market value by more than $9 billion., The final judgment against McCall permanently enjoins him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b), 13(b)(5) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder.

Olson, and A&amp;O Investments, LLC</i>, Case No. 1:10-cv-01143 (N.D. Ohio, filed May 20, 2010)</h2>]","[, The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that it filed a civil injunctive action against Edward A. Allen and David L. Olson, residents of Lakeland, Florida, and their company A&amp;O Investments, LLC, accusing them of conducting a fraudulent, unregistered offer and sale of approximately $14.8 million in securities.Â , The SECâs complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, alleges that from approximately September 2005 through December 2008, Allen and Olson raised approximately $14.8 million from at least 100 investors through the offer and sale of promissory notes issued by A&amp;O. The complaint alleges that both Allen and Olson recruited promissory note investors from customers of Georgia-based registered broker-dealer World Group Securities, Inc. (WGS), for which Allen and Olson were registered representatives, and through mass mailings and word-of-mouth after Allen and Olson left WGS. The complaint alleges that Allen and Olson told investors that they would use the investorsâ money to purchase, rehabilitate, and sell real estate. The complaint further alleges that Allen and Olson promised to pay investors annual returns of 20%, represented that the returns were generated from the sale of its real estate properties, and told investors that they were doing well in the real estate market and were making money. According to the complaint, the majority of the promissory notes purportedly were secured by property owned by A&amp;O. The complaint alleges that Allen and Olsonâs representations about their use of offering proceeds, the collateral securing the investments, and the success of the investments were all false. According to the complaint, in reality Allen and Olson operated a Ponzi scheme by using approximately $4.4 million of investorsâ funds to pay âinterestâ and, in some cases, principal to previous investors and spent only $5.1 million of the $14.8 million raised to purchase and rehabilitate real estate. The complaint further alleges that Allen and Olson used $2.2 million to pay personal expenses for themselves and their family members. According to the complaint, Allen and Olson also misrepresented and omitted to state material facts regarding the collateral securing the notes, in that as much as approximately $5.5 million worth of A&amp;O promissory notes purportedly were secured by the same piece of property in Lakeland, Florida. This propertyâs value was grossly inadequate to secure the notes., The complaint alleges that as a result of their misconduct, Allen, Olson, and A&amp;O violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The Commission is seeking permanent injunctions and disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, including prejudgment interest, from Allen, Olson, and A&amp;O and civil penalties from Allen and Olson., <b>See Also:</b> <a href=/litigation/complaints/2010/comp21529.pdf title=>SEC Complaint</a> ]"

U.S. v. Brian Hollnagel and Brian Olds, Criminal Action No. 1:10-cr-0195 (N.D. Ill.) (St. Eve., J.). In particular, this indictment includes a count of wire fraud (18 USC 1343) against Hollnagel in connection with his scheme to pay bribes to Brian Olds, an officer at a public company, AAR Corp. These bribes were paid in exchange for Olds using his position at AAR to ensure that AAR purchased from, or sold aircraft to, BCI at prices favorable to BCI., In addition, in October 2009, the Commission filed a Motion for Sanctions against the Defendants and their attorneys, Rothgerber Johnson &amp; Lyons, for alleged improper destruction of evidence. The Court subsequently found, in an order on April 7, 2010, that âRothgerber, Johnson &amp; Lyons had acted improperly in destroying emails.â However, the Court declined to assess specific sanctions until the Commission later reports on the full extent of prejudice it has suffered from this improper destruction of evidence., Previously, on August 13, 2007, the Commission filed a civil injunctive complaint alleging that Defendants Hollnagel and BCI, from approximately 1998 through 2007, raised at least $82 million from approximately 120 investors as part of a fraudulent scheme in which the Defendants commingled investor funds, used investor funds to pay other investors, and failed to use investor funds as represented.

The judgment ordered the defendants to disgorge their ill-gotten gains and prejudgment interest, and ordered each to pay a third tier civil penalty., In imposing the judgment, Judge Jed S. Rakoff found that Justman, Gold, and Reilly had engaged in an elaborate fraudulent scheme over the course of six months that manipulated a publicly traded stock, resulting in the eventual collapse of the stock price, and which which resulted in hundreds of thousand dollars of ill-gotten gains for the individual defendants [and] risked and, in fact, caused substantial losses to others., The Commissions complaint alleged that Justman, Gold, and Reilly made material misrepresentations concerning Forest Resources Management Corp. to Forests transfer agent in order to obtain millions of restricted shares without the required restricted legend. Justman, Gold, Reilly, and their nominees then sold these unlegended shares on the open market, falsely holding them out to the investing public as free-trading shares, when in fact they were restricted stock. In addition, Forest, Justman, Gold, and Reilly made materially false statements and failed to disclose material facts to investors. Justman, Gold, and Reilly previously consented to the entry of judgments, according to which the Commissions allegations were neither admitted nor denied, and which enjoined each of them from future violations of the federal securities laws.

Gagnon (Gagnon) for promoting and operating a series of fraudulent, unregistered securities offerings through his website, www.mazu.com. In its complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, the SEC alleges that from January 2006 through approximately August 2007, Gagnon helped orchestrate a massive Ponzi scheme conducted by Gregory N. McKnight (McKnight) and his company, Legisi Holdings, LLC (Legisi), which raised a total of approximately $72.6 million from over 3,000 investors by promising returns of upwards of 15% a month. The complaint also alleges that Gagnon promoted Legisi but in doing so misled investors by claiming, among other things, that he had thoroughly researched McKnight and Legisi and had determined Legisi to be a legitimate and safe investment. The complaint alleges that Gagnon had no basis for the claims he made about McKnight and Legisi. Gagnon also failed to disclose to investors that he was to receive 50% of Legisis purported profits under his agreement with McKnight. According to the complaint, Gagnon received a net of approximately $3.8 million in Legisi investor funds from McKnight for his participation in the scheme., The SECs complaint further alleges that beginning in August 2007, Gagnon fraudulently offered and sold securities representing interests in a new company that purportedly was to develop resort properties. The complaint alleges that Gagnon, among other things, falsely claimed that the investment was risk-free and SEC compliant, and guaranteed a 200% return in 14 months. In reality, however, Gagnon sent the money to a twice-convicted felon, did not register the investment with the SEC, and knew such an outlandish return was impossible. Gagnon took in at least $361,865 from 21 investors. The SECs complaint alleges that in April 2009, Gagnon began promoting a fraudulent offering of interests in a purported Forex trading venture. Gagnon guaranteed that the venture would generate returns of 2% a month or 30% a year for his investors. Gagnons claims were false, and Gagnon had no basis for making the claims. Finally, the complaint alleges that from October 2009 to November 2009, Gagnon offered another purported Forex trading venture in which he claimed to have a trader in Europe who would trade foreign currencies for investors in exchange for 40% of any profits he generated. Gagnon removed this offer from his website in November 2009 when he received notice that the SEC had subpoenaed his bank records., The SECs complaint charges Gagnon with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), 17(a) and 17(b) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 15(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. In addition to the emergency relief already obtained, the complaint seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions, disgorgement, and civil penalties from Gagnon., The Honorable George Caram Steeh of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan issued an Order freezing all of Gagnons assets and scheduling an evidentiary hearing for June 23, 2010, on the Commissions motion for a preliminary injunction., <b>See Also:</b> <a href=/litigation/complaints/2010/comp21532.pdf title=>SEC Complaint</a> ]"

Some hedge funds alerted the SEC, which immediately worked with the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to investigate. The FBI set up an undercover operation and made several contacts with Sebbag who offered to sell the information, in one instance for $15,000 and in another for half the expected trading profits., In early May, Hoxie obtained confidential information concerning Disneys quarterly earnings and provided it to Sebbag, who in turn sold it to an FBI agent posing as an investment manager., According to the SECs complaint, Hoxie had regular access to confidential information concerning Disneys financial performance and operating plans. Hoxie and Sebbag orchestrated a scheme to sell information to hedge funds to be used for purposes of insider trading., The SEC also alleges that Sebbag told FBI agents posing as investment managers that he wanted to establish a business relationship to share confidential information on a regular basis, and wanted to be compensated. Sebbag also expressed his understanding of the risks involved and his desire to avoid being caught. Among excerpts of Sebbags e-mails to undercover agents (<i>includes original spelling and punctuation</i>):, First of all, i am not a fed, I have no way to prove it at this point but i am not asking you to disclose your identity not i will disclose mine. It is up to you to determine if this is worth the risk as i did. I work for Disney, that is all i can tell you., I can deliver 3 to 4 days before release. I will email you the report as soon as i have it and you will wire transfer the money to my account after you get ahold of it. I am asking you to make me an offer based on the capital gains from the trade and the risk i am taking delivering this information to you? Also, i am looking to build a strong business relationship with you for future quarters and information., I dont think we will get caught if we stay discret and careful. You can count on my discretion as i am counting on yoursâ¦, â¦ $15k sounds great and $30k even better as i hope you will make a killing from Q2 earnings. I promise i will keep you informed of any unanticipated event, i keep my ears wide open here., The SECs complaint further alleges that two days before Disneys earnings announcement, Sebbag e-mailed the undercover agents a 107-page confidential document that contained a series of talking points for Disney executives during an upcoming quarterly earnings conference call. It contained very detailed information about the quarterly performance and future prospects of Disneys various business segments. The SEC also alleges that Hoxie learned that Disneys Earnings Per Share (EPS) for the quarter and provided that information to Sebbag, who in turn provided it to an undercover agent approximately two hours before its public release., According to the SECs complaint, Sebbag made arrangements to meet the undercover agents in person so he could collect his payment. At a May 14 meeting in New York, Sebbag told the agents he wanted to make a lot of money through the arrangement and asked for their advice on how to open up an off-shore account to deposit his proceeds from the scheme, stating that he didnt want to go to jail. Sebbag left the meeting with an envelope containing $15,000 in cash, and he subsequently made arrangements to meet with them again in California to continue building the illicit relationship. The FBI arrested Sebbag and Hoxie on May 26, 2010., By offering to sell and selling material non-public information to be used for the purposes of insider trading, Sebbag and Hoxie engaged in acts or practices that constitute violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws. The SECs complaint seeks an order providing for permanent injunctive relief against Sebbag and Hoxie pursuant to Section 21(d)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, permanently enjoining each defendant from violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder., The Commission thanks the FBI and the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York for their assistance in this matter., ]"

(May 26, 2010)</h2>, <h2>SEC CHARGES MONEY MANAGER AND TWO ASSOCIATES IN NEW YORK CITY-BASED AFFINITY FRAUD</h2>]","[, On May 26, 2010, the Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a purported money manager, his New York City-based investment company, and two of his associates with conducting an affinity fraud and Ponzi scheme that specifically targeted investors living in the Caribbean and African-American communities of Brooklyn., The SEC alleges that Gedrey Thompson, through his firm GTF Enterprises Inc., convinced investors to entrust him with money that he claimed to trade on their behalf. Thompson assured investors that the investments were risk-free and employed stop-loss trading techniques, and he guaranteed quarterly returns ranging from 4 to 20 percent., However, Thompson allegedly invested only a fraction of investor funds and sustained thousands of dollars in trading losses from those investments. He sent investors fake quarterly account statements that hid those losses and instead showed lofty returns. Thompson also made Ponzi-like payments to earlier investors, and he stole thousands of dollars in investor funds to pay for exotic trips and other personal expenses. GTFs account manager Dean Lewis and assistant treasurer Sezzie Goodluck also are charged in the fraud that caused many investors in GTF to lose their life savings., According to the SECs complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Thompson with assistance from Lewis and Goodluck raised a total of more than $800,000 from at least 20 investors from at least 2004 to 2009. Thompson primarily sought investors who were likewise from the Caribbean and now living in the New York area, convincing them to entrust him with their money that he claimed to trade on their behalf in options, futures, commodities, or other securities., The SEC alleges that Thompson and Lewis made a number of false or misleading representations to con investors. For example, they claimed that GTF practiced sound and careful investing and assumed all trading risk. They also falsely represented that key GTF personnel had extensive experience with Wall Streets top financial firms. Thompson himself boasted false trading qualifications and misstated GTFs success as an investment company., According to the SECs complaint, Lewis solicited and obtained approximately $170,000 in investments from at least five investors and obtained $29,000 in commissions from the fraud. Goodluck, a J.P. Morgan Chase Bank employee in Brooklyn at the time, recruited at least two Chase customers to invest in GTF without disclosing those outside activities to Chase. Goodluck personally obtained approximately $78,000 of the investors funds from GTFs Chase account and provided Thompson with cash from the same account to pay some of his personal expenses, including exotic trips for him and his girlfriend, private school tuition for his son, and meals at restaurants. By 2009, Thompson had dissipated all of the funds that investors had invested in GTF., The SEC charged Thompson and GTF with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; GTF with violating Section 7(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (Company Act); Thompson with violating Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers Act) and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder; Lewis with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; Lewis and Goodluck with violating Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder; and Goodluck with aiding and abetting violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The Commission seeks to enjoin each defendant from future violations of these provisions along with monetary relief and certain other sanctions., ]"

Conrad, United States District Judge for the Western District of Virginia, entered a final judgment against John M. Donnelly (Donnelly) and three entities that he controlled, Tower Analysis, Inc., Nasco Tang Corp., and Nadia Capital Corp. The final judgment permanently enjoins Donnelly and the other defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and orders them, along with two entity relief defendants controlled by Donnelly, to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest totaling $3,929,003., The Commissions civil injunctive action was filed on March 11, 2009, against Donnelly and the three defendant entities that he controlled, as well as three relief defendants, Blue Logic Operating Partners LP, Nadia Capital Operating Partners LP, and Deborah Donnelly. In its amended complaint, the Commission alleges that from at least 1998, Donnelly fraudulently raised at least $11 million from as many as thirty-one investors through the sale of securities in the form of limited partnership interests in three investment funds. The Commission further alleged that Donnelly orchestrated the scheme through three entities, Tower Analysis Inc., Nasco Tang Corp., and Nadia Capital Corp. Donnelly told investors that he would pool their funds to invest in, among other things, stock and bond index derivatives. However, Donnelly engaged in almost no securities trading. The Commission further alleged that Donnelly instead used investor funds to repay other investors, and paid himself approximately $1 million in salary and fees during the last three years of the scheme. The Commission alleges that the relief defendants received funds that were derived from profits obtained by Donnelly as a result of his fraudulent conduct., Donnelly and the three entity defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint. The final judgment permanently enjoins them from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, which are general anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws. The final judgment also orders them, along with relief defendants Blue Logic Operating Partners LP and Nadia Capital Operating Partners LP, to disgorge $3,838,790 together with prejudgment interest of $90,213, with payment of that amount to be deemed satisfied by an order of restitution that was entered in the parallel criminal case against John Donnelly. In the criminal case, Donnelly pled guilty to charges of wire fraud, securities fraud, fraud in connection with futures contracts, and impeding administration of internal revenue laws, and was sentenced to ninety months in prison and ordered to pay restitution of $5.435 million. <i>U.S. v.

The judgment, to which Ms. Donnelly consented, orders her to relinquish her interest in certain assets and to pay a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the Donnellys home towards the restitution order in the criminal case. In addition, the Court approved the Commissions motion to amend the complaint to add Samuel P. Fleming and Fleming-AOD, Inc. as relief defendants. Fleming and Fleming-AOD consented to the entry of a final judgment ordering them to pay jointly and severally disgorgement of $613,617, plus prejudgment interest of $65,717.89. The Commissions amended complaint does not allege that the relief defendants committed violations of the federal securities laws. All of the funds collected pursuant to these settlements will be distributed to harmed investors through the restitution fund established in the parallel criminal case., The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the United States Attorneys Office for the Western District of Virginia, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Department of Justice Tax Division, and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission., ]"

The Commission alleges that the defendants sold stock in unregistered offerings and that their subsequent manipulation led to artificially high prices and volume, which allowed the defendants and others to sell their holdings for substantial gains. The complaint also alleges that Williams acted as an unregistered broker-dealer when he solicited purchases of stock and traded on behalf of investors who bought stock from him., The Commissions complaint alleges that Williams, using five entities that he controlled, and Lopez, using the entity Da Big Kahuna, LLC, engaged in a number of manipulative practices, including:, engaging in bid support by placing orders for shares at prices below the inside (highest) bid to absorb sell orders and create an artificial floor for the stocks;, trading in multiple accounts through multiple brokers to give the false impression that there was greater demand for the stocks than truly existed;, coordinating trading among a group of individuals for the purpose of maintaining stock prices; and, obtaining securities in unlawful, unregistered offerings and then selling the securities to investors and into the markets in similarly unregistered and unlawful transactions., The Commission seeks injunctions, penny stock bars, disgorgement, and penalties from the defendants, in addition to an officer and director bar against Williams because he served as an officer of several of the microcap issuers., As a result of their conduct, Williams and Lopez, in a separate criminal matter, were indicted on one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and seven counts of securities fraud in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas., The Commissions investigation is ongoing.

Samberg, its Chairman and CEO, in connection with insider trading in Microsoft Corp. securities in 2001., The Commissions complaint, filed in the United States District Court in Connecticut, alleges that on Friday, April 6, 2001, amidst rumors that Microsoft would miss its earnings estimates for the quarter that had ended on March 31, Samberg emailed David Zilkha, seeking information about whether Microsoft would meet its earnings estimates. At the time, Zilkha was a Microsoft employee who had accepted an offer of employment from Pequot. That weekend, Zilkha contacted colleagues at Microsoft and learned that Microsoft would meet or beat its estimates. The Commissions complaint further alleged that based on this inside information, Zilkha then conveyed to Samberg his understanding that Microsoft would meet or beat its earnings estimates. Samberg thereafter purchased Microsoft options on behalf of funds managed by Pequot. In addition, at Sambergs recommendation, a friend of Sambergs purchased Microsoft stock. On April 19, 2001, after the market had closed, Microsoft announced its earnings for the quarter. Consistent with the information Zilkha had conveyed to Samberg, Microsoft beat its earnings estimates. As a result of the illegal trading, the Pequot funds had gains of $14,769,960 and Sambergs friend had gains of $372,060., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Pequot and Samberg have consented to the entry of a final judgment enjoining them from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The judgment also orders them to disgorge, on a joint and several basis, ill-gotten gains of $15,242,020 (plus prejudgment interest of $2,696,448) and to pay a civil penalty of $5 million each.

Kenneth Ira Starr, Starr Investment Advisors, LLC, and Starr &amp; Company, LLC</i>, Civil Action No. 10 Civ. 4270 (SDNY)(SHS)</h2>]","[, On May 27, 2010, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed an emergency civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York charging an investment adviser, his investment advisory firm, and his business management firm with securities fraud. The Commission alleged that Kenneth Ira Starr, Starr Investment Advisors, LLC (SIA), and Starr &amp; Company, LLC (Starrco) violated the securities laws by, among other things, misappropriating client money., According to the Commissions Complaint, Starr and SIA â an entity that Starr controls â provide investment advisory services to more than thirty high net-worth clients. In addition, Starr and Starrco â another entity that Starr also controls â provide advisory, accounting, tax preparation, business management, bill-paying, and concierge services to a larger but overlapping group of approximately 175 clients. Defendants have power of attorney or signatory authority over many bank and investment accounts belonging to their clients. The Commissions complaint charges that Defendants have abused the signatory power that they hold over their clients bank and investment accounts by misappropriating client funds for their own purposes, including the purchase of a luxury $7.6 million Manhattan apartment for Starr., Specifically, the Commissions complaint alleges that between April 13 and April 16, 2010, Defendants transferred $7 million from the accounts of three SIA and Starrco clients. The transfers from the accounts of the three SIA and Starrco clients were not authorized. These funds were ultimately used on April 16, 2010, to purchase an apartment in which Starr and Passage reside., The Commissions complaint alleges additional instances, beyond those in April 2010, of where Defendants misappropriated client funds. Starting in August 2009, Defendants transferred approximately $1.7 million from the personal account of an investor and from the account of a charity run by that investor. These were all unauthorized transfers. In April 2010, Defendants attempted to transfer an additional $750,000 from one of that investors accounts but the bank notified the investor, who halted the transfer. When that investor confronted Defendants over these transactions, Defendants paid the investor back with money that again appears to have come from the bank account of another unrelated party., According to the Commissions complaint, the Defendants ability to misappropriate client funds was enhanced by SIAs failure to comply with custodial rules. Indeed, SIA failed to engage an independent public accountant for the years 2006-2009 to perform a surprise examination of its advisory clients assets over which Defendants had custody. Moreover, certain assets of SIA clients were held in a physical form in a safe in Starrcos offices despite the fact that none of Defendants are qualified custodians., The SECs complaint charges each of the defendants with violations of Section 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers Act). The Complaint charges SIA with violation of Section 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-2(a)(1) thereunder. The Commission also named Starrs wife, Diane Passage, and Colcave, LLC, an entity that Starr used to buy the apartment, as relief defendants. The Commissions complaint seeks emergency relief including temporary restraining orders and preliminary injunctions, and an order: (i) imposing asset freezes against the Defendants and the Relief Defendants; (ii) appointing a Receiver over SIA, Starrco, and Colcave; (iii) allowing expedited discovery against Defendants and the Relief Defendants and preventing the destruction of Defendants and Relief Defendants documents; (iv) requiring that Defendants and Relief Defendants provide verified accountings; (v) repatriating funds transferred by Defendants and Relief Defendants to foreign accounts and the freezing of such funds; (vi) imposing a constructive trust over the apartment purchased by Colcave in which Starr and Passage reside; and (vii) enjoining the Defendants and Relief Defendants and any third party from filing bankruptcy on behalf of the Defendants and Relief Defendants without leave of the Court and notice to the Commission. The Commission seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest on a joint and several basis and civil monetary penalties against all of the Defendants. The Commission also seeks an order requiring that Relief Defendants disgorge all assets of Defendants clients that improperly were transferred to them, together with prejudgment interest, including, but not limited to, the apartment purchased by Colcave in which Starr and Passage reside., The case has been assigned to the Honorable Sidney H. Stein of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Upon the Commissions application, Judge Stein granted all the relief sought by the Commission except for the immediate appointment of a receiver. Judge Stein ordered a hearing to be held on June 1, 2010 to consider the appointment of a monitor. He further ordered that a hearing be held on June 10, 2010 to consider the Commissions request for a preliminary injunction and the appointment of a receiver., ]"

The Final Judgment enjoined Bonica from direct and indirect violations of the federal securities laws and ordered him to pay a total of $209,537.60 in disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, interest and penalties., The Commissions complaint alleged, among other things, that Bonica participated in a fraudulent stock option backdating scheme; that Bonicas fraudulent conduct caused Monsters periodic filings and proxy statements to falsely portray Monsters options as having been granted at exercise prices equal to the fair market value of Monsters common stock on the date of the grant, when, in fact, Monster was granting in-the-money options; and that Bonica understood the accounting consequences of granting in-the-money options but did nothing to ensure that Monster properly accounted for these options in its financial statements. The complaint alleged that Bonicas conduct caused Monster to file materially false and misleading public reports that contained financial statements that materially understated Monsters compensation expenses and materially overstated its quarterly and annual net income. On December 13, 2006, Monster restated its historical financial results for 1997-2005 in a cumulative pre-tax amount of approximately $339.5 million to record additional non-cash charges for option related compensation.

Diebold is an Ohio corporation that manufactures and sells automated teller machines, bank security systems, and electronic voting machines. The companys stock is registered with the Commission and listed on the New York Stock Exchange., The Commission alleges that Diebold, Geswein, Krakora, and Miller engaged in fraudulent accounting practices to inflate the companys earnings to meet forecasts.

In addition, the Commission charged Geswein and Krakora with violating Exchange Act Rules 13a-14 and 13b2-2 and Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Commission seeks against these defendants permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil monetary penalties, and, with respect to Geswein and Krakora, officer-and-director bars and reimbursement of bonuses and other compensation., In addition, the Commission filed an action against Walden ODell, the former Chief Executive Officer of Diebold, seeking reimbursement for bonuses and other incentive-based and equity-based compensation pursuant Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

Perez falsely told investors that their investments were collateralized by diamonds, and even led some investors to believe they were beneficiaries on his life insurance policy without disclosing that the policy had lapsed., Rather than financing his jewelry businesses, the SEC alleges that Perez misused new investor funds to pay prior investors, and he stole at least $6 million for lavish personal spending on limousines, extravagant dinners, bodyguards, and political contributions that helped bolster his image in the local community., According to the SECs complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, Perez began his scheme in 2006 when he began raising money from investors, many of them Hispanic, under the guise of investments in his purported jewelry businesses. Perez was the president and sole owner of Lucky Star Diamonds Inc. and Luis Felipe Jewelry Design Corp., neither of which ever had any employees. Both companies have now ceased operations., The SEC alleges that Perez boasted a successful track record of providing risk-free investments in order to befriend new investors through word-of-mouth from previous investors. Among the misrepresentations made by Perez when convincing investors to loan him money:, Perez told investors their money was also being used to finance pawn shops in New York from which he earned 5 to 10 percent returns per month that could be passed on to his investors. Contrary to his representations, Perez had no dealings with pawn shops and never provided financing to them., Perez told some investors that diamonds from the pawn shops had specifically been set aside for them as collateral securing their investments. In some instances, Perez placed them in a bank safety deposit box to which he and the investor had access. However, unbeknownst to investors, the diamonds were fake., Perez assured some investors that he added them as beneficiaries on his life insurance policy. However, what investors didnt know is that he defaulted on his policy premiums and as a result the policy had lapsed., The SEC alleges that Perez misused more than $6 million of investor money to fund his extravagant lifestyle. Among his lavish personal purchases with investor funds were a $3.2 million home, $1 million worth of jewelry, and exotic vacations that cost him $200,000 a year. Perez also spent investor money to travel by private jet, buy expensive artwork, and make $100,000 in political contributions., According to the SECs complaint, Perezs scheme collapsed in June 2009 when he was no longer able to recruit new investors., The SECs complaint charges Perez with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, sworn accounting, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil money penalty against Perez., The SEC coordinated the filing of these civil charges with the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of Florida, which today announced criminal charges against Perez., The SEC appreciates the assistance of the criminal authorities in this matter, including the U.S. Attorneys Office, the U.S. Secret Service, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the City of Miami Police Department., <b>See Also:</b> <a href=/litigation/complaints/2010/comp21544.pdf title=>SEC Complaint</a> ]"

She claimed that the test could predict whether a fetus had Down syndrome with almost 100 percent accuracy. However, the Commission alleges that Dragon knew the test was far less accurate than she claimed publicly. When Sequenom later announced that it was no longer relying on the data that Dragon presented and the test would not be launched as planned, the companys stock price plummeted by approximately 76 percent., The Commissions complaint, filed in federal court in San Diego, alleges that Dragon presented materially misleading scientific data about Sequenoms prenatal screening test for Down syndrome. The Commission alleges that she falsely claimed that the tests highly accurate results were obtained on a blinded basis, meaning that scientists did not know whether the fetus had Down syndrome at the time they tested the maternal blood sample., However, the Commission alleges that Dragon provided her scientists with the known outcomes of the samples, which allowed them to manipulate the data in order to produce more accurate results. The complaint alleges that Dragon falsified the number of samples allegedly tested by Sequenom and that she lied about how well the test worked, claiming that it produced unambiguous results. In reality, the complaint alleges, the test results were often difficult to interpret, which is why she needed to unblind the known outcomes to her scientists., Without admitting or denying the Commissions charges, Dragon has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining her from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and barring her from serving as an officer or director of a public company. The Court will determine the amount of a financial penalty to be paid by Dragon at a later date., <b>See Also:</b> <a href=/litigation/complaints/2010/comp21545.pdf title=>SEC Complaint</a> ]"

While claiming that the investments were for investments in securities and real estate, Vallett in fact used some investor funds for personal expenses and paid off certain investors in his first offering with funds received to invest in one of his later offerings. Vallett also claimed that the investments were for notes to be secured with his personal assets and asset of entities that he owned. However, during a recent examination by Financial Institutions Regulatory Authority (FINRA), he provided false documentation suggesting that the collateral exceeded the amount raised., In its Complaint, the Commission alleges that Vallett and Vallett &amp; Co. violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

Sentencing is scheduled for August 17, 2010. James faces a maximum sentence of 22 years in prison and up to several million dollars in restitution., The Commission previously filed a civil injunctive action against James and his investment advisory firm, James Asset Advisory LLC (James Asset) based on similar conduct. According to the Commissions complaint, from at least April 2001 through January 2008, James and James Asset received at least $5.2 million from 44 clients whom they misled into believing their funds would be invested in stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. However, James never invested any client funds. Instead, the complaint alleged, James misappropriated almost $2.4 million to fund personal expenses, including the purchase of a six-bedroom, 5,000 square foot home, a luxury condominium, a Porsche sports car, and season tickets to the Miami Heat games., On March 23, 2009, the Honorable Cecilia M.

The Commission alleges that LeMaire, a Nigerian citizen living in North Texas, held himself out as a minister and a man of God who planned to start a foundation to help needy children in Nigeria.

The Commission charged that Mortensen committed securities fraud, lied to accountants, falsified records and circumvented internal controls, and aided and abetted reporting, record-keeping and internal control violations. The Commission also alleged that Mortensen misappropriated hundreds of thousands of dollars from AMG to pay personal expenses., The Commission also charged one of Mortensens subordinates, Feng Eric Zheng, with lying to accountants, falsifying records and circumventing internal controls, and with aiding and abetting securities fraud and reporting, record-keeping and internal controls violations., The Commission alleges that, from March 2008 through February 2009, Mortensen directed Zheng to record false sales to two of AMGs largest customers. These entries materially overstated AMGs sales, earnings and accounts receivable, as reported in AMGs quarterly and annual reports during this period. The Commission further alleges that Mortensen, with Zhengs assistance, used the inflated accounts receivable to obtain greater borrowings under AMGs bank line of credit. Mortensen then misappropriated these and other AMG funds to pay such personal expenses as a country club membership, extensive home remodeling, property taxes, and family vacations to Florida, Europe and elsewhere using private jets., With respect to Mortensen, the Commission seeks civil penalties, disgorgement of misappropriated funds, a permanent bar from serving as a public company officer or director, and permanent injunctive relief.

The settlements are subject to court approval., The Commission alleged that Dorn, Lucents former Vice President of Indirect Sales for North America, entered into side agreements with certain of Lucents distributors that granted the distributors rights and privileges beyond those contained in their respective distribution agreements. Those side agreements made it improper for Lucent to recognize revenue, and caused Lucent to materially overstate its pre-tax income for fiscal year 2000.

Ltd., Merendon Mining (Nevada) Inc., and the Institute for Financial Learning Group of Companies, Inc. perpetrated a $300 million Ponzi scheme on investors in a purportedly successful gold mining operation., The SEC alleges that Brost and Sorenson of Calgary were the primary architects and beneficiaries of the scheme that persuaded more than 3,000 investors across the U.S. and Canada to invest their savings, retirement funds and even home equity. Brost and his sales team presented themselves as an independent financial education firm that had discovered profitable investment opportunities with companies involved in gold mining. They held seminars where they promised investors they could earn 18 to 36 percent annual returns by investing with these companies, and they claimed the investments were fully collateralized by gold., Unbeknownst to investors, they were actually investing in shell companies owned or controlled by Brost or Sorenson. Investor funds were often transferred multiple times through numerous bank accounts held as far away as Asia, Europe and South America, and then ultimately used to make interest payments to investors, fund the few unprofitable companies that actually had operations, and personally enrich Brost, Sorenson and others involved in the scheme., According to the SECs complaint, Brost and his sales team â called Structurists â sold investors shares in a series of shell companies and then put their money through a structuring process that culminated with the transfer of funds from Syndicated Gold Depository (SGD) to Merendon Mining Corp. Ltd. â which was purportedly a successful gold mining and refining company that would pay investors out of its profits. Sorenson, who controlled Merendon Mining Corp. Ltd., claimed to be a successful businessman receiving loans from SGD through arms-length transactions. Sorenson hosted tours by potential investors at his Honduran refinery and demonstrated the pouring of gold bars while making false claims about the profitability of his company. Brost and Sorenson concealed their ownership and control of SGD by using personal aliases, corporate entities and trust agreements with nominee shareholders., The SEC alleges that investor money whirled through accounts located in the U.S. and Canada as well as the Bahamas, Belize, Bermuda, Ecuador, Honduras, Malaysia, Panama, Peru, Portugal, and Venezuela. Brost and Sorenson diverted investor funds to their personal benefit, using millions of dollars to purchase and renovate extravagant homes, ranches, and recreational vehicles. Sorenson also purchased and outfitted a luxury fishing resort in South America., Sorensons wife and daughter are named as relief defendants in the case in order to recover investor assets now in their possession. Sorenson used investor funds to pay off the mortgage of daughter Laura Sorenson and invest in a film production company for her benefit, and he purchased a home and other items for wife Thelma Sorenson., The SECs complaint claims that based on this conduct, all of the defendants violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The court permanently enjoined Elkinson from future violations of the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws and ordered him to pay over $29 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest and civil penalties. On January 7, 2010, at the Commissions request, the court had issued an order freezing Elkinsons assets., The Commission alleged in its complaint that Elkinson, of Framingham, Massachusetts, operated a Ponzi scheme that defrauded at least 130 investors from multiple states of approximately $28 million. The complaint further alleged that since at least 1997, Elkinson offered and sold unregistered securities in the form of promissory notes. According to the complaint, Elkinson falsely told investors that he was in the business of brokering contracts on behalf of a Japanese firm that manufactured uniforms (such as police uniforms and prison uniforms) to be sold to large purchasers such as state and local governments (and even the U.S. Olympic Committee) and that investors money would be used to help finance specific uniform contracts. The investors received promissory notes signed by Elkinson, with terms that generally required payment within 300 to 330 days and with an interest rate that ranged from 9% to 13%. According to the complaint, however, Elkinson had no relationship with a Japanese uniform manufacturer, and there were no contracts to purchase uniforms. The Commission alleged that, while some investors did receive payments of principal and interest, those payments were made using funds obtained from other investors, and Elkinson was able to keep the scheme going as long as most of the investors kept rolling over their investments. In reality, according to the complaint, Elkinson used most of the investors money for his own personal purposes, including gambling., In its order granting the Commissions motion for default judgment, the court permanently enjoined Elkinson from committing further violations of Sections 5(a) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Investors were told that the BLF had been established as the private cash management vehicle for the Chimay royal family, and had a solid track record of safe and profitable returns. Investors were promised fixed annual returns of 12%, and were guaranteed the return of their principal and interest regardless of the actual performance of the loans., The Commission alleges that the defendants successfully obtained at least $6 million dollars in BLF investments in 2008 and 2009. According to the Commissions complaint, the defendants did not use these funds to make short-term loans but rather misappropriated them for a host of improper purposes, including to bankroll Chimays personal and business expenses, and to pay other investors. Among other things, the Commission alleges that nearly $600,000 in investor funds were diverted to pay Chimays divorce lawyers, and that additional funds were misappropriated to pay Chimays mortgage and credit card bills., The complaint alleges that the defendants violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5., The Commission seeks, among other emergency relief, a temporary restraining order: (i) enjoining the defendants from future violations of the federal securities laws; (ii) freezing the defendants assets and repatriating the defendants fraudulently obtained assets found overseas; (iii) directing the defendants to provide verified accountings; and (iv) prohibiting the destruction, concealment or alteration of documents.

The SECs complaint, filed in federal court in Albuquerque, alleges that between July 2007 and November 2009, UAV, based in Irvine, California, and its principals, Thomas and Hollowell, along with its investor relations associate, Dies, sold approximately $10 million in bonds to approximately 100 individual investors in various states. Integra, formerly of Albuquerque, New Mexico, which was owned and controlled by Oliva, used a website and held investment seminars to solicit investors for UAV., The SECs complaint alleges that the defendants misrepresented and concealed numerous material facts in communications with investors. They assured investors, for example, that UAV had a strong track record of profiting from medical-related investments and that investors would earn a guaranteed 25 percent annual return on UAVs bonds. In reality, UAV had no such record or experience, and never earned a return from any investment. Instead, UAV used nearly all of the money it raised from investors for purposes other than investments in medical ventures, such as paying exorbitant salaries and benefits to Thomas and Hollowell, paying referral fees to Integra and Oliva, and making Ponzi-type interest payments to investors. Further, the defendants misrepresented Thomas venture capital experience and educational background, and failed to inform investors that Thomas was previously barred by a California court from being involved in any securities offering., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, the defendants each consented to final judgments permanently enjoining them from violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

In addition, Rennie was ordered to pay $3.78 million in restitution to the victims of his fraud. On September 30, 2009 the U.S. Attorneys Office filed a criminal Information against Rennie, a licensed securities broker, charging that he defrauded investors by selling approximately $3.2 million in purported investments in federally subsidized real estate developments, among other things, and used the investors funds to pay his own expenses and debts. Rennie pleaded guilty to these charges on January 12, 2010., The Commission previously filed a civil injunctive action against Rennie based on similar conduct on January 23, 2009. According to the Commissions complaint, from early 2007 through early 2009, Rennie made misrepresentations to several of his clients about investing their money in risk-free federal housing certificates that paid up to 12% per year, tax free, and were offered by a real estate investment company based in Boston. In fact, however, the complaint alleges that the investments were completely fictitious and that Rennie had no relationship with the real estate investment company whose name he used. According to the Commissions filings, Rennie defrauded clients who were elderly, including an 89 year old man. The filings allege that Rennie induced some clients to cash out their investments in annuities, incurring substantial surrender charges, in order to invest in his fraudulent program. According to the complaint, Rennie used investor proceeds to pay personal expenses, including a gym membership and liquor, grocery, shoe and department store purchases, and withdrew thousands of dollars in cash from the account where investor funds were sent., On May 18, 2009, the Commission obtained a final judgment by default against Rennie in which he was enjoined from future violations of the securities laws and ordered to pay disgorgement in the amount of $3,678,377, representing profits gained as a result of the conduct alleged in the Commissions Complaint, prejudgment interest in the amount of $30,653, and a penalty of $500,000., On May 29, 2009, the Commission instituted administrative proceedings against Rennie based on the entry of the final judgment by default in the civil injunctive action to determine what, if any, remedial action was appropriate and in the public interest. On August 12, 2009, Administrative Law Judge James T. Kelly issued an order by default barring Rennie from association with any broker or dealer or investment adviser., For further information, please see: Exchange Act Release No. 60482 (August 12, 2009), Exchange Act Release No. 60007 (May 29, 2009), Litigation Release Nos. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2010/lr21379.htm>21379</a> (January 15, 2010), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21043.htm>21043</a> (May 18, 2009), and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr20865.htm>20865</a> (January 23, 2009)., ]"

The first amended complaint alleges that on July 22, 2008, the senior Qualcomm executive leading negotiations with Nokia representatives in Delaware informed Leyva that Nokia had surprised Qualcomm with a significant settlement offer and conveyed the key terms of that offer to Leyva. Approximately two hours later, the first amended complaint alleges, Leyva purchased 80 Qualcomm call option contracts priced at $.39 each with a strike price of $50., After the market closed on July 23, 2008, Qualcomm and Nokia announced their new licensing agreement and a global settlement of all litigation between them.

The complaint further alleges that after he received the customers funds, Wegener gave them purported brokerage account statements from Wealth Resources that falsely represented that he invested the money in a variety of investments, including publicly traded securities, publicly traded mutual funds, two private companies in which Wegener had an ownership interest, other private companies, and other funds. According to the complaint, in reality, Wegener did not use the customers money to purchase the investments as represented. Instead, Wegener used the customers money (1) for personal expenses, (2) to pay business expenses for and make investments on his own behalf in entities in which he held an ownership interest, including WU Ventures, LLC, Secura Technology, LLC, and Trailblazer Learning, Inc., as well as Wealth Resources itself; and (3) to make Ponzi-like payments to other customers who requested a return of all or part of their investment.

Priore and his companies also improperly obtained tens of millions of dollars in advisory fees and undisclosed profits at the expense of their clients and investors. The SEC further alleges that ICP and Priore directed more than a billion dollars of trades for the Triaxx CDOs at what they knew were inflated prices. ICP and Priore repeatedly caused the Triaxx CDOs to overpay for securities in order to make money for ICP and protect other ICP clients from realizing losses. The prices for such trades often exceeded market prices by substantial margins. In some trades, ICP caused the CDOs to pay a price that was substantially higher than the price another ICP client paid for the security earlier the same day., According to the SECs complaint, ICP and Priore caused the CDOs to make numerous prohibited investments without obtaining necessary approvals, and they later misrepresented those investments to the trustee of the CDOs and to investors. The prices of many of these investments were intentionally inflated to allow ICP to collect millions of dollars in advisory fees from the CDOs. The SEC further alleges that ICP and Priore executed undisclosed cash transfers from a hedge fund they managed in order to allow another ICP client to meet the margin calls of one of its creditors. Priore subsequently misrepresented the transfers to the hedge funds investors., The complaint alleges that ICP, ICP Securities, Institutional Credit Partners, and Priore violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and directly violated and aided and abetted violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Trade-LLC raised almost $28 million from the clubs and throughout the course of the scheme, claimed that it was profitably trading securities for them. In fact, Trade-LLC was incurring significant trading losses and Milton and Center were allegedly using the funds Trade-LLC received from the clubs to pay fictitious trading profits to them. Milton and Center also misappropriated the clubs monies to pay their salaries and other personal and business expenses., According to the SECs complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, between 2007 and 2009, the three private investment clubs invested nearly $28 million of their members funds with Trade-LLC based on promises that the firm can generate significant returns for them and their members.

Specifically, Milton and Center used the clubs funds to pay themselves salaries of more than $2 million and $1 million, respectively, and to cover more than $1.3 million in business and other unrelated expenses. Milton and Center also transferred, without any legitimate basis, over $4.8 million of the clubs funds to three Florida companies they controlled., The SECs complaint charges Trade-LLC, Milton, and Center with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

June 24, 2010)</h2>]","[, The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that it obtained an asset freeze and other emergency relief against a Jacksonville, Fla., retirement benefits consulting firm that defrauded active and retired government employees and law enforcement agents nationwide through a Ponzi scheme that promised safe investments., The SEC charged the estate of the recently deceased Kenneth Wayne McLeod, his benefits consulting firm, Federal Employee Benefits Group, Inc. (FEBG), and his registered investment adviser, F&amp;S Asset Management Group, Inc. with fraudulently soliciting government employees to invest in a government bond fund that didnt exist., The SEC alleges that McLeod lured many of his investors through retirement benefits seminars he gave at government agencies nationwide. He raised at least $34 million since 1988 from an estimated 260 investors around the country. The security of the government bonds was a key element of McLeods deception but he never purchased any bonds. Instead, he used the investors retirement savings to conduct a Ponzi scheme, to pay himself, and to pay for lavish entertainment, including annual trips to the Super Bowl for himself and 40 friends., According to the SECs complaint, filed on June 24, 2010, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, McLeod traveled to various state and federal government agencies to conduct FEBG employee benefits counseling and planning seminars. FEBG also provided individuals with personalized benefits analyses specific to their retirement plans and financial portfolios. Individuals could also choose to have F&amp;S Asset Management manage their money., The SEC alleges that in addition to the traditional investments McLeod offered through F&amp;S Asset Management, he offered many investors guaranteed annual returns of eight to ten percent through a purported tax-free FEBG Bond Fund or FEBG Special Fund. He falsely told investors that their principal would be 100 percent invested in and secured by government bonds. McLeod explained to several investors that the fund invested in government securities that provided a 13 percent return. McLeod misrepresented that he used the three to five percent spread to expand FEBG and his other businesses, but the investors principal would remain untouched., To perpetuate the scheme, McLeod told investors that their principal would be locked up for various periods of up to eight years, supposedly due to the long term nature of the funds underlying bonds, the SECs complaint alleges. He also issued some investors false FEBG Bond Fund account statements, which showed fake interest earnings. Furthermore, he gave investors the option to reinvest their quarterly interest earnings rather than receive distributions, which many investors did., The SEC alleges that the purported safety of the bond fund was an important factor in some investors decision to retire from law enforcement or public service. Based on McLeods misrepresentations, some investors rolled over their retirement and savings accounts into the bond fund or invested their inheritances and their childrens tuition savings., The SECs complaint charges the Estate of McLeod, FEBG, and F&amp;S Asset Management with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint further charges the Estate of McLeod and F&amp;S Asset Management with violations of Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. In addition to emergency relief, the SEC is seeking disgorgement against all of the defendants, and money penalties, and preliminary and permanent injunctions against FEBG and F&amp;S Asset Management., On June 24, 2010, the Honorable Federico A. Moreno, U.S. District Judge, entered an ex parte emergency order temporarily restraining FEBG and F&amp;S Asset Management and freezing their assets and the assets of the Estate of McLeod. The order also provides for expedited discovery, a sworn accounting and the preservation of records., The Court also appointed Michael Goldberg, an attorney with the law firm of Akerman Senterfitt of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, as a receiver over FEBG and F&amp;S Asset Management. Among other things, the receiver is responsible for marshaling and safeguarding assets held by these entities.

The Commission obtained an emergency court order freezing assets and halting the scheme that was ongoing. The Commission also named five relief defendants., The Commissions complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Utah, alleges that from approximately June 2005 through January 2007, Anthony C. Zufelt (Zufelt) and Joseph A. Nelson (Nelson) raised at least $3.6 million by convincing at least 36 investors to invest in offerings by defendants Zufelt, Inc. and Silver Leaf Investments, Inc. The complaint alleges that Zufelt and Nelson promised investment returns of up to 220% and fraudulently claimed that Zufelt ran a profitable credit card transaction processing business that was selling secure investments backed by a so-called merchant portfolio of credit card processing accounts. According to the complaint, defendants David Decker and Cache Decker acted as promoters and helped Zufelt and Nelson solicit investors for these schemes., The complaint further alleges that from approximately August 2005 to the present day, Nelson has separately solicited investors by fraudulently claiming that he buys and sells merchant portfolios for a profit through his companies, defendants JCN, Inc., JCN Capital, LLC, and JCN International, LLC. To date, Nelson has raised at least $12 million from over 100 investors by promising investors that their investments were secure and that he would provide investment returns of up to 200% in a very short period of time., According to the Commissions complaint, Zufelt, Nelson, David Decker and Cache Decker each solicited members of the Mormon community to invest in these schemes. The complaint further alleges that Zufelt, Nelson, David Decker and Cache Decker each encouraged and convinced potential investors to borrow against their homes in order to invest in these schemes., Unbeknownst to investors in any of the three Ponzi schemes, as the complaint alleges, Zufelt and Nelson misused investors funds to pay personal expenses, pay commissions and bonuses to associates, fund unrelated businesses, make gifts, and make payments to investors in order to perpetuate their schemes. The complaint further alleges that both Zufelt and Nelson diverted investor funds to friends and family members, some of whom are named relief defendants in the Commissions complaint., The Commissions complaint alleges violations of the antifraud, registration, and broker-dealer provisions of the federal securities laws: Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement, civil penalties, and officer and director bars against Zufelt, Nelson, David Decker and Cache Decker.

Jarman, Jr. (Zufelts brother-in-law), Eric R. Nelson (Nelsons brother) and Kevin J.

Among other things, the Court order freezes the defendants U.S. assets and orders defendants to repatriate $400,000., The Commission filed an emergency action on March 15, 2010, alleging violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The Commission alleged that the defendants and/or others acting in concert with them undertook to intrude into, and place trades in, online brokerage accounts at Scottrade, while simultaneously placing other, typically profitable sides of those unauthorized trades in their own account at Genesis Securities, LLC., On June 17, 2010, the Court found that there is a substantial likelihood that the Commission will succeed in proving that defendants participated in and substantially assisted fraudulent trading in Brocos account at Genesis Securities, thereby establishing liability under Section 10(b) and 17(a) as a primary violator or, at the least, as an aider and abettor. The Court based its decision, in part, on its findings that, among other things:, <p class=em2>[T]here is ample evidence that Broco ignored obvious signs of fraud. [The subaccount] generated trading profits so large and so rapid that no reasonable executive could have believed that they were legitimate, at least not without receiving a remarkable and well-supported explanation. â¦, <p class=em2>[The subaccount] achieved these results by consistently doubling and sometimes tripling or even quadrupling his subaccount balance in a single days worth of trading.

Technipâs American Depository Shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange from August 2001 to November 2007., According to the SECâs complaint, between at least 1995 and 2004, senior executives at Technip and other members of TSKJ, a four-company joint venture that includes KBR, Inc., devised and implemented a scheme to bribe Nigerian government officials to obtain multi-billion dollar contracts to build liquefied natural gas (LNG) production facilities. The complaint alleges that from the inception of the joint venture, Technip and the other joint venture partners paid bribes to assist in obtaining the LNG contracts. The joint venture partners formed a âcultural committee,â comprised of senior sales executives at each company, to consider how to carry out the bribery scheme. To conceal the illicit payments, the joint venture entered into sham contracts with a shell company controlled by a U.K. solicitor and a Japanese trading company as conduits for the bribes. Total payments to the two agents exceeded $180 million., The SECâs complaint also alleges that Technipâs internal controls failed to detect or prevent the bribery, and that the companyâs records were falsified as a result of the bribery scheme. After Technip became a U.S. issuer in August 2001, it became subject to the FCPA, including the FCPAâs prohibitions on the payment of anything of value to foreign government officials in order to obtain or retain business. The complaint alleges that although Technip was aware of these prohibitions, it did not implement adequate controls to ensure compliance with the FCPA. Instead, its due diligence was a âperfunctory exerciseâ conducted so that Technip would have some documentation in its files., Without admitting or denying the SECâs allegations, Technip has consented to the entry of a court order permanently enjoining it from violating Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and ordering Technip to disgorge $98 million in ill-gotten profits derived from the scheme and prejudgment interest. The proposed settlement is subject to court approval., In the related criminal proceeding announced today, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a criminal action against Technip, charging one count of conspiring to violate the FCPA and one count of violating the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA. Technip has entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the DOJ and agreed to pay a criminal penalty of $240 million., The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the U.S. Department of Justice, Fraud Section; the Federal Bureau of Investigation; and foreign authorities in Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas.

(Leinenweber, J.)</h2>]","[, The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced fraud charges and an emergency asset freeze against a purported fund manager based in the Virgin Islands who perpetrated a $105 million Ponzi scheme against investors., The SEC alleges that Daniel Spitzer, a resident of St. Thomas, used several entities and sales agents to misrepresent to investors that their money would be invested in investment funds that, in turn, would be invested primarily in foreign currency. Investors were falsely told that Spitzers funds had never lost money and historically produced profitable annual returns that one year reached over 180 percent. Spitzer instead used money raised from new investors to pay earlier investors, and misappropriated investor funds to pay unrelated business expenses. He concealed his scheme by issuing phony documents to investors that led them to believe their investments were profiting., The SEC has obtained an emergency court order freezing the assets of Spitzer and his companies., According to the SECs complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Spitzer conducted his fraudulent scheme, which involved 400 investors, from at least 2004 to present. He only invested approximately $30 million of the more than $105 million he raised from investors. Of that amount, Spitzer used approximately $13.5 million to invest through an offshore entity via a bank account in the Netherlands Antilles. These investments, some of which were placed in a French financial institution, lost money and were subsequently liquidated. Spitzer used another $16 million to invest in money market funds that earned only a few thousand dollars. Spitzer liquidated these investments as well. After the investments were liquidated, the money was returned to Spitzer, and he used it to repay investors in Ponzi-like fashion. To cover up his scheme, Spitzer issued to his investors false Schedule K-1s that showed inflated returns and led them to believe that their investments were profitable., The SECs complaint alleges that Spitzer used offshore bank accounts to pay purported business expenses of his companies. Spitzer deposited investor funds into bank accounts at the National Bank of Anguilla and the First Bank of Puerto Rico, from which he paid more than $15 million in purported operating expenses and payments to himself and various sales agents. Spitzer also used more than $4.8 million to pay third-party business expenses. The SEC further alleges that Spitzer led an extravagant lifestyle and spent more than $900,000 at a Las Vegas casino., According to the SECs complaint, Spitzers scheme is on the verge of collapse as he has attempted to delay and avoid paying investor redemptions. As recently as March 2010, Spitzer obtained $100,000 from an investor for an investment in one of his purportedly more conservative investment funds. Rather than invest the money, Spitzer used a portion of the money in April 2010 to pay other investors and third-party expenses., At the SECs request for emergency relief for investors, the Hon. Harry D. Leinenweber of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois issued an order freezing all assets of Spitzer and his companies. Among other things, the court order requires that the defendants repatriate to the U.S. all assets located overseas., The SECs complaint charges Spitzer and the defendant entities with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also charges Spitzer and two of the asset management companies with violations of Section 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder. The complaint also seeks a court order of permanent injunction against Spitzer and each of the defendant entities, as well as an order of disgorgement including prejudgment interest. The complaint also seeks financial penalties against Spitzer and five of the asset management companies., The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Irish Financial Regulator, Danish Financial Supervisory Authority, AutoritÃ© des marches financier in France, the Ontario Securities Commission and the Financial Intelligence and Investigations Unit Attached to the Royal Anguilla Police Force in Anguilla., The SECs investigation is continuing.

The SEC also charged two companies the couple control and obtained an asset freeze against them., According to the SECs complaint, the defendants profited by selling penny stocks at or around the same time that they were touting them on www.pennystockchaser.com. The website invites investors to sign up for daily stock alerts through email, text messages, Facebook and Twitter., The SEC alleges that since at least April 2009, Carol McKeown and Daniel F. Ryan, a couple residing in Montreal, Canada, have touted U.S. microcap companies. According to the SECs complaint, McKeown and Ryan received millions of shares of touted companies through their two corporations, defendants Downshire Capital Inc., and Meadow Vista Financial Corp., as compensation for their touting. McKeown and Ryan sold the shares on the open market while PennyStockChaser simultaneously predicted massive price increases for the issuers, a practice known as scalping., The SECs complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, also alleges McKeown, Ryan and one of their corporations failed to disclose the full amount of the compensation they received for touting stocks on PennyStockChaser. The SEC alleges that McKeown, Ryan and their corporations have realized at least $2.4 million in sales proceeds from their scalping scheme., The SECs complaint charges McKeown, Ryan, Downshire Capital Inc. and Meadow Vista Financial Corp. with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SECs complaint also charges McKeown, Ryan and Meadow Vista Financial Corp. with violating Section 17(b) of the Securities Act of 1933.

As a result of both ongoing investigations, the AMF obtained an emergency order freezing assets and a cease trade order against McKeown, Ryan, Downshire Capital Inc. and Meadow Vista Financial Corp.

The alleged violations stemmed from improper payments made by Veraz to foreign officials in China and Vietnam after the company went public in 2007., The SEC alleges that Veraz engaged a consultant in China who in 2007 and 2008 gave gifts and offered improper payment together valued at approximately $40,000 to officials at a government controlled telecommunications company in China in an attempt to win business for Veraz. A Veraz supervisor who approved the gifts described them in an internal Veraz email as the gift scheme. Similarly in 2007 and 2008, the SEC alleges that a Veraz employee made improper payments to the CEO of a government controlled telecommunications company in Vietnam to win business for Veraz., According to the SECs complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, Veraz violated the books and records and internal controls provisions of the FCPA by failing to accurately record the improper payments on its books and records, and failing to devise and maintain a system of effective internal controls to prevent such payments. Veraz, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining Veraz from future violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and ordering Veraz to pay a penalty of $300,000., The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security during the investigation., <b>See Also:</b> <a href=/litigation/complaints/2010/comp21581.pdf title=>SEC Complaint</a> ]"

Preston with fraud and breach of fiduciary duty for placing clients in unsuitable investments and misrepresenting and failing to disclose the risks of these investments., The SEC alleges that Life Wealth and Preston invested $6.9 million of client funds in unsecured promissory notes issued by Atherton-Newport Investments, LLC, a real estate company that buys and renovates distressed properties and is headquartered in Irvine, Calif. Beginning in or about October 2005, Preston recommended the notes to Life Wealth clients even though the notes were not suitable to the clients risk tolerances. Preston also characterized the notes as a solid and strong investment without disclosing the risks inherent in an unsecured loan. Atherton-Newport defaulted on all of the outstanding notes in September 2007, which amounted to almost total losses for Life Wealth clients., According to the SECs complaint, Preston recommended the Atherton-Newport unsecured promissory notes to his clients despite the fact that in July 2005, Life Wealths attorney had cautioned him about the enormous risk of such an investment. Nevertheless, not only did Preston recommend the notes to clients, he also falsely reassured clients that their principal would be safe. Even though Preston began to doubt the viability of Atherton-Newport in early 2007, he did not disclose his concerns to Life Wealth clients. Preston then redeemed his own unsecured promissory note several weeks before Atherton-Newport defaulted on all of the outstanding notes. Even after Atherton-Newport defaulted on the notes, Preston persuaded three Life Wealth clients to invest $235,000 in unsecured promissory notes issued by Atherton-Newport. In addition, Preston recommended the notes to clients even though the investment was highly unsuitable for many of them, such as one client who invested 86.2 per cent of her total net worth in the notes., The SECs complaint charges Life Wealth and Preston with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

Lee, of Rockwall, Texas, and Carl Lee and Associates, Inc. (CLA), Lees business. The final judgment: (1) enjoined Lee and CLA from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Rules 10b-5 and 10b-10 promulgated thereunder, and enjoined Lee from aiding and abetting violations of Rule 10b-10 of the Exchange Act; (2) ordered Lee and CLA to pay disgorgement in the amount of $1,416,557.82, plus prejudgment interest of $603,088.00, for a total of $2,019,645.82; and (3) ordered Lee to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $120,000., The SECs complaint in this matter charges that Michael E. Kelly and 25 other defendants, including Lee and CLA, participated in a massive fraud on U.S. investors that involved the offer and sale of securities in the form of Universal Leases. Universal Lease investments were structured as timeshares in several hotels in Cancun, Mexico, coupled with a pre-arranged rental agreement that promised investors a high, fixed rate of return. The SECs complaint alleges that from 1999 until 2005, Kelly and others, including Lee and CLA, raised at least $428 million through the Universal Lease scheme from investors throughout the United States, with more than $136 million of the funds invested coming from IRA accounts. The SEC further alleges that a nationwide network of unregistered salespeople who sold the Universal Leases, including Lee and CLA, collected undisclosed commissions totaling more than $72 million. The SEC also alleges that Kelly and others ran the scheme from Cancun, Mexico, through a number of foreign entities in Mexico and Panama. According to the SECs complaint, Kelly and others told investors that Universal Leases would generate guaranteed income through the leasing of investor timeshares by a large, independent leasing agent. In fact, the complaint alleges, the leasing agent was a small Panamanian travel agency controlled by Kelly, and for most of the scheme its payments to investors came from accounts funded by money raised from new investors. Further, the complaint alleges that Kelly and the other defendants, including Lee and CLA, failed to disclose key facts about the Universal Lease investment, including the risks of the investment and that Kelly was paying commissions as high as 27% to the selling brokers.

(Lifes Good Funds). Stinson falsely claimed that the Lifes Good Funds generated annual returns of 10 to 16 percent by originating more than $30 million in commercial mortgage loans, and other investment income gained on the sale of foreclosure and investment properties.

Wachovia also agreed to offer to purchase ARS from all of its institutional customers as well., Nearly 100% of these customers have accepted the firms offers, resulting in approximately $14 billion of liquidity. Specifically, Citigroup, RBC, and Wachovia purchased ARS from their respective eligible customers in the amounts of $6.38 billion, $759 million, and $7.45 billion., The settlements also required Citigroup and RBC to use best efforts to provide liquidity opportunities to their institutional customers. To assist in its analysis of whether the firms had in fact used best efforts, the SEC retained an outside expert with extensive knowledge of the ARS market., From the time of the ARS market failure in February 2008 through May 31, 2010, Citigroup institutional customer holdings were reduced by $8.46 billion or 46% (from $18.55 billion to $10.09 billion) and RBC institutional customer holdings were reduced by $3.2 billion or 48% (from $6.6 billion to $3.4 billion). In compliance with their obligations, Citigroup and RBC each implemented broad-based liquidity measures for their institutional investors., Citigroup, RBC, and Wachovia also met their other settlement obligations, including compensating investors who sold ARS below par, reimbursing investors for excess interest costs associated with loans taken out due to ARS illiquidity, and participating in special arbitration proceedings before the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The firms also submitted periodic reports to, and met quarterly with, SEC staff regarding the firms progress on meeting their settlement obligations., To ensure compliance with the terms, the settlements provided for a potential deferred penalty if the firms did not meet their settlement obligations.

The Commission previously charged Cutillo, Goldfarb, Goffer, and six others in connection with this insider trading scheme on November 5, 2009. <i>See SEC v.

Technip, KBR and its former parent Halliburton Company paid a combined $917 million to settle FCPA charges. The $365 million to be paid by ENI and Snamprogetti brings the total sanctions against the companies involved in the scheme to more than $1.28 billion., According to the SECs complaint against ENI and Snamprogetti, filed today in federal district court in Houston, senior executives at Snamprogetti and the other joint venture companies authorized the hiring of two agents, a U.K. solicitor and a Japanese trading company, through which more than $180 million in bribes were funneled to Nigerian government officials to obtain several contracts to build liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities on Bonny Island, Nigeria. The Nigerian government exercised majority control over the company that awarded the contracts â Nigeria LNG Ltd., The SECs complaint alleges that senior sales executives at the joint venture companies formed a cultural committee to consider how to implement and hide the bribery scheme through sham consulting and services contracts with subcontractors or vendors. After Nigeria LNG awarded the joint venture companies a $2.2 billion LNG-related construction contract in December 1995, the companies sent a total of $60 million to the U.K. agents Swiss bank account over the next 52 months. The U.K. agent transferred the money to accounts owned or controlled by high-ranking Nigerian government officials., The SEC alleges that following a change in Nigerian government in 1999, representatives from the joint venture companies traveled to Nigeria to meet a high-ranking government official to continue the scheme. The official confirmed that the U.K. agent was the correct intermediary, and also appointed his own representative to negotiate the bribe amount. A senior officer from Snamprogetti and others from the joint venture met with the Nigerian officials representative in London and negotiated an amount of $32.5 million to be delivered through the U.K. agent. Days after the London meeting, Nigeria LNG awarded a contract to the joint venture companies for $1.2 billion., The SEC alleges that in 2002 and 2003, the U.K. agent used a subcontractor on the Nigeria LNG project to transfer millions of dollars to a Nigerian government official for the benefit of a Nigerian political party. The subcontractor personally hand-delivered U.S. cash in briefcases to the Nigerian official in a hotel room in Abuja, Nigeria. The subcontractor also delivered the bribes to the Nigerian official in local Nigerian currency, the Naira. In these instances, because the Naira was too bulky to deliver by hand, the subcontractor loaded the cash into vehicles that were delivered to the Nigerian official., The SECs complaint also alleges that ENI failed to ensure that its former subsidiary, Snamprogetti, complied with ENIs internal controls concerning the use of agents, and that the books and records of both companies were falsified as a result of the bribery scheme. After ENI became a U.S. issuer in 1995, it became subject to the FCPA, including the requirement to create and maintain adequate internal controls., Without admitting or denying the SECs allegations, Snamprogetti has consented to the entry of a court order permanently enjoining it from violating the anti-bribery and recordkeeping and internal controls provisions in Sections 30A and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 13b2-1, and ENI has consented to the entry of a court order permanently enjoining it from violating the recordkeeping and internal controls provisions in Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act. Snamprogetti and ENI also consented to the entry of court orders that require them, jointly and severally, to pay $125 million in disgorgement. The proposed settlements are subject to court approval., In the related criminal proceeding announced today, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a criminal action against Snamprogetti, charging one count of conspiring to violate the FCPA and one count of aiding and abetting violations of the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA. Snamprogetti has entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the DOJ and agreed to pay a criminal penalty of $240 million., The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the U.S. Department of Justice, Fraud Section; the Federal Bureau of Investigation; and foreign authorities in Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas., SEC Charges Technip with FCPA Violations<br/><a href=/news/press/2010/2010-110.htm>http://sec.gov/news/press/2010/2010-110.htm</a>, SEC Charges KBR and Halliburton for FCPA Violations<br/><a href=/news/press/2009/2009-23.htm>http://sec.gov/news/press/2009/2009-23.htm</a>, SEC Charges Former CEO of Kellogg, Brown &amp; Root, Inc.

Goldman failed to disclose to investors vital information about the CDO, known as ABACUS 2007-AC1, particularly the role that hedge fund Paulson &amp; Co. Inc. played in the portfolio selection process and the fact that Paulson had taken a short position against the CDO., In settlement papers submitted to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Goldman made the following acknowledgement:, <i>Goldman acknowledges that the marketing materials for the ABACUS 2007-AC1 transaction contained incomplete information. In particular, it was a mistake for the Goldman marketing materials to state that the reference portfolio was selected by ACA Management LLC without disclosing the role of Paulson &amp; Co.

Goldman regrets that the marketing materials did not contain that disclosure.</i>, Goldman agreed to settle the SECs charges without admitting or denying the allegations by consenting to the entry of a final judgment that provides for a permanent injunction from violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933. Of the $550 million to be paid by Goldman in the settlement, $250 million would be returned to harmed investors through a Fair Fund distribution and $300 million would be paid to the U.S. Treasury., The settlement also requires remedial action by Goldman in its review and approval of offerings of certain mortgage securities. This includes the role and responsibilities of internal legal counsel, compliance personnel, and outside counsel in the review of written marketing materials for such offerings. The settlement also requires additional education and training of Goldman employees in this area of the firms business.

Lin, and Tridents former Chief Accounting Officer, Peter Jen, alleging violations related to stock option backdating., The Commissions complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, alleges that from at least 1993 to May 2006, Trident, through the conduct of Lin and Jen, engaged in a fraudulent and deceptive scheme to provide undisclosed compensation to executives and other employees, concealing millions of dollars in expenses from the Companys shareholders. According to the complaint, Lin used, and directed others to use, hindsight to select for stock option grants dates that coincided with the dates of low closing prices for the Companys stock. Lin backdated stock option documentation to make it appear as if options had been granted on earlier dates, resulting in disguised in-the-money option grants to Company employees, officers, and on at least one occasion to directors. Among the alleged backdating practices, Trident backdated offer letters to newly hired employees and parked low-priced options under the names of certain employees which were later allocated to different employees in subsequent months when Tridents stock price increased. The complaint alleges that Jen was aware of some of the backdating practices during at least 1998 to 2006 and that he approved backdated grants to certain employees., The complaint alleges that Lin and Jen signed and/or approved of the filing of annual and quarterly reports with the Commission that they knew, or were reckless in not knowing, failed to include compensation expenses associated with the in-the-money portions of the backdated grants. The reports falsely stated that Trident complied with stock option accounting rules and, in certain cases, stated that Trident granted options at the fair market value of the Companys stock on the date of grant. Lin and Jen also signed registration statements filed with the Commission that incorporated by reference these false and misleading periodic reports. The complaint also alleges that Lin and Jen reviewed and/or prepared proxy statements provided to shareholders that falsely reported stock option grant dates for executives and falsely stated that those stock options were granted at the market value of the Companys stock on the date of grant. Lin and Jen also filed beneficial ownership forms (Forms 4) with the Commission misrepresenting the purported grant dates of backdated stock options that they each received., According to the complaint, in August 2007, Trident filed a restatement to record approximately $37 million of compensation expenses that the Company had failed to record over a thirteen-year period. As a result of Tridents failure to properly account for its stock option grants, Trident materially overstated its pre-tax income or understated its pre-tax losses, by as much as 113%, in each of the Companys fiscal years from 1993 through 2005, and through the third quarter of its 2006 fiscal year, according to the complaint., Trident, Lin, and Jen agreed to settle the matter without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions complaint., Trident consented to the entry of an order permanently enjoining it from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13 (b)(2)(B) and 14 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13 and 14a-9., Lin consented to an order permanently enjoining him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b), 13(b)(5), 14(a), and 16(a) of the Exchange Act, and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, 13b2-1, 13b2-2, 14a-9, and 16a-3; and from aiding and abetting violations of the Exchange Acts reporting, books and records, and internal controls provisions. Lin agreed to pay a $350,000 penalty and to be barred for five years from serving as an officer or director of any issuer that has a class of securities registered with the Commission or that is required to file reports with the Commission. Lin also agreed to disgorge the in-the-money benefit he received upon his exercise of backdated option grants, plus pre-judgment interest thereon, for total disgorgement of $817,509, which the Commission will deem satisfied upon Lins payment of this amount to Trident., Jen consented to an order permanently enjoining him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b), 13(b)(5), and 16(a) of the Exchange Act, and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, 13b2-1, 13b2-2, and 16a-3; and from aiding and abetting violations of Exchange Acts reporting, books and records, internal controls, and proxy solicitation provisions.

Â§Â§ 1349 and 1956(h). The criminal charges are for their roles in a multi-million dollar Ponzi scheme which targeted the South Florida Haitian-American Community. According to the Indictment, Focus Development Center, Inc. and Focus Financial Group, Inc. a/k/a Focus Financial Associates (collectively Focus Financial) issued and sold 12-month promissory notes to investors providing for a guaranteed 15% annual return.

In reality, Focus Financial and its affiliated businesses never generated sufficient profits to pay annual returns and, instead, the defendants used new investor funds to pay principal and interest payments to earlier investors. The Indictment further charges that as a result of the scheme, the defendants raised $8 million from more than 600 Haitian-American investors living in South Florida who ultimately suffered losses of approximately $6 million., On June 9, 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a civil injunctive action against Focus Financial and its principals, Francois, Montinard and Pierre-Louis, charging them with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC subsequently obtained judgments against each of the defendants, providing for full permanent injunctive relief, holding each of the defendants jointly and severally liable for disgorgement in the amount of $5.9 million, plus prejudgment interest thereon, and ordering them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $120,000 each., On September 29, 2005, the SECs Miami Regional Office and the State of Florida Office of Financial Regulation held an investor education and outreach program in North Miami, Florida, in English and with Creole translators, to provide information to Focus Financial victims and provide information to the Haitian-American community about avoiding financial scams.<br/>For more information on earlier actions in this case, see Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr19258.htm>19258</a> (June 9, 2005), Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr19472.htm>19472</a> (November 18, 2005), Litigation Release <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19707.htm>19707</a> (May 22, 2006), Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19753.htm>19753</a> (July 5, 2006), Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19915.htm>19915</a> and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19916.htm>19916</a> (November 15, 2006)., ]"

Brown and Ronald J. Mangini, for fraudulently selling securities to investors and misappropriating the money for their personal use., In its complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, the SEC alleges that, from as early as April 2008 until June 2010, Brown and Mangini sold what purported to be the common stock and promissory notes of a company called Infinity Reserves-Tennessee Inc., which they represented to be a gas gathering and trunk pipeline system. In fact, the securities Brown and Mangini sold were fictitious. Infinity Reserves is the name of a company owned by one of their clients, and the companys principal asset is a now defunct natural gas pipeline in Tennessee. Without the knowledge or authorization of the client, who is the sole shareholder of Infinity Reserves, Brown and Mangini have been falsely holding themselves out to investors as senior officers of Infinity Reserves with authority to sell the phony securities at issue., The complaint further alleges that Brown and Mangini have sold the securities to a number of investors, including clients of their accounting practice, and have illegally obtained over $2 million from those investors. Brown and Mangini have returned only small amounts of funds to certain investors as interest payments, while diverting the vast majority of investor funds â at least $1.6 million â to their and their family members personal use., The SECs complaint also names as relief defendants certain of the defendants family members and related entities, who received hundreds of thousands of dollars of investor funds: Browns wife and daughter, Susan and Sloane Brown; Infinity Farms, Ltd., which received investor funds through a bank account controlled by Brown, and his wife and daughter; Manginis wife, June Mangini; and Maylil, Inc., which received investor funds through a bank account controlled by Ronald and June Mangini., The SECs complaint charges Brown and Mangini with violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5. In addition to emergency relief, including an order to freeze assets, the SECs complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of the defendants and relief defendants ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and financial penalties from the defendants., In addition to the SECs charges, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York today brought criminal charges against Laurence Brown concerning the same illegal activities alleged in the Commissions complaint., ]"

(AMD).Â  These exclusivity payments grew from 10 percent of Dellâs operating income in FY 2003 to 38 percent in FY 2006, and peaked at 76 percent in the first quarter of FY 2007.Â  The SEC alleges that Dell Inc., Michael Dell, Rollins, and Schneider failed to disclose the basis for the companyâs sharp drop in its operating results in its second quarter of fiscal 2007 as Intel cut its payments after Dell announced its intention to begin using AMD CPUs.Â  In dollar terms, the reduction in Intel exclusivity payments was equivalent to 75 percent of the decline in Dellâs operating income.Â  Michael Dell, Rollins, and Schneider had been warned in the past that Intel would cut its funding if Dell added AMD as a vendor.Â  Nevertheless, in Dellâs second quarter FY 2007 earnings call, they told investors that the sharp drop in the companyâs operating results was attributable to Dell pricing too aggressively in the face of slowing demand and to component costs declining less than expected.Â Â Â , The SECâs complaint further alleges that the reserve manipulations allowed Dell to materially misstate its earnings and its operating expenses as a percentage of revenue â an important financial metric that the Company itself highlighted â for over three years.Â  The manipulations also enabled Dell to misstate materially the trend and amount of operating income of its EMEA segment, an important business unit that Dell also highlighted, from the third quarter of FY 2003 through the first quarter of FY 2005., Without admitting or denying the SECâs allegations, Dell Inc. consented to the entry of an order that permanently restrains and enjoins it from violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13.Â  Dell Inc. also agreed to enhance its Disclosure Review Committee and disclosure processes, including the retention of an independent consultant to recommend improvements to those processes and enhance training regarding the disclosure requirements of the federal securities laws.Â , Michael Dell and Rollins consented to settle the SECâs disclosure charges, without admitting or denying the SECâs allegations, to the entry of an order that permanently restrains and enjoins each of them from violating Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act and from violating or aiding and abetting violations of other provisions of the federal securities laws.Â  Â , Schneider consented to settle the disclosure and accounting fraud charges against him without admitting or denying the SECâs allegations, and agreed to pay a penalty, disgorgement of $83,096, and prejudgment interest of $38,640.Â  Dunning and Jackson consented to settle the SECâs improper accounting charges without admitting or denying the SECâs allegations.Â  Dunning agreed to pay a penalty of $50,000.Â  In their settlement offers, Schneider, Dunning and Jackson consented to the issuance of administrative orders pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the Commissionâs Rules of Practice, suspending each of them from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an accountant with the right to apply for reinstatement after five years for Schneider and three years for Dunning and Jackson., The SECâs investigation is continuing as to other individuals., The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the Federal Trade Commission in this investigation., <b>See Also:</b> <a href=/litigation/complaints/2010/comp21599.pdf title=>SEC Complaint</a> ]"

This is the largest award paid by the SEC for information provided in connection with an insider trading case., The SEC staff previously investigated alleged insider trading in Microsoft Corp. securities by hedge fund adviser Pequot Capital Management, Inc., its chief executive, Arthur J. Samberg, and David E. Zilkha, a Microsoft employee who accepted an employment offer at Pequot, but closed its investigation without action. In late 2008, Karen Kaiser, the ex-wife of Zilkha, and her husband, Glen Kaiser, discovered key evidence that ultimately led to the filing of a settled enforcement action against Defendants Pequot and Samberg alleging they engaged in insider trading. Among other documents and information the Kaisers provided the SEC was a key email communication between Zilkha and another Microsoft employee that was not turned over to the SEC in the first investigation. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SECâs complaint, Pequot and Samberg consented to the entry of injunctions and orders requiring the payment of civil penalties totaling $10 million (as well as the payment of disgorgement and prejudgment interest totaling over $17 million and an investment advisory bar as to Samberg and censure as to Pequot)., The SEC approved the award earlier this week pursuant to Section 21A(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which authorized the Commission, in its discretion, to grant an award of up to 10% of the penalties paid in a case to a person who provided information leading to the imposition of those penalties, but only in insider trading cases. That provision has since been repealed by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which added new Section 21F to the Securities Exchange Act, authorizing the Commission to award bounties to parties who provide information leading to recovery of monetary sanctions in a broader range of cases, not limited as before to civil penalties recovered in insider trading cases., On the same day the Commission filed the settled complaint against Pequot and Samberg in the above matter, it also issued an order instituting administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings against Zilkha in connection with the conduct described above.

Oil for Food Program. GE Agrees to Pay Over $23.4 Million in Disgorgement, Interest, and Penalties</h2>]","[, The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed Foreign Corrupt Practices Act books and records and internal controls charges against General Electric Company (GE) and two GE subsidiaries â Ionics, Inc. (currently GE Ionics, Inc.) and Amersham plc (currently GE Healthcare Ltd.) â in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The General Electric Company, headquartered in Fairfield, Connecticut, participates in a wide variety of markets. The SEC alleges that two GE subsidiaries â along with two other subsidiaries of public companies that have since been acquired by GE â made $3.6 million in illegal kickback payments in the form of cash, computer equipment, medical supplies, and services to the Iraqi Health Ministry or the Iraqi Oil Ministry in order to obtain valuable contracts under the U.N. Oil for Food Program., According to the Commissions Complaint:, From approximately 2000 to 2003, two GE subsidiaries, Marquette-Hellige (Marquette) and OEC-Medical Systems (Europa) AG (OEC-Medical), made approximately $2.04 million in kickback payments in the form of computer equipment, medical supplies, and services to the Iraqi Health Ministry. Two other current GE subsidiaries, Ionics Italba S.r.L. (Ionics Italba), and Nycomed Imaging AS (Nycomed), made approximately $1.55 million in cash kickback payments under the Program prior to GEs acquisition of their parent companies. Nycomed was a subsidiary of publicly-registered Amersham plc, which was acquired by GE after the conduct at issue in the Complaint and is currently known as GE Healthcare Ltd. Ionics Italba was a subsidiary of publicly-registered Ionics, Inc., which was acquired by GE after the conduct at issue and is currently known as GE Ionics, Inc., Marquette, based in Germany, manufactures and sells cardiology monitoring equipment and has been a GE subsidiary since 1998. Marquette entered into three Program contracts in which it either paid or agreed to pay illegal kickbacks in the form of computer equipment, medical supplies, and services after declining to make the payments in cash. The contracts were for the supply of disposable electrodes, transducers, and fetal monitors to the Iraqi Health Ministry. The contracts generated a combined gross profit to Marquette of $8.8 million. In order to obtain two of the contracts, Marquettes Iraqi agent made in kind kickback payments of goods and services worth approximately $1.2 million to the Iraqi Health Ministry in violation of UN regulations. In order to obtain the third contract, the agent offered to make an additional in-kind kickback payment worth approximately $250,000. The illegal kickbacks were made or offered with the knowledge and approval of Marquette officials., OEC-Medical, based in Switzerland, manufactures and sells medical equipment. In 2000, OEC-Medical entered into a Program contract to provide C-Arms (C-shaped armatures used to support X ray equipment) to the Iraqi Ministry of Health. OEC made an in-kind kickback payment worth approximately $870,000 on the contract and earned a wrongful profit of $2.1 million. The OEC-Medical contract was negotiated by the same third party agent that handled the Marquette contracts. As was done with the Marquette contracts, the Iraqi agent agreed to make the payment on behalf of OEC-Medical in the form of computer equipment, medical supplies, and services, rather than cash. In order to conceal from UN inspectors the fact that the agents commission had been increased to cover an illegal kickback, OEC-Medical and the agent entered into a fictitious services provider agreement, purporting to identify services the agent would perform to justify his increased commission., During the Program, Nycomed was a subsidiary of Amersham plc, which GE acquired in 2004. Nycomeds violations occurred prior to the 2004 acquisition. At the time of the violations, however, Amersham plc was subject to the Commissions regulatory jurisdiction because it listed American Depository Receipts on the NYSE. GE acquired the liabilities of Amersham plc, along with the assets, in the 2004 acquisition., Between 2000 and 2002, Norway-based Nycomed entered into nine contracts involving the payment of cash ASSF kickbacks. The contracts were all direct agreements between Nycomed and the Iraqi Ministry of Health for the provision of Omnipaque and Omniscan. Omnipaque is an injectible contrast agent used in conjunction with X-rays; and Omniscan is a contrast agent used in conjunction with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Nycomed paid approximately $750,000 in kickbacks on the nine contracts and earned approximately $5 million in wrongful profits. The contracts were negotiated by Nycomeds Jordanian agent. The kickback payments were explicitly authorized by Nycomeds salesman in Cyprus. The Nycomed salesman increased the agents commission from 17.5% to 27.5% of the contract price, and artificially increased the UN contract prices by 10%, all to cover the cost of the kickbacks., During its involvement in the Program, Ionics Italba was a subsidiary of Ionics, Inc., which GE acquired in 2005. Ionics Italbas violations occurred prior to the acquisition. At the time of the violations, however, Ionics, Inc., was a publicly-listed company in the United States and was therefore subject to the Commissions regulatory jurisdiction. GE acquired Ionics liabilities, along with the assets, in the 2005 acquisition., Ionics Italba, based in Italy, manufactures and sells water purification equipment. Between 2000 and 2002, Ionics Italba paid $795,000 in kickbacks and earned $2.3 million in wrongful profits on five Program contracts to sell water treatment equipment to the Iraqi Oil Ministry. In the first of these contracts, the illegal kickback payment was concealed under a fictitious line item for modification and adaptation at site of obsolete spare parts. When UN inspectors requested additional detail about the line item, officials at Ionics Italba passed the inquiry along to the Iraqi Oil Ministry. The Ministrys proposed response, which described services neither party intended to be performed, was incorporated nearly verbatim in a letter that Ionics Italba provided to the UN. Four of the five contracts were negotiated with side letters documenting the commitment of Ionics Italba to make cash kickback payments. The side letters were concealed from UN inspectors in violation of a Program requirement to provide all contract documentation for inspection and UN approval. On the majority of the Ionics Italba contracts, invoices provided by the sales agent included fictitious activities to justify the agents inflated commission., GE; Ionics, Inc.; and Amersham plc failed to maintain adequate systems of internal controls to detect and prevent the payments; and the defendants accounting for these transactions failed properly to record the nature of the payments. GE; Ionics, Inc.; and Amersham plc, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and ordering GE to disgorge $18,397,949 in wrongful profits, pay $4,080,665 in pre-judgment interest, and pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000., The settlement with GE represents the Commissions fifteenth enforcement action brought in connection with the UN Oil for Food Program. In total, the SEC has recovered over $204 million in disgorgement of profits, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in Oil for Food-related cases., The Commission considered remedial acts promptly undertaken by GE and the cooperation the company afforded the Commission staff in its investigation.

Throughout the period in question, Citigroup represented that its sub-prime exposure in Citigroups investment banking unit, Citi Markets &amp; Banking, was $13 billion or less, when in fact, at all times during that period, the investment banks sub-prime exposure was over $50 billion., Citigroup, a global financial services company based in New York City, agreed to pay a $75 million penalty to settle the SECs charges., The SEC alleges that, beginning in July 2007, Citigroup made a series of statements in earnings calls and public filings in which it represented that its investment bank had approximately $13 billion of sub-prime exposure, and that the investment banks sub-prime exposure declined over the course of 2007. In fact, the $13 billion figure that Citigroup disclosed omitted two categories of sub-prime-backed assets, super senior tranches of collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and liquidity puts, through which Citigroup had approximately $43 billion of additional sub-prime exposure. Citigroup only disclosed the extent of its holdings of the super senior tranches of CDOs and the liquidity puts in November 2007, after a sharp decline in their value. According to the SECs complaint, the misleading disclosures were made at a time of heightened investor and analyst interest in public company exposure to sub-prime mortgages., According to the SECs complaint, as early as April 2007, Citigroups senior management began to gather information on the investment banks sub-prime exposure for purposes of possible public disclosure. From the outset of these efforts, internal documents describing the investment banks exposures included the super senior CDO tranches and the liquidity puts, while noting that they bore little risk of default. Nevertheless, on four occasions â a July 20, 2007 earnings call; a July 27, 2007 Fixed Income investors call; an October 1, 2007 earnings pre-announcement; and an October 15, 2007 earnings call â Citigroup stated that its investment banks sub-prime exposure was $13 billion or slightly less, and had been managed down from $24 billion at the end of 2006. The statements made in the October 1, 2007 earnings pre-announcement were included in a Form 8-K that Citigroup filed with the Commission. Citigroup did not disclose in any of these communications that it was excluding the amount of its sub-prime exposure from super senior tranches of CDOs or liquidity puts., Without admitting or denying the SECs allegations, Citigroup Inc. consented to the entry of a final judgment that (1) permanently restrains and enjoins it from violation of Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20 and 13a-11 and (2) orders it pay penalty and disgorgement of $75,000,001., Separately, the SEC also instituted settled cease-and-desist proceedings against Gary Crittenden, Citigroups former chief financial officer, and Arthur Tildesley, Jr., Citigroups former head of Investor Relations, for their roles in causing Citigroup to make certain of the misleading statements., <b>See Also:</b> <a href=/litigation/complaints/2010/comp21605.pdf title=>SEC Complaint</a> ]"

In February 2009, the SEC filed an emergency action and obtained an asset freeze against Greenwood and the other principal of WG Trading Company, Stephen Walsh, and their three affiliated entities, to halt a brazen investment fraud involving the misappropriation of as much as $554 million in investor assets., The SECs complaint alleges that, since at least 1996, Greenwood and Walsh promised investors that their money would be invested in a stock index arbitrage strategy. Instead, Greenwood and Walsh essentially treated their clients investments as their personal piggy bank to purchase multi-million dollar homes, a horse farm and horses, luxury cars, and rare collectibles such as Steiff teddy bears. The SECs complaint also named as defendants: WG Trading Company; WG Trading Investors, L.P., an unregistered investment vehicle; and Westridge Capital Management, Inc., a registered investment adviser of which Greenwood was also a principal., Greenwood agreed to settle the SECs charges by consenting to the entry of the judgment. The judgment provides for a permanent injunction against violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and violating or aiding and abetting violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.

Wyly and his brother, Charles J. Wyly, Jr. (hereinafter the Wylys), engaged in a 13-year fraudulent scheme to hold and trade tens of millions of securities of public companies while they were members of the boards of directors of those companies, without disclosing their ownership and their trading of those securities. According to the complaint, the Wylys scheme defrauded the investing public by materially misrepresenting the Wylys ownership and trading of the securities at issue while enabling the Wylys to realize hundreds of millions of dollars of undisclosed gain and other material benefits in violation of the federal securities laws governing the ownership and trading of securities by corporate insiders., The public companies involved in the Wylys scheme to defraud were, according to the complaint, Michaels Stores, Inc., Sterling Software, Inc., Sterling Commerce, Inc., and Scottish Annuity &amp; Life Holdings Ltd. (now known as Scottish Re Group Limited) (Scottish Re) (hereinafter collectively referred to as the Issuers). The complaint alleges that shares of the Issuers were traded on the New York Stock Exchange throughout the period of the Wylys scheme., According to the complaint, the apparatus of the fraud was an elaborate sham system of trusts and subsidiary companies located in the Isle of Man and the Cayman Islands (collectively hereinafter the Offshore System) created by and at the direction of the Wylys. The complaint alleges that the Offshore System enabled the Wylys to hide their ownership and control of the Issuers securities (hereinafter Issuer Securities) through trust agreements that purported to vest complete discretion and control in the offshore trustees. In actual fact and practice, according to the complaint, the Wylys never relinquished their control over the Issuer Securities and continued throughout the relevant time period to vote and trade these securities at their sole discretion., The complaint alleges that through their use of the Offshore System, the Wylys were able to sell without disclosing their beneficial ownership over $750 million worth of Issuer Securities, and to commit an insider trading violation resulting in unlawful gain of over $31.7 million. According to the complaint, the Wylys attorney and fellow director of three of the Issuers, Michael C. French (French), and their stockbroker, Louis J. Schaufele III (Schaufele), substantially assisted the Wylys fraudulent scheme, each reaping financial rewards for doing so. The complaint alleges that each also committed primary violations of the antifraud provisions of the securities laws., The complaint alleges that the Wylys and French knew or were reckless in not knowing their obligations under the federal securities laws as public company directors and greater-than-5% beneficial owners, to report their Issuer Securities holdings and trading on Schedules 13D and Forms 4, public documents filed with the Commission. According to the complaint, the Wylys and French also knew or were reckless in not knowing that the investing public routinely used such disclosures to, among other things, gauge the sentiment of public companies insiders and large shareholders about those companies financial condition and prospects, thereby relying on them in making investment decisions. The complaint alleges that despite their knowledge, the Wylys and French systematically and falsely created the impression that the Wylys holdings and trading of Issuer Securities were limited to the fraction that they held and traded domestically. By depriving existing shareholders and potential investors of information deemed material by the federal securities laws, according to the complaint, the Wylys were able to sell, in large-block trades alone, more than 14 million shares of Issuer securities over many years, realizing gains in excess of $550 million. The complaint further alleges that the sales generating most of these gains were made pursuant to materially false or misleading Commission filings., The complaint further alleges that the Wylys exploited their illegal non-disclosure of their offshore Issuer Securities to make a massive and bullish transaction in Sterling Software in October 1999 based upon the material and non-public information that they, the Chairman and Vice-chairman of Sterling Software, had jointly decided to sell the company. This transaction, according to the complaint, yielded ill-gotten gains of over $31.7 million when Sterling Softwares sale was ultimately announced to the public less than four months later., The complaint further alleges that throughout the course of their scheme, the Wylys, French and Schaufele engaged in fraud, deception and material misrepresentation to conceal their actions; and that these acts included: (i) the making of hundreds of false and materially misleading statements to the Issuers, the Issuers attorneys, investors, the Commission, and, in the case of Schaufele, to brokerage firm intermediaries, (ii) the establishment and operation of an offshore Wyly family office in the Cayman Islands as a conduit and repository for communications and records which should not be seen in the USA, and (iii) the allocation of the Wylys offshore holdings of Issuer Securities among different, and often newly created, offshore entities, all under the Wylys control, solely to avoid making required Commission filings., The complaint alleges that French utilized his roles as the Wylys lawyer and fellow director on three of the four Issuers boards to cover the Wylys scheme with a false cloak of legality that was essential both to its concealment and to its execution. The complaint further alleges that Frenchs assistance to the Wylys scheme continued during Frenchs tenure as Scottish Res Chairman, when the Wylys, who had left Scottish Res board, continued covertly to hold more than 5% of its outstanding stock. According to the complaint, French also established offshore entities of his own, which he used to control and to trade Issuer Securities without disclosing his own ownership or trading as required by law., The complaint alleges that for his part, Schaufele used his position as the Wylys stockbroker to conceal from and affirmatively misrepresent to his brokerage firm superiors the Wylys control over the Issuer Securities held in their Offshore System. Schaufele also directly committed an insider trading violation, according to the complaint, by trading in Sterling Software common stock through his wifes accounts based upon non-public material information he learned through his employment at Lehman Brothers, i.e. the Wylys intent to make a massive, bullish and undisclosed transaction in Sterling Software offshore., The complaint charges that all four defendants violated, and that French and Schaufele also aided and abetted the Wylys violations of, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint further charges the Wylys and French with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) as well as Exchange Act Sections 13(d), 14(a) and 16(a) and Rules 13d-1 13d-2, 14a-3, 14a-9, 16a-2 and 16a-3 thereunder. The complaint further charges the Wylys with violations of Securities Act Sections 5(a) and 5(c); and charges the Wylys and French with aiding and abetting (i) the Issuers violations of Exchange Act Sections 13(a) and 14(a) and Rules 13a-1, 14a-3 and 14a-9 thereunder and (ii) three of the Wylys offshore trustees violations of Exchange Act Section 13(d) and Rules 13d-1 and 13d-2 thereunder. Finally, the complaint charges French with aiding and abetting the Wylys violations of Exchange Act Sections 13(d), 14(a) and 16(a) and Rules 13d-1, 13d-2, 14a-3 and 14a-9 thereunder.

HARDEY IN FRAUDULENT ACCOUNTING SCHEME</h2>]","[, On July 29, 2010, the Honorable Martin L.C. Feldman, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Louisiana entered a final judgment of permanent injunction against defendant Matthew W. Hardey, a Louisiana resident and the former chief financial officer for Newpark Resources, Inc. (Newpark), an oil and gas company based in Houston, Texas. Hardey was charged in the complaint along with another Newpark principal and a third party vendor of Newpark with violations of the federal securities laws. The final judgment permanently enjoined Hardey from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13 and 13a-14 thereunder. The final judgment also required Hardey to pay a civil penalty of $75,000, and imposed a bar prohibiting him from serving as an officer or director of a public company. Hardey consented to the entry of the order without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions complaint., Â According to the Commissions Complaint, Hardey, a former Chief Financial Officer for Newpark, and L. Cyrus DeBlanc, a former Chief Financial Officer for Newpark subsidiary Soloco LLC, conspired with Quality Mat president Joe E. Penland to engage in a fraudulent accounting scheme that allowed Newpark in fiscal year 2003 to avoid writing off approximately $4.2 million in aging debt. As a result, Newpark reported approximately $500,000 of net income instead of a significant loss for that fiscal year. The Commissions Complaint alleged that, in 2002 and 2003, Newpark recognized $4.2 million in revenue based on sales of its primary product â industrial mats used to lay temporary roads at drilling sites â to Quality Mat and another vendor, Easy Frac. The Complaint alleged that neither vendor had made any payment on the sales through the end of 2003, and that Hardey, DeBlanc and Penland devised and executed a scheme to funnel money to Quality Mat and Easy Frac through sham transactions that would then allow the vendors to pay their debts to Newpark., According to the Complaint, one of the sham transactions took place in 2004 and involved Dura-Base Nevada, LLC and Dura-Base de Mexico, two Newpark subsidiaries created to begin mat rentals in Mexico. The Complaint asserted that Newpark purchased the entire initial inventory of mats for the Dura-Base business from Quality Mat, and that the decision to purchase the approximately 6,175 mats from Quality Mat was a pretext meant to give the appearance of a legitimate business transaction to Newparks repurchase, at the original sales price, of 1,500 mats sold to Quality Mat in 2002 and 600 mats sold to Easy Frac in 2003. The Complaint claimed that, in an attempt to perpetuate the pretext, Hardey also misled Newparks auditors about the basis for buying the Dura-Base inventory from Quality Mat by falsely claiming that Quality Mat had contractual rights in Mexico that Newpark would have to buy in order for the Dura-Base venture to go forward. According to the Complaint, this ruse was necessary to allow Newpark to buy back the mats at the original sales price without suffering any adverse accounting consequences. Under this scheme, Newpark could account for the repurchases as if they had taken place at Newparks manufacturing cost, but still pay Quality Mat the original purchase price for the mats by assigning the difference in value to the intangible asset allegedly created by the repurchase of Quality Mats contract rights., The Complaint alleged that the other sham transaction, which took place during 2004 and 2005, involved Quality Mat sending fictitious invoices to Newpark purportedly for bulk lumber sales. According to the Complaint, in early 2004, Penland agreed to convert Quality Mats outstanding debt from the 2002 sales to notes receivable. One of the notes required monthly payments of $52,409, which Quality Mat began making in March 2004. Between May 2004 and July 2005, the bulk lumber invoices, which were sent monthly, averaged $52,409, but there were no purchase orders or delivery tickets backing up the alleged sale. The Complaint alleged that Hardey, DeBlanc and Penland devised this scheme to provide Quality Mat with funds to continue making payments on this note, thus allowing Newpark to keep the debt on its books. Penland was permanently enjoined from further violations of the federal securities laws in a final judgment entered against him on October 2, 2009. That judgment also required that Penland pay a $70,000 civil penalty. DeBlanc was permanently enjoined from further violations of the federal securities laws in a final judgment entered against him on May 14, 2010. As with the final judgment against Hardey, the final judgment against DeBlanc also imposed an officer and director bar against him and required DeBlanc to pay a $75,000 civil penalty., See also: L.R. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21236.htm>21236</a> (October 5, 2009); L.R. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21137.htm>21137</a> (July 16, 2009)., ]"

While Froning represented to investors that offering proceeds would be used to fund operating expenses and growth of the financial planning company, he diverted the proceeds to a personal bank account and used them to pay for personal expenses such as cash withdrawals, purchases from internet retailers, adult entertainment, meals, and groceries. He also used investor funds to make Ponzi payments to some investors., The complaint alleges that, as a result of his misconduct, Froning violated the antifraud provisions of both the Securities and the Exchange Act. Pending court approval of the injunction, the court will also determine the amount of disgorgement and civil money penalties to be assessed against Froning. Finally, upon the courts entry of the injunction, the Commission will institute settled administrative proceedings against Froning. Froning has agreed to an administrative order barring him from future association with any broker, dealer, or investment adviser., The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Texas State Securities Board and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority in this matter., <b>See Also:</b> <a href=/litigation/complaints/2010/comp21610.pdf title=>SEC Complaint</a> ]"

The asset freeze order entered by the Court on October 7, 2009, freezing Chos assets continues., First filed on October 7, 2009, in an emergency TRO action, the Commissions complaint alleges that, since at least 2001, Cho engaged in a fraudulent scheme to misappropriate investors funds for his personal use and to repay other investors, raising at least $3.7 million from at least 45 investors in four states. The complaint alleges that Cho falsely represented to investors that he would pool their funds to invest in shares of specific well-known companies in anticipation of expected initial public offerings of those companies, including Centerpoint, AOL/Time Warner, Inc., Google, Inc., Facebook, Inc. and Rosetta Stone, Inc. The complaint alleges that, instead of purchasing these shares for investors, Cho used investor funds for personal trading, the personal expenses of himself and his family, and also operated a Ponzi scheme, using new investor funds to repay existing investors. The complaint alleges that throughout the scheme, Cho falsely told investors that he had worked at Goldman Sachs, still had an account there and made his investments through the firm, and/or that Goldman Sachs still considered him a preferred client. The complaint further alleges that Cho told some investors that additional funds would be needed to satisfy a U.S. tax liability in connection with their supposed purchase of Google and Rosetta Stone shares, when there was no tax liability and when the shares had not even been purchased for the investors., ]"

THOMAS P. FLANAGAN AND PATRICK T. FLANAGAN, Civil Action No. 10 CV 4885 (N.D. Ill., filed August 4, 2010)</h2>]","[, <p style= text-align: right;><b>CORRECTED</b>, The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a former Deloitte and Touche LLP partner and his son with insider trading in the securities of several of the firms audit clients., The SEC alleges that Thomas P. Flanagan of Chicago traded in the securities of Deloitte clients, often while serving as a liaison between those companies management teams and Deloittes audit engagement teams. In this role, Flanagan had access to advance earnings results and other nonpublic information from Deloittes audit engagements with Best Buy, Sears, and Walgreens as well as the firms consulting engagement with Motorola. Flanagan made trades in the securities of these and other companies while in possession of the confidential information, and also tipped his son Patrick T. Flanagan who then traded on the basis of the nonpublic information., The Flanagans agreed to pay more than $1.1 million to settle the SECs charges., According to the SECs complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court in Chicago, Thomas Flanagan worked at Deloitte for 38 years and rose to the position of Vice Chairman of Clients and Markets. The SEC alleges that Flanagan committed insider trading on nine occasions between 2005 and 2008 by trading in the securities of multiple Deloitte clients and a company acquired by Deloitte client Walgreens. Flanagan was in possession of nonpublic information about those clients that he learned through his duties as a Deloitte partner, including such material market-moving events as earnings results, earnings guidance, and acquisitions. Flanagans illegal trading resulted in profits of more than $430,000. On four occasions, Flanagan relayed the nonpublic information to his son, who traded based on that information for illegal profits of more than $57,000., In addition to the court-filed complaint alleging illegal insider trading, the SEC also instituted administrative proceedings against Thomas Flanagan, finding that he violated the SECs auditor independence rules on 71 occasions between 2003 and 2008 by trading in the securities of nine Deloitte audit clients. Accountants are not independent if they own or control securities in the clients that they audit. The SECs settled administrative order finds that while Thomas Flanagan owned or controlled client securities, Deloitte issued audit reports to the clients stating that the financial statements contained in the reports had been audited by an independent auditor. However, Deloitte was not independent due to Flanagans ownership and control of the audit clients securities. As a result, the SECs administrative order finds that Thomas Flanagan caused and willfully aided and abetted Deloittes violations of the SECs auditor independence rules under Regulation S-X. Flanagan also caused and willfully aided and abetted the clients violations of the reporting and proxy provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934., According to the SECs complaint, Thomas Flanagan concealed his trades in the securities of Deloittes clients and circumvented Deloittes independence controls. He failed to report the prohibited trades to Deloitte, lied to Deloitte about his compliance with its independence policies, and provided false information to Deloittes personal income tax preparers about the identity of the companies whose securities he traded., As a result of their conduct, the SECs complaint charged Thomas and Patrick Flanagan with violations of Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3. The SECs administrative action found that Thomas Flanagan caused and willfully aided and abetted Deloittes violations of Rule 2-02(b)(1) of Regulation S-X, and caused and willfully aided and abetted the clients violations of Sections 13(a) and 14(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 13a-1, 13a-13, and 14a-3 thereunder., Without admitting or denying the SECs allegations in the complaint and the findings in the administrative order, Thomas Flanagan consented to the entry of an order of permanent injunction, disgorgement with prejudgment interest of $557,158, a penalty of $493,884, and a denial of the privilege of appearing or practicing before the SEC as an accountant. Without admitting or denying the SECs allegations in the complaint, Patrick Flanagan consented to the entry of an order of permanent injunction, disgorgement with prejudgment interest of $65,614, and a penalty of $57,656., The SEC acknowledges the assistance of FINRA and the Options Regulatory Surveillance Authority in this investigation., <b>See Also:</b> <a href=/litigation/complaints/2010/comp21612.pdf title=>SEC Complaint</a> ]"

The SECs complaint names as defendants, boiler-room operators Joseph R. Porche, age 51, of Aliso Viejo, CA, and Larry R. Crowder, age 53, of Newport Coast, CA; and salesmen Konrad C. Kafarski, age 40, of Trabuco Canyon, CA, Carlton L. Williams, age 51, of Coto de Caza, CA, Gary K. Juncker, age 47, of Rancho Santa Margarita, CA, and Dale J. Engelhardt, age 46, of San Clemente, CA., The SECs complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana, alleges that between early 2008 to February 2009, Kensington Resources, Inc., through its principals, Porche and Crowder, and its salespeople, raised $11 million from approximately 200 investors nationwide selling unregistered shares of American Environmental Energy, Inc. (AEEI) common stock. The SECs complaint alleges that Porche, Crowder, and Kafarski falsely disclosed to investors that payments of sales commissions were limited to 10% of the funds raised, when, in reality, 25% of the funds raised were paid to salesmen and sales managers. The complaint further alleges that these defendants misrepresented how the funds raised would be used, telling investors that 80% of the funds raised would be used by AEEI to conduct its green energy business. In reality, most of the funds raised were kept by Porche and Crowder to fund their lavish lifestyles and only $315,000 of the $11 million raised went to AEEI., The SECs complaint alleges that all of the named defendants violated the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933. The complaint also alleges that Porche, Crowder, and Kafarski violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint further alleges that all of the named defendants violated the broker-dealer registration requirement of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act. Crowder also violated his previous bar from association with a broker or dealer in violation of Section 15(b)(6)(B)(i) of the Exchange Act. The SEC seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and penny stock bars against each of the defendants., Crowder and Engelhardt are repeat securities law offenders. In 1998, the SEC charged Crowder and Engelhardt with, among other things, violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws in connection with another offering fraud. Crowder and Engelhardt were enjoined from future violations of those provisions. Crowder was permanently barred from associating with any broker or dealer, and Engelhardt was suspended for one year from associating with any broker or dealer., <b>See Also:</b> <a href=/litigation/complaints/2010/comp21614.pdf title=>SEC Complaint</a> ]"

(RMC)</h2>]","[, The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a settled enforcement action on August 5, 2010, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, charging David P. Turner, a former Business Director at Innospec, Inc., and Ousama M. Naaman, Innospecâs agent in Iraq, with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) by paying bribes to numerous government officials to obtain and retain business., The SECâs complaint alleges that:, Turner and Naaman engaged in widespread bribery of Iraqi government officials to obtain contracts under the United Nations Oil for Food Program, and in order to continue selling Tetra Ethyl Lean (TEL) to Iraq after the Oil for Food Program ended. Turner also violated the FCPA by paying bribes to Indonesian officials to sell TEL to Indonesian state owned oil companies., From 2000 to 2008, Innospec, Inc., a manufacturer and distributor of fuel additives and specialty chemicals, routinely paid bribes to government officials in Iraq and Indonesia to sell TEL. The bribery activities in Iraq began with Innospecâs participation in the United Nations (âUNâ) Oil for Food Program in 2001, and extended all the way until at least 2008. Turner, the Business Director of Innospecâs TEL group, and Naaman, Innospecâs agent, both actively participated in the bribery and kickback schemes in Iraq. Innospec also paid bribes to government officials in Indonesia beginning as early as 2000, and continued until 2005, when Indonesiaâs need for TEL ended. Turner actively participated in the bribery scheme in Indonesia. In all, Innospec made illicit payments of over $6.3 million and promised an additional $2.8 million in illicit payments to Iraqi ministries and government officials as well as Indonesian government officials. The contracts that Innospec obtained in exchange for the bribes were worth approximately $176 million., Naaman paid kickbacks to Iraq on Innospecâs behalf so that Innospec could obtain five Oil-for-Food Program contracts for the sale of TEL to the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and its component oil refineries. Naaman aided Innospec in obtaining the Oil for Food contracts by paying kickbacks equaling 10 percent of the contract value on three of the contracts. When the Oil-for-Food Program ended shortly before Innospec was to pay promised kickbacks on the two remaining contracts, Innospec kept the promised payments as part of its profit. When Innospecâs internal auditors questioned Turner about the nature of the commission payments that were made to Naaman under the U.N. Oil for Food Program, Turner made false statements to the auditors and concealed the fact that the commission payments to Naaman included kickbacks to the Iraqi government in return for Oil for Food contracts., After the Oil for Food Program ended in late 2003, Turner and Naaman paid bribes to Iraqi officials in order to secure TEL business contracts from Iraq. Turner and senior officials at Innospec directed and approved the bribery payments. From at least 2004 through 2008, Innospec made payments totaling approximately $1,610,327 and promised an additional $884,480. In one e-mail, Naaman informed management, including Turner, that Iraqi officials were demanding a 2% kickback related to one TEL order. Naaman also stated: âWe are sharing most of our profits with Iraqi officials. Otherwise, our business will stop and we will lose the market. We have to change our strategy and do more compensation to get the rewards.â In his response to the e-mail, Turner confirmed that the requested kickback would be paid through an additional 2% âcommissionâ to Naaman., Turner and senior officials at Innospec also directed Naaman to pay a bribe of $155,000 to Iraqi officials to ensure the failure of a 2006 field trial test of MMT, a fuel product manufactured by a competitor of Innospec. Turner and other Innospec officials also authorized payments, through Naaman, to fund lavish trips for Iraqi officials, including the seven-day honeymoon of one official. Innospec officials and Turner also arranged for Naaman to pay thousands of dollars in cash to Iraqi officials for âpocket moneyâ on trips funded by Innospec., Turner and senior officials at Innospec authorized and directed the payment of bribes to Indonesian government officials to win contracts for Innospec. More than $2.8 million in bribes was funneled through an Indonesian agent. One scheme involved bribes paid annually to a senior official at BP Migas, another scheme involved âspecial commissionsâ paid to a Swiss account; and another involved a âone offâ payment of $300,000. On another occasion, a Managing Director of Innospec informed Turner that Innospec had provided payments to its Indonesian Agent to fund the purchase of a Mercedes for a Pertamina official., Without admitting or denying the SECâs allegations, Turner and Naaman have consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating Exchange Act Sections 30A and 13(b)(5) and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder, and from aiding and abetting Innospecâs violations of Exchange Act Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B), and as to Turner, from violating Rule 13b2-2. Turner will also disgorge $40,000. No civil penalty was imposed based on, among other things, Turnerâs extensive and ongoing cooperation in the investigation. Naaman will disgorge $810,076 plus prejudgment interest of $67,030, and pay a civil penalty of $438,038, which will be deemed satisfied by a criminal order requiring Naaman to pay a criminal fine that is at least equal to the civil penalty amount. After his extradition to the United States, Naaman cooperated., The SEC appreciates the assistance of the DOJâs Fraud Section, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the United Kingdom Serious Fraud Office in this matter., <b>See Also:</b> <a href=/litigation/complaints/2010/comp21615.pdf title=>SEC Complaint</a> ]"

Ustian (Ustian), former CFO Robert C. Lannert (Lannert), Thomas M. Akers, Jr. (Akers), James W. McIntosh (McIntosh), James J. Stanaway (Stanaway), Ernest A. Stinsa (Stinsa) and Michael J. Schultz (Schultz). Each Respondent consented to the issuance of the Order without admitting or denying the Commissions findings as part of a global settlement., The Order finds that at times from 2001 through 2005, Navistar overstated its pre-tax income by a total of approximately $137 million as the result of various instances of misconduct. Fraud by certain individuals at a Wisconsin foundry and in connection with certain vendor rebates and vendor tooling transactions accounted for approximately $58 million of that total. The remaining approximately $79 million resulted from improper accounting for certain warranty reserves and deferred expenses., More specifically, the Order finds, among other things, that:, Navistar had numerous deficiencies throughout its system of internal controls during the relevant period, including fifteen material weaknesses during 2005-06 that were attributable, in part, to the Companys failure to dedicate sufficient resources to those controls., From 2001 through 2004, Navistar improperly booked as many as 30 vendor rebates and related receivables from its suppliers. While these rebates and receivables took different forms â including volume-based rebates and so-called signing bonuses for Navistars award of new business â all were improperly booked as income in their entirety upfront, even though, in whole or in part, they were earned in future periods. The Companys eventual restatement of these rebates and receivables totaled $9.7 million of pre-tax income in 2004, which represented 27.7 percent of that years restated loss before income taxes., In 2003, Navistar improperly accounted for certain tooling buyback agreements by recapturing and booking as income the previously-paid amortization on those agreements and then improperly deferring the related depreciation costs. The Company continued to utilize this improper accounting treatment in 2004 to record 60 days of amortization from the buyback agreements as income, despite employees warnings that doing so would be inconsistent with the outside auditors guidance., From 2001 to 2005, Schultz, the Waukesha, Wisconsin plant controller, engaged in various fraudulent accounting practices that collectively caused income during that period to be overstated by a total of approximately $38 million., Beginning in fiscal year 1999, Navistar inappropriately included various below-the-line items in the Companys warranty reserve calculation, which caused the warranty reserve expense to be understated by $17 million in fiscal year 2002 and by $18.5 million in fiscal year 2003. The $18.5 million total represented 5.9 percent of the restated loss before income tax for that year., Navistar, through its senior accounting staff, deferred certain start-up costs from the fourth quarter of 2001 through the fourth quarter of 2002 that were not in compliance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Specifically, the Company deferred $4.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2001, $12.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2002, and $13.3 million in each of the second and third quarters of fiscal year 2002., Navistar, from the first quarter of fiscal year 2004 through the third quarter of 2005, failed to report its Parts group as a segment in its publicly-filed financial statements and notes, and instead allocated the Parts groups results between its Truck and Engine divisions results. This resulted in investors not being able to view the Parts group in the same manner as senior management and the Board. The Companys Forms 10-K for at least fiscal year 2004 and Forms 10-Q for 2004 and the first three quarters of 2005 failed to provide complete segment information required by GAAP and Commission rules., Based on the above, the Order directs Navistar to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder and Ustian, Navistars CEO, and Lannert, Navistars former CFO, to cease and desist from causing any violations and any future violations of Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act., Ustian and Lannert also agreed to comply with the forfeiture provisions of Section 304(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Ustian consented to tender to the Company shares of Navistar common stock currently owned by Ustian in the amount of $1,320,000 and Lannert consented to pay $1,049,503 to the Company. Those dollar amounts reflect monetary bonuses that each received during the restatement period., Additionally, the Order directs McIntosh to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder and from causing any violations and any future violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act; Akers, Schultz and Stanaway to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder and from causing any violations and any future violations of Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act; and Stinsa to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1 and from causing any violations and any future violations of Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act., The Commission filed a parallel civil action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against Akers, McIntosh, Stanaway, Stinsa and Schultz, in which each consented to pay civil penalties as follows: Akers â $100,000; McIntosh â $150,000; Stanaway â $50,000; and Stinsa â $25,000. A civil penalty was not imposed against Schultz because of a demonstrated inability to pay. These individuals consented to the filing of this complaint without admitting or denying its allegations., Additionally, on August 5, 2010, the Commission issued a separate settled order concerning Navistars former Controller, Mark T. Schwetschenau. The Order directs Schwetschenau to cease and desist from causing any violations and any future violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act. The Order also denies him the privilege of appearing or practicing before the Commission with the right to request reinstatement after one year pursuant to Section 102(e)(1)(ii) of the Commissions Rules of Practice., The Commission filed a parallel civil action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against Schwetschenau in which he consented to pay $37,500 in civil penalties.

The SEC also charged Alliance One with paying bribes in Kyrgyzstan and making improper payments in China, Greece, and Indonesia and Universal with making improper payments in Malawi and Mozambique. Moreover, the SECs complaints alleged Universal and Alliance One engaged in books and records and internal control violations., According to the SECs complaint, between 2000 and 2004, Universal, in coordination with two of its competitors, Dimon, Inc. (Dimon) and Standard Commercial Corporation (Standard), paid approximately $800,000 to bribe officials of the government-owned Thailand Tobacco Monopoly (TTM) in exchange for securing approximately $11.5 million in sales contracts for its subsidiaries in Brazil and Europe. From 2004 through 2007, Universal also made a series of payments in excess of $165,000 to government officials in Mozambique through corporate subsidiaries in Belgium and Africa. Universal made these payments, among other things, to secure an exclusive right to purchase tobacco from regional growers and to procure legislation beneficial to the companys business. Between 2002 and 2003, Universal subsidiaries paid a total of $850,000 to high-ranking Malawian government officials. Universal did not accurately record these payments in its books and records., From 2000 to 2004, in a coordinated bribery scheme with Universal, Dimon and Standard paid bribes of more than $1.2 million to government officials of the TTM in order to obtain more than $18.3 million in sales contracts. (In May 2005, Dimon and Standard merged to form Alliance One). Dimon characterized the payment of bribes to TTM officials as commissions paid to Dimons agent in Thailand. Similarly, Standard personnel authorized improper payments to TTM officials and failed to record those payments accurately in Standards books and records., The SECs complaint also alleges that, from 1996 through 2004, Dimon International Kyrgyzstan (DIK), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dimon, paid more than $3 million in bribes to Kyrgyzstan government officials to purchase Kyrgyz tobacco for resale to Dimons customers.

Michigan, filed August 4, 2010)</h2>]","[, The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced fraud charges and an asset freeze against CJs Financial (CJF) and Candice Campbell (Campbell), a resident of Canton, Michigan. At the SECs request for emergency relief, the Hon. Stephen J. Murphy, III, United States District Court, Eastern District of Michigan, issued a temporary restraining order against Campbell and CJF and an order freezing all assets under the control of Campbell and CJF, in addition to granting other emergency relief., The SECs complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, alleges that from approximately May 2009 through June 2010, Campbell and CJF obtained approximately $1,057,400 from more than 60 investors, for a supposedly guaranteed trading program, but invested less than 10% of the proceeds. Campbell solicited funds in person and through a website, cjsfinancial.com., As recently as of July 9, 2010, CJF portrayed itself on its website as an independent investment firm dedicated to putting your money to work for you! The complaint alleges that Campbell told investors that she was a day trader who would invest their funds in the stock market. The complaint further alleges that CJF and Campbell specifically informed potential investors, among other things, that their initial investment will NEVER go down in value; that CJF guaranteed [a]t least a 10% return monthly on your investment; and that there will be NO PENALTIES OR TAXES to pay when you withdraw your money, because CJs Financial pays your Capital Gains taxes!, According to the complaint, Campbells representations to investors regarding her use of investor funds and trading profits were all false. Specifically, the complaint alleges that Campbell invested only a small portion of the investor funds that she raised. Instead, Campbell used at least $540,000 of investor funds to pay personal expenses, including approximately $127,000 for travel expenses, more than $100,000 to car dealerships, approximately $33,046 at several jewelry retailers, approximately $28,350 at sporting goods retailers, and approximately $29,124 at furniture stores. Campbell used approximately $376,640 to pay other investors in Ponzi scheme fashion. Out of approximately $1,057,400 raised by Campbell, only $58,000 was transferred into a trading account., The complaint further alleges that when some investors requested the return of their investments, Campbell, through an assistant, tried to conceal the scheme by claiming the SEC was investigating her and CJF and had frozen its assets and bank accounts. As alleged in the SECs complaint, this was simply false, as the Commission had not frozen CJFs or Campbells bank accounts, trading accounts, or other assets. Instead, the complaint alleges this was a lie meant to conceal the fact that the defendants could not return investors funds., According to the SEC complaint, Campbell and CJF violated Section 17(a)(1), 17(a)(2), and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940., The SECs investigation of this matter is continuing., The SEC acknowledges and appreciates the assistance provided by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority in this matter., <b>See Also:</b> <a href=/litigation/complaints/2010/comp21619.pdf title=>SEC Complaint</a> ]"

Riner, of San Marcos, Texas, and Southwest Income Marketing, Inc. (SIMI), Riners business. The final judgment: (1) enjoined Riner and SIMI from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Rules 10b-5 and 10b-10 promulgated thereunder, and enjoined Riner from aiding and abetting violations of Rule 10b-10 of the Exchange Act; (2) ordered Riner and SIMI to pay disgorgement in the amount of $2,784,293.38, plus prejudgment interest of $1,155,871.72 for a total of $3,940,165.10; and (3) ordered Riner to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $120,000., The SECs complaint in this matter charges that Michael E. Kelly and 25 other defendants, including Riner and SIMI, participated in a massive fraud on U.S. investors that involved the offer and sale of securities in the form of Universal Leases. Universal Lease investments were structured as timeshares in several hotels in Cancun, Mexico, coupled with a pre-arranged rental agreement that promised investors a high, fixed rate of return. The SECs complaint alleges that from 1999 until 2005, Kelly and others, including Riner and SIMI, raised at least $428 million through the Universal Lease scheme from investors throughout the United States, with more than $136 million of the funds invested coming from IRA accounts. The SEC further alleges that a nationwide network of unregistered salespeople who sold the Universal Leases, including Riner and SIMI, collected undisclosed commissions totaling more than $72 million. The SEC also alleges that Kelly and others ran the scheme from Cancun, Mexico, through a number of foreign entities in Mexico and Panama. According to the SECs complaint, Kelly and others told investors that Universal Leases would generate guaranteed income through the leasing of investor timeshares by a large, independent leasing agent. In fact, the complaint alleges, the leasing agent was a small Panamanian travel agency controlled by Kelly, and for most of the scheme its payments to investors came from accounts funded by money raised from new investors. Further, the complaint alleges that Kelly and the other defendants, including Riner and SIMI, failed to disclose key facts about the Universal Lease investment, including the risks of the investment and that Kelly was paying commissions as high as 27% to the selling brokers. The SECs action against the remaining defendants is pending., For further information, see Litigation Release Nos. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20267.htm>20267</a> (Sept. 5, 2007), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20573.htm>20573</a> (May 14, 2008), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20578.htm>20578</a> (May 15, 2008), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20579.htm>20579</a> (May 15, 2008), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20664.htm>20664</a> (July 31, 2008), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20679.htm>20679</a> (August 12, 2008), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20708.htm>20708</a> (Sept. 9, 2008); <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20709.htm>20709</a> (Sept. 9, 2008), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20799.htm>20799</a> (November 6, 2008), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21003.htm>21003</a> (April 15, 2009), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2010/lr21481.htm>21481</a> (April 8, 2010) and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2010/lr21583.htm>21583</a> (June 29, 2010); [<i>SEC v.

The final judgment enjoins Genet from violating the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay more than $2 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest and penalties, and bars him from participating in a penny stock offering for a period of five years., The Commissions complaint, filed in September 2009, alleges that Genet played a crucial role in the illegal pump and dump and market manipulation of China Energys common stock. According to the Complaint, as part of the manipulation, Genet: (i) helped China Energy falsely obtain a listing on the Nasdaq NMS by helping China Energy to give away shares to hundreds of persons, and thereby creating the false and misleading impression that China Energy had a bona fide and active shareholder base; (ii) engaged in unregistered distributions of securities; and (iii) entered into secret arrangements to give away China Energy stock to persons who agreed to purchase China Energy stock in the open market, thereby creating the false and misleading impression that there was active trading and investor interest in China Energy. In payment for his fraudulent activities, Genet received thousands of shares of China Energy stock, which he later sold into the artificially inflated market, realizing illicit profits in excess of $1.7 million., The Final Judgment, to which Genet consented without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, permanently enjoins Genet from future violations of Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Â The agency also separately settled charges against the company and began administrative proceedings against the companyâs outside auditors for professional misconduct. Â , The SEC alleges that Karl Redekopp, the former CFO of International Commercial Television Inc. (ICTV), turned millions of dollars of quarterly losses into profits by falsely accounting for ICTVs sales of the Derma Wand, a skin care appliance that purports to reduce wrinkles and improve skin appearance. Redekopp fraudulently recognized revenue before the Home Shopping Network had actually sold or delivered the product to viewers. He also improperly recognized revenue before a free trial period offered by the company had expired, and failed to reverse revenue from products that had been returned. Redekopps misconduct caused the company to falsely report millions of dollars in excess revenue in 2007 and 2008., The SECs complaint against Redekopp, filed in federal district court in Tacoma, Wash., alleges that Redekopp recorded sales of products that had not been shipped or that the customer was not obligated to pay for. Redekopps fraudulent accounting resulted in ICTV adjusting net sales by more than $3.7 million over a five-quarter period in 2007 and 2008, negating all originally reported net income for those periods to restated net losses. For example, for year-end 2007 alone, ICTV restated its originally reported net income of $1.5 million to a net loss of $1.1 million after correcting the fraudulent reporting., The SECs complaint charges Redekopp, who lives in Vancouver, B.C., with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, and 13b2-1 thereunder, and aiding and abetting the violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, a financial penalty, and an order barring him from serving as an officer or director of a public company., In a separate complaint, the SEC charged ICTV for its misleading financial statements. Without admitting or denying the allegations, ICTV agreed to settle the charges by consenting to a final judgment permanently enjoining the company from future violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder., <b>See Also:</b>      SEC Complaints v. <a href=/litigation/complaints/2010/comp21622-ictv.pdf title=>International Commercial Television</a> and <a href=/litigation/complaints/2010/comp21622-redekopp.pdf title=>Karl Redekopp</a> ]"

Huber, pled guilty to one count of mail fraud, one count of money laundering and one count of engaging in prohibited monetary transactions in a case being prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney for the Central District of Illinois. Also on August 10, 2010, the U.S Attorneys Office filed a criminal Information against Huber charging that he defrauded investors by operating a Ponzi-type scheme in which he used money invested by clients to make payment to other investors. The Information also charges Huber with defrauding investors by grossly inflating the amount of money he managed and the amounts of investors returns. The Information further charges that Huber used investor funds to support his lavish lifestyle, including paying mortgage payments and remodeling expenses for residences in California and Florida and his personal life insurance premiums. Huber is scheduled for sentencing in front of U.S. District Court Judge Joe Billy McDade on December 10, 2010., The Commission previously filed a civil injunctive action against Huber in the Northern District of Illinois based on similar conduct on September 29, 2009. The Commissions complaint alleged that Huber, operating through his investment firm Hubadex, Inc., made Ponzi-like payments to investors by using newer investor funds to make redemption payments at inflated amounts. The complaint also alleged that Huber significantly inflated the fees that he was entitled to receive based on the outsized investment returns that he reported to investors. According to the SECs complaint, Huber diverted over $1.9 million in investor funds into his and his wifes bank accounts and used investor funds to pay other lavish personal expenses. The SEC further alleged that on December 17, 2008, one week after Bernard Madoff was arrested for perpetrating a massive Ponzi scheme, Huber sent an e-mail message to investors reassuring them that he managed his funds honestly and that his funds bore no resemblance to Madoffs scheme. According to the complaint, Huber made a series of additional misrepresentations to investors, including, overstating the amount of assets under management and inflating investor returns. Huber also lied to SEC staff members during their investigation of his activities, reporting false account balances and claiming he had made hedge fund investments that did not exist., On September 29, 2009, the Commission obtained an order pursuant to Hubers consent, permanently enjoining him from further violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and freezing his assets.

Ginder (Ginder) and two related oil and gas companies, Northamerican Energy Group, Inc. (NEG) and Northamerican Energy Group Corp. (NEGC). The complaint alleges that from February 2008 to May 2010, trhe defendants fraudulently raised approximately $3.5 million from over 50 investors nationwide through unregistered oil and gas limited partnership offerings. Investors were solicited through television advertisements touting annual returns as high as 40% from low risk producing wells. The estimated returns were purportedly based upon historical oil and gas data. In fact, the complaint alleges that historical oil and gas production from the leases in the first two partnership offerings was very poor, and many of the wells had no recent production history., In connection with the first, and largest offering that raised in excess of $2.4 million, investors were told that funds would be used only for partnership purposes, specifically to purchase leases and renovate existing wells to further enhance monthly production. Contrary to these representations, the complaint alleges that $800,000 of investor funds were utilized to purchase leases from a private company Ginder controlled for an undisclosed profit of approximately $700,000 in cash plus an additional ten partnership units worth $60,000 per unit â in essence an undisclosed profit of $1.3 million. Further, without the partners approval, it is alleged that Ginder withdrew $300,000 from the partnerships operating account to make an unsecured and non-interest bearing loan to a penny stock company operated by a personal friend and in which Ginder owned stock. The general partner has also borrowed over $478,000 from the partnership. None of these funds were repaid to the partnership. Ginder also paid at least $210,000 of investor funds for the television advertising campaign that generated investor leads.. None of the above expenditures, which total approximately 70% of the offering proceeds, were approved by investors., In connection with another offering that raised approximately $900,000, it is alleged that the defendants made material misstatements and omissions concerning the identity of the general partner, and the defendants prior oil and gas activities., The complaint alleges that the defendants violated the registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 and the anti-fraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Instead of following Zolteks internal controls which required the CEO to approve all wire transfers, the complaint alleges that Schott instructed the controller of Zolteks foreign subsidiary in Hungary on two occasions and instructed him to wire the payments to the financing consultant from the subsidiarys account. According to the complaint, Schott told the Hungarian controller that the payments were for another purpose. Schott then further concealed the payments by creating a false document which he gave to Zolteks CEO. By mischaracterizing the payments to the consultant, Schott caused Zoltek to make false entries into its books and records.

Kevin Castel of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, entered final judgments against James E. Gansman and Donna B. Murdoch in <i>SEC v. Gansman et al.,</i> 08-CV-4918, an insider trading case the Commission filed on May 29, 2008.Â  The Commission charged Gansman, who was an attorney and partner in the Transaction Advisory Services group at Ernst &amp; Young, with having tipped Murdoch, who was a stockbroker and close friend of Gansman, concerning the identities of at least seven different acquisition targets of Ernst &amp; Young valuation services clients. The complaint further alleged that two of the seven acquisitions were tender offers; that Murdoch used Gansmanâs tips to trade in the securities of all seven of the acquisition targets; and that Murdoch also tipped her father, Gerald Brodsky, concerning one of the acquisitions and recommended trading in two of the acquisition targets to two other persons; and, finally, that all three persons then traded on Murdochâs communications., To settle the Commissionâs charges, Gansman and Murdoch each consented, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissionâs complaint, to a separate final judgment that permanently enjoins each, respectively, from violating Exchange Act Sections 10(b) and 14(e) and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder.Â  The final judgment to which Gansman consented further orders him to pay disgorgement of $233,385 together with $16,470 in prejudgment interest thereon, and $145 in post-judgment interest, but allows him one year from the entry of the final judgment to satisfy this payment obligationâwith $200,000 due within ten days, and the remainder due within one year, of the entry of the final judgment.Â  The final judgment to which Murdoch consented further orders that she is liable for disgorgement of $339,110 together with $64,943.52 in prejudgment interest thereon, but, based on her demonstrated inability to pay, waives payment of disgorgement and prejudgment interest and does not impose a civil penalty. Â Because a default judgment was previously entered against the sole other defendant in the Commissionâs case, Gerald Brodsky, the settlements announced today conclude this litigation.Â  Additionally, Gansman and Murdoch each consented, in related administrative proceedings, to the entry of a Commission order that, in the case of Gansman, suspends him from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an attorney, and in the case of Murdoch, bars her from association with any broker or dealer.Â , Gansman and Murdoch were also each prosecuted criminally by the United States Attorneyâs Office for the Southern District of New York.Â  In that parallel criminal prosecution, Gansman was convicted by a jury on May 15, 2009, following a two-week trial, on six felony counts of having tipped Murdoch; he was sentenced in February 25, 2010 to a year-and-a-day in prison, six months probation, and a $600 special assessment, and is currently incarcerated.Â  For her part, Murdoch pled guilty to seventeen counts of a superseding information on December 23, 2008âincluding fifteen counts of securities fraud, one count of false statements, and one count of obstructing the Commissionâs investigationâand is awaiting sentencing., The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (âFINRAâ), and the Options Regulatory Surveillance Authority (âORSAâ) in this matter.Â  The Commissionâs investigation of this matter is continuing., See also Litigation Rel.

Kennelly of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois issued under seal a temporary restraining order and asset freeze against Juan Jose Fernandez Garcia (Garcia) and Luis Martin Caro Sanchez (Sanchez), both residents of Madrid, Spain. The emergency court order obtained late Friday by the SEC and unsealed by the Court today freezes approximately $1.1 million in assets and, among other things, grants expedited discovery and prohibits Garcia and Sanchez from destroying evidence.Â , The Commissionâs complaint alleges that Garcia and Sanchez engaged in insider trading in call options contracts of Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan, Inc. (Potash) just prior to an August 17, 2010 public announcement by Potash that it had received and rejected an unsolicited proposal from BHP Billiton Plc (BHP) to acquire Potashâs stock for $130 per share. In the complaint, the Commission alleges that on Tuesday, August 17, it was publicly announced that BHP had made an unsolicited $38.6 billion offer to purchase all of the stock of Potash for $130 per share in cash. The acquisition share price represented a 16% premium above Potashâs closing price of $112.15 on Monday, August 16. The complaint alleges that Garcia, the Head of European Equity Derivatives Research at Banco Santander, S.A., a Spanish banking group advising BHP on its bid, was in possession of material, nonpublic information regarding BHPâs offer to acquire Potash while he purchased, from August 12 to 16, 2010, approximately 282 call option contracts for Potash stock, the majority of which were scheduled to expire on August 21, 2010.

The complaint further alleges that Sanchezâs contracts were set to expire within weeks of the purchase date. The Commission alleges that neither individual had previously traded this year in Potash securities through his account at Interactive Brokers.<br/><br/>The complaint charges each of the defendants with violations of Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder.

Rosenbaum of the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota sentenced Trevor Cook to 25 years in prison and ordered to pay $158 million in restitution on one count of mail fraud and one count of tax evasion for his role in a $190 million foreign currency trading scheme that defrauded approximately 1,000 investors. Cook was charged on March 30, 2010, and pleaded guilty on April 13, 2010., Cook is one of the defendants in a pending civil injunctive action filed by the SEC on November 23, 2009 in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota. The SECs action against Cook arises out of the same facts that are the subject of the criminal case. The SECs complaint alleges that from at least July 2006 through at least July 2009, Cook and co-defendant Patrick J. Kiley of Minneapolis, Minnesota, raised $190 million from 1,000 investors through the unregistered sale of investments in a purported foreign currency trading venture. According to the SECs complaint, Cook and Kiley pooled investors funds in bank and trading accounts in the names of entities they controlled. The SECs complaint alleges that the foreign currency trading they did conduct resulted in millions of dollars in losses, and they misused approximately one half of the investor funds raised to make Ponzi-like payments to earlier investors and pay for, among other things, Cooks gambling losses and the purchase of the historic Van Dusen Mansion in Minneapolis. The SECs complaint charges Cook and Kiley with violating Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission also filed an action on November 23, 2009, against Cook, Kiley and others for their roles in the scheme., On November 23, 2009, the Court entered a preliminary injunction order against Cook and froze all of his assets. On January 25, 2010, the Court found Cook in civil contempt of the asset freeze order for failing to surrender more than $35 million in assets and ordered Cook jailed until he is in compliance with the Courts orders.

(Dell) Chief Accounting Officer Robert W. Davis for his role in the companys accounting fraud. Last month, the SEC charged Dell with fraud for materially misstating its operating results from fiscal year 2002 to fiscal year 2005. The SECs complaint against Davis alleges that he materially misrepresented Dells financial results by using various cookie jar reserves to cover shortfalls in operating results and engaged in other reserve manipulations from FY2002 to FY2005. Davis agreed to pay a $175,000 penalty and to pay disgorgement and pre-judgment interest to settle the SECs charges., The SEC separately charged today former Dell Assistant Controller Randall D. Imhoff with aiding and abetting Dells improper accounting. Imhoff agreed to pay a $25,000 penalty and to pay disgorgement and pre-judgment interest to settle the SECs charges. The SECs complaint against Davis, filed in federal district court in Washington, D.C., alleges that he directed the use of cookie jar reserves to cover shortfalls in operating results over three years. This fraudulent accounting made it appear that Dell was consistently meeting Wall Street earnings targets through the companys management and operations. The SECs complaint further alleges that the reserve manipulations allowed Dell to materially misstate its operating expenses as a percentage of revenue - an important financial metric that Dell highlighted to investors. The manipulations also enabled Dell to materially misstate the operating income of its Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) segment., The SECs complaint alleges that Davis directed that Dell maintain cookie jar reserves - which he referred to as contingencies - to cover future liabilities. The SEC alleges that an example of this misconduct related to Dells use of excess tax reserves identified in its Japanese business unit. The complaint alleges that Dell identified an excess tax reserve in Dell Japan in the fourth quarter of FY2003. Rather than releasing the entire excess to its income statement, as required by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), Dell transferred the bulk of the excess to a cookie jar reserve account in its corporate division that Davis tracked. Two quarters later, Dell released this excess to offset the income statement impact to Dell from a litigation settlement and otherwise provide a boost to Dells operating results. In another example, the SECs complaint alleges that Davis improperly manipulated Dells bonus and profit sharing accounts by bleeding down the amounts of excess accruals over time, rather than recording the entire excess in its income statement when it was first identified as required by GAAP., In a separate complaint also filed in federal district court in Washington, D.C., the SEC alleges that Imhoff aided and abetted Dells improper use of cookie jar reserves and other reserve manipulations to cover shortfalls in Dells operating results from FY2002 to FY2004. The SECs complaint alleges that Imhoff, acting under his supervisors general direction, planned and issued instructions regarding Dells build-up and use of cookie jar reserves. In an example of his involvement in Dells other improper reserve manipulations, the SECs complaint alleges that Imhoff failed to ensure that Dell increased its reserves, as required by GAAP, after learning that an accrual to cover the costs of closing a Dell facility in Texas was inadequate., Without admitting or denying the SECs allegations, Davis consented to the entry of an order that permanently restrains and enjoins him from violation of Section 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Rules 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder, and from aiding and abetting violations of Exchange Act Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13. Davis also agreed to pay a penalty of $175,000, disgorgement of $19,080, and prejudgment interest of $9,078. In his settlement offer, Davis also consented to the issuance of an administrative order pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the Commissions Rules of Practice, suspending him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an accountant, with the right to apply for reinstatement after five years., Without admitting or denying the SECs allegations, Imhoff consented to the entry of an order that permanently restrains and enjoins him from violation of Exchange Act Section 13(b)(5) and Rules 13b2-1 and 13b2-2, and from aiding and abetting violations of Exchange Act Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13.

Goldfield (Goldfield), a former hedge fund manager, for engaging in unlawful insider trading in advance of the April 23, 2007 announcement that AstraZeneca would acquire MedImmune, Inc. (MEDI). The Commissions complaint alleges that Self tipped Goldfield, a friend and former business school classmate, with material nonpublic information regarding the MEDI acquisition and that Goldfield unlawfully purchased 17,000 MEDI call options and 255,000 shares of MEDI stock while in possession of the material nonpublic information provided to him by Self. Goldfield realized actual profits of approximately $14 million from his unlawful trading., The Commissions complaint further alleges that Self had been assigned to the Companys team that was tasked with evaluating a potential acquisition of MEDI, and learned nonpublic information about the potential MEDI acquisition. The Complaint alleges that Self knew that he owed a duty to the Company to maintain the confidence of all nonpublic information he learned during the course of his employment and to abstain from disclosing any such information to others., The Complaint alleges that during a meeting with Goldfield on or about March 12 or 13, 2007, Self, in violation of his duty to the Company, told Goldfield that he had been assigned to work on the potential MEDI acquisition and showed Goldfield a confidential deal sheet, which described MEDI and the procedure and planned timing for the subsequent confidential auction process. The Complaint further alleges that, following this meeting, Self continued to provide nonpublic information to Goldfield on the status of the potential acquisition. From March 15, 2007 continuing through April 20, 2007, Goldfield traded while in possession of the material nonpublic information that Self provided to him. Goldfield closed out his MEDI position entirely within the four business days immediately following the April 23, 2007 announcement about the acquisition, and realized $13,978,752 in profits from his unlawful trading.

(Lucent), arising out her role in an accounting fraud action that the Commission previously filed against Lucent and ten individuals. Aversano was the remaining defendant in this action. The Commission alleged that Aversano entered into side agreements with certain of Lucents distributors that granted the distributors rights and privileges beyond those contained in their respective distribution agreements. Those side agreements made it improper for Lucent to recognize revenue, and caused Lucent to materially overstate its pre-tax income for fiscal year 2000., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions Amended Complaint, Aversano consented to the entry of the order, which permanently enjoins her from aiding and abetting violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws, and from violating, or aiding and abetting the violation of, the books and records, internal controls, and reporting provisions of the federal securities laws.

Sachdeva used the embezzled funds to finance an extravagant lifestyle, including lavish spending sprees at department stores, designer boutiques, jewelry stores, and other high-end retailers. Sachdeva and Mulvaney - Kosss senior accountant - concealed and facilitated the theft from Koss by preparing materially false accounting records. Mulvaney, working in concert with Sachdeva, prepared false journal entries to disguise Sachdevas misappropriation of funds. Sachdeva and Mulvaney attempted to hide the embezzlement on Kosss balance sheet and income statement by overstating assets, expenses, and cost of sales, and by understating liabilities and sales. Based on the fraudulent records prepared by Sachdeva and Mulvaney, Koss prepared materially false financial statements and filed materially false current, quarterly, and annual reports with the Commission. After discovering the embezzlement, Koss amended and restated its financial statements for fiscal years 2008 and 2009 and the first three quarters of fiscal year 2010., The Commissions complaint seeks an order to permanently enjoin Sachdeva from violating Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2, and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13.

Further, the Commission seeks an order directing Sachdeva and Mulvaney each to disgorge their ill-gotten gains obtained through their misconduct, plus prejudgment interest thereon, and to pay a civil money penalty. Finally, the Commission seeks an order permanently barring Sachdeva from acting as an officer or director of any public company., On July 27, 2010, Sachdeva entered into a plea agreement with the United States Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Wisconsin in a parallel criminal proceeding and pleaded guilty to six counts of wire fraud. Sachdeva admitted her multi-million-dollar theft from Koss, and admitted her scheme to falsify Kosss accounting records to hide her embezzlement.

Systematic Financial Associates Inc. is an investment adviser, Systematic Financial Services LLC is an accounting and tax preparation firm, and Systematic Financial Services Inc. is an entity Venetis created to conduct the fraudulent offerings. Venetis, acting on behalf of the three entities, solicited and obtained funds from clients and others to invest in promissory notes, fixed income investments, or other side investments., The Commissions complaint alleges that Venetis told some investors that the promissory notes were guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and would earn interest of approximately 6 to 11 percent per year that would be tax-free due to a loophole in the tax code. She also told investors that she would use their money to fund loans to doctors that would be backed by Medicare reimbursement payments to those doctors. Instead of making investments, Venetis looted investor funds to pay business debts and personal expenses accrued from international travel, gambling, and home mortgages and property taxes. She also funneled cash to her relatives., The complaint alleges that the representations made by Venetis to investors were entirely false and the promissory notes and other offerings were unsupported by any investments, assets, or related revenues. Venetis simply fabricated the names and signatures of doctors or forged signatures of other people she claimed were recipients of the loans. Venetis concealed from investors that she used their funds to pay her home mortgage and property taxes, purchase a home for her daughter, finance improvements on a home owned by her brother, pay her own gambling debts, and pay for trips to such destinations as Alaska, Italy, France, India, and the Caribbean., The complaint charges Venetis, Systematic Financial Associates, Inc., Systematic Financial Services, LLC, and Systematic Financial Services, Inc. with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

In addition, the SECs complaint names three relief defendants for the purposes of recovering investor assets now in their possession: Jennifer Venetis (Venetiss daughter); Kevin Persley (Venetiss brother); and Venetis LLC (an entity owned and controlled by Venetis)., Venetis and the entities have agreed to settle the SECs charges and have consented to all of the relief that the SEC seeks in its complaint, including the entry of a court order enjoining them from future violations of the above provisions of the securities laws, ordering the payment of disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, financial penalties, an asset freeze, accountings, and the appointment of an independent monitor. The settlement will defer the determination of the amount of the monetary relief to a later date., Venetis and Systematic Financial Associates Inc. also agreed to settle related administrative actions by the Commission that will bar Venetis from association with any investment adviser or broker or dealer, and revoke the registration of the firm., ]"

ACS was later acquired by Xerox Corporation on February 5, 2010., The SECs complaint, filed in federal district court in Washington, D.C., alleges that from 1995 to 2006, ACS engaged in a fraudulent and deceptive scheme to provide executives and other employees with undisclosed compensation. ACS, through its former CEO and its former CFO, backdated the grant dates of ACS stock options to coincide with the dates of low closing prices for the companys stock and then filed periodic reports with the SEC that omitted necessary expenses for backdated options., The SECs complaint alleges that as a result of the undisclosed backdating, ACS materially understated the companys compensation expenses in financial statements contained in public reports filed with the Commission. Additionally, ACS did not have adequate internal controls relating to the granting of stock options and did not maintain accurate books and records concerning its stock option grants., The SECs complaint also alleges that while the company was conducting an internal investigation of the backdating ACS, through its former CEO and former CFO, made false denials that intentional backdating by officers had occurred at ACS. As alleged in the complaint, the former CEO read a statement during an April 27, 2006 earnings call for investors denying the intentional granting of look-back stock options to executive officers and directors in order to achieve lower option exercise prices. ACS made similar false disclosures in its May 10, 2006 Form 12b-25 and in Note 3 to its May 15, 2006 Form 10-Q stating that, ACS does not believe that any director or officer of the Company has engaged in the intentional backdating of stock option grants in order to achieve a more advantageous exercise price. Both the former CEO and the former CFO reviewed drafts of the filings and the former CFO signed the filings. On August 7, 2006, ACS filed a Form 8-K with the Commission attaching a press release, which stated that information set forth in Note 3 to its May 15, 2006 Form 10-Q concerning its stock option investigation can no longer be relied upon., In January 2007, ACS restated its historical financial statements.

(FTC), FTC Emerging Markets (Emerging Markets), Guillermo David Clamens, and Lina Lopez. The judgments against Clamens, FTC and Emerging Markets order those defendants to pay over $20 million in disgorgement and penalties but provide for full satisfaction of their monetary obligations by defendants release of their assets frozen at the start of the case and any other assets in the United States. The final judgments, to which the defendants consented without admitting or denying allegations in the Commissions complaint, also permanently enjoin all the defendants from future violations of the relevant provisions of the federal securities laws., The Commission filed the action on May 19, 2009, charging Clamens, FTC, a registered broker-dealer controlled by Clamens, and Lopez, an FTC employee, with a fraudulent scheme to engage in tens of millions of dollars of unauthorized securities trading through the accounts of two FTC customers. According to the Commissions complaint, Clamens and Lopez defrauded the two FTC customers in part to conceal their prior fraudulent sale of $50 million in non-existent notes to a Venezuelan bank through defendant Emerging Markets, another Clamens-controlled entity. When the fictitious notes held by the Venezuelan bank purportedly came due in August 2008, Clamens allegedly misappropriated $50 million from the two FTC customers to fund the redemption. In addition, the Complaint alleged that Emerging Markets illegally acted as an unregistered broker-dealer. As a result of the alleged misconduct, the Complaint charged that defendants FTC, Emerging Markets, Clamens and Lopez violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; defendant FTC violated Section 15(c) of the Exchange Act; defendant Emerging Markets violated Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act; and defendants Clamens and Lopez aided and abetted FTCs violations of Exchange Act Section 15(c) and Emerging Markets violations of Exchange Act Section 15(a)., The final judgment against Lopez holds her liable for a civil penalty of $130,000 but does not order her to pay the penalty in light of her conviction in a separate criminal proceeding, <i>United States v.

Berlacher, along with several of his investment advisory entities and various hedge funds he managed, liable for securities fraud in connection with the funds PIPE investments. In entering judgment for the Commission, the Court ordered the defendants to pay, jointly and severally, $352,363.68 in disgorgement. The ruling followed a three-day bench trial in March 2010 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, before the Honorable Mitchell S. Goldberg, United States District Judge for the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania., The Commissions complaint, filed on September 13, 2007, alleged that Berlacher - and his investment advisory entities (LIP Advisors, LLC, NCP Advisors, LLC, and RAB Investment Company, LLC) and the hedge funds he managed (Lancaster Investment Partners, L.P., Northwood Capital Partners, L.P., Cabernet Partners, L.P., Chardonnay Partners, L.P., Insignia Partners, L.P., and VFT Special Ventures, Ltd.) â made materially false representations to issuers in connection with two unregistered securities offerings that are commonly referred to as PIPEs (an acronym for private investments in public equities)., In connection with the February 2004 Radyne ComStream, Inc. (Radyne) PIPE, the Court found that Berlacher misrepresented in the securities purchase agreement that he did not hold a short position, directly or indirectly, in Radyne securities. Contrary to this representation, Berlacher, after learning about the PIPE, had established a barrier option position on a basket of securities (i.e., a portfolio of underlying assets), one of which included a short position in Radyne securities. Berlachers barrier option on a basket of securities was an exotic derivative product that provided him with leverage and gave him the right to the underlying assets., Similarly, in connection with the May 2004 International Displayworks, Inc. (IDWK) PIPE, Berlacher misrepresented in the securities purchase agreement that he had not engaged in any transactions in the companys securities when he had in fact, after learning about the PIPE, established a barrier option position that included positions in IDWK as part of its underlying basket of securities., As a result of these material misrepresentations, the Court found that Berlacher, along with his investment advisory entities and the hedge funds he managed, violated Section 10(b), the antifraud provision of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder., The Court found Berlacher and the other defendants not liable for insider trading in connection with the Radyne offering and for fraud in connection with two other offerings. Previously, the Court dismissed the Commissions claim that Berlacher had violated the registration requirements of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933., Additional information about this matter can be found at SEC v.

This settlement resolves all of the Commissions pending charges against Miszuk., The Commissions complaint alleges, among other things, that, in the second quarter 2003, Biovail and some of its executives, including Miszuk, engaged in two separate accounting fraud schemes that resulted in Biovail materially misstating its financial statements by overstating its revenue and understating its loss for that quarter. The Commissions complaint also alleges that other senior Biovail executives and Biovail violated the antifraud and other provisions of the securities laws in connection with misstatements concerning a third quarter 2003 truck accident as well as a fraudulent scheme concerning an off-balance-sheet, research-and-development vehicle., Last year, the Commission settled its claims against Biovail former vice president of corporate affairs Kenneth G.

It is also alleged that these entities then dumped more than $1 million of BIHs stock and divided illegally obtained sales proceeds among themselves and Baron International, Inc., Beaver Creek Financial Corporation, and The Caddo Corporation.

Duckson, of Prior Lake, Minnesota, Michael W. Bozora, of Belvedere, California, and Timothy R. Redpath, of Mill Valley, California, raised more than $21 million from investors in the Capital Solutions Monthly Income Fund after the funds sole business partner defaulted on its obligations to the fund. The SEC alleges that after this May 2008 default, the fund â whose sole business was to make real estate loans to a single borrower â had no meaningful income and was using new investor funds to pay existing investors., According to the SECs complaint, Bozora and Redpath launched the fund in 2004 and, through August 2009, raised approximately $74 million from approximately 450 investors from across the U.S. After the May 2008 default by the funds sole borrower, the fund foreclosed on the borrowers real estate projects. The SEC alleges that in late 2008, Bozora and Redpath asked Duckson, who was acting as the funds outside counsel, to take over managing the fund. The SEC alleges that Duckson then began managing the fund while Bozora and Redpath continued to raise money from new investors. The SEC alleges that Bozora, Redpath, and Duckson failed to disclose the default and foreclosure to investors for several months. The SEC alleges that Bozora, Redpath, and Duckson eventually made some disclosure of the default and foreclosure, but they minimized the impact of these events and misleadingly promoted the funds ability to make new loans., The SECs complaint also charges True North Finance Corporation, a Minneapolis real estate lending company that merged with the fund in 2009, and True Norths Chief Financial Officer, Owen Mark Williams, of Saratoga, California, with accounting fraud. The SEC alleges that in 2008 and 2009, Williams caused True North to overstate its revenues by as much as 99%. The SEC alleges that True North improperly recognized revenue on interest from borrowers which were not paying True North and which were in poor financial condition., The SEC is seeking permanent injunctions, disgorgement, prejudgment interest and civil penalties against all of the Defendants, and officer-director bars against Bozora, Redpath, Duckson, and Williams., ]"

In compliance with these settlement obligations, UBS purchased over $18 billion worth of ARS from over 32,000 customer accounts â or almost 100% of its customers ARS positions that had not already been liquidated through issuer redemptions. Of the eight broker-dealer firms that entered into ARS settlements with the Commission, UBS and Wachovia were the only two that agreed to purchase ARS held not only by retail and small business customers, but by institutional customers as well., UBS also met its other settlement obligations, including compensating investors who sold ARS below par, reimbursing investors for excess interest costs associated with loans taken out due to ARS illiquidity, and participating in special arbitration proceedings before the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. UBS also submitted periodic reports to, and met quarterly with, SEC staff regarding its progress in meeting its settlement obligations., The UBS settlement provided for a potential deferred penalty if the firm did not meet its settlement obligations. The SEC has determined that based on the firms compliance with its settlement, as well as other factors, no penalties will be pursued., The Commissions eight ARS settlements, including the UBS settlement, followed the Commissions investigation into the ARS market seizure of February 2008, an event that left tens of thousands of investors holding ARS they could not sell.

Khanna and Sharanjit K. Khanna, he personally defrauded certain MAK 1 investors, aided and abetted the fraud of MAK 1 and the Khannas, and offered and sold MAK 1s unregistered securities. Investors in the $35 million MAK 1 scheme were promised exorbitantly high returns through guaranteed investments such as foreign currency trading. MAK 1 was in fact a Ponzi scheme and was halted by an emergency action filed by the Commission in federal court in San Diego in August 2009. In that action, <i>SEC v. Mohit A. Khanna, et al.</i>, Case No. 09CV1784BEN (filed Aug.17, 2009, the Commission charged MAK 1 and the Khannas with violations of the federal securities laws, Bujkovsky represented MAK 1 and the Khannas as clients between April and August 2009., The complaint alleges that despite having notice that MAK 1 was conducting an unregistered and likely fraudulent securities offering, Bujkovsky made material misrepresentations and failed to disclose material facts to some MAK 1 investors. Bujkovsky misrepresented that MAK 1 was engaged in foreign currency trading and that his own clients invested in MAK 1 and had received the promised high returns, and that the MAK 1 investment was insured and had other downside risk protection. The complaint further alleges that after Mohit Khanna told Bujkovsky on July 9, 2009 that MAK 1 did not engage in foreign currency trading and was a fraud, Bujkovsky lulled certain investors by falsely representing that their money would be returned after problems were resolved with intermediaries including European banks. During the period of Bujkovskys representation, MAK 1 raised more than $3.3 million from investors, over $1.9 million of which was returned to earlier investors as interest payments or return of principal, and over $1.5 million of which were sent to Bujkovskys client trust account from MAK 1 or the Khannas. By funneling these funds through his client trust account and the account of a sham corporation he created, Bujkovsky helped the Khannas misappropriate about $1.3 million investor funds for their own use. Bujkovsky retained over $459,000 of investor funds, about half of which he used for his personal expenses or paid to his wife, Betty D. Hansen, who was named as a relief defendant in the Commissions complaint., The Commission seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against Bujkovsky and disgorgement from Hansen of her ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest., Separately, Bujkovsky pleaded guilty to felony counts of obstruction of justice (for making false statements to Commission staff in connection with the Commissions investigation of MAK 1 and Mohit Khanna) and income tax evasion. <i>United States of America v.

McAdams was also ordered to pay disgorgement, pre-judgment interest and a civil penalty in amounts to be resolved upon motion of the Commission at a later date, and directed that for purposes of that motion, the allegations of the Commissions Complaint shall be deemed true. McAdams consented to the entry of the order without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions Complaint., The Complaint, filed on March 18, 2010, alleged fraud against McAdams and his co-defendant R. Dane Freeman (Freeman) in connection with sales of securities interests in Global Holdings, a limited liability company organized by McAdams. Approximately $3.5 million was raised from investors during the first nine months of 2008. The Complaint alleged that McAdams and Freeman told investors orally and in writing that Global Holdings was in the business of locating and securing high return investment opportunities for investors on international trading platforms. Most of the Global Holdings investors executed a joint venture agreement that was prepared by McAdams and signed by either McAdams or Freeman. These joint venture agreements represented that Global Holdings would utilize those funds for the purpose of buying and selling Standard and Poors AAA or AA rated bonds and/or Medium Term Notes on an overseas trading platform. Some of the joint venture agreements stated that investors who invested $20,000 would receive $1,000,000 after 60 days, a return of 4,900%. At least one joint venture agreement stated that an investors $500,000 would grow to $1,500,000 after 60 days, for a 200% rate of return. Most investors, if not all of them, never received either profits or a return of their principal. Instead, over $500,000 in investor funds were transferred to accounts controlled by Freeman and his family. McAdams received many questions about the high yield investment program from the outset, from investors and his own family members, to whom McAdams vouched for the existence and legality of the global trading platforms that supposedly would generate such outlandish returns. McAdams also misrepresented the success of the program.

Additionally, the Complaint alleges that Hansen tipped his longtime friend Stuart Kobrovsky (âKobrovskyâ) about one of the acquisitions, and that Kobrovsky, in turn, traded on that information. The Complaint alleges that Hansen and Kobrovsky made illegal trading profits of approximately $215,000. Without admitting or denying the allegations, Kobrovsky has agreed to settle the Commissionâs allegations against him, and his settlement papers were submitted to the Court for its consideration., The Complaint, filed in federal court in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, alleges that defendant Hansen learned of each of the pending acquisitions, and the identity of the target companies, from his business associate, Donna Murdoch (âMurdochâ).

Gansman (âGansmanâ), then a partner in the Transaction Advisory Services Department of Ernst and Young, LLP (âE&amp;Yâ). According to the Complaint, by tipping Murdoch with material, non-public information about pending acquisitions, Gansman breached of a duty of confidentiality he owed to E&amp;Y and its clients; and Murdoch, in turn, tipped Hansen. Hansen is then alleged to have traded on that information, and in one instance to have tipped his longtime friend, Stuart Kobrovsky, who also traded. The Complaint alleges that Hansen and Kobrovsky knew or recklessly disregarded that the tips on which each traded stemmed from a breach of duty to the informationâs source., For their part, Murdoch and Gansman were both defendants in the recently settled civil case of <i>S.E.C. v.

In that criminal case, Murdoch entered guilty pleas to a total of 17 felony counts and is awaiting sentencing. Gansman was convicted by a jury of six felony counts and acquitted of four. He is currently incarcerated pending his appeal. See <i>United States v.

September 29, 2010)</h2>]","[, The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that it filed a civil injunctive action today in federal district court in Massachusetts against Sage Advisory Group, LLC, an investment adviser registered with the Commission and its sole principal, owner, and employee Benjamin Lee Grant. The Commissionâs complaint alleges that starting on or about October 4 2005, Grant, a resident of Boston, Massachusetts, made material misrepresentations and omissions to his former brokerage customers in order to induce them to transfer their assets to Sage, his new advisory firm., The Commissionâs complaint alleges that prior to October 2005, Grant was a registered representative of broker-dealer Wedbush Morgan Securities and had more than 300 customer accounts, representing more than $100 million in assets, virtually all of which were managed by California-based investment adviser First Wilshire Securities Management. According to the complaint, Grant resigned from Wedbush on September 30, 2005 so that he could operate Sage, his own investment advisory firm. The complaint alleges that, in a letter dated OctoberÂ 4, 2005, Grant told his Wedbush customers that Sage had been formed to handle their investments and that, at the suggestion of First Wilshire, their accounts were being moved from Wedbush to a discount broker. The complaint alleges that the letter told Grantâs customers that the charge for their accounts was changing from a 1% management fee paid to First Wilshire plus Wedbushâs brokerage commissions to a 2% âwrap feeâ paid to Sage, and that First Wilshire had indicated that the wrap fee had been historically less expensive than the previous arrangement. According to the complaint, the letter also told Grantâs customers that if they wanted to avoid any disruption in First Wilshireâs management of their assets, they had to sign and return the new advisory and custodial account documents as soon as possible. According to the complaint, in subsequent communication with customers, Grant told them that First Wilshire was no longer willing to manage their assets at Wedbush and that they had to transfer to Sage., According to the Complaint, however, these statements were materially false and misleading because First Wilshire had not suggested a transfer from Wedbush and had not refused to manage assets at Wedbush. Moreover, according to the complaint, Grant knew that the wrap fee would not be less expensive than the previous arrangement. The complaint further alleges that Grant failed to disclose that the switch from Wedbush to the discount broker would result in significant savings that would flow to Grant and Sage rather than to the advisory clients and that, as a result, Grant and Sageâs compensation would be substantially increased. Indeed, once Grantâs customers transferred their accounts from Wedbush to Sage, Grant more than doubled his own compensation., The Commissionâs complaint alleges that Sage and Grant violated Sections 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Sections 204A, 206, 207 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rules 204A-1 and 206(4)-7 thereunder.

ABB is a Swiss corporation that provides power and automation products and services worldwide. The SEC alleges that ABB, through its subsidiaries, paid bribes to government officials in Mexico to obtain business with government owned power companies, and paid kickbacks to the former regime in Iraq to obtain contracts under the United Nations Oil for Food Program. As alleged in the complaint, ABBs subsidiaries made at least $2.7 million in illicit payments in these schemes to obtain contracts that generated more than $100 million in revenues for ABB., In the Mexican bribery scheme, the SEC alleges that from 1999 through 2004, ABB Network Management (ABB NM), a business unit within ABBs U.S. subsidiary, ABB, Inc., bribed officials in Mexico to obtain and retain business with two government owned electric utilities, Comision Federal de Electricidad (CFE) and Luz y Fuerza del Centro (LyFZ). According to the complaint, the bribes were funneled through ABB NMs agent and two other companies in Mexico. The complaint alleges that ABB failed to conduct due diligence on these payments and entities and improperly recorded the bribes on its books as payments for commissions and services on projects in Mexico. Examples of illicit payments in the complaint include checks and wire transfers to relatives of CFE officials, cash bribes to CFE officials, and payment of a Mediterranean cruise vacation for CFE officials and their wives. The SEC alleges that, as a result of this bribery scheme, ABB NM was awarded contracts with CFE and LyFZ that generated over $90 million in revenues, and $13 million in profits, for ABB., The SEC further alleges that from approximately 2000 to 2004 ABB participated in the United Nations Oil for Food Program (the Program). The Program was intended to provide humanitarian relief for the Iraqi population, which faced hardship under the international trade sanctions that followed Iraqs 1990 invasion of Kuwait. According to the complaint, ABB participated in the Program through six subsidiaries: ABB Near East Trading Ltd. (ABB Jordan), ABB Automation, ABB Industrie AC Machines and ABB Solyvent-Ventec (collectively referred to as ABB France), ABB AG (ABB Austria), and ABB Elektrik Sanayi AS (ABB Turkey). The SEC alleges that these subsidiaries developed various schemes to pay secret kickbacks to Iraq to obtain contracts under the Program. ABBs Jordanian subsidiary acted as a conduit for other ABB subsidiaries by making the kickback payments on their behalf. Some of the kickbacks were made in the form of bank guarantees and cash payments. ABB improperly recorded the kickbacks on its books as legitimate payments for after sales services, consultation costs, and commissions. According to the complaint, the Oil for Food contracts obtained as a result of the kickback schemes generated $13.5 million in revenues, and $3.8 million in profits, for ABB., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, ABB has agreed to settle the SECs action by consenting to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins the company from future violations of Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, orders the company to pay $22,804,262 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, orders the company to pay a $16,510,000 civil penalty, and requires the company to comply with certain undertakings regarding its FCPA compliance program., In related criminal proceedings, ABB has reached a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice in which ABB has agreed to pay $19 million in criminal penalties., The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Department of Justice, Criminal Division, Fraud Section, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the United Nations Independent Inquiry Committee., ]"

Alexander even used $200,000 of investor funds to remodel her kitchen., According to the SECâs complaint filed in federal district court in San Jose, Alexander, PiÃ±a and Swanson raised nearly $7 million from 50 investors for two investment funds managed by APS Funding. They claimed that the funds would make short-term secured loans to homeowners and yield 12 percent annual returns to investors. Contrary to what investors were told, $1.2 million of their money instead went directly to Alexander, PiÃ±a, and Swanson for personal use, and $1.3 million in investor funds was used to finance other businesses owned by Alexander and APS Funding, including <i>MoneyDots</i>., The SEC further alleges that Alexander, PiÃ±a, and Swanson furthered the scheme by sending monthly account statements to investors reflecting fictitious profits and, in classic Ponzi scheme fashion, paying out purported returns that actually came from new investors., In its federal court action, the SEC charges Alexander, PiÃ±a, Swanson, and APS Funding with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (âSecurities Actâ) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC also charges Alexander, Swanson, and APS Funding with violating Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act. The SECâs complaint seeks relief in the form of permanent injunctions against all defendants enjoining them from future violations of the provisions charged, an order requiring that they disgorge their ill-gotten gains, with prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties against Alexander, PiÃ±a, and Swanson., <b>See Also:</b> <a href=/litigation/complaints/2010/comp21690.pdf title=>SEC Complaint</a> ]"

The U.S. Attorney today announced criminal charges against some of the same individuals facing SEC civil charges., The defendants, who are all insiders or promoters of publicly traded microcap companies, sought to manipulate the volume and price of microcap stocks and to generate stock sales through the payment of illegal kickbacks. The defendants thought they were paying-off corrupt pension fund managers, stockbrokers, or promoters, but these individuals were in reality undercover FBI agents or cooperating sources. In related criminal prosecutions, the United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of Florida today announced criminal charges against some of the same individuals the SEC sued., The defendants reside or are based in South Florida, Nevada, California, New Mexico, and Texas. According to the SECs complaints, which were all filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, most of the schemes involved the defendants paying kickbacks to purported corrupt pension fund managers or stockbrokers, who in return would use their clients accounts to purchase the publicly traded stock of microcap issuers the defendants controlled or promoted. In one other scheme, a promoter paid another apparently dishonest promoter to make a microcap companys share price rise through false and misleading press releases, e-mail blasts, and newsletters. In all of the schemes, what the defendants did not know was that the individuals with whom they arranged the illegal transactions were actually FBI agents or confidential sources participating in an undercover operation. The undercover operation was conducted in such a way that no investors suffered harm., The Commissions complaints allege that the defendants in some of the schemes, understood that they needed to disguise the kickbacks as payments to phony consulting companies, which they knew would perform no actual work. In other instances, the defendants knew that the purported corrupt fund managers and brokers would be violating their fiduciary duties to their clients by taking part in the kickback schemes., The complaints allege the defendants violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The SEC is seeking: permanent injunctions and financial penalties against all the defendants; disgorgement plus prejudgment interest against the defendants that received ill-gotten gains; officer and director bars against the individual defendants who served as officers or directors of the microcap companies involved; and penny stock bars against all the individual defendants., The SEC acknowledges the assistance and cooperation of the United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of Florida and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Miami Division in investigating these matters., ]"

LocatePlus sells on-line access to public record databases for investigative searches. Locate Plus stock is registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act and is currently quoted in the Pink Sheets, operated by Pink OTC Markets, Inc., The Commissions Complaint alleges that from 2005 through 2007, LocatePlus engaged in securities fraud by misleading investors about its funding and revenue, in violation of, among other provisions, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. During that time period, LocatePluss then-CEO and CFO abused their positions to fraudulently inflate the companys publicly-reported revenue for fiscal years 2005 and 2006 by creating a fictitious customer called Omni Data. LocatePlus then improperly recognized millions of dollars in payments from Omni Data as revenue. As the Complaint alleges, Omni Data was actually funded by approximately $2 million in cash routed from entities secretly controlled by the former LocatePlus CEO and CFO., The Complaint further alleges that, to date, LocatePlus has not made public disclosure of the fraud or disclosed the fictitious nature of the previously-reported Omni Data revenue in any SEC filing, restatement or other public document., In its Complaint against LocatePlus, the Commission is seeking an injunction prohibiting future violations of the federal securities laws, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, and civil monetary penalties., The Commissions investigation is continuing., The Commission acknowledges the assistance of Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts William F.

PrÃ©vost of Palm Beach Gardens and David W. Harrold of Del Ray Beach falsely assured their investors and potential investors that the flow of their money would be safeguarded by collateral accounts and described a phony process for protecting their assets. When Petters was unable to make payments on investments held by the funds they managed, PrÃ©vost, Harrold, and their firms concealed it from investors by concocting sham note exchange transactions with Petters, <a href=/news/press/2009/2009-156.htm>who the SEC charged last year</a> along with an Illinois-based hedge fund manager who also facilitated the scheme., The SECs complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota alleges that PrÃ©vost, Harrold, and their firms Palm Beach Capital Management LP and Palm Beach Capital Management LLC invested more than $1 billion in hedge fund assets with Petters while pocketing more than $58 million in fees. Petters promised investors that their money would be used to finance the purchase of vast amounts of consumer electronics by vendors who then re-sold the merchandise to such Big Box retailers as Wal-Mart and Costco. In reality, Petterss purchase order inventory financing business was merely a Ponzi scheme. There were no inventory transactions. Petters sold promissory notes to feeder funds like those controlled by PrÃ©vost, Harrold, and their firms and used some of the note proceeds to pay returns to earlier investors, diverting the rest of the cash to his own purposes., According to the SECs complaint, PrÃ©vost, Harrold, and their firms funneled money into the Petters Ponzi scheme beginning as early as 2004 through at least June 2008. PrÃ©vost and Harrold sold interests in their Palm Beach Funds to individuals, foundations, family trusts and other hedge funds throughout the U.S. The Palm Beach Funds invested all investor contributions into the Petters Ponzi Scheme and were holding more than $1 billion worth of notes when the scheme collapsed., The SEC alleges that PrÃ©vost, Harrold, and their firms falsely assured investors that the inventory financing transactions were structured in such a way that after the retailers received their merchandise from vendors, they were supposed to send their payments for the merchandise directly into the funds collateral accounts to pay off the notes held by the funds. This arrangement purported to protect investors inasmuch as the receipt of funds directly from the retailers would ostensibly verify their participation in each transaction. But in reality, money for the repayment of notes held by the funds always came directly from Petters and never came from any retailers. PrÃ©vost and Harrold did not disclose this material fact to investors in the funds, and instead continued to lie about the operation of the collateral accounts., The SEC further alleges that PrÃ©vost, Harrold, and their firms devised with Petters a series of bogus note exchange transactions beginning around February 2008. The Palm Beach Funds on multiple occasions exchanged groups of mature notes that were due to be repaid on or about the date of the exchange for newly-issued notes that were not due to be paid for six months and purported to be collateralized by different merchandise associated with different inventory finance transactions. Instead of receiving cash repayments and then reinvesting that cash in new notes as they had done in the past, PrÃ©vost and Harrold simply began exchanging old IOUs for new ones, ultimately swapping the vast majority of notes held by the funds. Meanwhile, they continued to falsely report in monthly communications to investors that the funds were generating the same steady profits they had generated since their inceptions. These overstated rates of return resulted in the payment of excessive fees to PrÃ©vost, Harrold, and their firms., The SECs complaint charges PrÃ©vost, Harrold, and their firms with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206-4(8) thereunder. The SEC seeks entry of a court order of permanent injunction against PrÃ©vost, Harrold, and their firms, as well as an order of disgorgement, including prejudgment interest and financial penalties., The SECs investigation is continuing., <b>See Also:</b> <a href=/litigation/complaints/2010/comp21694.pdf title=>SEC Complaint</a> ]"

Lines, Scott G.S. Lines, Anthony W. Wile, Wayne E. Wew, Lines Overseas Management Ltd., LOM Securities (Bermuda) Ltd., LOM Securities (Bahamas) Ltd., LOM Securities (Cayman) Ltd., and LOM Capital Ltd. on October 15, 2010. (The LOM companies collectively are referred to hereinafter as the âLOM Entitiesâ). All of the foregoing defendants, with the exception of LOM Securities (Bahamas) Ltd. and LOM Securities (Cayman) Ltd., were enjoined by the Court from violating certain of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, as described below. The Court also ordered broad ancillary relief against the defendants, including as to certain defendants, disgorgement, civil money penalties, and compliance with undertakings to not trade in penny stocks quoted on certain U.S.-based electronic quotation services and, for the LOM Entities, to not maintain accounts for U.S.-resident customers. Brian and Scott Lines and the LOM Entities were ordered to disgorge over $1.9 million in profits and prejudgment interest and pay civil penalties totalling $600,000., Without admitting or denying the Commissionâs allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of the judgments against them. These judgments resolve the Commissionâs claims against these defendants in a civil action that was filed on December 19, 2007, in which the Commission alleged that that these defendants had participated in a fraudulent scheme to manipulate the stock price of Sedona Software Solutions, Inc. (âSSSIâ), and, except for Wile and Wew, also had participated in a second stock manipulation scheme involving SHEP Technologies, Inc. (âSHEPâ) f/k/a Inside Holdings Inc. (âIHIâ)., In addition to entering permanent injunctions, the Court ordered Brian and Scott Lines, who are brothers and during the relevant time were the controlling persons of the LOM Entities, to pay, jointly and severally with the LOM Entities, disgorgement of $1,277,403, prejudgment interest of $654,918. The Court also imposed civil penalties in the following amounts: $450,000 for the LOM Entities, $100,000 for Brian Lines; and $50,000 for Scott Lines. In addition to entering permanent injunctions against Anthony Wile and Wayne Wew, the Court ordered Wile to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $35,000, and Wew to disgorge approximately $8000 and pay a $10,000 civil penalty., In its Complaint in the civil action, the Commission alleged that, in early 2002, Brian and Scott Lines assisted two LOM customers, defendants William Todd Peever and Phillip James Curtis, to secretly acquire a publicly-traded OTCBB shell company named Inside Holdings, Inc. (âIHIâ). Peever and Curtis then arranged for a reverse merger of IHI with SHEP Ltd., a private company that purportedly owned certain intellectual property. Peever and Curtis paid three touters to publish a series of highly positive reports recommending investments in the newly-merged entity, SHEP Technologies, Inc. The Commissionâs complaint alleged, in pertinent part, that during the first half of 2003, Peever, Curtis, and the Lines brothers sold over three million SHEP shares into this artificially-stimulated demand in an unregistered distribution of SHEP stock. As part of the alleged scheme, the Lines brothers, Peever, and Curtis failed to file required reports regarding their beneficial ownership of IHI and SHEP stock, and Brian Lines caused several false reports to be filed with the Commission in order to conceal that Peever and Curtis, among others, owned substantial positions in, and had been selling, SHEP stock., As further alleged in the Commissionâs Complaint, in late 2002, Anthony Wile and another individual formed Renaissance Mining Corporation (âRenaissanceâ) and thereafter engaged in substantial promotional activities that created the misleading impression that Renaissance had acquired three Central American gold mines and was the âLeading Gold Producer in Latin America.â In fact, Renaissance had only executed a non-binding Letter of Intent to acquire those mines and lacked the funding necessary to consummate the acquisition. The Complaint further alleges that Wile acted in concert with the Lines brothers, who acquired a publicly-traded shell, Sedona Software Solutions, Inc., using LOM accounts in the names of nominees to disguise their ownership of the Sedona shell, as part of a plan to merge Sedona with Renaissance., The Complaint alleges that, in early 2003, Wile and his associate primed the market for Renaissance/Sedona by disseminating materially false and misleading information that misrepresented the ownership of the gold mines and created the impression that the Renaissance/Sedona merger had been completed. Wile and his associate also arranged for the Renaissance/Sedona offering to be touted to prospective investors by Robert Chapman, the publisher of an on-line investment newsletter, and three other newsletter writers, all of whom purchased Renaissance shares for nominal sums. Through this deceptive promotional campaign, Wile and his associate informed the market that there would be an opportunity to invest in Renaissance by acquiring Sedona stock at approximately $10 per share beginning on January 21, 2003., According to the Complaintâs allegations, on that date, Wile orchestrated a pre-arranged manipulative trade between his uncle, defendant Wayne E. Wile (who subsequently changed his name to Wayne Wew), and Brian Lines to artificially drive up the price of Sedona stock from $.03 per share to over $9.00 per share and stimulate trading in the stock. The Complaint alleged that Scott Lines solicited investors, including at least one LOM customer in the United States, to purchase Renaissance stock in anticipation of the merger between Renaissance and Sedona, without disclosing that he and Brian Lines owned the Sedona shell corporation. The Complaint further alleged that, after Renaissance and Sedona had announced their pending merger, the Lines brothers sold 143,000 shares of Sedona stock in an unregistered distribution to numerous public investors at between $8.95 and $9.45 per share, reaping over $1 million in illegal profits. On January 29, 2003, the Commission suspended trading in Sedonaâs stock., Final judgments were entered by the Court against each defendant and provide the following relief, respectively:, <p class=em2>(i) Brian Lines is permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud, securities offering registration, and securities ownership disclosure provisions of the federal securities laws, Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (âSecurities Actâ) and Sections 13(d) and 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ) and Rules 13d-1, 13d-2, and 16a-3 thereunder;

Talbot and Carl E. Binette were charged in a seven-count indictment with conspiracy and securities fraud related to an insider trading scheme. Binette was also charged with obstruction of justice for making false statements to the Commission during its attempts to discover and investigate that very scheme. <i>U.S. v. Talbot et al.</i>, Criminal Action No. 3:10-cr-30036-MAP (D. Mass.) (Ponser, J)., As part of the indictment, Binette is accused of obstructing the SECs investigation of his trading activities in Safeco securities. In particular, Binette is accused of making several false statements to SEC investigators regarding whether he had spoken to anyone prior to engaging in trading of Safeco securities. Binette repeatedly denied speaking to anyone before trading, even though in fact his trading was based on the tip he received from Talbot. Binette also claimed that his trades were based on a dream he had in which a deceased relative told him that she was safe., In addition, the indictment alleges that in April 2008, Talbot, who was then employed by the Hartford Investment Management Company (HIMCO), determined, through confidential information obtained through the course of his employment, that the insurance company Safeco Corp. was a potential acquisition target of the Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. (HIMCOs parent company). Talbot tipped his nephew, Binette, and the two set up a brokerage account in Binettes name to buy Safeco securities. Less than a week after Talbot and Binette bought Safeco common stock and call option contracts, the acquisition of Safeco by a third insurance company, Liberty Mutual, was announced. Talbot and Binette sold all of the Safeco securities for a profit of approximately $615,833., On July 13, 2009, the Commission filed a civil injunctive complaint alleging Binettes and Talbots insider trading in Safeco securities violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Talbot and Binette each consented to the entry of a judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the SECs complaint. On February 25, 2010 and July 23, 2010, the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts entered judgments permanently enjoining Talbot and Binette, respectively, from committing or aiding and abetting future violations of the above provisions; and ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest thereon, and civil penalties, in amounts to be determined by the court upon the Commissions motion.

Reckles, of Milton, Georgia, and investment adviser entities they control with defrauding Palisades Master Fund, L.P. investors by overvaluing illiquid fund assets they placed in a so-called side pocket and by misappropriating other fund assets. The Commission also charged Mannion, Reckles, and their investment adviser entities with making material misrepresentations in connection with a private stock offering. A side pocket is a type of account hedge funds use to separate particular, typically illiquid, investments from the remainder of the investments in the fund., According to the SECs complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, from August through at least October 2005, Mannion and Reckles, through PEF Advisors LLC and PEF Advisors Ltd., two investment adviser entities they controlled, placed the hedge funds investments in World Health Alternatives, Inc. in a side pocket and valued those investments in a manner that was both inconsistent with fund disclosures and contrary to Mannions and Reckles undisclosed internal assessment of their value. As the complaint alleges, the fraudulent valuations enabled Mannion and Reckles to report to investors misleadingly inflated net asset values and allowed Mannion and Reckles to take excessive management fees from the fund., In addition, the SECs complaint alleges that Mannion and Reckles stole more than one million warrants in World Health that belonged to the fund. At the time Mannion and Reckles exercised those warrants, they were worth $1.6 million. The defendants also improperly used investors cash to pay for their own personal investments. In July 2005, Mannion and Reckles, without disclosure, took $2 million from the fund as an apparent short-term loan to finance their personal investments, and separately used approximately $13,000 from the fund to pay for services not rendered to the fund and to purchase warrants for their personal accounts., Finally, the SEC alleges in its complaint that Mannion, Reckles, and their investment adviser entities made material misrepresentations in connection with a February 2004 PIPE (an acronym for private investment in public equity) offering conducted by Radyne ComStream Inc., The SEC complaint charges defendants with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The Commission seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement of profits, prejudgment interest, and financial penalties.

The Commissions complaint charges that Sun, East Delta, David Amsel, and Mayer Amsel violated the federal securities laws in a scheme to manipulate the market for the securities of East Delta., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, Sun consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating certain provisions of the federal securities laws, imposes an officer and director bar, permanently bars him from participating in the offer or sale of penny stocks, imposes disgorgement in the amount of $109,411 plus prejudgment interest in the amount of $31,485, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $70,000. The judgment against Sun was entered on September 22, 2010. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, East Delta consented to the entry of a final judgment against it containing certain injunctive relief and the prospect of monetary penalties to be ordered at a later date.

Pending a final disposition of the Commissionâs enforcement action, the preliminary injunction order enjoins the Defendants from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The preliminary injunction order also requires Defendants to prepare a written verified accounting and freezes the Defendantsâ and Relief Defendantâs assets pending a final disposition of the Commissionâs enforcement action., The Commissionâs complaint, filed on October 5, 2010, alleged that, between 2008 and the present, Chiaese and CGC misappropriated at least approximately $2.5 million from at least six of their advisory clients, including a union pension trust fund for the benefit of approximately 880 members. Chiaese repeatedly made false and misleading statements to his clients regarding the clients investments, including creating and providing to clients fictitious, self-generated account statements that (i) misrepresented the value of their investments and (ii) falsely stated that their investments were safely held at a broker-dealer. In fact, Chiaese and CGC had misappropriated their clients funds. Instead of investing these funds as Chiaese promised, he used much of his clients funds to support his lavish lifestyle, including: mortgage payments on a million dollar home; approximately $32,000 on landscaping; approximately $70,000 on multiple country clubs; approximately $12,000 on his childs private school tuition; approximately $4,000 at a New York City hotel on New Years Eve 2008; thousands of dollars on expensive cars; tens of thousands of dollars per month in living expenses; and numerous cash withdrawals. Micol Chiaese, an officer of CGC, benefited from this fraud by directly receiving at least $261,300 of clients funds., On October 5, 2006, the Court granted, among other emergency relief, temporary orders freezing the Defendantsâ and Relief Defendantâs assets. In its enforcement action, the Commission is seeking additional relief, including orders permanently enjoining Chiaese and CGC from committing future violations of the foregoing federal securities laws, and a final judgment ordering Chiaese, Micol Chiaese and CGC to disgorge their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and assessing civil penalties against Chiaese and CGC., ]"

The SEC also charged Office Depot with unrelated accounting violations., Regulation FD requires that when issuers disclose material nonpublic information, they must make broad public disclosure of that information. The SECs alleges that as they neared the end of Office Depots second quarter for 2007, the companys CEO and then-CFO discussed how to encourage analysts to revisit their analysis of the company. Office Depot then made a series of one-on-one calls to analysts. The company did not directly state that it would not meet analysts expectations, but rather this message was signaled with references to recent public statements of comparable companies about the impact of the slowing economy on their earnings. The analysts also were reminded of Office Depots prior cautionary public statements. Analysts promptly lowered their estimates for the period in response to the calls. Office Depot did not regularly initiate these types of calls to all analysts covering the company., The SECs complaint alleges that Office Depots CEO, in an attempt to get analysts to lower their estimates, proposed to the companys CFO that the company talk to the analysts and refer them to recent public announcements by two comparable companies about their financial results being impacted by the slowing economy. The CEO further suggested that Office Depot point out on its calls what the company had said in prior public conference calls in April and May 2007. The CFO then assisted Office Depots investor relations personnel in preparing talking points for the calls., According to the SECs complaint, the CEO and CFO were not present during the calls but were aware of the analysts declining estimates while the company made the calls. They encouraged the calls to be completed. Office Depot continued to make the calls despite the CFO being notified of some analysts concerns about the lack of public disclosure among other things. Six days after the calls began, Office Depot filed a Form 8-K announcing that its sales and earnings would be negatively impacted due to a continued soft economy. Before that Form 8-K was filed, Office Depots share price had significantly dropped on increased trading volume., Unrelated to these Regulation FD violations, the SEC also charged Office Depot with overstating its net earnings in its financial statements for the third quarter of 2006 through the second quarter of 2007 as a result of accounting violations. The SEC alleges that Office Depot prematurely recognized approximately $30 million in funds received from vendors in exchange for the companys merchandising and marketing efforts instead of recognizing the funds over the relevant reporting periods in a manner consistent with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. In November 2007, the company restated those financials and announced a material weakness in its internal controls over financial reporting that resulted from the failure of its personnel responsible for negotiating agreements with vendors to communicate all of the relevant information to financial accounting personnel., Office Depot agreed to settle the SECs charges without admitting or denying the allegations, and will pay a $1 million penalty. Office Depot also consented to the entry of an administrative order in a separate proceeding requiring it to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder, and Regulation FD., ]"

Action No. 3:10-cv-1685</h2>, <h2>SEC CHARGES CONNECTICUT-BASED HEDGE FUND MANAGER WITH FRAUD IN VALUING PORTFOLIO ASSETS, MAKING MISREPRESENTATIONS TO INVESTORS, AND MISUSE OF INVESTOR ASSETS</h2>]","[, The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it charged hedge fund manager Stephen M. Hicks and his investment advisory businesses with defrauding investors in funds managed by Southridge Capital Management LLC and Southridge Advisors LLC by overvaluing the largest position held by the funds. The SEC alleges that the hedge fund manager also made material misrepresentations to investors and misused investor money to pay legal and administrative expenses of other funds managed by Hicks and Southridge., The SEC alleges that Hicks, of Ridgefield Connecticut, overvalued the largest position held by the funds by fraudulently misstating the acquisition price of the assets. According to the SECs complaint, Hicks arranged a transaction in which a telecommunications company acquired by the Southridge funds when the company defaulted on a $769,000 note, was sold to Fonix Corporation in exchange for securities with a stated valued of $33 million in early 2004. The complaint further alleges that neither the asset sold nor the securities obtained in the transaction were accurately valued by Southridge and Hicks. Thereafter, the SEC alleges, the Fonix position was wrongfully valued at its acquisition cost, and the funds paid or accrued hundreds of thousands in management fees every year since 2004., The SEC further alleges that beginning in late 2003, Hicks fraudulently solicited investors to put money in new funds by telling them that the majority of their investments would be placed in unrestricted, free-trading shares (meaning shares that were available to be sold), cash, or near cash. According to the complaint, Hicks raised $80 million for the new funds between 2004 and 2007. The complaint further alleges that, at year-end 2006, more than one-third of the assets in one new fund (and more than half of the assets in another new fund) were invested in relatively illiquid deals. By 2007, the SEC alleges, many investors in these funds were having difficulty redeeming their money because it had been invested in relatively illiquid securities., The SEC also alleges that between 2005 and 2008, Southridge and Hicks caused certain of the funds that had available cash to pay approximately $5 million of legal and administrative expenses of older funds that were illiquid and had no available cash. The SECs complaint alleges that investors in the funds from which money was taken were not told about this misappropriation of fund assets while it was taking place. According to the SECs complaint, in February 2009, Hicks sent a letter to investors admitting that certain legal and administrative expenses had been improperly allocated between the funds. Rather than repaying the money to the funds, however, the SEC alleges that Southridge and Hicks transferred certain illiquid securities to the funds., The SEC complaint charges defendants with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) if the Investment Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.

Among other things, the SEC alleges that the defendants misappropriated some investor funds and lost the vast majority of remaining investor funds through Forex trading activity after promising investors that most of their funds were protected from such trading losses., The Commissionâs complaint alleges that BTR offered investors investments in a program that traded in the Forex market. BTR solicited investments through a website, sales representatives called âintroducing brokers,â and live presentations by Karlis and Akyil. BTR attracted investors from around the world, with many residing in Florida. BTRâs representations to investors, included the following: (1) investors would have 100% transparency about what was going on in their accounts through the provision of daily and monthly account statements and twenty-four hour access to real-time trading information regarding the trading that Akyil was doing on their behalf; (2) the BTR trading system was set up with a stop-loss program, so investors could lose no more than an agreed-upon percentage (typically 30%) of their initial investment; and (3) BTR and its principals would be paid from profits only., The SEC alleges that in fact Karlis and Akyil diverted some investor funds for their own benefit. To conceal the fraud, BTR sent investors misleading account statements, while Akyil and Karlis were actually depleting the investment pool through misappropriation and trading losses., According to the Complaint, BTR collapsed in September 2008 due to significant losses accrued as a result of concealed trading far past the stop loss limits promised to investors. Ultimately, BTR distributed the remaining funds, which accounted for only approximately 10% of account balances, to its investors., The Commissionâs complaint alleges that BTR, Akyil, and Karlis violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Â Over the course of the fraudulent scheme, Sterling reaped $1,502,193 in ill-gotten gains., When banks convert from mutual to stock ownership, depositors receive priority rights to purchase shares in the offering ahead of other interested investors.Â  To ensure that only depositors benefit from these priority rights, banking regulations and offering terms prohibit depositors from transferring their purchase rights or shares obtained in the offering.Â  The SECâs complaint alleges that Sterling, to evade these restrictions, opened numerous savings accounts at mutual banks for himself, and in his daughterâs name, in the hope that some would convert to stock ownership.Â  When banks converted, Sterling executed his daughterâs signature on stock order forms certifying that she was purchasing stock solely for her own account and was not transferring her purchase rights or the underlying stock to anyone else.Â Â  The SECâs complaint alleges that Sterling funded his daughterâs purported stock purchases, controlled the depositing and sales of the shares issued to her, and transferred all of her purported stock sale proceeds to himself.Â Â  Because most of the 51 offerings at issue were oversubscribed, Sterlingâs scheme harmed legitimate bank depositors by limiting the amount of stock available to them., The SECâs complaint, which was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges Sterling with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder., Sterling, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, has consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the abovementioned provisions, ordering him to pay $2,084,494 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and imposing a civil monetary penalty of $150,000., <b>See Also:</b> <a href=/litigation/complaints/2010/64479.pdf title=>SEC Complaint</a> ]"

Mohammed fabricated and submitted false information to the broker-dealers on new account applications, misrepresenting, for example, the account holders income, assets, employment, and investment experience. In total, Mohammed, alone or with others, fraudulently presented to the broker-dealers checks with a total face value of approximately $1.05 million, pretending to fund the brokerage accounts but knowing that the checks were not backed by sufficient funds. Mohammed solicited and obtained some of these checks from Bangladeshi immigrants he had recruited. Mohammed also, directly or indirectly, pretended to fund the brokerage accounts with checks drawn against bank accounts that he owned or controlled., The Complaint further alleges that Mohammed, alone or with others, then purchased and sold hundreds of short term options in the accounts before the checks used to fund the accounts bounced. When the trades resulted in losses, which occurred on all but one occasion, Mohammed abandoned the brokerage accounts, leaving the broker-dealers holding the loss. On the one occasion when the trades generated a net profit, Mohammed directed the funding of the securities account with a second check backed by sufficient funds and proceeded to reap the profits from the successful trades., The SEC charged Mohammed with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The Commission seeks to enjoin Mohammed from future violations of these provisions, disgorgement of Mohammeds ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a monetary penalty., The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Queens County District Attorneys Office, and the Suffolk County Police Department., <b>See Also:</b> <a href=/litigation/complaints/2010/comp21720.pdf title=>SEC Complaint</a> ]"

Benhamou, M.D., the French doctor and a member of the Steering Committee overseeing HGSIs clinical trial of Albuferon, tipped the portfolio manager about problems encountered during Phase 3 of the trial. While serving on the Steering Committee, Benhamou also provided consulting services to the portfolio manager, with whom he had also developed a friendship over the years. According to the complaint, the portfolio manager, based on the material, non-public information provided by Benhamou, ordered the sale of the entire position of HGSI stock held by the six healthcare-related hedge funds that he co-managed, or approximately six million shares, during the six and a half weeks preceding HGSIs January 23, 2008 announcement. As a result of the sales, the hedge funds avoided losses of at least $30 million., The complaint alleges that Phase 3 of HGSIs clinical trial consisted of three arms: (1) a 1200 microgram dosage of Albuferon; (2) a 900 microgram dosage of Albuferon; and (3) a dosage of the current leading hepatitis C drug on the market. HGSI expected Phase 3 of the trial to show that the 1200 microgram dosage performed better than the current leading hepatitis C drug and had fewer side effects and thus great commercial potential. According to the complaint, from no later than December 1, 2007, until prior to the announcement, Benhamou learned of (i) two serious adverse events, including one death, that occurred in the 1200 microgram arm of the trial; (ii) the possibility and ultimate recommendation by an independent safety committee monitoring the trial to stop the 1200 microgram dosage; and (iii) HGSIs decision to follow the committees recommendation, reduce the dosage for the patients on the 1200 microgram arm to 900 micrograms, and publicly announce the changes to the trial. The complaint alleges that Benhamou tipped material non-public information about the trial to the portfolio manager, in stages, immediately upon learning of each new negative development. According to the complaint, the portfolio manager knew or should have known that Benhamou was affiliated with the Albuferon trial, that it was improper for Benhamou to consult with the portfolio manager about Phase 3 of the trial, and that Benhamou breached his duty of confidentiality to HGSI when he tipped the portfolio manager material, non-public information about the trial. The complaint alleges that the portfolio manager, based on the material, non-public information tipped by Benhamou, caused the six hedge funds to sell approximately six million shares of HGSI between December 7, 2007 and January 22, 2008, including two million shares sold in a block trade just before the markets closed on January 22, 2008. On January 23, 2008, when HGSI announced it was dropping the 1200 microgram arm of the Albuferon trial at the recommendation of the independent safety committee, HGSIs share price dropped to $5.62 by the end of the day, representing a 44 percent drop from the close of the prior day. The hedge funds avoided losses of at least $30 million., Benhamou is charged with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 [15 U.S.C.

In November 2007, GSF, an oil and gas drilling services company, merged with a subsidiary of Transocean Inc. In December 2008, the listed company became Transocean Ltd.Â , GSF will pay a total of approximately $5.9 million dollars to settle the SECâs charges.Â , The SEC complaint alleges that instead of moving its oil drilling rigs out of Nigerian waters as required by Nigerian law when GSFâs permit to temporarily import the rigs into Nigeria had expired, GSF, through its customs brokers, made illegal payments to NCS officials to secure documentation reflecting that the rigs had moved out of Nigerian waters, when in fact, the rigs had not moved at all., The SEC alleges that GSF, through its customs brokers, made other suspicious payments, some characterized as âinterventions,â to Nigerian customs officials. In addition, GSF similarly made a number of suspicious payments to government officials in Gabon, Angola, and Equatorial Guinea. These payments were described on invoices as, for example, âcustoms vacation,â âcustoms escort,â âcosts extra police to obtain visa,â âofficial dues,â and âauthorities fees.â None of the payments were accurately reflected in GSFâs books and records, nor was GSFâs system of internal accounting controls adequate at the time to detect and prevent these illegal payments.Â , Without admitting or denying the SECâs allegations, GSF has consented to the entry of a court order permanently enjoining it from violating the anti-bribery and record keeping and internal controls provisions in Section 30A and Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act. GSF also consented to the entry of a court order requiring GSF to pay disgorgement of $2,694,405, prejudgment interest of $1,063,760, and a civil penalty of $2.1 million.

(âTransoceanâ), an international provider of offshore drilling services and equipment to oil companies throughout the world, with violations of the anti-bribery, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (âFCPAâ). Transocean has agreed to pay disgorgement, interest, and a civil penalty totaling $7,265,080 to settle the charges.Â , The SECâs complaint alleges that:, From at least 2002 through 2007, Transocean made illicit payments through its customs agents to Nigerian government officials to extend the temporary importation status of its drilling rigs, to obtain false paperwork associated with its drilling rigs, and obtain inward clearance authorizations for its rigs and a bond registration. In addition, Transocean made illicit payments through Panalpina World Transport Holding Ltd.âs Pancourier express courier service to Nigerian government officials to expedite the import of various goods, equipment and materials into Nigeria. In most instances, customs duties for these items were not paid by either Panalpina or Transocean. Transocean also made illicit payments through Panalpina to Nigerian government officials to expedite the delivery of medicine and other materials into Nigeria. Transoceanâs total gains from the conduct were approximately $5,981,693., In 2002, certain Transocean managers, including the then Executive Vice President, Operations and Chief Operating Officer (âCOOâ), authorized four âpaper movesâ for two rigs operating in Nigeria because Transocean was unwilling to interrupt profitable drilling operations once the relevant Temporary Import Permit (âTIPâ) or TIP extension had expired. On June 10, 2002, Transoceanâs then Country Manager in Nigeria sent an e-mail to the then Africa Region Manager, indicating that there was a temporary import issue related to three rigs. In the e-mail the Country Manager sought permission to do paper moves, which would falsely depict the rigs leaving and reentering the country. The Country Manager indicated that the paper moves were necessary in order to create a more âdefendableâ file and to enable Transocean to avoid severe penalties connected to failing to move the rigs once the relevant TIP had expired. The e-mail also contained a quote from Transoceanâs customs agent for the cost of obtaining false paperwork related to the paper moves from the Nigeria Customs Service (âNCSâ). The Country Manager added that âThe only alternative is to physically move the rigs out of the country, and this is clearly not acceptable.â On June 11, 2002, the Africa Region Manager sent an e-mail to the Executive Vice President, Operations and COO in Houston, seeking authorization for the paper moves. The same day, the Executive Vice President, Operations and COO sent an e-mail approving the paper moves. Another paper move involving a third rig also occurred in 2002, and two additional paper moves involving a fourth rig occurred in 2007. Transoceanâs total gain from the paper moves was approximately $4,261,363.Â , Prior to the 2007 paper moves, Transocean was on notice of problems with its TIP process. On April 27, 2004, the Nigerian Temporary Import Permit Panel (the âTIP Panelâ) notified Transocean that Transocean would be penalized approximately $1.17 million after an investigation showed Transocean had not complied with TIP laws. In May 2004, Transoceanâs Corporate Affairs Manager in Nigeria sent several emails informing the Transocean customs supervisor that he had visited a member of the TIP Panel and discussed making a payment to reduce the penalty. In particular, the email stated that âWe will spend money on them [TIP Panel members] through him, but definitely we will pay less to the Federal Government.â On July 28, 2004, the penalty was reduced to $340,000. While there is no record indicating what payment, if any, was in fact made to the Nigerian TIP Panel official, the TIP Panel investigation put Transocean on notice that there were problems with the TIP process., From approximately 2002 to 2006, Transocean also made illicit payments totaling $207,170 to a second customs agent for what were described on invoices as âcustoms interventionâ charges related to six rigs. Transoceanâs employees believed that the invoiced âinterventionâ charges were likely illicit payments to customs officials. From 2002 to 2007, Transocean also made illicit payments to Nigerian customs officials through Panalpina, a freight forwarding company headquartered in Switzerland, and Panalpinaâs express door to door courier service, Pancourier, to import goods and materials into Nigeria without paying applicable duties to Nigerian customs officials. Pancourier invoiced Transocean for âlocal processing chargesâ related to the shipments, and the invoice amounts were typically 25% to 40% of the actual duties owed.Â , The total customs duties that Transocean avoided through its use of Pancourier were approximately $1,480,419. Transocean also used Panalpina to make illicit payments to Nigerian government officials to expedite the delivery of medicine and other goods totaling $32,741., Transocean violated Section 30A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 when its senior management and employees made illicit payments through their freight forwarding and customs agents to Nigerian government officials to obtain various customs-related benefits. Transocean violated Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act by failing to devise and maintain an effective system of internal controls to prevent or detect the violations. Transocean violated Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act by failing to make and keep accurate books and records. In related criminal proceedings, Transocean Ltd. and Transocean Inc. reached a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice, Fraud Section and agreed to pay $13.44 million., Without admitting or denying the Commissionâs allegations, Transocean has consented to the entry of a court order permanently enjoining it from future violations of Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and ordering it to pay $5,981,693 in disgorgement, plus prejudgment interest of $1,283,387.Â , The SEC acknowledges assistance from the U.S. Department of Justice, Fraud Section and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.Â , <b>See Also:</b> <a href=/litigation/complaints/2010/comp21725.pdf>SEC Complaint</a> ]"

The bribery schemes allowed Pride and its subsidiaries to extend drilling contracts, obtain the release of drilling rigs and other equipment from customs officials, reduce customs duties, extend the temporary importation status of drilling rigs, lower various tax assessments, and obtain other improper benefits., To settle the SECâs charges, Pride will pay disgorgement of $19,341,870 plus pre-judgment interest of $4,187,848. The company will pay an additional $32,625,000 to resolve related criminal proceedings announced today by the Department of Justice., According to the SECâs complaint, from 2003 through 2005, Prideâs former Venezuela country manager authorized bribes totaling approximately $384,000 to an official of Venezuelaâs state-owned oil company to secure extensions of three drilling contracts. In addition, the country manager authorized a bribe of approximately $30,000 to an employee of Venezuelaâs state-owned oil company to secure the payment of receivables., The SEC alleges that in 2003 a French subsidiary of Pride paid three bribes totaling approximately $500,000, believing that the funds would be given to an Indian judge to influence customs litigation relating to the importation of a drilling rig. According to the complaint, a Pride employee in the U.S. had knowledge of the payments at the time they were made.Â , The complaint alleges that in 2004 a former Pride vice president authorized a $10,000 bribe to a Mexican customs official in return for favorable treatment regarding customs deficiencies identified during an inspection of a supply boat., The SECâs complaint also alleges that from 2001 through 2006 numerous improper payments made by Pride subsidiaries operating in Mexico, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, the Republic of the Congo, and Libya were not correctly recorded in those subsidiariesâ books and records. As a result, the complaint alleges that Pride failed to make and keep accurate books and records and failed to devise and maintain appropriate internal controls., Without admitting or denying the SECâs allegations, Pride consented to the entry of a final judgment ordering disgorgement plus pre-judgment interest and permanently enjoining it from violating the anti-bribery, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the FCPA, codified as Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The proposed settlement is subject to court approval., The Department of Justice charged Pride in a criminal information filed today with conspiring to violate the anti-bribery and books and records provisions of the FCPA, violating the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA, and violating the books and records provisions of the FCPA. The department and Pride International agreed to resolve the charges by entering into a deferred prosecution agreement. The department also filed a criminal information charging a Pride subsidiary with conspiring to violate the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA, violating the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA, and aiding and abetting the violation of the books and records provisions of the FCPA. Prideâs subsidiary agreed to plead guilty to the charges. The agreements require the payment of a $32,625,000 criminal penalty.Â , The SEC previously charged two former Pride employeesâBobby Benton and Joe Summersâfor their roles in the scheme. The SEC filed a civil action against Benton on December 11, 2009 and the court entered final judgment on August 9, 2010.

(Panalpina), in concert with other PWT subsidiaries and affiliates (Panalpina Group), bribed government officials in countries including Nigeria, Angola, Brazil, Russia, and Kazakhstan. The bribes were paid by Panalpina to obtain preferential customs, duties, and import treatment for its customers in connection with international freight shipments. Although PWT, Panalpina, and the Panalpina Group are not issuers for purposes of the FCPA, many of their customers are. By paying bribes on behalf of issuers, Panalpina both violated and aided and abetted violations of the FCPA., To settle the SECs charges, Panalpina will pay $11,329,369. PWT and Panalpina will pay an additional $70,560,000 to resolve related criminal proceedings announced today by the Department of Justice., The complaint alleges that although the bribery schemes varied, most shared several similarities. The customers often used Panalpina or other Panalpina Group companies to ship goods internationally or sought Panalpinas assistance in obtaining customs or logistics services in the country to which goods were shipped. For various reasonsâincluding delayed departures, insufficient or incorrect documentation, the nature of the goods being shipped and imported, or the refusal of local government officials to provide services without unofficial paymentsâPanalpinas customers sometimes faced delays in importing goods. In other cases, Panalpinas customers sought to avoid local customs duties or inspection requirements or otherwise sought to import goods in circumvention of local law. In order to secure the importation of goods under these circumstances, Panalpinas customers often authorized Panalpina and other Panalpina Group companies to bribe foreign officials., The complaint further alleges that Panalpina Group companies invoiced Panalpinas customers for the bribes. The invoices, which contained both legitimate and illegitimate charges, concealed the bribes by inaccurately referring to them as local processing, special intervention, special handing, and other seemingly legitimate fees., Without admitting or denying the SECs allegations, Panalpina consented to the entry of a final judgment ordering disgorgement and permanently enjoining it from violating the FCPAs anti-bribery provisions and aiding and abetting violations of the FCPAs books and records and internal controls provisions. These provisions are codified as Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The proposed settlement is subject to court approval., The Department of Justice today filed a criminal information charging PWT with conspiring to violate and violating the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA. The department and PWT agreed to resolve the charges by entering into a deferred prosecution agreement. The department also filed a criminal information charging Panalpina with conspiring to violate the books and records provisions of the FCPA and with aiding and abetting certain customers violations of the books and records provisions of the FCPA. Panalpina agreed to plead guilty to the charges. The agreements require the payment of a $70,560,000 criminal penalty., The SEC acknowledges and appreciates the assistance of the Department of Justices Fraud Section and the Federal Bureau of Investigation., The SECs investigation is continuing., <b>See Also:</b> <a href=http://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2010/comp21727.pdf>SEC Complaint</a> ]"

The SEC alleged that Noble, an offshore drilling contractor headquartered in Switzerland with an office in Sugarland, Texas, made improper payments through its custom agents to officials of the Nigeria Customs Service to obtain permits and permit extensions necessary for operating offshore oil rigs in Nigeria. As part of the settlement, Noble will pay $5,576,998 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest., The Commissions action against Noble was filed in coordination with a parallel criminal action brought by the United States Department of Justice, and several other federal civil and criminal actions against companies involved in oil operations in Nigeria., The Commissions complaint, filed today in federal court in Houston, alleges that from January 2003 through May 2007, Noble authorized payments by its Nigerian subsidiary to its customs agent, believing that the agent would give portions of the payments to Nigerian government officials to induce them to grant temporary importation permits (TIPs) and TIP extensions for Nobles drilling rigs. Although Noble was required to move its rigs out of Nigeria when TIPs and any extensions had expired, it did not do so in order to avoid the costs of moving the rigs, the potential loss of profits, and the break in performance of rigs under contract. Noble used the customs agents to submit false documents to Nigerian Customs Service showing export and re-import of its drilling rigs when in fact the rigs never moved. Noble paid its customs agents to present these false documents to the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) and, through the customs agents, made improper payments to officials of the NCS to process the false documents and issue new TIPS. Noble obtained eight TIPs with false documentation., The Commissions complaint further alleges that Noble improperly recorded in its books and records the payments that its customs agent passed on to Nigerian government officials. Noble also failed to maintain internal controls to detect and prevent these payments., In the Commissions settlement, Noble has agreed, without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, to the entry of a Court order enjoining it from violating the anti-bribery, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws. The order also requires that Noble disgorge ill-gotten gains of $4,294,933 and pay prejudgment interest of $1,282,065., The settlement takes into consideration Nobles self-reporting and its substantial cooperation during the investigation, as well as its remediation efforts following its extensive internal review., The Commission acknowledges the assistance and cooperation of the U.S. Department of Justices Fraud Section, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation., <b>See Also:</b> <a href=http://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2010/comp21728.pdf>SEC Complaint</a> ]"

The SEC further alleges that from January 2002 through March 2007, Tidewater, through a subsidiary, reimbursed approximately $1.6 million to its customs broker in Nigeria used to make improper payments to local Nigerian customs officials. These improper payments were made in order to induce the Nigerian officials to disregard regulatory requirements in Nigeria relating to the temporary importation of Tidewaters vessels into Nigerian waters. Tidewater improperly recorded these payments as legitimate expenses in its books and records., The SECs complaint charges that Tidewater violated Section 30A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) by making illicit payments to Azeri government officials through its subsidiaries and agent. The complaint also charges Tidewater with violating Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act for improperly recording the Azeri and Nigerian payments in its books and records and Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act for failing to have adequate internal controls to detect and prevent the illegal payments., Without admitting or denying the SECs allegations, Tidewater has consented to a court order permanently enjoining it from future violations of these statutory provisions; and ordering it to pay $7,223,216 in disgorgement plus prejudgment interest of $881,146, and a $217,000 civil penalty.

Rajaratnam is the founder and a Managing General Partner of Galleon, a New York hedge fund, which at the time of the alleged insider trading had billions of dollars under management. When the SECs complaint was filed, Goel, a friend of Rajaratnams, was a managing director within the treasury group of Intel Corp. (Intel), as well as the Director of Strategic Investments at Intel Capital, an Intel subsidiary that makes proprietary equity investments in technology companies. Khan was an individual investor who had been employed at Intel in the late 1990s and had been subsequently employed at Galleon., The SEC alleged that Rajaratnam unlawfully traded based on inside information involving numerous companies. It further alleged that Goel acquired material non-public information while working at Intel and passed that information to Rajaratnam, who traded on it. The SEC also alleged that Khan acquired material non-public information from several sources, including a senior executive at Polycom, Inc., a Moodys rating agency analyst, and an employee at an investor relations consulting firm, and traded on that information.

The judgment in <i>SEC v. Duane Martin, et al.</i>, 09-cv-05259 (N.D.

It also permanently bars him from participating in any penny stock offerings and from serving as an officer or director of a public company. The Courts Order was entered based on Martins Consent to Final Judgment in which he neither admitted nor denied the allegations in the Commissions Complaint., In its Complaint, the Commission alleged that Martin violated the registration provisions by improperly registering a Universal stock offering using Form S-8 â a registration method that is meant to cover offerings to bona fide employees and consultants of the company â and then surreptitiously directed the S-8 shares to stock promoters and Martins personal creditors. The Complaint also alleges that Martin violated the antifraud provisions for multiple material misrepresentations and omissions to Universals investors designed to hide the fact that Martin (a) improperly paid himself deferred salary, (b) had misappropriated company assets to pay himself and his creditors, (c) funneled S-8 shares to stock promoters and his creditors, and (d) took $234,430.66 in short-term loans from Universal in violation of Section 13(k) of the Exchange Act. To hide his self-dealing, Martin misled Universals outside auditor and forged invoices to disguise payments he directed to his creditors. In so doing, Martin violated the Exchange Acts books and records provisions and aided and abetted Universals violations of the Exchange Acts reporting provisions., On Mar. 16, 2010 â based largely on the same set of facts developed in the Commissions investigation â the United States Attorneys Office for the Northern District of Illinois (the USAO) brought a criminal wire fraud charge against Martin.

Tex.)(November 9, 2010)</h2>, <h2>SEC Charges Texas Oil and Gas Promoters and their Companies with Fraud</h2>]","[, On November 9, 2010, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed an emergency civil action against Garry B. Smith, Robert J. Nelson and their Lewisville, Texas-based companies, Overland Energy, Inc. and Acorn Energy, Inc., for their roles in defrauding investors in oil and gas securities offerings. The Commission also charged one of Overlands most prolific salesmen, Steven M. Ray, with violating federal broker-registration requirements. Another entity Smith and Nelson control, Tega Operating Company, was named as a relief defendant., The same day, Judge Schneider of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas entered a temporary restraining order against Smith, Nelson and Acorn. The Court also froze the assets of Overland, Acorn, Smith, Nelson and Tega, and granted the Commission other legal and equitable relief., The Commissions complaint alleges that, from at least September 2007 to the present, Smith and Nelson raised approximately $11 million dollars from more than 180 investors nationwide, through six securities offerings conducted through Overland and Acorn. The complaint further alleges that the first five offerings were sold by unregistered salespeople employed by Overland, including Smith, Nelson and Ray. According to the Commission, Overland and Acorn gave prospective investors private placement memoranda (PPM), approved by Smith and Nelson, which contained material misrepresentations and omissions about the use of offering proceeds, potential oil and gas production, and potential investment returns. Specifically, the Commission contends that the PPMs represented that approximately 82% of funds raised would be spent on leasehold costs and to drill, test, complete and equip oil and gas wells. In fact, the Commission alleges that less than half of the funds raised went to these costs. Instead, according to the complaint, Smith and Nelson diverted the majority of funds to other purposes, including extensive international travel for themselves and family members; concerts; fine restaurants; private flight instruction; and lavish bonuses and dividends they frequently paid themselves. The complaint also alleges that the defendants enticed investors with claims that the wells would be highly productive and would return investors initial investment in one to two years. The Commission contends that these claims were unfounded, speculative and materially misleading., The complaint charges that Overland, Smith and Nelson violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The Commission also alleges that Acorn violated Sections 17(a) of the Securities Act and Sections 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Ray is charged with violating Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act. In addition to the relief already obtained, the Commission seeks appointment of a receiver, civil penalties, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief and disgorgement of ill-gotten gains against the defendants. Against Tega, the Commission seeks to recover investor funds it improperly received., <b>See Also:</b> <a href=/litigation/complaints/2010/comp21736.pdf title=>SEC Complaint</a> ]"

The Final Judgment enjoined Entrust and Mathur, its principal, from engaging in future violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and held all three defendants jointly and severally liable for $12,572,237.28 in disgorgement., The Commission filed its action against Mathur and Entrust, an investment advisory firm based in Worcester, Massachusetts, on April 12, 2005 and filed an Amended Complaint adding Raheev Johar, Mathurs partner at Entrust, as a defendant on September 14, 2005. The Commissions Amended Complaint alleged that, from 2000 through 2005, the defendants engaged in a scheme to defraud investors in a purported hedge fund run by Mathur and Johar at Entrust. The Amended Complaint alleged that approximately twenty clients invested over $16 million with Entrust. The Commission alleged that the defendants made material misrepresentations to investors about, among other things, their assets under management and returns that the fund generated. According to the Amended Complaint, the defendants dissipated most of the $16 million invested through undisclosed trading losses and misappropriation of investor funds for the defendants personal use. The Commissions Amended Complaint further alleged that Mathur, Johar, and Entrust transferred at least $1 million in investor funds to AMR Realty, a real estate investment company controlled by Mathur, which the Commission alleged had no legitimate interest in the funds. The Court, on April 12, 2005, entered a temporary restraining order and asset freeze against Mathur and Entrust and an asset freeze against AMR Realty and on September 21, 2005 entered a preliminary injunction and asset freeze against Johar. A Final Judgment by consent was entered against Johar in the Commission action on June 4, 2007, which, among other things, ordered him to pay over $600,000 in disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and penalties.

A federal judge sentenced Mathur in May 2009 to ten years in federal prison. Upon release from imprisonment, Mathur will be placed on supervised release for three years. The Court also ordered Mathur to pay restitution in the amount of $12,572,237.28 and a special assessment of $2,000.00. In separate administrative proceedings following Mathurs criminal conviction, the Commission issued an Order by consent on July 14, 2008, barring Mathur from association with any investment adviser., The Final Judgment against Mathur, Entrust, and AMR Realty enjoined Mathur and Entrust from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

(November 16, 2010).</i></h2>]","[, On November 16, 2010, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed an emergency civil action in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado against Richard Dalton and Universal Consulting Resources LLC (UCR) in connection with a Ponzi scheme. The Commission is also seeking an order to freeze the assets of Daltonâs wife, Marie Dalton, who is named as a relief defendant., The Commission alleges that from about March 2007 through about June 2010, the Ponzi scheme raised approximately $17 million from 130 investors in 13 states. Dalton and his company, UCR, solicited investors for two fraudulent offerings that were generally referred to as the âTrading Programâ and the âDiamond Programâ and promised returns of between 60% to 120% per year. The Commission alleges that investors in both programs received monthly payments which Dalton told them were profits from successful trading. However, the majority of funds that came into UCR bank accounts were from new investors, not from any actual profit-generating activity. The complaint alleges that Dalton, who had no other employment or legitimate source of income, funded his personal life at the expense of investors and also transferred more than $900,000 in order to purchase a home in the name of his wife., According to the complaint, Dalton told investors in the Trading Program that their money would be held safely in an escrow account at a bank in the United States, and that a European trader would use the value of that account, but not the actual funds, to obtain leveraged funds to purchase and sell bank notes. According to Dalton, the trading was profitable enough that he was able to guarantee returns of four to five percent per month â or 48 to 60% per year â to investors. Dalton claimed that he had successfully run the Trading Program for nine years., The Commission alleges that in early 2009, UCR began offering the Diamond Program, which Dalton claimed would profit by using investor funds for diamond trading. Similar to the Trading Program, Dalton claimed that investor funds would be safely held in an escrow account. Under the Diamond program, Dalton enticed investors with a guaranteed ten percent monthly return â or 120% yearly return., The SECs complaint alleges that Dalton and UCR violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 10(b) and 15(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also names Marie Dalton as a relief defendant in order to recover investor assets now in her possession. In addition to seeking an immediate asset freeze and temporary restraining order, the SEC will also seek permanent injunctions, disgorgement plus pre-judgment interest, and financial penalties against Dalton and UCR, and disgorgement from Marie Dalton., <b>See Also:</b> <a href=/litigation/complaints/2010/comp21747.pdf title=>SEC Complaint</a> ]"
21748,2010,"[<h2>U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION</h2>, <h2>Litigation Release No. 21748 / November 18, 2010</h2>, <h2><i>Securities and Exchange Commission v. Steven L. Rattner, 10 CV 8699Â  (S.D.N.Y.)</i></h2>]","[, The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged former Quadrangle Group principal Steven Rattner with participating in a widespread kickback scheme to obtain investments from New Yorkâs largest pension fund., The SEC alleges that Rattner secured investments for Quadrangle from the New York State Common Retirement Fund after he arranged for a firm affiliate to distribute the DVD of a low-budget film produced by the Retirement Fundâs chief investment officer and his brothers.Â  Rattner then caused Quadrangle to retain Henry Morris â the top political advisor and chief fundraiser for former New York State Comptroller Alan Hevesi â as a âplacement agentâ and pay him more than $1 million in sham fees even though Rattner was already dealing directly with then-New York State Deputy Comptroller David Loglisci and did not need an introduction to the Retirement Fund., The SEC alleges that after receiving pressure from Morris, Rattner also arranged a $50,000 contribution to Hevesiâs re-election campaign.Â  Just a month later, Loglisci increased the Retirement Fundâs investment with Quadrangle from $100 million to $150 million.Â  As a result of the $150 million investment with Quadrangle, the Retirement Fund paid management fees to a Quadrangle subsidiary.Â  By virtue of his partnership interest in Quadrangle and its affiliates, Rattnerâs personal share of these fees totals approximately $3 million., Rattner agreed to settle the SECâs charges by paying $6.2 million and consenting to a two-year bar from associating with any investment adviser or broker-dealer., The SEC previously charged Morris and Loglisci for orchestrating the fraudulent scheme that extracted kickbacks from investment management firms seeking to manage the assets of the Retirement Fund.Â  The SEC charged Quadrangle earlier this year., According to the SECâs complaint against Rattner filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Morris informed Rattner in the fall of 2003 that Loglisciâs brother was involved in producing a film called âChooch.âÂ  Morris suggested that Rattner help Loglisciâs brother with the theatrical distribution of the film.Â  Rattner met with Loglisciâs brother and agreed to assist him, but Rattnerâs efforts did not lead to a distribution deal.Â  Approximately one year later, Loglisciâs brother contacted Rattner about DVD distribution of âChooch.âÂ  Within days of speaking to Loglisciâs brother, Rattner contacted Loglisci about investing in a new Quadrangle private equity fund being marketed by the firm.Â  Rattner told Loglisci that he had arranged a meeting between Loglisciâs brother and a Quadrangle affiliate â GT Brands â to discuss a possible DVD distribution deal.Â , The SEC alleges that after Loglisciâs brother met with GT Brands and telephoned Rattner to complain about the treatment he had received from GT Brands, Rattner warned a GT Brands executive to treat Loglisciâs brother âcarefullyâ because Quadrangle was trying to obtain an investment through Loglisci.Â  After GT Brands made clear to Rattner that it was not interested in distributing the film, Rattner instructed the GT Brands executive to âdance alongâ with Loglisciâs brother.Â  According to an e-mail, Rattner telephoned Morris to inquire whether âGT needs to distribute [the Chooch] videoâ in order to secure an investment from the Retirement Fund.Â  Morris offered to ânose aroundâ to determine how important the DVD distribution deal was to Loglisci.Â  GT Brands ultimately reversed course and offered to manufacture and distribute the DVD at a discount from its standard fee.Â  Rattner approved the proposed terms of the distribution deal., The SECâs complaint alleges that in late October 2004, after Rattner and others from Quadrangle had already met with Loglisci and the Retirement Fundâs private equity consultant and received encouraging feedback from both of them, Morris met with Rattner and offered his placement agent services to Quadrangle.Â  Morris warned Rattner that Quadrangleâs negotiations with the Retirement Fund could always fall apart.Â  Although Quadrangle was already working with a placement agent, Quadrangle agreed to pay Morris as well.Â , According to the SECâs complaint, soon after Quadrangle retained Morris as a placement agent and Rattner had advised Morris that GT Brands was moving forward with the deal to distribute the Chooch DVD, Loglisci personally informed Rattner that the Retirement Fund would be making a $100 million investment in the Quadrangle fund.Â , The SEC alleges that Morris later contacted Rattner and pressed him for a financial contribution to Hevesiâs re-election campaign.Â  Although Rattner purportedly had a personal policy that he would not make political contributions to politicians who have influence over public pension funds, Rattner agreed to find someone else to make the contribution.Â  After speaking with Morris, Rattner asked a friend and the friendâs wife to each contribute $25,000 to Hevesiâs campaign.Â  The day after these contributions were communicated to Hevesiâs campaign staff, Hevesi telephoned Rattner and left him a message thanking him for the contribution.Â  In late May 2006, Rattnerâs friend transmitted the promised campaign contributions to Rattner, who forwarded the two checks to Hevesiâs campaign.Â  Approximately one month later, Loglisci committed the Retirement Fund to an additional $50 million investment in the Quadrangle fund., In settling the SECâs charges without admitting or denying the allegations, Rattner consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 and orders him to pay approximately $3.2 million in disgorgement and a $3 million penalty.Â  The settlement is subject to court approval.Â  Rattner also consented to the entry of a Commission order that will bar him for two years from associating with any investment adviser or broker-dealer., The SECâs investigation was conducted by Joseph Sansone and Maureen Lewis of the New York Regional Office.Â  The investigation is continuing., For further information, see Litigation Release No. <a

Civ. 10 CV 8701)</h2>]","[, The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a pair of longtime employees at Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC (BMIS) with playing key roles in the Madoff Ponzi scheme.Â  One employee produced phony account statements for investors and feathered her own accounts for personal gain, while the other conspired to cash out Madoffâs friends and family as the fraud collapsed in addition to creating phony account statements and tracking the Ponzi scheme bank account., The SEC alleges that Annette Bongiorno, who began working for BMIS in an administrative capacity in 1968, regularly created false books and records and helped mislead investors in telephone conversations and through account statements and trade confirmations that reported securities transactions that never happened and positions that never existed.Â  Bongiorno also created false trades in her own BMIS accounts that enabled her to cash out millions of dollars more than she deposited., The SEC further alleges that JoAnn Crupi, who was responsible for supervising the primary bank account used in BMISâs investment advisory operations, helped facilitate the fraud and mislead investors, auditors, and regulators into believing that BMIS was a legitimate enterprise.Â  When the fraud was on the verge of collapse, Crupi helped decide which accounts should be cashed out and prepared checks for those selected investors, many of them who were friends or family of Madoff., According to the SECâs complaint against Bongiorno filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Bongiorno created trades that were chosen with the benefit of hindsight to generate large âgainsâ in BMIS accounts.Â  The trades and positions reported in investor accounts, however, were fictional.Â  Bongiorno also fabricated trades in her own BMIS accounts, depositing approximately $920,000 into these accounts but withdrawing approximately $14.5 million. Â The high balances and withdrawals were made possible only through the sham, backdated, highly profitable âtradesâ that Bongiorno fabricated., According to the SECâs complaint against Crupi, also filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, she was hired in 1983 as a keypunch operator in BMISâs investment advisory operations and reported to Bongiorno.Â  She eventually supervised some lower-level BMIS employees and worked closely with Frank DiPascali, another high-level BMIS lieutenant <a href=/news/press/2009/2009-182.htm>charged by the SEC last year</a>.Â  Crupi had exclusive control over two important aspects of the BMIS fraud: she handled the primary bank account used in the Ponzi scheme, and she created false trading portfolios and account statements related to a purported hedging strategy using baskets of stock for a group of limited partnership funds managed by a longtime BMIS investor., The SEC alleges that Crupi knew the true financial condition of Madoffâs Ponzi scheme and its dwindling assets.Â  On Dec. 3, 2008, DiPascali told Crupi that the scheme was on the verge of collapse, and they met shortly thereafter to discuss the implications of the collapse in more detail.Â  Crupi continued to process client deposits during this time period, depositing approximately $59 million of client checks into the Ponzi scheme bank account from December 4 to December 12.Â  In the final days of the fraud, when the money available to meet investor redemptions had dwindled to a few hundred million dollars, DiPascali convinced Madoff to use the remaining funds to liquidate the accounts of family and friends of the firm, including employees, and not to honor redemption requests by the larger institutional investors.Â  Crupi helped DiPascali review BMIS investor lists and identify which accounts should be cashed out.Â  Madoff approved these actions and Crupi prepared checks for the selected investors totaling more than $350 million.Â  Madoff was arrested and the checks were seized before they could be distributed., The SECâs complaints against Bongiorno and Crupi specifically allege that by their actions, they violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act; violated and aided and abetted violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and aided and abetted violations of Sections 204, 206(1) and 206(2) of the Advisers Act and Rule 204-2 thereunder and Sections 15(c) and 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-3 and 17a-3 thereunder.Â  Among other things, the SECâs complaints seek permanent injunctions, financial penalties and court orders requiring Bongiorno and Crupi to disgorge their ill-gotten gains., The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Southern District of New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, with which the Commission has coordinated its investigation.Â  The SECâs investigation is continuing., For more information see prior litigation release nos. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20834.htm>20834</a>, <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr20889.htm>20889</a>, <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr20959.htm>20959</a>, <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21095.htm>21095</a>, <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21096.htm>21096</a>, <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21174.htm>21174</a>, <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21292.htm>21292</a>, and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21292.htm>21424</a>., <b>See Also:</b>      SEC Complaints: <a href=/litigation/complaints/2010/comp21750-crupi.pdf>Joann Crupi</a> and <a href=/litigation/complaints/2010/comp21750-bongiorno.pdf>Annette Bongiorno</a> ]"

From 1989 until the filing of the SECâs action Moskop and his company, Moskop misappropriated most of the life savings of at least two elderly investors.Â , The Honorable Rebecca R. Pallmeyer, United States District Court Judge, granted the Commissionâs motion for emergency relief, including an order temporarily restraining Moskop and his company from committing further violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and an order freezing the assets of Moskop and his company., The SECâs complaint alleged that Moskop and his company have defrauded an elderly couple since 1989 by falsely claiming to make securities investments on their behalf. Moskop, who is 62 years old, is a former registered representative and a licensed insurance broker. Moskop is the principal of Moskop &amp; Associates, which is located in Belleville, Illinois. In an earlier incident unrelated to the SECâs charges, the NASD (n/k/a FINRA) in 1990 imposed an associational bar against Moskop for the misappropriation of client funds. According to the SECâs complaint in this matter, Moskop received funds from an elderly couple on numerous different occasions throughout the years, with directions to invest their funds in securities such as fixed-rate trusts and certificates of deposit. In reality, the SEC alleged, Moskop misappropriated the investorsâ funds and never made the investments. Throughout the scheme, Moskop and Moskop &amp; Associates sent the elderly couple account statements identifying non-existent investments in various securities. According to the SECâs complaint, Moskop also forged documentation related to the purported investments, including creating counterfeit CDs supposedly issued by a major insurance company.

The Commission alleges that investors in both programs received monthly payments which Dalton told them were profits from successful trading. However, the majority of funds that came into UCR bank accounts were from new investors, not from any actual profit-generating activity. The complaint alleges that Dalton, who had no other employment or legitimate source of income, funded his personal life at the expense of investors and also transferred more than $900,000 in order to purchase a home in the name of his wife., According to the complaint, Dalton told investors in the Trading Program that their money would be held safely in an escrow account at a bank in the United States, and that a European trader would use the value of that account, but not the actual funds, to obtain leveraged funds to purchase and sell bank notes. According to Dalton, the trading was profitable enough that he was able to guarantee returns of four to five percent per month â or 48 to 60% per year â to investors. Dalton claimed that he had successfully run the Trading Program for nine years., The Commission alleges that in early 2009, UCR began offering the Diamond Program, which Dalton claimed would profit by using investor funds for diamond trading. Similar to the Trading Program, Dalton claimed that investor funds would be safely held in an escrow account. Under the Diamond program, Dalton enticed investors with a guaranteed ten percent monthly return â or 120% yearly return., The SECs complaint alleges that Dalton and UCR violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 10(b) and 15(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also names Marie Dalton as a relief defendant in order to recover investor assets now in her possession. The SEC will also seek permanent injunctions, disgorgement plus pre-judgment interest, and financial penalties against Dalton and UCR, and disgorgement from Marie Dalton., <b>See Also:</b> <a href=/litigation/complaints/2010/comp21754.pdf title=>SEC Complaint</a> ]"

The complaint alleges that the defendants generally told investors that the Notes were safe and high-yielding and that the Note proceeds would be invested in real estate or real estate related projects. The defendants also told investors that each Note would be secured by a mortgage security deed on a particular property in Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama, North Carolina, or South Carolina at a loan to value ratio of no more than 60 to 75%. The complaint alleges that these representations were false because no mortgage security deeds on properties were ever created, and Petty admitted that the Note proceeds were not invested in real estate or real estate related projects. The complaint further alleges that the defendants scheme is ongoing and that as recently as November 16, 2010, the defendants were posting messages on various Google Groups that solicit investors to purchase three month Notes that pay 18% quarterly which Petty describes as 72% Annualized Returns., In its Complaint, the Commission alleges that the defendants violated Sections 5(a) and (c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.

According to the complaint, the defendants raised the money by inducing borrowers to transfer ownership of millions of shares of publicly traded stock to them as collateral for purported non-recourse loans based on a false promise to return the shares to borrowers who repaid their loans. In fact, the defendants generally sold all of the stock received from borrowers before funding each loan. After funding each loan, the Spillans did not set aside any cash reserves to repurchase and return shares to borrowers who repaid their loans.

After receiving the illegal tips, the brother-in-law took financial positions in U.S. companies that were targets of acquisitions by Arnold McClellans clients. His subsequent trades were closely timed with telephone calls between Annabel McClellan and her sister, and with in-person visits with the McClellans. Their insider trading reaped illegal profits of approximately $3 million in U.S. dollars, half of which was to be funneled back to Annabel McClellan., The UK Financial Services Authority (FSA) <a href=/cgi-bin/goodbye.cgi?www.fsa.gov.uk/pages/Library/Communication/PR/2010/166.shtml>has announced charges</a> against the two relatives â James and Miranda Sanders of London. The FSA also charged colleagues of James Sanders whom he tipped with the nonpublic information in the course of his work at his London-based derivatives firm. Sanderss tippees and clients of his trading firm made approximately $20 million in U.S. dollars by trading on the inside information., According to the SECs complaint, Arnold McClellan had access to highly confidential information while serving as the head of one of Deloittes regional mergers and acquisitions teams. He provided tax and other advice to Deloittes clients that were considering corporate acquisitions., The SEC alleges that between 2006 and 2008, James Sanders used the non-public information obtained from the McClellans to purchase derivative financial instruments known as spread bets that are pegged to the price of the underlying U.S. stock. The trading started modestly, with James Sanders buying the equivalent of 1,000 shares of stock in a company that Arnold McClellans client was attempting to acquire. Subsequent deals netted significant trading profits, and eventually James Sanders was taking large positions and passing along information about Arnold McClellans deals to colleagues and clients at his trading firm as well as to his father., Among the confidential impending transactions allegedly revealed by McClellan:, The SECs complaint alleges the following chronology involving insider trading around the Kronos transaction:, The SECs complaint charges Arnold and Annabel McClellan with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.

The Commissions complaint alleges that, from April 2007 to May 2008, the defendants raised approximately $9 million from 20 investors nationwide by selling unregistered, high-yield interests in a Prime Bank scheme through the now-defunct company, Quantum Funding Strategies, LLC. Prime Bank schemes lure investors with the promise of astronomical profits and the chance to be a part of an exclusive, international investing program., The Commissions complaint alleges that investors were told that their funds would be pooled and placed with an escrow agent and then used to secure money from high-net worth funders. That money would be held in a blocked funds account and would be used as collateral for traders to buy and sell bank notes and other instruments. Dodge, together with Carroll, Davis and her company, Cornerstone, promised investors they would receive between 25% and 100% weekly returns on their investments, without risking loss of investment principal. According to the complaint, Dodge also misled investors about her past success with similar trading schemes, and Carroll misrepresented that he was a licensed securities broker and that he had verified the validity of the Private Placement program. The complaint further alleges that investors never earned any returns because the defendants never completed the promised transactions., The Commissions complaint alleges that Dodge and Carroll violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The complaint seeks disgorgement from Dodge and Carroll, and injunctive relief and civil money penalties from all the defendants. Without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, Dodge partially settled the Commissions charges by consenting to the entry of an agreed judgment enjoining her from violating Securities Act Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) and Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

At that time, the Honorable Richard J. Holwell granted the Commissionâs request to freeze the Defendantsâ assets pending a preliminary hearing. On June 17, 2010, the Commission obtained a preliminary injunction against BroCo and Maltsev., According to the amended complaint filed today, the Commission alleges that BroCo and Maltsev controlled an omnibus account that was used to turn $2,080 into $627,633 in a six-month period by repeatedly buying and selling securities contemporaneously with unauthorized trades that had been placed in compromised accounts at various U.S. broker-dealers., The amended complaint alleges that BroCo and Maltsev violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws as a result of the fraudulent trading being conducted through their omnibus account. BroCo and Maltsev ignored several red flags that should have alerted them to the fraudulent activity including the massive short term trading gains being realized in the account, internal memoranda that identified the suspicious trading, and the constant repatriation of funds., In settling the SECâs charges without admitting or denying the allegations, BroCo agreed to pay $627,633 in disgorgement plus prejudgment interest and a $627,633 penalty.

The defendants attracted investors by, among other things, touting impressive monthly returns posted on MexGroups web site. In early December 2008, however, investors learned that their accounts were virtually wiped out in the previous month. MexGroup gave a number of explanations, eventually blaming allegedly illegal conduct by a Swiss Forex trading firm through which it executed trades., The Complaint further alleges that beyond the fact that none of the defendants understood how the Forex market or Forex trading functioned, neither Oram, Winker or Michael took any significant steps to investigate MexGroup, its principals, or the viability of the investment. Instead, they blindly accepted MexGroups representations about its background, veracity, and track record. Further, Michael and his company used MexGroups purported performance numbers on his companys website and made misleading representations and omissions regarding their own Forex trading experience. Even more egregious, Winkler and Oram continued to offer and sell the MBFX offering even after the November 2008 collapse., In its Complaint, the Commission alleges that the defendants violated Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.

Konigsberg and Fischler thought they were paying-off a corrupt pension fund employee, stockbroker, and middlemen. In reality, the pension fund employee and the stockbroker were fictitious persons, and the middlemen were an undercover FBI agent and a cooperating witness., According to the SECs complaint, two of the schemes involved Konigsberg and Fischler paying kickbacks to a purported corrupt pension fund employee to buy restricted shares of stock in two microcap companies, MediSys Corp. and Casino Management of America, Inc., n/k/a Crosslands Energy Corp. The SECs complaint alleges Konigsberg and Fischler understood they needed to disguise the kickbacks as payments to a phony consulting company that they knew would perform no actual work. According to the complaint, in two other schemes, Konigsberg and Fischler paid bribes to a purported corrupt stockbroker, who in return would use his clients accounts to purchase the publicly traded stock of microcap issuers Pavillion Energy Resources, Inc. and Xtreme Motorsports International, Inc. The fraudulent buying would create the false impression in the market that these companies were developing active trading supporting a rising stock price., The SECs complaint charges the defendants with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The SEC is seeking permanent injunctions, financial penalties, and disgorgement plus prejudgment interest against all three defendants, and penny stock bars against Konigsberg and Fischler., Previously, on October 7, 2010, the SEC filed eight separate civil actions stemming from the FBI undercover operation, charging a dozen penny stock promoters and their companies for their roles in schemes to manipulate the volume and price of various microcap stocks and illegally generate stock sales.

Temple, a former Information Systems and Security Manager at a Wilmington, Del.-based law firm, accessed material nonpublic information in the course of his employment and then traded in advance of at least 22 merger and acquisition public announcements involving 20 companies that retained his former employer as counsel in some capacity.Â  Temple also tipped his brother-in-law, Benedict M. Pastro, who traded in concert with Temple in advance of twelve public announcements.Â  The pair reaped over $182,000 in illegal profits during their insider trading scheme.Â  Temple was terminated from his position on Oct. 11, 2010 once his illegal scheme was uncovered., According to the SECâs complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, the scheme began in 2009 as Temple used his IT position to access nonpublic information about impending deals involving law firm clients.Â  Temple, who lives in Newark, Delaware, corresponded with his online brokerage firm using his law firm e-mail address.Â  Electronic login records for Templeâs brokerage account reflect that he often placed trades from work.Â  Frequent telephone calls around the time of the trades indicate that Temple closely coordinated his trading with Pastro, who also lives in Newark., Among the many deals mentioned in the Complaint, the SEC alleges, for example, that Temple and Pastro conducted insider trading based on confidential information Temple accessed about an impending merger and acquisition involving DynCorp International, Inc.Â  Templeâs law firm was hired on Oct. 6, 2009 to act as special Delaware outside counsel to Dyncorpâs Board of Directors in connection with its possible acquisition by Cerberus Capital Management L.P.Â  Temple and Pastro purchased stock and call options in DynCorp shortly before an Apr. 12, 2010 public merger and acquisition announcement.Â  Immediately following the announcement, Temple and Pastro sold their positions for illicit trading profits of more than $34,000., The SEC further alleges that Temple and Pastro also traded on nonpublic information that Temple obtained about an impending deal between Facet Biotech Corporation and Abbott Laboratories, Inc.Â  Templeâs law firm was retained as counsel to Facet on or before Aug. 25, 2009, in connection with Abbott Labsâs proposed tender offer to Facet.Â  Temple and Pastro bought stock and call options only days before the Mar. 9, 2010 public announcement that Facet agreed to be acquired by Abbott Labs.Â  Pastro and Temple sold all of their positions immediately after the announcement for combined trading profits of more than $23,000.Â , The SEC also alleges that Temple was trading on material nonpublic information obtained during the course of his employment and profiting from his scheme as recently as September.Â Â Â Â , Finally, the SEC alleges that Temple and Pastro violated Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder.Â  The SEC is seeking permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and financial penalties., The SECâs investigation is continuing.Â  The SEC is bringing this action in coordination with the United States Attorneyâs Office for the District of Delaware.Â  The SEC also appreciates the assistance of the Options Regulatory Surveillance Authority, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and The Federal Bureau of Investigation., <b>See Also:</b> <a href=/litigation/complaints/2010/comp21765.pdf>SEC Complaint</a> ]"

The Commission filed a complaint alleging that the Unknown Purchasers engaged in illegal insider trading in the last three days before the DecemberÂ 2, 2010, announcement that PepsiCo, Inc. intended to acquire a 66 percent interest in Wimm-Bill-Dann Foods OJSC (âWBDâ) for $3.8Â billion, pending required government approvals. (The $3.8 billion price for 66 percent implies a total enterprise value of $5.4 billion.) WBD is a Russian corporation that manufactures and sells dairy and fruit juice products. It has American Depositary Receipts (âADRsâ) that trade on the New York Stock Exchange. The Commissionâs complaint alleges that the Unknown Purchasers, through their insider trading, violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, the disgorgement of all illegal profits, and the imposition of civil monetary penalties., The Commissionâs complaint alleges that, in an account maintained at SG Private Banking (Suisse) SA in Geneva, Switzerland, the Unknown Purchasers placed orders to buy 107,500 ADRs on November 29, 2010; another 132,500 ADRs on November 30, 2010; and an additional 160,000 ADRs on December 1, 2010.

As a result, the Unknown Purchasers are in a position to realize total profits of approximately $2.7 million from the sale of the ADRs.Â , The Courts Temporary Restraining Order prohibits the transfer of the illegally purchased WBD ADRs, or proceeds from their sale, to the Unknown Purchasers.

Cohen received coded e-mails referencing the movie <i>Wall Street</i> from his fraternity brother, who was being tipped with inside information by his own brother, a patent agent for San Diego-based Sequenom, Inc. Cohen subsequently made phone calls from an outdoor pay phone to tip his uncle David V. Myers of Cleveland, who then traded on the illegally obtained inside information and garnered more than $600,000 in illicit profits., In a parallel criminal proceeding, the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Southern District of California today filed criminal charges against both Cohen and Myers., According to the SECâs complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, the patent agent learned about two corporate events involving Sequenom prior to the public release of the information:, According to the SECâs complaint, the patent agent conducted intellectual property due diligence with respect to the EXAS transaction, and he was the patent agent assigned to the companyâs Down syndrome test.Â , The SEC alleges that the patent agent tipped material, non-public information about the EXAS transaction to his brother, who relayed it to his fraternity brother Cohen. For example, the patent agentâs brother sent Cohen an e-mail asking, <i>â[a]ny word related to Blu H@rsesh0e? La Jolla says the times are ripe.â</i> The movie <i>Wall Street</i> uses the phrase, âBlue Horseshoe loves Anacot Steel,â as a code for insider trading. âLa Jollaâ references the fact that the patent agent lived and worked near La Jolla, Calif., The SEC alleges that after at least a dozen phone calls among the schemeâs four participants in the succeeding days, Myers made his first-ever purchase of EXAS securities, buying 15,000 shares. It was the first stock purchase in Myersâs brokerage account since at least January 2007. Myers later purchased an additional 20,000 shares of EXAS stock before Sequenom publicly announced after the markets closed on Jan. 9, 2009, that it planned to acquire EXAS. EXAS stock rose 50 percent by the close of the markets on January 10 on increased trading volume of 466 percent. During the next few weeks, Myers sold nearly all of his EXAS stock for illegal profits of more than $34,000., The SEC alleges that the patent agent also tipped his brother ahead of Sequenomâs announcement that investors could no longer rely on previously disclosed data related to its Down syndrome test. The announcement caused Sequenomâs stock price to drop by more than 75 percent in one day. Cohen illegally obtained and tipped inside information just prior to the companyâs announcement through a series of communications, including a call he placed from a pay phone near his workplace to convey information to Myers, who immediately purchased risky Sequenom put options just minutes before the markets closed on April 29, 2009. The next morning, Myers sold his entire Sequenom position for illegal profits of more than $570,000., The SECâs complaint charges that Cohen and Myers violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The Order also granted a continuation of an existing asset freeze of all the defendants assets. The Courts Order permanently enjoins Spitzer and the entity defendants from violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Spitzer only invested approximately $30 million of the more than $105 million he raised from investors. To cover up his scheme, Spitzer issued to his investors false Schedule K-1s that showed inflated returns and led them to believe that their investments were profitable. The SECs complaint further alleged that Spitzer used offshore bank accounts to pay purported business expenses of his companies. Spitzer deposited investor funds into bank accounts at the National Bank of Anguilla and the First Bank of Puerto Rico, from which he paid more than $15 million in purported operating expenses and payments to himself and various sales agents. Spitzer also used more than $4.8 million to pay third-party business expenses.

The SEC alleges that Vitesse, through the former senior executives, perpetrated fraudulent and deceptive schemes during 1995 to April 2006 to inflate revenue from shipment of Vitesses products and to backdate stock options to employees and officers by failing to record millions of dollars of compensation expense. The SEC alleges that all four former executives engaged in the revenue recognition fraud from 2001 to 2006 and that Tomasetta and Hovanec orchestrated the options backdating from 1995 to 2006. The four executives left Vitesse in 2006., Vitesse has settled the matter by agreeing to be permanently enjoined and to pay a $3 million civil penalty. Mody and Kaplan have each agreed to a bifurcated settlement that provides they will be permanently enjoined and ordered to pay disgorgement, and that any civil penalty will be determined later by the district court. Mody has also agreed to be permanently barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company. The SECs case against Tomasetta and Hovanec is contested., The SECs complaint alleges that during September 2001 through April 2006, Tomasetta, Hovanec, Mody, and Kaplan engaged in an elaborate channel stuffing scheme in order to improperly record revenue on product shipments. They caused Vitesse to immediately recognize revenue and record invalid accounts receivable for product shipped at period end to its largest distributor, even though the distributor had an unconditional right to return all of the product. The right of return was accomplished through undisclosed side letters and oral agreements. As a result, as alleged in the complaint, Vitesse materially inflated the revenue it reported in its financial statements in 14 quarters from September 2001 through early 2006., The complaint further alleges that the defendants compounded their fraudulent revenue recognition practices by failing to timely record credits related to the invalid accounts receivable that were generated by the distributors return of product. As further alleged, in order to conceal the true age of the accounts receivable from Vitesses external auditor, Hovanec and Kaplan then directed that cash receipts received by Vitesse from the distributor and other customers be misapplied to these aged invalid receivables., In addition, the SECs complaint alleges that from 1995 to 2006, Tomasetta and Hovanec engaged in a scheme to backdate stock option grant dates for their personal benefit and the benefit of other Vitesse executives and employees. The complaint alleges that Tomasetta and Hovanec disregarded the dates on which Vitesses Compensation Committee actually approved and granted the options. Instead, they intentionally selected grant dates in the past based on low points in the companys stock price in order to assign favorable exercise prices for the options. They also used hindsight to reprice option grants as Vitesses stock price declined. In total, as alleged, Tomasetta and Hovanec backdated or repriced 40 option grants to employees and officers, representing over 60% of the total options that Vitesse awarded during the period., As alleged in the complaint, Tomasetta and Hovanec collectively reaped millions of dollars in illicit profits from exercising backdated options. Despite representing in Vitesses periodic filings made with the Commission that Vitesse did not grant in-the-money options and complied with applicable accounting rules, Tomasetta and Hovanec intentionally manipulated grant dates in order to award in-the-money options and failed to ensure that Vitesse properly recorded compensation expenses for the backdated grants. As a result of the backdating, Vitesse failed to record approximately $184 million in compensation expense, overstating its pretax income or understating its pretax loss by as much as 45% annually for its fiscal years 1996 through 2005., The complaint further alleges that after the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> questioned Vitesse in November 2005 about the legitimacy of its option granting practices, Tomasetta and Hovanec engaged in a cover-up to hide some of their prior backdating. As alleged in the complaint, between November 2005 and April 2006, Tomasetta and Hovanec lied to Vitesse board members and to Vitesses auditor by falsely telling them that past option grants were proper and correctly accounted for in the companys books., The SEC alleges that in furtherance of their cover-up, Tomasetta and Hovanec fabricated minutes of two non-existent 2001 meetings during which Vitesses Compensation Committee purportedly granted stock options. Tomasetta and Hovanec inserted these fabricated minutes into the stock option administrators computer and turned back the clock on the computer thereby creating the false appearance that the minutes had been written at the same time as when the purported meetings occurred. Tomasetta also inserted the dates of these two phantom meetings into his Palm Pilot thereby creating the faÃ§ade that these two meetings had actually happened. Also, as further alleged, on or about December 2005, Hovanec directed his assistant to create a third set of fabricated Compensation Committee meeting minutes to substantiate another backdated grant date from 2003., Vitesse, Mody, and Kaplan have agreed to settle this matter, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, on the following terms:, Vitesse consented to entry of a judgment: (1) permanently enjoining it from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, and 14a-9; and (2) ordering Vitesse to pay a $3 million civil penalty., Mody consented to entry of a judgment: (1) permanently enjoining him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2, and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a 1, and 13a 13; (2) permanently barring him from serving as an officer or director of any public company; (3) requiring him to disgorge ill-gotten gains of $105,604 plus prejudgment interest thereon of $56,716, for a total of $162,320; and (4) providing that, upon motion of the Commission, the court will determine whether a civil penalty is appropriate and the amount of any such penalty. Mody also consented to the issuance of an administrative order pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the Commissions Rules of Practice, permanently suspending him from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant., Kaplan consented to entry of a judgment: (1) permanently enjoining her from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2, and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a 1, and 13a 13; (2) requiring her to disgorge ill-gotten gains of $31,050 plus prejudgment interest thereon of $16,445, for a total of $47,495; and (3) providing that, upon motion of the Commission, the court will determine whether a civil penalty is appropriate and the amount of any such penalty. Kaplan also consented to the issuance of an administrative order pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the Commissions Rules of Practice, permanently suspending her from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant., These settlements are subject to the approval of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The settlement with Vitesse takes into account the companys cooperation in the SECs investigation., The complaint against Tomasetta and Hovanec alleges that each of them violated or aided and abetted violations of the antifraud, record-keeping, financial reporting, internal controls, lying to auditors, and equity transaction reporting provisions of the federal securities laws. Tomasetta is also charged with violating the proxy provisions of the Exchange Act. The complaint also alleges that Tomasetta and Hovanec violated Exchange Act Rule 13a-14 by signing certifications required by Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 that were false and misleading. The SECs complaint against Tomasetta and Hovanec seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement with interest, civil monetary penalties, and officer and director bars., Separately, the United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York today filed criminal charges against Tomasetta and Hovanec, and announced that Mody and Kaplan have pleaded guilty to criminal charges., <b>See Also:</b> <a href=/litigation/complaints/2010/comp21769.pdf title=>SEC Complaint</a> ]"

The SEC filed a civil action against Vaughn Reeves and others in July 2005 based on related conduct., The State of Indiana alleged that Vaughn Reeves and his sons, Christopher, Joshua, and Vaughn Reeves, Jr., violated state securities laws by misusing money raised from purchasers of church bonds sold through Alanar, Inc., an entity controlled by Vaughn Reeves and his sons. According to the State of Indiana, the Reeves scheme involved approximately 300 separate bond issuances that raised at least $120 million from investors.

The State charged each of the Reeves with ten separate felony counts of violating the Indiana Securities Act. Christopher Reeves, Joshua Reeves, and Vaughn Reeves, Jr. are scheduled to go to trial in 2011.

Nearly 100% of these customers accepted BOAâs offer resulting in approximately $4.7 billion of liquidity., The settlement also required BOA to use âbest effortsâ to provide liquidity to its institutional customers.Â  From February 2008, when the ARS market failed, through October 2010, the ARS holdings of BOAâs institutional customers were reduced by $2 billion or 56.4% (from $3.68 billion to $1.6 billion), primarily through settlements with individual customers and issuer redemptions.Â  In further compliance with its âbest effortsâ obligation, in November 2010, BOA launched a program offering favorable loans or buybacks to all its remaining institutional investors, including legacy customers of Merrill Lynch.

Beginning in November 2008 through Starrs arrest in May 2010, more than $25 million of Starrs clients funds flowed through Bristols attorney trust accounts. Throughout that time, Bristol was a partner with a prominent international law firm., The SECs amended complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that Bristol repeatedly allowed Starr to use Bristols attorney trust accounts as conduits when Starr stole money from his advisory clients. Starr would transfer, without authorization, clients funds into the attorney trust accounts, and then Bristol, who was the sole owner of the trust accounts, would transfer the stolen funds to, among others, Starr and two Starr-controlled entities â Starr Investment Advisors LLC and Starr &amp; Company LLC. The account documentation for the attorney trust accounts was sent directly to Bristols home address. Bristol received monthly statements for the attorney trust accounts, which clearly listed the names of Starrs clients as the source of the incoming transfers. Bristol never disclosed the existence of the accounts to his law firm. Bristol did, however, tout his relationship with Starr to his colleagues and others, even claiming that Starr managed $70 billion in assets, when in fact Starr managed a fraction of that amount., The SEC further alleges that, when confronted by one of Starrs victims about an unauthorized $1 million transfer from the victims account, Bristol lied to the victim that the funds were being bundled with other clients funds for an investment with UBS Financial Services. In fact, Bristol had already used the misappropriated funds to pay a multi-million dollar legal settlement with one of Starrs former clients. Bristol subsequently sought to represent that same victim in connection with the SECs investigation., The SEC previously charged Starr, Starr Investment Advisors and Starr &amp; Company (together, the Starr Parties) with using misappropriated client funds to, among other things, buy a multimillion dollar luxury condominium on Manhattans Upper East Side, and with violating securities laws pertaining to investment advisers custody of clients assets. The SECs original complaint also named two relief defendants in order to recover client assets now in their possession: Diane Passage, who is Starrs wife, and Colcave, LLC, a Starr-controlled entity through which Starr purchased the apartment., Todays amended complaint charges Bristol with aiding and abetting the Starr Parties violations of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

The SEC alleges that the company has made multiple misrepresentations, including claims that its executives had such confidence in AEHI that they had not sold a single share of company stock. Records obtained by the SEC show that Gillispie and Ransom have instead secretly unloaded extensive stock holdings and funneled the money back to Gillispie., The SECs complaint also alleges that AEHI reported to the SEC and investors that Gillispies compensation was $133,000. However, Gillispie has actually reaped approximately six times that amount in 2010., The SECs complaint charges AEHI with violating Sections 13(a) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Rule 13a-11 thereunder and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

This marks the first non-prosecution agreement entered by the SEC since the announcement of the SECâs new cooperation initiative earlier this year., The SECâs complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, alleges that between 2004 and 2009, Elles, then Carterâs Executive Vice President of Sales, fraudulently manipulated the amount of discounts that Carterâs granted to its largest wholesale customer in order to induce that customerâitself a large national department storeâto purchase greater quantities of Carterâs clothing for resale. Elles then concealed his conduct by persuading the customer to defer subtracting the discounts from payments until later periods and creating and signing false documents misrepresenting the timing and amount of those discounts to Carterâs accounting personnel., After discovering Ellesâs actions and conducting its own internal investigation, Carterâs was required to issue restated financial results for the affected periods., The SEC further alleges that Elles realized sizeable gains from insider trading in shares of Carterâs common stock during the fraud. Between May 2005 and March 2009, Elles realized a profit before tax of approximately $4,739,862 from the exercises of options granted to him by Carterâs and sales of the resulting shares. Each of these stock sales occurred prior to the Companyâs initial disclosure relating to the fraud on October 27, 2009, immediately after which the Companyâs common stock share price dropped 23.8%., The SECâs complaint alleges that Elles violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1, and aided and abetted violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13. The SEC is seeking permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, financial penalties, and an officer and director bar against Elles., The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Northern District of Georgia and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter.

At least 21 of Ludlums investors were his advisory clients, including some of his most trusting and financially unsophisticated clients. The complaint also alleges that Ludlum fraudulently obtained approximately $80,000 in loans from one of his advisory clients and misappropriated approximately $72,000 more from three advisory clients accounts without their authorization., According to the SECs complaint, Ludlum told investors and his advisory client lender that their funds would be used for working capital and to grow and operate the businesses of the Printz Entities. In fact, however, Ludlum used most of the funds to support his lavish lifestyle, pay his personal expenses, and repay other investors. During the relevant period, Ludlum withdrew more than $445,000 from the Printz Entities three main business accounts in the form of cash withdrawals, wire transfers to his personal accounts, and checks written to himself and his family trusts. In addition to these direct withdrawals, Ludlum also spent approximately $251,000 from the three primary Printz Entity business accounts on personal expenses such as bars and restaurants, rent for his luxury riverside condominium, lease payments for his car, groceries, and medical bills. Ludlum induced investors, including his advisory clients to whom he owed a fiduciary duty, to buy securities by promising superior rates of return, but failed to disclose that the Printz Entities earned little revenue and were unable to cover their expenses out of earnings. The Printz Entities failed to register their securities offerings with the Commission, even though no exemption from registration applied, and Printz Capital violated multiple provisions governing registered investment advisers., The SECs complaint charges Ludlum and the Printz Entities with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The complaint also charges Printz Financial with violations of Securities Act Rule 503(a) of Regulation D.

The SEC also charged Imperium Investment Advisors, LLC, a registered investment adviser which served as trustee for Vestium Equity Fund, and its three principals, Richard Mittasch, Christopher Paganes and Glenn Barikmo, for their roles in the scheme., The SECs complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, alleges that from April 2008 through April 2010, the Managing Members raised funds promising investors that they would generate substantial returns through conservative investments in high-grade debt instruments and, in some cases, limited physical commodities transactions. Additionally, the offering materials and prospectus for Vestium Equity Funds further assured investors that Imperium would safeguard their funds from impermissible uses. Contrary to these assurances, however, the defendants disregarded the Funds respective investment parameters and used investor funds for illiquid private investments and loans to affiliate entities. Additionally, although the Funds incurred investment losses of at least $8.1 million, the Managing Members disseminated monthly statements falsely depicting consistent profits and paid at least $6 million to investors in alleged profits. The Managing members further paid themselves over $1.3 million in compensation that was improperly based on inflated asset values and fictitious profits. The SECs complaint further alleges that Buckhannon, Mittasch, Paganes and Barikmo collectively misappropriated at least $734,000 of investor funds to themselves and others., The SECs complaint alleges that the defendants violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, that Buckhannon and Rawstern violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and that defendants Buckhannon, Rawstern, St. Jean and Tindall also violated, and Mittasch, Paganes, Barikmo and Imperium aided and abetted violations of, Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.

Alcatel-Lucent, S.A.</i>, Civil Action No. 1:10-CV-24620-GRAHAM (S.D. FL.) (December 27, 2010)</h2>]","[, The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a settled enforcement action on December 27, 2010, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida to resolve charges that Alcatel-Lucent, S.A. (Alcatel) violated the anti-bribery, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) by paying bribes to foreign government officials to obtain or retain business in Latin America and Asia., Alcatel, the provider of telecommunications equipment and services, has offered to pay a total of $137.372 million in disgorgement and fines, including $45.372 million in disgorgement to the SEC. Â In a related action, Alcatel will pay a $92 million criminal fine to the U.S. Department of Justice.Â , The SECâs complaint, filed in the Southern District of Florida, alleges that Alcatelâs bribes went to government officials in Costa Rica, Honduras, Malaysia, and Taiwan between December 2001 and June 2006.Â  An Alcatel subsidiary provided at least $14.5 million to consulting firms through sham consulting agreements for use in the bribery scheme in Costa Rica.Â  Various high-level government officials in Costa Rica received at least $7 million of the $14.5 million to ensure Alcatel obtained or retained three contracts to provide telephone services in Costa Rica.Â , The SEC alleges that the same Alcatel subsidiary bribed officials in the government of Honduras to obtain or retain five telecommunications contracts.Â  Another Alcatel subsidiary made bribery payments to Malaysian government officials in order to procure a telecommunications contract.Â  An Alcatel subsidiary also made illegal payments to various officials in the government of Taiwan to win a contract to supply railway axle counters to the Taiwan Railway Administration.Â , According to the SECâs complaint, all of the bribery payments were undocumented or improperly recorded as consulting fees in the books of Alcatelâs subsidiaries and then consolidated into Alcatelâs financial statements.Â  The leaders of several Alcatel subsidiaries and geographical regions, including some who reported directly to Alcatelâs executive committee, either knew or were severely reckless in not knowing about the misconduct., The SECâs complaint charges that Alcatel violated Section 30A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by making illicit payments to foreign government officials, through its subsidiaries and agents, in order to obtain or retain business.Â  Alcatel violated Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act by failing to have adequate internal controls to detect and prevent the payments.Â  Alcatel violated Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act by improperly recording the payments in its books and records.Â  Alcatel violated Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act when its subsidiaries knowingly failed to implement a system of internal controls and knowingly falsified their books and records to camouflage bribes as consulting payments. Â Without admitting or denying the SECâs allegations, Alcatel has consented to a court order permanently enjoining it from future violations of these statutory provisions; ordering the company to pay $45.372 million in disgorgement of wrongfully obtained profits, and ordering it to comply with certain undertakings, including an independent monitor for a three year term.Â Â , The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the U.S. Department of Justice, Fraud Section; the Federal Bureau of Investigation; the Office of the Attorney General in Costa Rica; the FiscalÃ­a de Delitos EconÃ³micos, CorrupciÃ³n y Tributarios in Costa Rica; and the Service Central de PrÃ©vention de la Corruption in France., <b>See Also:</b> <a href=/litigation/complaints/2010/comp21795.pdf>SEC Complaint</a> ]"
