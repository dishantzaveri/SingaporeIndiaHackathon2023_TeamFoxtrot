Rakoff has ruled that Defendant Eric Aronson violated the antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws. In addition, the Court entered orders of permanent injunctions against Defendants Vincent Buonauro and Fredric Aaron and further imposed officer and director and penny stock bars against Aaron. Furthermore, the Court ordered Aronsons wife, Relief Defendant Caroline Aronson, to disgorge the ill-gotten gains she received from her husband., The Commissions Complaint, filed in October 2011, alleged that, from 2006 to 2010, PermaPave Industries and its affiliates raised more than $26 million from the sale of promissory notes and use of funds agreements to over 140 investors. Eric Aronson, Vincent Buonauro and others told investors that there was a tremendous demand for the product - permeable paving stones - and that investors would be repaid from the profits generated by guaranteed product sales. In reality, there was little demand for the product, and defendants used investors money to make interest and profit payments to earlier investors and to fund managements lavish lifestyles. In addition, shortly after an affiliate of PermaPave Industries acquired a majority stake in Interlink-US-Network, Ltd., Eric Aronson, Fredric Aaron - who was the attorney for Eric Aronson and the entity defendants - and others issued a press release stating that a company that had never heard of Interlink intended to invest $6 million in Interlink., On August 6, 2013, the Court granted in part the Commissions motion for summary judgment. Finding that the Commission proved an almost endless fraud with evidence that Eric Aronson and others raised millions from investors, misappropriated the funds raised, and then converted the investments several times over to delay and ultimately avoid repayment, the Court ruled that Eric Aronson, age 45 and resident of Syosset, New York, violated Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Subsequently, on December 11, 2013, the Court granted the Commissions motion for reconsideration of the Courts summary judgment order and ruled that Eric Aronson also violated Section 20(e) of the Exchange Act by aiding and abetting Interlinks violations of Exchange Act Sections 10(b) and 13(a) and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20 and 13a-11. Relief for these violations will be determined at a later date., The Court also granted summary judgment on the Commissions claim for disgorgement against Caroline Aronson, age 43 and resident of Syosset, New York. On December 23, 2013, the Court issued a final judgment ordering Caroline Aronson to pay the full disgorgement amount sought, $296,262., Also on December 23, 2013, the Court issued judgments as to Vincent Buonauro, age 42 and resident of West Islip, New York, and Fredric Aaron, age 49 and resident of Plainview, New York. Vincent Buonauro agreed to consent to the judgment as to him, which enjoins him from violating Securities Act Sections 5 and 17(a) and Exchange Act Sections 10(b) and 15(a) and Rule 10b-5. Fredric Aaron also agreed to consent to the judgment as to him, which enjoins him from violating Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 and from aiding and abetting violations of Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-11. The judgment as to Fredric Aaron also imposes five year officer and director and penny stock bars. The Commissions claims for monetary relief against Vincent Buonauro and Fredric Aaron will be determined at a later date., The Commissions civil action also continues against Relief Defendant Deborah Buonauro. The Court previously issued final judgments against all entity defendants and entity relief defendants on January 19, 2012 and against Defendant Robert Kondratick on October 17, 2012.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr22901.htm</i><br/>]"

(“Veolia”), a multinational utilities and environmental services company, with falsifying books, records, and accounts and circumventing internal controls in order to overstate Special Services’ earnings before taxes (“EBT”) over a period of at least three years.  , The Commission’s complaint alleges that beginning no later than January 2008 and continuing through February 2011, Hohol, who was the most senior executive at Special Services, and Poshak, among other things, made and caused others to make false accounting entries in Special Services’ general ledger, including entries for fictitious revenue accruals, and entries that improperly reclassified expenses as inventory and improperly reclassified expenses (such as rental equipment, including industrial tools and diving gear) as prepaid assets, in order to artificially increase Special Services’ monthly EBT to meet internal financial performance projections and create the false appearance that Special Services consistently was profitable.  The complaint further alleges that both Hohol and Poshak signed monthly certifications falsely verifying the accuracy of Special Services’ financial information and efficacy of Special Services’ internal controls.  The complaint also alleges that Poshak forged invoices and other documents to support the false accounting entries and to conceal the scheme.  According to the complaint, as a result of Hohol’s and Poshak’s misconduct, Special Services overstated its EBT by a total of approximately $64 million.  The complaint also alleges that, as a result of their misconduct, Hohol and Poshak received $136,000 and $28,000, respectively, in ill-gotten bonus payments that were triggered by the inflated financial performance of Special Services.  The complaint further alleges that the false financial information provided by Special Services was reported up through several intermediate subsidiaries and, ultimately, was consolidated into the parent company’s publicly disclosed financial statements, which were filed with and furnished to the Commission.  , The complaint charges Hohol and Poshak with violating Section 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder, and aiding and abetting Veolia’s violations of Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act.  , Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Hohol and Poshak have consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating Exchange Act Section 13(b)(5) and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder, and aiding and abetting violations of Exchange Act Section 13(b)(2)(A).  Hohol also has agreed to disgorge $106,000, and Poshak has agreed to disgorge $28,000, together with prejudgment interest in the amount of $3,500.  The settlements, which are subject to court approval, take into account Hohols and Poshak’s current financial condition.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr22906.htm</i><br/>]"

Conley’s Office, whose office referred Palladino’s and Viking’s conduct to the Commission.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr22909.htm</i><br/>]"

Tocci, was sentenced for insider trading in the securities of Massachusetts-based American Superconductor Corporation.  The criminal charges against Tocci arose out of the same conduct for which the Commission filed a securities fraud action against Tocci in 2013.  Tocci pled guilty to the charges of insider trading on August 29, 2013., According to the criminal information filed on August 12, 2013, Tocci, a former assistant treasurer of American Superconductor, learned in a call on or about March 31, 2011 with American Superconductor’s chief financial officer that the company’s primary customer, Sinovel Wind Group Co. Ltd., would not make past due payments and would not accept shipments scheduled for the end of the quarter on March 31, 2011.  The criminal information further stated that following the call and discussions with other members of the finance staff, Tocci knew that American Superconductor’s actual financial results for fiscal year 2010 (ended March 31, 2011) would likely be well below analysts’ expectations for the company.  According to the information, Tocci knew that he was not allowed to trade in American Superconductor shares based on material, nonpublic information about the company.  However, on April 1, 2011, while in possession of material, nonpublic information concerning Sinovel, he purchased 100 American Superconductor put option contracts.  In the context of stock transactions, a “put option” is the right to sell a particular stock at a certain price (the “strike price”) by a certain date (“expiration date”).  For the put options that Tocci purchased, if American Superconductor’s stock price declined significantly before May 21, 2011, Tocci stood to profit from the put option contracts.  On April 5, 2011, American Superconductor made a public announcement that Sinovel had refused to accept scheduled shipments and that the company expected Sinovel to reduce its level of inventory before accepting further shipments and that American Superconductor expected its revenues for the fourth quarter and/or fiscal year 2010 (ended March 31, 2011), and its expected earnings, to be substantially below prior forecasts.  On April 6, 2011, American Superconductor’s stock price dropped 42%, closing at $14.47 per share.  Tocci sold his put options for $95,092.37, earning a profit of approximately $82,440.  Tocci was sentenced to one year probation, a $100 fine, and was required to continue to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties he previously agreed to with the Commission., In a parallel Complaint filed on August 12, 2013, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts in Boston, the SEC alleges that Tocci, age 59, of Belmont, Massachusetts, used confidential information he obtained as the assistant treasurer of American Superconductor to purchase option contracts through which Tocci essentially bet that the company’s stock price would soon decrease on the release of negative news.  Tocci agreed to settle this case by consenting to a judgment enjoining him from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering him to pay disgorgement of $82,439 (representing his ill-gotten gains) plus prejudgment interest of $6,109 and a civil penalty of $82,439.  , The SEC’s investigation was conducted by Asita Obeyesekere, Michael Foster, and Kevin Kelcourse in the SEC’s Boston Regional Office.  The Commission acknowledges the assistance and cooperation of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Massachusetts and the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Boston Field Office.  The Commission also thanks the Options Regulatory Surveillance Authority and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority for their assistance., For more information see Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2013/lr22775.htm>22775</a> (August 12, 2013). ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr22910.htm</i><br/>]"

Dismissal of the proceeding, as proposed by the parties, is subject to the approval of the district court. , The SEC initiated the subpoena enforcement action to compel DTTC to produce audit workpapers and other documents responsive to an administrative subpoena issued in connection with the SEC’s investigation into possible fraud by DTTC’s former audit client, China-based Longtop Financial Technologies Limited, a foreign private issuer whose securities were registered with the Commission and traded on U.S. markets.

In the judgments, Leszczynski was ordered to disgorge $1,500,000; Chouchane was ordered to disgorge $2,007,408 plus prejudgment interest of $442,169; and Condron was ordered to disgorge $168,336 plus prejudgment interest of $39,339. The Court has reserved the issue of whether to impose a civil penalty on the defendants pending their continued cooperation with the SEC. Acknowledging the facts to which they have admitted as part of their guilty pleas in parallel criminal cases, Leszczynski, Chouchane, and Condron consented to the entry of these judgments., 	The SEC charged these brokers, who formerly worked on the cash desk at a New York-based broker-dealer, with illegally overcharging customers $18.7 million by using hidden markups and markdowns and secretly keeping portions of profitable customer trades. The brokers made their scheme difficult for customers to detect because they deceptively charged the markups and markdowns during times of market volatility in order to conceal the fraudulent nature of the prices they were reporting to their customers. The surreptitiously embedded markups and markdowns ranged from a few dollars to $228,000 and involved more than 36,000 transactions during a four-year period. , 	The SEC further alleged that when a customer placed a limit order seeking to purchase shares at a specified maximum price, the brokers filled the order at the customer’s limit price but used opportune times to sell a portion of that order back to the market to obtain a secret profit for the firm. They falsely reported back to the customer that they could not fill the order at the limit price. , 	The SEC’s litigation has been conducted by John V. Donnelly III and G.

Between April 10 and the close of the markets on April 26, Dombrowski, knowing of Allscripts poor financial results, sold short 1000 shares of Allscripts stock and purchased more than 510 Allscripts put option contracts, trades that would be profitable only if Allscripts stock price went down. On April 26, 2012, Allscripts announced first quarter financial results that were much worse than the market had expected. Allscripts also announced that its Chief Financial Officer would soon leave the company for another job, and that the Chairman of the Board and several other members of the Board had resigned. Immediately after the announcement Dombrowski purchased Allscripts stock to close his short position, and the next day, on April 27, Dombrowski sold all of his options positions as Allscripts common stock fell $5.72, or approximately 35.7% from the previous days close.  The SECs complaint alleges that Dombrowskis trading resulted in illegal profits of $286,211.55., The SECs complaint charges Dombrowskis with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a judgment that permanently enjoins Dombrowski from future violations of these provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to disgorge all of his ill-gotten gains, plus prejudgment interest, and orders him to pay an appropriate civil penalty. The SEC also seeks an order requiring Dombrowskis wife, relief defendant Lisa Fox, to pay disgorgement, plus prejudgment interest, as Dombrowskis illegal trades were in her account., In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Northern District of Illinois announced criminal charges against Dombrowski., The SECs investigation was conducted by Kristopher S. Heston and Norman H. Jones of the Chicago Regional Office. The SECs litigation will be led by Benjamin J.

According to the complaint, the promissory notes provided various interest rates ranging from seven to twelve percent per year and Zada told some investors that they would earn as much as 48 percent on their investment. The complaint also alleged that Zada told investors that he would invest their funds in oil-related investments, that he had exclusive access to certain oil investments, that he had business contacts in oil-producing countries in the Middle East, and that he had earned substantial returns from prior oil-related investments. The complaint alleged that Zada’s representations were false and that he never invested any funds in oil-related investments or any other type of investment. Instead, Zada conducted a Ponzi scheme, utilizing funds from new investors to pay earlier investors. Specifically, Zada used approximately $12.4 million to make monthly “interest” and return-of-principal payments to investors. He used all other available funds to pay his personal and other expenses unrelated to any investments. , The final judgments permanently enjoin Zada and Zada Enterprises from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.

On February 4, 2014, the Court also entered a final judgment against Ulrich Bock and Stephan Signer, both former Heads of Major Projects at Siemens Aktiengesellschaft (Siemens).  The judgments resolve the Commission’s Civil Action against Truppel, Bock and Signer for their role in a decade long bribery scheme at Siemens and its regional company in Argentina., 	On December 13, 2011, the Commission filed a Civil Action charging Bock, Signer, Truppel and four other senior executives of Siemens and its regional company in Argentina with violations of the anti-bribery, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the FCPA.  The Commission alleged that between 2001 and 2007, the defendants paid bribes to senior government officials in Argentina to retain a $1 billion contract (“the DNI contract”) to produce national identity cards for Argentine citizens. The officials included two Argentine presidents and cabinet ministers in two presidential administrations. , 	The Commission’s complaint alleged that Bock and Signer, both senior Siemens managers based in Germany, took various actions to revive the DNI contract after it was cancelled by government officials in Argentina, and made sure that the bribery connected to the contract went undetected.  Truppel, a former CFO of Siemens Argentina with close ties to government officials, assisted their efforts.  The Commission’s complaint also alleged that Uriel Sharef, a member of Siemens Managing Board, or “Vorstand,” and the most senior officer charged in connection with the scheme, met with payment intermediaries in the U.S. and agreed to pay bribes to Argentine officials while enlisting subordinates to conceal payments and circumvent Siemens’ internal accounting controls., 	The final judgment as to Bock and Signer enjoins them from violating Sections 30A and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder, and from aiding and abetting Siemens’ violations of Exchange Act Sections 31(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B), and orders them to each pay a civil penalty of $524,000, the highest penalty assessed against individuals in an FCPA case.  The judgment also orders Bock to pay disgorgement of $316,452, plus prejudgment interest thereon in the amount of $97,505.  Bock and Signer failed to respond to the Commission’s complaint., 	The final judgment as to Truppel enjoins him from violating Sections 30A and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder, and from aiding and abetting Siemens’ violations of Exchange Act Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B), and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $80,000.  Truppel settled the Commission’s charges without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint., 	This concludes the SEC’s case.  The Commission previously announced that on April 16, 2013, a final judgment was entered by the Court against Uriel Sharef, a former officer and board member of Siemens, for his role in the long standing bribery scheme.  The final judgment, to which Sharef consented without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission’s complaint, enjoined him from violating the anti-bribery and related books and records and internal controls provisions of the FCPA, and ordered him to pay a $275,000 civil penalty.

According to the complaint, Lee recruited clients to open online brokerage accounts, including margin accounts in which he had discretionary authority to trade in options. He also charged his clients a management fee of as much as 50% of their monthly realized profits and promised clients that he would share equally in 50% of their realized losses. But when Lees clients suffered large realized losses, he failed to reimburse most of them for his promised share., The complaint alleges that Lee defrauded his clients in several ways. He charged some clients fees for the month of February 2011 based on false performance and concealed from them that they had actually incurred realized losses that month. In addition, he misled clients about his background, including failing to disclose a criminal conviction for embezzlement and an SEC cease-and-desist order for his role in illegal unregistered penny stock offerings. He also misled clients about his promise to share in realized losses and the risks of his options trading strategy. Furthermore, he traded in penny stocks in client accounts outside of his discretionary authority, and fraudulently induced one client to loan money to a penny stock company., The complaint charges Lee with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws - Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Section 206(1) and (2) of the Investment Advisors Act of 1940.

22928,2014,[<h3>Connecticut-Based Stock Promoter Ordered to Pay Over $9.6 Million in Stock Touting and Scalping Scheme</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that on February 12, 2014, a Connecticut federal court entered judgments against a former Connecticut-based stock promoter, Jerry S. Williams, and two companies that he controlled, Monks Den, LLC and First In Awareness, LLC, who are defendants in a Commission enforcement action filed in 2012 alleging that they operated a fraudulent Internet-based stock touting and scalping scheme.  The judgments order the defendants to pay a total of over $9.6 million., Williams, Monks Den, and First In Awareness were defendants in a civil fraud action filed by the Commission on July 20, 2012.  The Commissions complaint alleged that from 2009 through 2010, Williams recommended two stocks, Cascadia Investments, Inc. and Green Oasis, Inc., to a large group of followers who followed his trading recommendations and strategies.  Williams, who was known to his followers as Monk, used his internet-based message board - called Monks Den - as well as his in-person seminars (called Monkinars), and other means, to encourage people to buy, hold, and accumulate Cascadia and Green Oasis stock.  In particular, Williams told his followers that by buying up the outstanding shares, or float, of these companies, they could collectively trigger a short squeeze that would allow them to sell their stock to market makers that had shorted the stock.  Williams falsely stated that he had previously used this Float Lock Down strategy successfully to make himself and his followers enormous profits.  In fact, unknown to his followers, Williams had been hired by Cascadia and Green Oasis to promote their stock and had been compensated with millions of free and discounted shares of these stocks.  Williams secretly sold millions of Cascadia and Green Oasis shares at the same time he was encouraging potential investors to buy, hold and accumulate these stocks.  Williams made profits of over $2.3 million from his scheme., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, Williams, First In Awareness and Monks Den consented to final judgments enjoining them from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and as to Williams only, enjoining him from violating Sections 17(a) and 17(b) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  The final judgments found Williams, Monks Den, and First In Awareness jointly and severally liable for disgorgement of $2,357,208 in ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $188,766, ordered each to pay a civil penalty of $2,357,208, and imposed a penny stock bar on Williams.  , For additional information, see <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22420.htm>Litigation Release No. 22420</a> (July 23, 2012).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr22928.htm</i><br/>]"
22929,2014,[<h3>SEC Charges Three California Residents Behind Movie Investment Scam</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission charged three California residents with defrauding investors in a purported multi-million dollar movie project that would supposedly star A-list celebrities and generate exorbitant investment returns., The SEC alleges that Los Angeles-based attorney Samuel Braslau was the architect of the fraudulent scheme that raised money through a boiler room operation spearheaded by Rand Chortkoff of Encino, Calif.  High-pressure salespeople including Stuart Rawitt of Marina del Rey, Calif., persuaded more than 60 investors nationwide to invest a total of $1.8 million in the movie first titled Marcel and later changed to <i>The Smuggler</i>.  Investors were falsely told that well-known actors ranging from Donald Sutherland to Jean-Claude Van Damme would appear in the movie when in fact they were never even approached.  Instead of using investor funds for movie production expenses as promised, Braslau, Chortkoff, and Rawitt have spent most of the money among themselves.  The investor funds that remain arent enough to produce a public service announcement let alone a full-length motion picture capable of securing the theatrical release promised to investors., In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Central District of California announced criminal charges against Braslau, Chortkoff, and Rawitt., According to the SECs complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, Braslau set up companies named Mutual Entertainment LLC and Film Shoot LLC to raise funds from investors for the movie project.  In January 2011, Mutual Entertainment spent $25,000 to purchase the rights to <i>Marcel</i>, an unpublished story set in Paris during World War II.  Shortly thereafter, Mutual Entertainment began raising money from investors through a boiler room operation that Chortkoff operated out of Van Nuys, Calif., The SEC alleges that Braslau, Chortkoff, and Rawitt claimed that 63.5 percent of the funds raised from investors would be used for production expenses.  However, very little if any money was actually spent on movie expenses as they instead used the vast majority of investor funds to pay sales commissions and phony consulting fees to themselves and other salespeople.  Rawitt made numerous false claims to investors about the movie project.  For instance, he flaunted a baseless projected return on investment of about 300 percent.  He falsely depicted that they were just shy of reaching a $7.5 million fundraising goal and the movie was set to begin shooting in summer 2013.  He instilled the belief that Mutual Entertainment was a successful film company whose track record encompassed the <i>Harold and Kumar</i> movies produced by Carsten Lorenz.  And he falsely stated that investors would realize revenues from action figures and other products tied to the movie when in fact no such licensing rights had been sold., According to the SECs complaint, Rawitt was the subject of a prior SEC enforcement action in 2009, when he was <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21348.htm>charged for his involvement</a> in an oil-and-gas scheme., The SECs complaint alleges that Braslau, Chortkoff, and Rawitt violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5.  The complaint further alleges that Chortkoff and Rawitt violated Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rawitt violated Section 15(b)(6)(B) of the Exchange Act.  The SEC seeks financial penalties and a permanent injunction against Braslau, Chortkoff, and Rawitt. , The SECs investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Peter Del Greco and Marc Blau of the Los Angeles office.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Central District of California and the Federal Bureau of Investigation., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2014/comp-pr2014-36.pdf>SEC Complaint</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr22929.htm</i><br/>]"

Fisher offered investors the opportunity to invest their money through a “special trading platform” that supposedly generated significant returns. Fisher told investors that their money would be deposited in an overseas bank account and used as collateral for the purchase and sale of collateralized debt obligations and medium term notes on the trading platform. However, Fisher instead fraudulently misappropriated and converted investors funds for his personal use to pay previous investors, to purchase a house and car and to pay his daughters tuition and other personal and business expenses. Fisher also provided quarterly statements to investors which falsely represented that investors were earning money on their investments., The Indictments allegations are based on the same conduct underlying the Commissions September 30, 2013 Complaint against Fisher filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin.

While InfrAegis  engaged in some discussions with the city about the installation of the iaMedium kiosks, there was never any agreement or contract to  install the system in Chicago.  In  another example, Webb falsely represented that the company had a contract with  the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) to install iaMedium kiosks throughout the Washington, D.C., Metro  train system.

Karlis, 53, of Hopkinton,  MA, pled guilty before U.S. District Court Senior Judge Mark L. Wolf, to nine  counts of wire fraud and two counts of filing false tax documents.  His sentencing is currently scheduled for June  2, 2014 at 3:00 p.m.  His business  partner, Ahmet Devrim Akyil, 41, formerly of Hingham, MA, was charged with 10  counts of wire fraud.  According to a  March 7, 2014 press release issued by the United States Attorney’s Office for  the District of Massachusetts (USAO), Akyil left the United States for Turkey  in 2009 and remains a fugitive.  The USAO  unsealed an indictment charging Karlis and Akyil with criminal violations on  October 28, 2010., Also on October 28,  2010, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action in federal district  court in Massachusetts against BTR, and its principals Ahmet Devrim Akyil and  Craig Karlis for fraudulently raising millions of dollars from investors in a  purported foreign currency (Forex) trading venture. Among other things, the  Commission alleges that the defendants misappropriated some investor funds and  lost the vast majority of remaining investor funds through Forex trading  activity after promising investors that most of their funds were protected from  such trading losses., According to the Complaint, BTR  collapsed in September 2008 due to significant losses accrued as a result of  concealed trading far past the stop loss limits promised to investors.  Ultimately, BTR distributed the remaining funds, which accounted for only  approximately 10% of account balances, to its investors., The Commission’s complaint, which is  pending, alleges that BTR, Akyil, and Karlis violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and  17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the  Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Commission seeks the entry of a permanent  injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus pre-judgment interest, and  the imposition of civil monetary penalties against BTR, Akyil, and Karlis., For further information, see Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2010/lr21712.htm>21712</a> (October  28, 2010) (<a href=/litigation/complaints/2010/comp21712.pdf>Complaint</a>).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr22939.htm</i><br/>]"

Mascioli and His Purported Hedge Fund, North Street Capital, LP</h3>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed settled fraud charges in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut against Alexander H.G. Mascioli and his alter-ego, purported hedge fund, North Street Capital, LP (NSC), alleging that Mascioli and NSC made a fraudulent May 2012 offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Winnebago Industries, Inc.s (WGO) common stock., The Commission alleges that, on May 9, 2012, Mascioli authored on NSC letterhead, signed, and sent to WGO an offer to acquire all outstanding common stock of WGO for approximately $321 million in cash.  The May 9 letter represented that NSCs offer was not conditioned on any financing, that NSC was prepared to move forward immediately, and that it could complete the process in approximately two weeks.  In truth, Mascioli and NSC had virtually no assets, significant liabilities, and no reasonable prospects of securing any financing to fund the acquisition.  Furthermore, at the time they made their offer, Mascioli and NSC had not retained any financial or legal advisers to represent them in the transaction.  On May 17, having not received a response to the May 9 offer, Mascioli sent a copy of the May 9 letter that he had modified to look like an NSC press release to Bloomberg, which subsequently posted the offer on its website.  After NSCs fraudulent offer was made public on May 17, WGOs stock price and trading volume increased significantly.  In pre-market trading on May 18, almost 700,000 WGO shares were traded.  By contrast, in the four trading days prior to May 18, WGO had little to no volume in pre-market trading.  Moreover, on May 17, WGOs stock closed at $8.51 per share; when trading opened on May 18, however, WGO stock opened at $9.81 per share, an almost 15% increase.  In pre-market trading on May 18, after learning of NSCs offer for WGO and viewing a public website Mascioli created for NSC that contained various  misrepresentations about NSCs business, a New York hedge fund made the decision to cover the majority of a large short position it held in WGO and incurred losses in doing so. , Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Mascioli and NSC have consented to entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining each of them from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and ordering them to pay, jointly and severally, a $100,000 civil penalty.  Mascioli has also consented to a final judgment that permanently bars him from serving as an officer and/or director of any issuer that has a class of securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act or that is required to file reports pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act.  The proposed settlement is subject to court approval. , The SECs investigation was conducted by George Bagnall and George Parizek with assistance from trial attorney Cheryl Crumpton.

Capital Advisors with insider trading based on nonpublic information that he obtained about a pair of technology companies., The SEC alleges that Ronald N. Dennis got illegal tips from two friends who were fellow hedge fund analysts.  They provided him confidential details about impending announcements at Dell Inc. and Foundry Networks.  Armed with inside information, Dennis prompted illegal trades in Dell and Foundry stock and enabled hedge funds managed by S.A.C. Capital and affiliate CR Intrinsic Investors to generate illegal profits and avoid significant losses., Dennis, who lives in Fort Worth, Texas, has agreed to be barred from the securities industry and pay more than $200,000 to settle the SECs charges., According to the SECs complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan, Dennis received illegal tips about Dells financial performance from Jesse Tortora, who was then an analyst at Diamondback Capital.  <a href=http://www.sec.gov/News/PressRelease/Detail/PressRelease/1365171482492>Tortora and Diamondback were charged in 2012</a> along with several other hedge fund managers and analysts as part of the SECs broader investigation into expert networks and the trading activities of hedge funds.  Dennis separately received an illegal tip about the impending acquisition of Foundry from Matthew Teeple, an analyst at a San Francisco-based hedge fund advisory firm.  The <a href=http://www.sec.gov/News/PressRelease/Detail/PressRelease/1365171513470>SEC charged Teeple and two others last year</a> for insider trading in Foundry stock., The SEC alleges that Dennis caused CR Intrinsic and S.A.C. Capital to trade Dell securities based on nonpublic information in advance of at least two quarterly earnings announcements in 2008 and 2009.  Dennis obtained confidential details from Tortora, who had obtained the information from a friend who communicated with a Dell insider.  Dennis enabled hedge funds managed by CR Intrinsic and S.A.C. Capital to generate approximately $3.2 million in profits and avoided losses in Dell stock.  Within minutes after one of the Dell announcements, Tortora sent an instant message to Dennis saying your welcome.  Dennis responded you da man!!! I owe you. , The SECs complaint also alleges Dennis was informed by Teeple in July 2008 about Foundrys impending acquisition by another technology company.  Shortly after receiving the inside information, Dennis caused a CR Intrinsic hedge fund to purchase Foundry stock and generate approximately $550,000 in profits when the news became public.  , The SECs complaint charges Dennis with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.  Dennis has agreed to pay $95,351 in disgorgement, $12,632.34 in prejudgment interest, and a $95,351 penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Dennis also has agreed to be permanently enjoined from future violations of these provisions of the federal securities laws.

According to the application and supporting papers, the SEC is investigating whether Riel, REinvest, and others have violated or are violating anti-fraud or other provisions of the federal securities laws in connection with an investment marketed by REinvest., The SECs application alleges that Riel and REinvest marketed a high-yield investment that promised fixed returns of 50% to 150% over a five-year period with inherently low risk but no explanation of its methodology. The SECs staff is investigating the basis for the promised returns and the accuracy of other representations made to investors., As part of its investigation, the staff in the SECs New York Regional office served Riel and REinvest with document subpoenas in January 2014.

The Complaint alleges that John Babikian used AwesomePennyStocks.com and its related site PennyStocksUniverse.com, collectively APS, to commit a brand of securities fraud known as scalping.  The APS websites disseminated e-mails to approximately 700,000 people shortly after 2:30 p.m. Eastern time on the afternoon of Feb. 23, 2012, and recommended the penny stock America West Resources Inc. (AWSRQ).  What the e-mails failed to disclose among other things was that Babikian held more than 1.4 million shares of America West stock, which he had already positioned and intended to sell immediately through a Swiss bank.  The APS emails immediately triggered massive increases in America Wests share price and trading volume, which Babikian exploited by unloading shares of America Wests stock over the remaining 90 minutes of the trading day for ill-gotten gains of more than $1.9 million., According to documents filed simultaneously with the SECs complaint in federal court in Manhattan, Babikian was actively attempting to liquidate his U.S. assets, which he holds in the names of alter ego front companies.  He was seeking to wire the proceeds offshore.  The Honorable Paul A. Crotty granted the SECs emergency request to preserve these assets by issuing an asset freeze order., According to the Commissions complaint, America Wests stock was both low-priced and thinly traded prior to Babikians mass dissemination of the APS e-mails promoting it.  America Wests trading volume in 2011 averaged approximately 15,400 shares per day.  There was not a single trade in America West stock on Feb. 23, 2012, before the touting e-mails were sent.  However, in the immediate aftermath of Babikians e-mail launch, more than 7.8 million shares of America West stock was traded in the next 90 minutes as America Wests share price hit an all-time high.  Absent the fraudulent touts, Babikian could not have sold more than a few thousand shares at an extremely lower share price., The courts order, among other things, freezes Babikians assets, temporarily restrains him from further similar misconduct, requires an accounting, prohibits document alteration or destruction, and expedites discovery.  Pursuant to the order, the Commission has taken immediate action to freeze Babikians U.S. assets, which include the proceeds of the sale of a fractional interest in an airplane that Babikian had been attempting to have wired to an offshore bank, two homes in the Los Angeles area, and agricultural property in Oregon., The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Quebec Autorité des Marchés Financiers, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, and OTC Markets Group Inc., The Commissions investigation of this matter is continuing., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2014/comp-pr2014-52.pdf>SEC Complaint</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr22944.htm</i><br/>]"

Cancian has agreed to pay a total of $97,843 in disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty to settle the insider trading charges.,   According to the SECs complaint, filed in federal district court in Boston, Cancian, while having drinks on April 1, 2011 with a friend who was a senior executive at the company, learned that American Superconductors stock price was likely to drop. The next trading day, April 4, 2011, Cancian sold the majority of American Superconductor stock he owned and sold covered call options to offset losses on the stock he continued to hold. On April 5, 2011, after the close of trading, American Superconductor announced that its financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended March 31, 2011 would be lower than expected due to a deteriorating relationship with its primary customer, Sinovel Wind Group Co., Ltd., of China.

Myers, Florida, found Robert A. DiGiorgio, owner and President/CEO of Radius Capital Corporation (Radius), liable for securities fraud in connection with the issuance of mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae)., The Complaint alleged that Radius made mortgage loans in Florida, California, and other states and then issued securities backed by pools of those loans.  Between December 2005 and October 2006 Radius sold at least fifteen mortgage-backed securities with a total principal amount of over $23 million. To induce Ginnie Mae to guarantee these securities and to make the securities more attractive to investors, Radius, acting at DiGiorgios direction and under his control, stated to Ginnie Mae and investors that all loans backing the securities were or would be insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). , The Complaint further alleged that Radius assurances were untrue because approximately 70% of the loans backing its securities were not FHA insured, and most fell below FHA requirements and could never have been insured by FHA.  The Complaint also alleged that DiGiorgio directed Radius employees to ignore underwriting guidelines and knowingly approved low-quality, improperly documented, and fraudulent loans.  The loans backing the Radius securities quickly became delinquent and Radius defaulted on its pass-through payments to investors. As a result, Ginnie Mae was required to assume Radius obligations, incurring losses of more than $5 million.  The Complaint alleged that Radius and DiGiorgio violated the federal securities laws by engaging in a fraudulent scheme and making materially false statements to Ginnie Mae and to investors. , Following a ten-day trial, the jury returned a verdict finding DiGiorgio liable on each of the Commissions claims.  DiGiorgio was found to have violated subsections (1), (2), and (3) of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as well as Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and subsections (a), (b) and (c) of Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

22948,2014,[<h3>SEC Charges Law Firm Managing Clerk and Stockbroker in $5.6 Million Insider Trading Scheme</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission charged a managing clerk at a law firm and a stockbroker with insider trading around more than a dozen mergers or other corporate transactions for illicit profits of $5.6 million during a four-year period., The SEC alleges that Steven Metro and Vladimir Eydelman were linked through a mutual friend who acted as a middleman in the illegal trading scheme.  Metro, a managing clerk at Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett in New York, obtained material nonpublic information about corporate clients involved in pending deals by accessing confidential documents in the law firms computer system.  Metro typically tipped the middleman during in-person meetings at a New York City coffee shop, and the middleman later met with his stockbroker, Eydelman, near the clock at the information booth in Grand Central Station.  The middleman tipped Eydelman, who was a registered representative at Oppenheimer and is now at Morgan Stanley, by showing him a post-it note or napkin with the relevant ticker symbol.  After the middleman chewed up and sometimes even ate the note or napkin, Eydelman went on to use the illicit tip to illegally trade on his own behalf as well as for family members, the middleman, and other customers.  Eydelman bolstered his unlawful profits with commissions from those trades.  The middleman allocated a portion of his ill-gotten profits for eventual payment back to Metro in exchange for the inside information.  Metro also personally traded in advance of at least two deals., In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the District of New Jersey today announced criminal charges against Metro, who lives in Katonah, N.Y., and Eydelman, who lives in Colts Neck, N.J., According to the SECs complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, the scheme began in early February 2009 at a bar in New York City when Metro met the middleman and other friends for drinks.  When Metro and the middleman separated from the rest of their friends and began discussing stocks, the middleman expressed concern about his holdings in Sirius XM Radio and his fear that the company may go bankrupt.  Metro divulged that Liberty Media Corp. planned to invest more than $500 million in Sirius, and said he obtained this information by viewing documents at the law firm where he worked.  As a result, the middleman later called Eydelman and told him to buy additional shares of Sirius.  Eydelman expressed similar concern about Sirius struggling stock, but the middleman assured him that his reliable source was a friend who worked at a law firm.  Following the public announcement of the deal, whose news coverage noted that Simpson Thacher acted as legal counsel to Sirius, Eydelman acknowledged to the middleman, Nice trade.  The middleman told Metro following the announcement that he had set aside approximately $7,000 for Metro as a thank you for the information.  Instead of taking the money, Metro told the middleman to leave it in his brokerage account and invest it on Metros behalf based on confidential information that he planned to pass him in the future. , According to the SECs complaint, Metro tipped and Eydelman traded on inside information about 12 more companies as they settled into a routine to cloak their illegal activities.  Metro shared confidential nonpublic information with the middleman by typing on his cell phone screen the names or ticker symbols of the two companies involved in the transaction.  Metro pointed to the names or ticker symbols to indicate which company was the acquirer and which was being acquired.  Metro also conveyed the approximate price of the transaction and the approximate announcement date.  The middleman then communicated to Eydelman that they should meet.  Once at Grand Central Station, the middleman walked up to Eydelman and showed him the post-it note or napkin containing the ticker symbol of the company whose stock price was likely to increase as a result of the corporate transaction.  Eydelman watched the middleman chew or eat the tip to destroy the evidence.  Eydelman also learned from the middleman an approximate price of the transaction and an approximate announcement date., The SEC alleges that Eydelman then returned to his office and typically gathered research about the target company.  He eventually e-mailed the research to the middleman along with his purported thoughts about why buying the stock made sense.  The contrived e-mails were intended to create what Eydelman and the middleman believed to be a sufficient paper trail with plausible justification for engaging in the transaction., The SECs complaint charges Metro and Eydelman with violating Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 as well as Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.  The complaint seeks a final judgment ordering Metro and Eydelman to pay disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and penalties, and permanent injunctions from future violations of these provisions of the federal securities laws., The SECs investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Jason Burt and Carolyn Welshhans in the Market Abuse Unit.  John Rymas, Mathew Wong, Daniel Koster, and Leigh Barrett assisted with the investigation.  The case was supervised by Mr. Hawke and Mr. Cohen.

We are creating a new business model.”, The SEC alleges that Xu and his entities made various false claims to investors about purported partnerships with more than 700 major companies such as Siemens, Denny’s, and Goldman Sachs – in some instances falsely representing that they had permission to use their logos.  Meantime, besides buying two golf courses with investor money, Xu and his entities also purchased a warehouse, vacant land, and several single family homes  They also used investor funds to play the stock market and make other related investments through intermediary companies, such as an oil and gas offering.  They also sent investor money to a rough diamond jewel merchant in Hong Kong and another unrelated company affiliated with Xu., The SEC’s complaint alleges that WCM, WCM777, and Xu violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5.  The complaint further alleges that Xu violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act.  In addition to the asset freezes and appointment of a temporary receiver, the Honorable Christina A. Snyder also granted the SEC’s request for an order prohibiting the destruction of documents and requiring the defendants to provide accountings. A court hearing has been scheduled for April 10, 2014., The SEC’s investigation has been conducted by Peter Del Greco, Maria Rodriguez, and Marc Blau of the Los Angeles office.  The SEC’s litigation will be led by John Bulgozdy.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr22953.htm</i><br/>]"

Halek of Southlake, Texas and Patrick J. Booths of Fort Worth fraudulently conducted unregistered securities offerings of working interests in oil and gas projects that were owned and operated by Halek’s company, Halek Energy, LLC. These projects were offered to investors by Joshua D. Spivey of Morristown, Tennessee and Steven J. Little of Southlake, Texas, through their separately incorporated companies. Through this alleged scheme, Halek and the other defendants sold more than $5.5 million in Halek Energy oil and gas working interests to more than 100 investors nationwide., The Commissions complaint alleges that the investments were offered and sold to investors through separately incorporated companies owned and operated by Spivey, Little and a third individual. The Commission contends that these individuals and companies were merely “straw men” who sold and promoted investments in new Halek Energy oil and gas projects. Booths was Halek Energy’s Vice President of Sales and Marketing and served as Halek’s point man on the alleged scheme.  Booths helped Halek recruit the straw men and assisted in facilitating their sale and promotion of Halek Energy projects through their companies., According to the complaint, offering documents given to investors falsely claimed that the straw men companies owned the oil and gas projects. In fact, none of the companies owned any part of the projects. Rather, the projects were established and owned by Halek Energy and controlled by Halek and Booths. Spivey and Little each received large commissions or other compensation from promoting and selling the working interests for Halek and Halek Energy. Booths was also well compensated for his role in the alleged scheme. , The complaint alleges that Halek conceived of the straw men scheme after the Commission began investigating his involvement in an earlier scheme to make fraudulent oil-and-gas securities offerings. As a result of that earlier scheme, the Commission sued Halek and Halek Energy in August 2010. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2010/lr21637.htm>Lit. Rel. No. 21637</a>.

In addition, the Commission charges Joshua Spivey and Steven Little with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), 17(a)(2) and 17a(3) of the Securities Act and Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, defendants Booths, Spivey, and Little have agreed to injunctions against violations of these provisions, and to follow-on administrative bars that would bar them from association with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, transfer agent, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization, or from participating in any offering of a penny stock.

Clients then traded on the inside information.  Portfolio managers and analysts at prominent hedge funds and investment advisers paid Kinnucan and Broadband significant consulting fees for the information that Kinnucan provided.

(Shaw)., The SEC alleges that Walter D. Wagner of Rockville, Maryland, and Alexander J. Osborn of Alexandria, Virginia realized nearly $1 million in combined profits by trading on material, nonpublic information concerning the impending acquisition of Shaw by Chicago Bridge and Iron Company. Wagner was tipped by his longtime friend and college classmate John W. Femenia, who worked at a firm that was considering whether to participate in financing the transaction. Wagner then tipped his friend Osborn with the inside information. Both Wagner and Osborn traded heavily in Shaw securities ahead of the July 30, 2012 announcement of the acquisition, after which Shaws closing stock price jumped approximately 55 percent from the previous day., Wagner has agreed to settle with the SECs charges by disgorging his ill-gotten gains plus interest, with any additional financial penalty to be determined by the court at a later date. In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Western District of North Carolina announced criminal charges against Wagner., The SECs litigation continues against Osborn. The SEC already charged Femenia in a <a href=/News/PressRelease/Detail/PressRelease/1365171486614>related insider trading case</a>. He was subsequently <a href=/litigation/admin/2014/34-71619.pdf>barred from the securities industry</a>., According to the SECs complaint filed in federal court in Greenbelt, Maryland, Femenia collected nonpublic details about the acquisition while at work and communicated them to Wagner via text messages and phone calls in violation of the duty he owed his firm to keep the information confidential. Wagner knew Femenia was employed in investment banking at Wells Fargo Securities. Wagner in turn tipped Osborn, who knew that Wagners source was employed in the finance industry. Wagner and Osborn used the nonpublic information to obtain illegal trading profits of approximately $517,784 and $439,830 respectively., The SECs complaint charges Wagner and Osborn with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Sample of San Diego, California raised almost $1 million from five investors based on representations that he would use their money to trade on the investors’ behalf. Instead, the Commission alleges that he fraudulently diverted approximately one-third of the money for his personal use and to make payments to other investors. , The Commissions complaint alleges that Sample raised the money from investors based in New Mexico and elsewhere through his hedge fund, The Lobo Volatility Fund, LLC. Sample told investors he would take a monthly management fee of 1/12 of 1% of Lobo’s net asset value, 20% of trading profits and only limited expenses. But almost immediately after receiving investor funds, Sample diverted significant sums to his personal accounts, credit card payments, retail purchases, meals, and entertainment. The complaint further alleges that when Sample’s trading strategy failed, resulting in the loss of all remaining investor funds, he provided investors with false documents making it look like his trading had been successful. He also used at least $50,000 from a new investor to make a partial payment to an investing couple who had demanded a refund. , The Commission charges Sample with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), (2) and (4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

22968,2014,[<h3>SEC Charges CVS with Misleading Investors and Committing Accounting Violations</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged CVS Caremark Corp. with misleading investors about significant financial setbacks and using improper accounting that artificially boosted its financial performance., CVS has agreed to pay $20 million to settle the charges., According to the SECs complaint filed in federal court in Rhode Island, CVS has two business segments as a pharmacy benefits manager and a retail chain of drug stores.  In offering documents for a $1.5 billion bond offering in 2009, CVS fraudulently omitted that it had recently lost significant Medicare Part D and contract revenues in the pharmacy benefits segment.  Investors were therefore misled about the expected future financial results for that line of business.  When CVS eventually revealed the full extent of the setbacks on Nov. 5, 2009, its stock price fell 20 percent in one day.  CVS further misled investors on an earnings call that same day by maintaining there was a slight improvement in its retention rate, which is a key metric of retained business often used to compare pharmacy benefits management companies.  But CVS omitted the fact that it had manipulated how it calculated the rate and concealed the full extent of its lost business., The SECs complaint further alleges that CVS made improper accounting adjustments that overstated the financial results for its retail pharmacy line of business.  During the same 2009 timeframe, CVS altered the accounting treatment for its acquisition of another drug store chain - Longs Drugs - and failed to disclose the adjustments in its quarterly report filed on November 5.  CVS improperly reduced the value of $189 million of personal property in the Longs stores down to $0, and then reversed $49 million of depreciation that had been taken on those assets since the acquisition.  The undisclosed depreciation reversal increased the third-quarter earnings and enabled CVS to exceed analysts expectations at a time when it was otherwise announcing significant bad news about earnings projections in its pharmacy benefits line of business., The SEC alleges that the improper accounting adjustments were orchestrated by Laird Daniels, who was the retail controller at CVS and is charged with accounting violations in a related SEC administrative proceeding.  According to the SECs order against Daniels, proper accounting would have treated the asset write-down as a current period expense, and the third quarter earnings per share for CVS would have been reduced by as much as 17 percent.  As Daniels described in an e-mail, the dramatic change in accounting turned the acquisition of Longs Drugs from a bad guy to a good guy in terms of purported profitability for CVS., Daniels has agreed to settle the administrative case against him by paying a $75,000 penalty and being barred for at least one year from practicing as an accountant on behalf of any publicly traded company or other entity regulated by the SEC.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Daniels agreed to the entry of a cease-and-desist order finding that he willfully violated Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 13b2-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  The order finds that Daniels willfully aided, abetted, and caused violations by CVS of the reporting, books and records, and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws. See Order Instituting Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 4C and 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 102(e) of the Commissions Rules of Practice, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order, Administrative Proceeding File No. 3-15825, Securities Act <a href=/litigation/admin/2014/33-9573.pdf>Release No. 9573</a>, Exchange Act Release No. 71896, Accounting and Audit Enforcement Release No. 3548 (April 8, 2014)., The SECs complaint charges CVS with violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act.

Inc., and their respective principals Joseph Signore of West Palm Beach, Fla. and Paul L. Schumack II of Pompano Beach, Fla.  The complaint, filed in United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, alleges that, from at least 2011 through the present, the defendants fraudulently raised at least $40 million from hundreds of investors nationwide through the ongoing sale of investments in Virtual Concierge machines (VCMs).  The defendants guaranteed exorbitant returns, ranging from 80 to 120% annually and up to 500% over the life of a three- or four-year investment contract.  Also, on April 7, 2014, Judge Donald M. Middlebrooks, U.S. District Judge for the Southern District of Florida, issued an order placing JCS and TBTI under the control of a receiver to safeguard assets, as well as other emergency orders, including temporary restraining orders and asset freezes. , According to the SEC’s complaint unsealed today, JCS, T.B.T.I, Signore, and Schumack touted the VCMs as a revolutionary product and fail-safe investment.  The defendants promised to place and manage VCMs, which are ATM-like machines, at various locations to advertise products and services via touch screen, and print tickets or coupons, among other services.  They represented that advertising revenue would generate the guaranteed returns paid to investors, who did not have to take any additional steps to earn their money.  In reality, Signore, Schumack and their companies operated a Ponzi scheme, where, through numerous misrepresentations and omissions, they used new investor funds to make payments to earlier investors.  , In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida today announced criminal charges against Signore and Schumack. , The defendants promoted VCMs on the internet though YouTube videos, and promised to locate, place and manage the VCMs, as well as inform investors about the location and activity of their VCMs.  These representations were false.  The defendants did not place VCMs at anywhere near the rate of those purchased by investors.  Moreover, investors could not track their VCM’s activity, and the defendants did not provide investors with the location of their VCMs as promised. , The SEC’s complaint alleges that while operating the Ponzi scheme, Signore and Schumack also diverted more than $2.5 million to themselves and family members, and used money to fund other business ventures, for recreational purposes, and to satisfy financial obligations.  While the majority of investors stopped receiving their monthly payments in January 2014, the defendants continued to solicit investors.  Schumack continued lying to investors in an effort to generate more capital by providing a bulletin stating their last opportunity to invest was expiring at year end 2013.  Schumack later fabricated excuses to placate irate investors who were no longer receiving their returns, telling them their checks were forthcoming.  They were not.  When investors started complaining, JCS also continued its fraud by issuing a press release, posted on its website, claiming it was “investigating the matter” and TBTI had defrauded JCS.   , The SEC’s complaint charges JCS, TBTI, Signore and Schumack with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC also seeks disgorgement of all ill-gotten gains, including prejudgment interest thereon; an order directing the defendants to pay civil money penalties; and any other relief that may be necessary and appropriate., The SEC’s investigation was conducted by Fernando Torres, Linda S.

The Commission alleges that Posey repeatedly traded in the securities of Carters based on inside information that he possessed as a result of his position at Carters, and that he tipped material nonpublic information to the companys former Vice-President and Director of Investor Relations, Eric M. Martin (Martin).,  The Commissions complaint alleges that from at least January 2006 through at least October 2009, while in possession of material inside information, Posey traded Carters stock without preclearance during blackout periods in advance of quarterly earnings releases and announcements. Poseys trades produced gains and avoided losses totaling $49,778.

In fact, the Commission alleges that the bank guarantees were fictional and the trading programs non-existent, and that Rice and other defendants together defrauded investors of more than $1.8 million.

Coughlin, 63, and two entities that did business as Oxford International Credit Union or Oxford International Cooperative Union with conducting an Internet offering fraud in which investors lost millions of dollars by investing funds in a fictitious credit union.  The complaint alleges that between June 2007 and December 2009, Coughlin and Oxford International Credit Union collected deposits from more than 5,000 investors exceeding $12.8 million dollars.  Approximately 3,300 of the investors were U.S. residents, with victims residing in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.  The SECs complaint alleges that Coughlin misappropriated investor money to pay personal expenses, fund unrelated business expenses, and make distributions to other investors in a classic Ponzi-scheme fashion., According to the SECs complaint, to further the fraud, the defendants posted false information to investors online accounts to create the appearance that their deposits in the fake credit union were earning substantial daily investment returns.  The Oxford International Credit Union website (www.oxfordicu.com), for example, showed investors that their deposits were purportedly earning investment returns that averaged, during the January 2007 through December 2009 period, 0.471% each trading day, equating to an approximately 356% average annual rate of return.  According to the complaint, however, the defendants did not actually make investments with the members deposits sufficient to generate the returns they boasted.  Coughlin and Oxford International Credit Union also falsely claimed that member accounts were insured by a private insurance company.  Then, beginning in December 2008, Coughlin began operating a successor to Oxford International Credit Union, called Oxford International Cooperative Union, which also boasted bogus investment returns on its website (<a href=/cgi-bin/goodbye.cgi?www.oxfordprivacygroup.com/>www.oxfordprivacygroup.com</a>) from its inception in late 2008 through December 2011. , The SECs complaint alleges that Coughlin misappropriated at least $5.97 million and used investor money for illegitimate purposes, including $1.57 million used for personal expenditures and $4.4 million (or approximately 35%) to pay other investors who had requested withdrawals from their Oxford International Credit Union accounts .  Coughlin also transferred money from Oxford International Credit Unions accounts to bank accounts he controlled in the names of two relief defendants., According to the SECs complaint, in late 2008 and 2009, Coughlin began to deny investors requests for withdrawals from their accounts.  To explain his refusal to allow investors to access their funds, Coughlin falsely claimed that Internal Revenue Service and foreign tax authorities had frozen Oxford International Credit Union and Oxford International Cooperative Unions accounts., In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Virginia today unsealed a criminal complaint against Coughlin., The SECs complaint charges Coughlin, OICU Ltd. and OICU Investments Corp. with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and seeks disgorgement of all ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, conduct-based injunctions, and an officer-and-director bar against Coughlin.

(collectively, Defendants).  The Commissions action charged that Defendants were operating a fraudulent Ponzi scheme.  The charging document filed by the United States Attorneys Office alleges that Palladino knowingly and wilfully disobey[ed] Court orders in the Commissions action that froze all of Defendants assets, required that Defendants deposit all funds in their possession into a court-ordered escrow account, and required Palladino to purge himself of a prior order of civil contempt.  If convicted, Palladino, who is currently serving a prison sentence based on convictions in state court for the same Ponzi scheme activity, could face additional incarceration., On April 30, 2013, the Commission filed an emergency action against Defendants in federal district court in Massachusetts.  In its complaint, the Commission alleged that, since April 2011, Defendants misrepresented to at least 33 investors that their funds would be used to conduct the business of Viking - which was purportedly to make short-term, high interest loans to those unable to obtain traditional financing.  The Commission also alleged that Palladino misrepresented to investors that the loans made by Viking would be secured by first interest liens on non-primary residence properties and that investors would be repaid their principal, plus monthly interest at rates generally ranging from 7-15%, from payments that borrowers made on the loans.  The complaint alleged that Defendants actually made very few real loans to borrowers, and instead used investors funds largely to pay earlier investors and to fund the Palladino familys lavish lifestyle., When the Commission first filed its action, it moved the Court for a temporary restraining order, asset freeze, and other emergency relief.  On April 30, 2013, the Court issued a temporary restraining order, which included the asset freeze, and set the matter for further hearing on May 3, 2013.  On May 3, 2013, the Court issued a revised restraining order, which included the same asset freeze.  On May 15, 2013, the Court issued the order that Defendants deposit all funds in their possession into an escrow account.  The asset freeze and escrow order have remained in effect at all times since April 30, 2013 and May 15, 2013, respectively., Since September 2013, the Commission has filed four motions for civil contempt against Palladino.  The Commissions first motion for contempt, filed on September 4, 2013, alleged that Palladino violated the asset freeze by transferring three vehicles that he owned (solely or jointly with his wife) into his wifes name and using the vehicles as collateral for new loans - effectively cashing out the equity in these vehicles.  The motion also alleged that Palladino violated the escrow order by failing to deposit the funds he received from this cashing-out process into the escrow account.  On November 15, 2013, the Court held Palladino in contempt and ordered that he restore ownership of the vehicles that he had transferred into his wifes name.  Subsequently, Palladino reported to the Court that he had repaid all the new loans and restored ownership of two of the vehicles (but had failed to restore ownership of one vehicle).  The Commission alleges that, in truth, the checks used to repay the new loans on the vehicles were all returned for insufficient funds.  According to the Commissions allegations, to date, Palladino has not purged the civil contempt order against him.  The Commission also filed three other contempt motions against Palladino charging that (i) he obtained a loan for $6,750 from a Viking investor and failed to deposit this amount into the escrow account; (ii) he sold a truck owned by him for $9,500 and failed to deposit this amount into the escrow account; and (iii) he opened new credit cards and ran up charges for cash advances, gold coins, luxury merchandise and fine dining and failed to deposit the cash and other assets obtained into the escrow account - all in violation of the asset freeze and escrow order.  These three motions remain outstanding.  The United States Attorneys Offices criminal charges arise from these same violations, as well as Palladinos alleged refusal to comply with the civil contempt order., On July 15, 2013, the Court held that Defendants conduct violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act.  On November 18, 2013, the Court entered orders that enjoined Defendants from further violations of the antifraud provisions of the securities laws and ordered them to pay disgorgement of $9,701,738, plus prejudgment interest of $122,370.  On January 14, 2014, Palladino pled guilty in Suffolk Superior Court to various state criminal charges based on the same conduct alleged by the Commission in its case.  Palladino is currently serving a 10-12 year prison sentence for his state court convictions., The Commission acknowledges the continued assistance of Suffolk County (Massachusetts) District Attorney Daniel F.

That asset freeze, which the U.S. District Court in Boston ordered on Wednesday, secured millions of dollars of funds and prevented the potential dissipation of investor assets.  After the SEC staff implemented the asset freeze, at the SECs request the Court lifted the seal today, permitting public announcement of the SECs charges.,  The SEC alleges that TelexFree, Inc. and TelexFree, LLC claim to run a multilevel marketing company that sells telephone service based on voice over Internet (VoIP) technology but actually are operating an elaborate pyramid scheme.  In addition to charging the company, the SEC charged several TelexFree officers and promoters, and named several entities related to TelexFree as relief defendants based on their receipt of investor funds.,  According to the SECs complaint filed in federal court in Massachusetts, the defendants sold securities in the form of TelexFree memberships that promised annual returns of 200 percent or more for those who promoted TelexFree by recruiting new members and placing TelexFree advertisements on free Internet ad sites.  The SEC complaint alleges that TelexFrees VoIP sales revenues of approximately $1.3 million from August 2012 through March 2014 are barely one percent of the more than $1.1 billion needed to cover its promised payments to its promoters.  As a result, in classic pyramid scheme fashion, TelexFree is paying earlier investors, not with revenue from selling its VoIP product but with money received from newer investors.,  According to the SECs complaint, the defendants have continued enrolling new investors but recently changed TelexFrees method of compensating promoters, requiring them to actually sell the VoIP product to qualify for payments that TelexFree had previously promised to pay them.  The complaint also alleges that since December 2013, TelexFree has transferred $30 million or more of investor funds from TelexFree operating accounts to accounts controlled by TelexFree affiliates or the individual defendants., In addition to the TelexFree firms, the complaint charges TelexFree co-owner James Merrill, of Ashland, Mass., TelexFree co-owner and treasurer Carlos Wanzeler, of Northborough, Mass., TelexFree CFO Joseph H. Craft, of Boonville, Ind., and TelexFrees international sales director, Steve Labriola, of Northbridge, Mass.  The SEC also charged four individuals who were promoters of TelexFrees program:  Sanderley Rodrigues de Vasconcelos, formerly of Revere, Mass., now of Davenport, Fla., Santiago De La Rosa, of Lynn, Mass., Randy N. Crosby, of Alpharetta, Ga., and Faith R. Sloan, of Chicago., The SECs complaint alleges that TelexFree, Inc., TelexFree, LLC, Merrill, Wanzeler, Craft, Labriola, Rodrigues de Vasconcelos, De La Rosa, Crosby, and Sloan violated the registration and antifraud provisions of U.S. securities laws: Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Among other things, the SECs complaint seeks, against these primary defendants, permanent injunctions prohibiting further violations of the laws charged, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil monetary penalties.  The SEC also charged three entities related to TelexFree (TelexFree Financial, Inc., TelexElectric, LLLP, and Telex Mobile Holdings, Inc.) as relief defendants based on their receipt of investor funds, and seeks disgorgement of those funds plus prejudgment interest., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2014/comp-pr2014-79.pdf>SEC Complaint</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr22974.htm</i><br/>]"
22975,2014,[<h3>SEC Charges Former Bp Employee with Insider Trading During  the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a former 20-year employee of BP p.l.c. and a senior responder during the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill with insider trading in BP securities based on confidential information about the magnitude of the disaster.  The price of BP securities fell significantly after the April 20, 2010 explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig, and the subsequent oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, resulted in an extensive clean-up effort., According to the SECs complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, BP tasked Keith A. Seilhan with coordinating BPs oil collection and clean-up operations in the Gulf of Mexico and along the coast.  Seilhan, an experienced crisis manager, directed BPs oil skimming operations and its efforts to contain the expansion of the oil spill.  The complaint alleges that within days, Seilhan received nonpublic information on the extent of the evolving disaster, including oil flow estimates and data on the volume of oil floating on the surface of the Gulf., The complaint alleges that by April 29, 2010, in filings to the SEC, BP estimated that the flow rate of the spill was up to 5,000 barrels of oil per day (bopd).  The companys public estimate was significantly less than the actual flow rate, which was estimated later to be between 52,700 and 62,200 bopd.  The information that Seilhan obtained indicated that the magnitude of the oil spill and thus, BPs potential liability and financial exposure, was likely to be greater than had been publicly disclosed., According to the complaint, while in possession of this material, nonpublic information, and in breach of duties owed to BP and its shareholders, Seilhan directed the sale of his familys entire $1 million portfolio of BP securities over the course of two days in late April 2010.  The trades allowed Seilhan to avoid losses and reap unjust profits as the price of BP securities dropped by approximately 48 percent after the sales on April 29 and April 30, 2010, reaching their lowest point in late June 2010., Without admitting or denying the allegations, Seilhan consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of federal antifraud laws and SEC antifraud rules.  Seilhan, of Tomball, Texas, also agreed to return $105,409 of allegedly ill-gotten gains, plus $13,300 of prejudgment interest, and pay a civil penalty of $105,409.  The settlement is subject to court approval., The SECs investigation was conducted by Matthew S. Raalf, Brian P. Thomas, John S. Rymas, Kelly L. Gibson, Brendan P. McGlynn, G.

The Commissions complaint alleges that between 2004 and 2010, Vitale and RATI fraudulently raised at least $8.7 million from investors through four real estate securities offerings. According to the complaint, Vitale and RATI made numerous materially false and misleading statements and omissions concerning, among other things, the credentials and experience of Vitale and other purported RATI officers, Vitales supposed reputation for honesty in the investment world, the safety of investing in RATI, and the ownership of the properties purchased with RATI investor proceeds. The complaint further alleges that Vitale also effected transactions in securities for the account of others without being registered as a broker in connection with his RATI activities, and, by so doing, violated both the unregistered-broker statute and a 2006 Commission Order that barred him from association with any broker or dealer. The complaint further alleges that no registration statement was on file with the Commission or in effect with respect to any of the RATI offerings or sales., The Commission charges Vitale and RATI with violating Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The charges stem from an alleged oil and gas offering fraud., The Commissions complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, alleges that between August 2010 and June 2013, Mullins, Guardian, and GONG raised approximately $6.5 million through the fraudulent offer and sale of securities to investors in the form of limited partnership interests in oil and gas programs., According to the complaint, Mullins and Guardian failed to disclose to investors Guardians deteriorating financial condition, including significant amounts owed on pre-existing bank loans.  The Commission further alleges that defendants falsely represented to investors that their contributions would be used solely for the specific drilling project in which they had invested but instead, under Mullinss direction, Guardian and GONG redirected investor funds for other unrelated purposes.  The complaint also alleges that defendants falsely represented to investors that they would directly receive revenue from the sale of any oil and gas production from the project in which they were invested when, in truth, operators were deducting from production revenue expenses due on other unrelated projects, a process known as net checking.  Moreover, according to the Complaint, Mullins made direct misrepresentations to investors.  When, after collecting money from investors for one project and spending that money on unrelated expenses, Guardian was unable to obtain an interest in the oil and gas drilling project that it had purported to sell to investors, Mullins further lied to investors, telling them, among other things, that the well was unproductive and that Defendants had been approached by a possible purchaser of the partnerships interest.  The Commission alleges that Defendants never disclosed that the investors funds had been spent elsewhere and that Defendants had been unable to actually obtain an interest in the drilling project they sold. , The complaint alleges that Mullins, Guardian, and GONG violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Bekkedam, of Hobe Sound, Florida. Bekkedam is the former owner, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer of Ballamor Capital Management, LLC (“Ballamor”), a formerly SEC-registered investment adviser located in Radnor, Pennsylvania., The SEC’s complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, alleges that from April through October 2009, Bekkedam fraudulently induced, or assisted in inducing, his advisory clients and others to invest approximately $100 million in a fund that purportedly purchased lawsuit settlements from now-convicted Ponzi-schemer Scott Rothstein. The settlements Rothstein sold were not real and the supposed plaintiffs and defendants did not exist. Rothstein simply used the funds in classic Ponzi scheme fashion to make payments due other investors and support his lavish lifestyle. Rothstein’s scheme collapsed in October 2009, and he is currently serving 50 years in federal custody., The complaint alleges that, in early 2009, Bekkedam met George Levin, a Florida businessman, who was himself a Rothstein investor and had been raising capital from investors to purchase settlements from Rothstein since 2007. Levin’s investments with Rothstein were at risk if he could not find additional investors. In April 2009, Levin and Bekkedam formed a private fund called Banyon Income Fund, LP (the “Banyon Fund”) to enable Bekkedam to raise funds from clients and others to be invested exclusively in Rothstein’s settlements., The SEC alleges that, when soliciting his advisory clients and other prospective investors to invest in the Banyon Fund, Bekkedam made material misrepresentations and omissions regarding the level of due diligence he and Ballamor had performed, including their access to information confirming the existence of the settlement funds, the authenticity of Rothstein’s investment program, and the overall safety of investing in the Rothstein settlements. At the time that Rothstein’s scheme collapsed, Banyon Fund investors had received approximately $2 million in interest payments, with their approximately $100 million principal investments lost in the Ponzi scheme., The SEC’s complaint further alleges that Bekkedam also concealed from his advisory clients and other prospective investors the nature of his relationship with Levin and the clear conflicts of interest resulting from the financial arrangements between Levin and Bekkedam and his affiliates. Throughout 2009, Levin and Bekkedam engaged in a series of transactions designed to funnel money to Bekkedam and his related entities in exchange for Bekkedam’s solicitation of investors in the Fund. The transactions included Levin’s agreement to purchase approximately $3 million in municipal bonds from Bekkedam, Levin’s agreement to help Bekkedam restructure $10 million of his personal and business debt, Levin’s agreement to invest up to $5 million in Ballamor, and Levin’s purported investment of $5 million in a bank co-founded by Bekkedam with an agreement to invest up to an additional $13 million. , The complaint alleges that Bekkedam violated Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and seeks a final judgment ordering a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains together with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty against Bekkedam., The SEC’s investigation was conducted by Kelly L.

Smith acted as Maloms attorney as well as its escrow agent and paymaster., According to the SECs complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Hampshire, Smith, leveraging his title and position as an attorney, made several false and misleading statements to investors.  These statements concerned Maloms financial strength and history of success, Smiths familiarity with Malom and its principals, and the status of transactions from which Malom would repay investors who lost all their funds.

22985,2014,[<h3>SEC Charges Ohio-Based Investment Adviser and President for Fraudulently Hiding Account Shortfall</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that it filed securities fraud and other charges against Professional Investment Management, Inc., a Columbus, Ohio-based investment adviser, and its president, Douglas E. Cowgill, of Columbus, Ohio, for repeatedly hiding a shortfall of more than $700,000 in client assets., The SECs complaint, which was filed under seal on April 29, 2014, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, and unsealed on May 2, alleged that a shortfall in a money market fund account managed by Professional Investment Management (PIM) was discovered when the agency conducted an examination of the firm to verify the existence of client assets.  PIM reported in account statements sent to clients that they held a total of approximately $7.7 million in a particular money market fund when in fact the account reflecting these investments held less than $7 million., The SEC further alleges that Douglas Cowgill, who is the chief compliance officer as well as president of the firm, attempted to disguise this shortfall from SEC examiners by entering a fake trade in PIMs account records.  The purported trade was later reversed.  Cowgill allegedly provided additional falsified reports to SEC staff, and he later transferred funds from a cash account at another financial institution to eliminate the shortfall in the money market fund account.  However, that cash account also was held for the benefit of clients; thus Cowgill merely moved the shortfall from one asset holding to another in an effort to avoid detection., In response to the SECs request for emergency relief, U.S. District Court Judge Algenon L. Marbley issued a temporary restraining order and imposed an asset freeze to protect client assets., According to the SECs complaint, PIM manages approximately $120 million in assets for approximately 325 clients, including a significant number of retirement plans.  PIM was registered with the SEC as an investment adviser from 1978 until Sept. 30, 2013, when it withdrew its registration.  The firm had custody of client assets through various omnibus securities and cash accounts, and therefore was required to comply with the Custody Rule under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  The Custody Rule is designed to protect advisory clients from misuse of their funds and securities. , According to the SECs complaint, the SEC commenced an examination of the firm in November 2013 after learning that for four consecutive years, PIM had failed to arrange for independent verification of client assets as required by the Custody Rule, and had filed a notice withdrawing its registration with the SEC., The SECs complaint alleges that PIM and Cowgill violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 206(1) and (2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  In addition, the complaint alleges that PIM violated, and Cowgill aided and abetted PIMs violations of, Sections 203(a) and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-2 thereunder.  A hearing on the SECs motion for a preliminary injunction has been scheduled for May 12., The SECs investigation arose from the examination conducted by Will Davis, Michael Lockhart, Nathan Haselhorst, and Jack Howard of the Chicago Regional Office.  The ongoing investigation and litigation are being conducted by David Benson, Ann Tushaus, Paul Montoya, John Birkenheier, and Michael Foster of the Chicago office.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr22985.htm</i><br/>]"
22986,2014,[<h3>SEC Charges Toronto-Based Consultant and Four Others with Multiple Chinese Reverse Merger Schemes</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil injunctive action on May 5, 2014, in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against Canadian citizens S. Paul Kelley and George Tazbaz, Roger D. Lockhart of Arkansas, Robert S. Agriogianis of Florham Park, New Jersey, and Shawn A. Becker of Overland Park, Kansas, for their roles in nearly identical schemes to take two Chinese companies -- China Auto Logistics, Inc. (China Auto), and Guanwei Recycling Corp. (Guanwei) -- public through reverse mergers with U.S. public shell companies, hide their control over the companies stock through a vast network of U.S. and international entities, sell that stock in unregistered distributions, and manipulate trading in the stock, ultimately obtaining millions in profits as a result., The SECs complaint alleges the two schemes were orchestrated by Kelley, in coordination with Tazbaz, Lockhart, and Agriogianis (collectively, the Kelley Group) and Becker, an affiliated stock promoter.  The complaint alleges the schemes followed a similar pattern, which began when the Kelley Group reached secret oral agreements with the management of China Auto and Guanwei that they would cover all of the companies costs of going public in the United States, plus costs associated with the companies securities remaining publicly traded for at least two years, in exchange for approximately 30 - 40% of the resulting public companies stock.  The complaint alleges the Kelley Group then acquired controlling interests in the stock of two publicly-held U.S. shell companies, which were used as the vehicles to bring China Auto and Guanwei public.  The complaint further alleges that, consistent with their secret agreement, the Kelley Group paid for expenses on behalf of China Auto and Guanwei, including outside auditors, lawyers, and stock promoters, in order to prepare the companies to go public.  In addition, the complaint alleges the Kelley Group structured reverse mergers between China Auto, Guanwei, and the respective shell companies, such that they initially controlled nearly all of the companies shares that were available to be publicly traded - the public float - but hid that control by directing that the stock be distributed to myriad entities that the Kelley Group controlled in the U.S., Canada, and Hong Kong, and by failing to file the required SEC reports disclosing their ownership.  Furthermore, the complaint alleges that at times after China Auto and Guanweis stock began publicly trading, the Kelley Group, acting in concert with Becker and other stock promoters, manipulated the trading of the stocks, artificially boosting the stock price and volume to help facilitate the listing of both companies on NASDAQ.  The complaint alleges that after succeeding in taking China Auto and Guanwei public in the United States, the Defendants sold millions of their shares in China Auto and Guanwei, and made millions in profits from their fraudulent schemes., In addition, the complaint alleges that from approximately June 2009 through at least December 2010, Tazbaz, Lockhart, and Becker also engaged in a separate scheme to artificially inflate the price and volume of the stock of a third Chinese company that members of the Kelley Group had previously taken public, Kandi Technologies Group Inc., The complaint alleges that Kelley, Tazbaz, Lockhart, Agriogianis and Becker each violated the anti-fraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Rule 10b-5 adopted thereunder;  the securities ownership reporting requirements of Sections 13(d) and 16(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13d-1, 13d-2 and 16a-3; and the securities registration provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act).  The complaint also alleges that Kelley, Tazbaz, Lockhart, and Becker each violated the anti-fraud provisions Section 17(a) of the Securities Act; the market manipulation provisions of Section 9(a) of the Exchange Act; and the restrictions on purchasing during a distribution prohibited by Rule 101 of Regulation M.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Kelley and Becker violated the broker-dealer registration provisions of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act by failing to register as broker-dealers when they effected securities transactions.  The SECs complaint seeks permanent injunctions against further violations, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, civil penalties, and other relief against the defendants., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, Kelley, Lockhart and Agriogianis consented to entry of a final judgments in which each agreed to be enjoined from violating Sections 5, and 17(a) of the Securities Act; and Sections 9(a), 10(b), 13(d), , and 16(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 10b-5, 13d-1, 13d-2, and 16a-3 thereunder. Kelley and Lockhart further agreed to be enjoined from violating Rule 101 of Regulation M; Kelley additionally agreed to be enjoined from violating Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act. Kelley also agreed to pay disgorgement of $2,828,353.53, prejudgment interest of $560,812.47 and a civil penalty of $2,828,353.53.  Lockhart also agreed to pay disgorgement of $1,819,211.77, prejudgment interest of $332,268.15, and a civil penalty of $1,000,000.

Holley, for trading on the basis of inside information about an impending acquisition of the company that was illegally tipped to them by Holley. , In Complaints filed in the U.S. District Court in Trenton, New Jersey, the SEC alleges that, in 2010, Holley, who co-founded Home Diagnostics, provided his friends John Campani and John Mullin, and employee Alan Posner, with confidential information about the impending acquisition of Home Diagnostics by Nipro Corporation. Campani, Mullin, and Posner each purchased Home Diagnostics stock on the basis of Holley’s tips for combined profits of more than $105,000. The SEC previously had charged Holley and other tippees with insider trading based on the same material nonpublic information (<em>SEC v. George H. Holley, et al.</em>, No. 3:11-cv-00205-MLC-DEA (D.N.J.))., The SEC’s complaints charge Campani, Mullin, and Posner with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, the general antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, and Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14e-3 thereunder, the tender offer fraud provisions.

22988,2014,[<h3>SEC Announces Charges and Asset Freeze Against Hedge Fund Advisory Firm Distributing Falsified Performance Results</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission filed fraud charges and sought emergency relief on May 5, 2014, against a New York-based investment advisory firm and two executives for distributing falsified performance results to prospective investors in two hedge funds they managed. , The SECs complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York alleges that Aphelion Fund Management, LLCs (Aphelion) chief investment officer Vineet Kalucha fraudulently altered an outside audit firms report reviewing the performance of an investment account he managed.  Aphelions chief financial officer George Palathinkal allegedly learned about Kaluchas falsifications, which essentially changed an investment loss into a major investment gain in the account.  Nevertheless, the falsified report showing the phony gain instead of the actual loss was distributed to prospective investors.  Furthermore, investors were separately provided false information about Aphelions assets under management and Koluchas litigation history., Kalucha, who is majority owner and managing partner of the firm in addition to chief investment officer, also is charged with siphoning investor proceeds for his luxury car payments and settlements of legal actions against him personally that are unrelated to Aphelion., In response to the SECs request for emergency relief for investors, U.S. District Court Judge Jed S. Rakoff issued a temporary restraining order, imposed an asset freeze to protect client assets, and temporarily prohibited the defendants from soliciting new investors or additional investments from existing investors.  A hearing on the SECs motion for a preliminary injunction has been scheduled for May 15 before Judge Richard M. Berman. , According to the complaint, Aphelion serves as the investment adviser and general partner for two unregistered hedge funds: Aphelion US Fund LP and Aphelion Offshore Fund Ltd.  Kalucha has been managing investor funds since 2009 using a proprietary investment model that he developed.  The outside auditors report showed an investment loss of more than 3 percent during a 15-month period in an account that Kalucha managed.  However, the fraudulent report distributed to investors showed a phony investment gain of 30 percent during an 18-month period.  In addition to distributing the altered report, Aphelion, Kalucha, and Palathinkal also misled investors about Aphelions assets under management.  While Kalucha and Palathinkal told investors at various times during 2013 that Aphielion had $15 million or more in assets under management, the firm never had more than $5 million in assets under management at any point during that year., The complaint further alleges that the defendants misrepresented Kaluchas litigation history to investors.  Under the legal proceedings section in a due diligence questionnaire included in Aphelions marketing materials, Kalucha answered None and added a lengthy, materially misleading explanation of a civil proceeding in which he was involved.  The proceeding, which he did not identify by name, was a case against him by the U.S. Department of Labor for breaching fiduciary duties.  By virtue of a consent judgment in the case, Kalucha and Aphelion are prohibited from acting as investment advisers to many types of common retirement plans, which often invest in hedge funds.  Investors were deprived of this information in the due diligence questionnaire., According to the complaint, Aphelion, Kalucha, and Palathinkal raised $1.5 million in investments for Aphelion from 2013 to March 2014 by representing to investors that the funds would be used for Aphelions operating expenses.  Kalucha actually used more than 40 percent of the funds raised in 2013 for his personal benefit.  He has withdrawn investor proceeds for such things as settlement of a foreclosure action involving his personal residence, settlement of a breach of contract action filed against him in his personal capacity, down payment of a luxury BMW sedan, and payment for tax and accounting services for his personal finances.  Palathinkal approved all of Kaluchas withdrawals.The complaint alleges that Aphelion, Kalucha, and Palathinkal violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Aphelion and Kalucha violated Sections 206(1), (2) and (4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder and that Palathinkal aided and abetted these violations., The SECs investigation and litigation have been conducted by David Benson, Paul Montoya, Eric Phillips, Delia Helpingstine, Kristine Rodriguez, and Joan Price-McLaughlin of the Chicago Regional Office.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr22988.htm</i><br/>]"
22989,2014,[<h3>Three Software Company Founders to Pay $5.8 Million to Settle Charges of Insider Trading Ahead of Sale</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed insider trading charges against three software company founders for taking unfair advantage of incorrect media speculation and analyst reports about the company’s acquisition., They agreed to pay nearly $5.8 million to settle the SEC’s charges., The SEC alleges that Lawson Software’s co-chairman Herbert Richard Lawson tipped his brother William Lawson and family friend John Cerullo with nonpublic information about the status of the company’s 2011 merger discussions with Infor Global Solutions, a privately-held software provider. Lawson Software’s stock price had begun to climb following media and analyst reports that the company was considering a sale and multiple bidders were possible. However, Richard Lawson knew reports about possible multiple bidders were incorrect, and the merger share price offered by the lone bidder was significantly lower than what journalists and analysts were speculating. While in possession of the accurate, inside information from his brother, William Lawson sold more than one million shares of his family’s Lawson Software stock holdings. He also suggested that another trader sell shares. Cerullo sold approximately 175,000 of his company shares on the basis of the nonpublic information. When Lawson Software later announced the merger agreement at the lower-than-anticipated share price, the company’s stock value dropped 8.7 percent. By selling their shares at the inflated stock prices prior to the merger announcement, the traders collectively profited by more than $2 million. , According to the SEC’s complaint filed in federal court in San Francisco, Lawson Software was founded by the Lawsons and Cerullo in 1975 and based in St. Paul, Minn. William Lawson and Cerullo each retired in 2001, but Richard Lawson was still serving as co-chairman of the board of directors when the company began considering a possible sale. After Lawson Software and Infor Global Solutions entered into a non-disclosure agreement and met about a possible merger, Richard Lawson and other members of the board were regularly informed about the ongoing merger discussions. While Infor conducted its due diligence in late February 2011, Lawson Software began a “market check” in which its financial adviser reached out to five competitors to gauge their interest in acquiring the company. The market check elicited little-to-no interest, and Richard Lawson and the board were kept informed throughout the process. , Meanwhile, according to the SEC’s complaint, a March 8 article reported that Lawson Software had retained a financial adviser to explore a possible sale. The article identified other companies as potential acquirers of Lawson Software and led to a 13-percent jump in Lawson Software’s stock price that day. The article also fueled widespread - and incorrect - media speculation about potential acquirers of Lawson Software and possible merger prices. Soon thereafter, Lawson Software publicly confirmed an acquisition offer from Infor for $11.25 per share. Nevertheless, ensuing media and analyst reports still incorrectly suggested that other potential purchasers would likely enter the bidding and submit competing higher offers for Lawson Software. Some reports suggested a merger price of up to $15-16 per share. In reality, the same companies being speculated as potential purchasers already had informed Lawson Software that they weren’t interested in an acquisition. But fueled in part by the reports, Lawson Software’s stock price closed at $12.24 per share on March 14 - nearly $1 higher than Infor’s offer of $11.25. The stock price had increased approximately 23 percent since the March 8 article. , The SEC alleges that Richard Lawson knew that these media and analyst reports were inaccurate and the very entities mentioned as possible acquirers had in fact told the company they were not interested. He knew that Infor was the lone bidder and would not increase its offer. Richard Lawson also knew that Lawson Software’s financial adviser and board of directors viewed Infor’s bid as reasonable. After Richard Lawson tipped his brother and Cerullo with nonpublic information about the planned deal, they proceeded to sell their shares at approximately $1 per share higher than the eventual merger price of $11.25. Following the merger announcement on April 26, Lawson Software’s stock price dipped to $11.06 per share at market close. The merger became effective in July 2011. , Richard Lawson agreed to settle the SEC’s charges by paying a penalty of $1,557,384.57 for tipping his brother and Cerullo. The penalty amount is equivalent to the ill-gotten gains received by William Lawson and Cerullo. Richard Lawson also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company. William Lawson agreed to pay disgorgement of $1,853,671.28, prejudgment interest of $162,442.60, and a penalty of $1,853,671.28 for a total of $3,869,785.16. William Lawson’s disgorgement amount includes the ill-gotten gains of the other trader who he suggested sell shares. Cerullo agreed to pay disgorgement of $178,481.29, prejudgment interest of $15,640.81, and a penalty of $178,481.29 for a total of $372,603.39. Without admitting or denying the SEC’s allegations, the Lawsons and Cerullo agreed to the entry of final judgments enjoining them from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5. The settlement is subject to court approval. , <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2014/comp-pr2014-93.pdf>SEC Complaint</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr22989.htm</i><br/>]"

Armed with the nonpublic information, all three sales managers purchased Atheros securities while exchanging a series of suspiciously-timed phone calls. As news leaked about the impending acquisition and the two companies subsequently announced it in a joint news release, Atheros stock price jumped 20 percent. Cohen, Herman, and Fleischli sold their securities to realize quick profits., In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of California yesterday announced criminal charges against Cohen and Herman., According to the SECs complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, Cohen and Herman live in San Diego and Fleischli lives in Newport Beach, Calif. Qualcomm had an insider trading policy that clearly explained that it was illegal for employees to trade securities while possessing material nonpublic information. Cohen, Herman, and Fleischli each acknowledged receipt of the Qualcomm insider trading policy included in the companys code of business conduct. , However, the SEC alleges that after learning confidentially that Atheros was the target of a Qualcomm acquisition, all three sales managers proceeded to purchase Atheros securities on Jan. 4, 2011. None of them had ever previously traded in Atheros securities. News of the acquisition began leaking out through media reports that same afternoon, and the two companies formally announced the merger agreement on January 5. After selling all of the securities they had purchased, Cohens illegal trading profits mounted to more than $200,000.

Merrill, of Ashland, Massachusetts, and Carlos N. Wanzeler, of Northborough, Massachusetts, with conspiracy to commit wire fraud in connection with the alleged TelexFree pyramid scheme previously charged by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Federal authorities arrested Merrill on Friday, and an arrest warrant was issued for Wanzeler, who the Department of Justice announced is a fugitive. The Department of Justice also announced it has executed 37 seizure warrants seizing assets relating to the fraudulent pyramid scheme., The criminal charges against Merrill and Wanzeler related to the same conduct charged in a civil enforcement action filed by the SEC on Tuesday, April 15, 2014, against Merrill, Wanzeler, and others. Those charges were filed under seal, in connection with the Commissions request for an immediate asset freeze. That asset freeze, which the U.S. District Court in Boston ordered on Wednesday, April 16, secured millions of dollars of funds and prevented the potential dissipation of investor assets. After the SEC staff implemented the asset freeze, at the SECs request the Court lifted the seal on April 17. On April 30, 2014, the Court entered preliminary injunctions extending the asset freeze as to defendants Santiago De La Rosa, of Lynn, Massachusetts, and Randy N. Crosby, of Alpharetta, Georgia. On May 8 and 9, the Court entered preliminary injunctions extending the asset freeze as to all the remaining defendants (Merrill, Wanzeler, TelexFree, Inc., TelexFree, LLC, Joseph H. Craft, of Boonville, Indiana, Steve Labriola, of Northbridge, Massachusetts, Faith R. Sloan, of Chicago, Illinois, and relief defendants (TelexFree Financial, Inc., TelexElectric, LLLP, and Telex Mobile Holdings, Inc.). ,  The SEC alleges that TelexFree, Inc. and TelexFree, LLC claim to run a multilevel marketing company that sells telephone service based on “voice over Internet” (VoIP) technology but actually are operating an elaborate pyramid scheme. In addition to charging the company, the SEC charged several TelexFree officers and promoters, and named several entities related to TelexFree as relief defendants based on their receipt of investor funds. According to the SECs complaint filed in federal court in Massachusetts, the defendants sold securities in the form of TelexFree “memberships” that promised annual returns of 200 percent or more for those who promoted TelexFree by recruiting new members and placing TelexFree advertisements on free Internet ad sites. The SEC complaint alleges that TelexFrees VoIP sales revenues of approximately $1.3 million from August 2012 through March 2014 are barely one percent of the more than $1.1 billion needed to cover its promised payments to its promoters. As a result, in classic pyramid scheme fashion, TelexFree was paying earlier investors, not with revenue from selling its VoIP product but with money received from newer investors., In related proceedings, on May 6, 2014, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the District of Nevada granted the SECs motion to transfer venue of those proceedings from Nevada to Massachusetts. The SEC had contended that the TelexFree entities hastily filed for bankruptcy in Nevada on Sunday night, April 13, 2014, in a transparent attempt to avoid Massachusetts. The SEC had noted that TelexFree does virtually no business in Nevada but rather was headquartered in Marlborough, Massachusetts. The SEC also argued that TelexFree did not have a legitimate business capable of reorganization under the bankruptcy code. The bankruptcy case will be transferred to Massachusetts for all further proceedings.  <!-- End text --><!--Complaint --><!-- <img src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10 height=9 alt= border=0>  <a href=/litigation/complaints/xxxx/compxxxxx.pdf>SEC Complaint</a>-->,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr22992.htm</i>, ]"

He described the investment program to investors and recommended they purchase Opus partnership interests or securities of Tri-Valley and its affiliated entities. In return, Sarafraz received commissions that ranged from seven to 17 percent of the sales proceeds that he and members of a sales network generated. The SEC alleges that Opus and Tri-Valley paid Sarafraz approximately $18.3 million in sales commissions. He paid approximately $1.9 million to others as referral fees and kept the remaining $16.4 million for himself., Sarafraz has agreed to settle the SEC’s charges by consenting to entry of a final judgment ordering him to pay a total of $22,482,318.87 without admitting or denying the allegations. The sum consists of $16,406,459 in disgorgement, $6,075,859.87 in prejudgment interest, and a $50,000 penalty. The final judgment will also permanently enjoin him from violating Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act.

Lama of San Bernardino Urological Associates Medical Group (SBUA), San Bernardino, California, for insider trading in the securities of GTx Inc., a biopharmaceutical company based in Memphis Tennessee.  The SECs complaints against Dr. Chu and Dr. Lama were filed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California., The SEC alleges that Drs. Chu and Lama were medical investigators in the clinical trials of Capesaris, a drug GTx developed for the treatment of prostate cancer.  As alleged in the complaints, the purpose of the clinical trials was to test the safety and efficacy of Capesaris in anticipation of GTx applying for approval of the drug by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  According to the complaints, beginning in early 2011, GTx entered into a series of Clinical Trial Agreements (CTA) with SBUA, Chus and Lamas medical practice, pursuant to which GTx paid compensation to SBUA for each patient the practice enrolled in the study.  As alleged in the complaints, the CTAs contained strict confidentiality provisions that prohibited Drs. Chu and Lama from using confidential information about the clinical trials for any purpose other than rendering services under the CTAs. , The SEC alleges that on Friday February 17, 2012, Chu and Lama each learned material, nonpublic information from GTx that the FDA was placing a hold on the Capesaris clinical trials because of concerns of an increased risk of blood clots in patients participating in the clinical trials.  The SEC further alleges that immediately after learning this confidential information, and in breach of their duty to GTx, Chu and Lama each sold shares of GTx stock they held personal accounts.  According to the complaints, Chu sold 16,000 shares of GTx stock, and Lama sold 5,400 shares of GTx stock, at an average sale price of $5.82 per share.  As alleged in the complaints, on Tuesday February 21, 2012, after GTx publicly announced the FDA hold on the Capesaris clinical trials, the market price of GTx stock dropped over 36% and closed at $3.69 per share.  The SEC alleges that as a result of trading on material, nonpublic information about the FDA hold prior to the public announcement, Chu and Lama each avoided trading losses of approximately $34,081 and $11,502, respectively.  The SEC further alleges that when later contacted by SEC staff investigating this matter, Lama initially provided false information, including claiming that he had no knowledge of the FDA hold at the time of his trading.  To settle the SECs charges, Dr. Chu and Dr. Lama have each consented to the entry of a final judgment, which are subject to court approval.  Dr. Chu has consented to a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), and orders him to pay disgorgement of $34,081, plus prejudgment interest of $2,014, and a one-time civil penalty of $34,081.  Dr. Lama has consented to a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $11,502, plus prejudgment interest of $680, and a three-time civil penalty of $34,506., <b>See also Complaints:</b>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr22996.htm</i><br/>]"

The SEC also charged a Massachusetts-based microcap company and the CEO with orchestrating a pair of illicit kickback schemes and an insider trading scheme involving the companys stock.  A stock promoter in Texas was charged for his role in the insider trading scheme., The SEC has now charged 48 individuals and 25 companies in this series of penny stock investigations out of the agencys Miami Regional Office, which has worked closely with the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of Florida and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  The first of the joint enforcement actions was announced in October 2010., The U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of Florida today announced criminal charges against many of the same individuals charged today by the SEC., According to the SECs complaint against Boca Raton, Fla.-based stock promoters Kevin McKnight and Stephen C. Bauer, they engaged in market manipulation fraud involving the penny stock of Environmental Infrastructure Holdings Corp. (EIHC).  They generated the appearance of market interest in EIHC to induce investors to purchase the stock and artificially increase the trading price and volume.  In a separate complaint against Jeffrey M. Berkowitz of Jupiter, Fla., the SEC alleges that he participated in a market manipulation scheme involving the stock of Face Up Entertainment Group (FUEG) and similarly worked to falsely generate the appearance of market interest in that stock.

In a separate kickback scheme, Ray made an inducement payment to a stock promoter who would purchase shares of Urban on the open market ahead of planned press releases to help him manipulate the stock.  Meanwhile, stock promoter Wade Clark participated in Rays insider trading scheme involving Urban stock by providing the hedge fund fiduciary with an advance copy of a press release containing material nonpublic information about the company so the hedge fund manager would purchase stock prior to the news being issued., The SECs complaints allege that Altomare, Bauer, Berkowitz, Brown, Clark, McKnight, Ray, and Urban AG Corp. violated Section 17(a)(1) of the Securities Act of 1933 and/or Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5(a) and 10b-5(c).  The SEC is seeking financial penalties, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and permanent injunctions.

In that final judgment, the court had ordered OMeally to pay over $763,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty., On December 14, 2011, a federal jury returned a verdict in the Commissions favor against OMeally, a resident of Bay Shore, New York.  OMeally is a former registered representative of broker-dealer Prudential Securities Inc.  The jury found OMeally liable for violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and/or (3) of the Securities Act of 1933.  The verdict against OMeally followed a month-long trial in U.S. District Court in Manhattan., The Commission filed its Complaint on August 28, 2006 against four registered representatives formerly employed by Prudential Securities, Inc.  The Complaint alleged that, between 2001 and 2003, certain mutual fund companies detected market timing activity by the defendants and attempted to block the defendants and their hedge fund customers from further trading in their funds.  The Complaint further alleged that the defendants used fraudulent and deceptive trading practices to conceal their and their customers identities to evade these blocks.  Cases against the three other defendants had been resolved previously by settlement., In reversing the judgment against OMeally, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding of negligence., The Commission also brought related enforcement actions against several other parties associated with Prudential Securities concerning deceptive market timing activities, as well as a settled enforcement action against Prudential Securities itself on August 28, 2006, in which Prudential agreed to pay $270 million that was later distributed to harmed investors., For further information about the Commissions action in SEC v.

Those sentenced were: stock promoter Edward Henderson of Lincoln, Rhode Island; and corporate officers Paul Desjourdy of Medfield, Massachusetts (President of Symbollon Pharmaceuticals, Inc.); James Wheeler of Camas, Washington (Chief Executive Officer of MicroHoldings US, Inc.); and Michael Lee of Hingham, Massachusetts (President and Chief Executive Officer of ZipGlobal Holdings, Inc.).  The Commission filed related civil charges against these and other parties on December 1, 2011, and those charges remain pending., Henderson, Desjourdy, Wheeler, and Lee were among 13 defendants who were alleged to have engaged in criminal activity in the midst of an undercover FBI operation. According to the charges filed in U.S. District Court, the schemes involved secret kickbacks to an investment fund representative in exchange for having the investment fund buy stock in certain companies; the kickbacks were to be concealed through the use of sham consulting agreements. What the insiders and promoters did not know was that the purported investment fund representative was actually an undercover agent. , On November 25, 2013, Henderson was sentenced to one year of probation and was ordered to forfeit $12,650 after pleading guilty on January 20, 2012 to one count of wire fraud.  On January 16, 2014, Desjourdy was sentenced to 18 months of probation and was ordered to forfeit $54,000 after pleading guilty on January 11, 2012 to one count of mail fraud and one count of conspiracy.

John Benson made repeated false accounting entries that materially inflated the value of inventory on the balance sheets at DGSE Companies Inc., which buys and sells jewelry, diamonds, fine watches, rare coins, precious metals and other collectibles. Benson’s entries made it appear that DGSE owned certain inventory that actually still belonged to customers in consignment arrangements where DGSE held the goods on the owner’s behalf until they were sold. Benson then misled the company’s independent auditors about the journal entries, and DGSE subsequently overstated its inventory by anywhere from 99.1 percent to 227.4 percent in public filings during 2009, 2010, and 2011., DGSE agreed to settle the SEC’s charges, and Benson agreed to a settlement in which he will pay a $75,000 penalty, be permanently barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and be suspended from practicing as an accountant on behalf of any publicly traded company or other entity regulated by the SEC., According to the SEC’s complaint filed in the Dallas Division of U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, deficiencies in DGSE’s accounting systems and controls led to problems that significantly compromised the integrity of the company’s financial data. The deficiencies included the failure to properly record intercompany transactions such as inventory transfers between stores. As a result, DGSE’s intercompany accounts became out of balance by millions of dollars., The SEC alleges that Benson subsequently made a number of fraudulent accounting entries in order to bring the intercompany accounts and DGSE’s general ledger as a whole back into balance. The entries resulted in a number of errors in DGSE’s financial statements including the large overstatement of DGSE inventory by millions of dollars. Benson concealed the improper entries by manipulating inventory detail listings to improperly reflect the consigned inventory as being owned by DGSE. Benson sent these listings to DGSE’s external auditor, and misled the auditor to believe the consigned goods were owned by DGSE. Benson then knowingly signed misleading public filings by DGSE, including annual reports for the 2009 and 2010 fiscal years as well as quarterly filings. Benson also signed false management certifications that were attached to these filings., Benson is charged with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) and Sections 10(b), 13(a), and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2(a) thereunder, and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder.

DGSE and Benson each consented to injunctions against future violations of these provisions. DGSE also agreed to the appointment of an independent consultant to review the company’s accounting controls, and DGSE has taken or agreed to take remedial steps to correct its deficiencies. , <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2014/comp-pr2014-106.pdf>SEC Complaint</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr23003.htm</i><br/>]"

Pearson admitted to the scheme during questioning by SEC examiners, and the agency subsequently filed an emergency action to obtain an asset freeze and place control of the firm under a third-party receiver appointed by the court., IST Shareholder Services is registered with the SEC as a transfer agent under the name of Illinois Stock Transfer Company., According to the SECs complaint, Pearson misappropriated more than $1.3 million during the past two years from an IST bank account holding the funds of clients who use IST as a paying agent to make cash disbursements to shareholders.  The account also holds money belonging to shareholders who sent IST dividend reinvestment checks in order to purchase additional securities.  When reviewing account records, SEC examiners discovered several unusual transactions that appeared to be related to ISTs own payroll rather than transfer agent activities.  When asked why it appeared that payroll payments were being made out of an account holding customer funds, Pearson initially said that the local suburban bank holding ISTs general operating account could not handle making direct deposits for payroll, so he utilized that account for the direct deposit function.  When asked whether IST generated enough of its own revenue in the customer account to cover those payroll expenses without siphoning customer funds, he responded by saying probably not.   In later interviews, it became clear that Pearson used funds from the account to meet payroll and payroll tax expenses because IST simply had not earned enough income to cover its business expenses.  The income setbacks were attributed to a number of factors including the loss of several clients and unanticipated expenses related to the relocation of the office.  Pearson claimed that he originally intended to repay the funds he took from the account, but lacked the funds to make full repayment in a timely manner., The SECs complaint further alleges that under Pearsons direction, IST committed multiple violations of the SECs transfer agent rules.  IST failed to safeguard funds and securities and did not properly report lost and stolen securities.  The firm did not file an accurate annual study and evaluation of internal accounting controls, and it failed to give notice of assumption and termination of transfer agent services., The SECs complaint alleges that IST and Pearson violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5(a) and 10b-5(c).  The complaint further alleges that IST violated Section 17A(d)(1) of the Exchange Act and Rules 17Ad-12, 17Ad-13, 17Ad-16, and 17f-1.  The complaint charges Pearson with aiding and abetting those violations., The SECs investigation was conducted by Tracy Lo and Steven Klawans of the Chicago Regional Office.

Goyal.  In its complaint, the SEC alleges that Goyal told investors that the private funds he managed would invest in securities following a long-short trading strategy.  However, Goyal actually did little trading and simply operated a Ponzi scheme that used new investor funds to pay redemptions to existing investors and fund his own lavish lifestyle.  Goyal concealed the poor results of the few investments he did make by sending investors phony account statements that grossly overstated the performance of the funds., In a parallel action, on May 28, 2014, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Northern District of Illinois filed a criminal information against Goyal., According to the SECs complaint filed in federal court in Chicago, Goyal raised more than $11.4 million since 2006 for investments in four private funds that he managed and controlled.  The complaint further alleges that Goyals investment strategy lost money from the outset, but he hid those losses from investors through the Ponzi payments and phony account statements.  Meanwhile, Goyal misused investor funds to make down-payments and pay the mortgages on two homes he purchased.  According to the SECs complaint, Goyal also siphoned away investor money to invest in a Chicago tavern, fund two childrens clothing boutiques that his wife operates in Chicago, and purchase artwork and lavish furniture., The SECs complaint alleges that Goyal along with Caldera Advisors and Blue Horizon Asset Management violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8(a).  In its complaint, the SEC seeks financial penalties, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a permanent injunction against Goyal, Blue Horizon Asset Management, and Caldera Advisors.  The SEC named another Goyal-controlled entity Caldera Investment Group as a relief defendant in its complaint for the purpose of recovering any investor funds it received., At the SECs request, the Honorable Rebecca R. Pallmeyer issued a permanent injunction and asset freeze against Goyal and his firms, who consented to the order without admitting or denying the allegations in the SECs complaint.  Under the courts order, monetary remedies will be decided at a later date., The SECs investigation was conducted by Richard G. Stoltz and supervised by Robert J.

The SEC’s case was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas., The SEC alleges that McCraw knowingly or recklessly provided substantial assistance to Kevin G. White and his company, KGW Capital Management, LLC, in perpetrating a fraudulent scheme that raised approximately $7.4 million between September 2011 and July 2013. The SEC’s complaint alleges that White and KGW Capital raised investor funds through Revelation Forex, a purportedly successful “highly specialized hedge fund” that claimed to employ a sophisticated, low-risk, high-return forex trading strategy. McCraw helped White attract potential investors to Revelation Forex by calculating alleged trading returns that were used in various marketing materials and on Revelation Forex’s website. McCraw also took the lead in creating an ostensibly “independent” website that ranked Revelation Forex as one of the best performing forex funds in the world. McCraw also met with potential investors and solicited investments for Revelation Forex., According to the SEC, Revelation Forex’s actual trading did not generate the positive returns that were represented to investors, but instead lost more than $2 million. Moreover, White used investor funds for various personal expenses and to fund other unrelated and undisclosed investments and businesses, including a propane gas company operated by McCraw. The SEC previously halted White’s fraudulent scheme in <em>SEC v. Kevin G. White, et al.</em>, Civil Action No. 4:13-cv-0383 (E.D. Tex.

ELIV Group has in fact earned no positive results at all, instead sustaining consistent investment losses for the past three years. Meanwhile, Valente has been making substantial cash withdrawals of client funds and spending their money on his home improvements and mortgage payments as well as jewelry and a vacation condominium.  Valentes unsuccessful trading strategies and misappropriations have severely diluted the amount of client funds on hand at ELIV Group, and the SEC is seeking an asset freeze to halt the fraud as Valente continues to solicit new clients with his false claims.  ELIV Group has offices in Albany and Warwick, N.Y., According to the SECs complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Valente misleadingly told his clients that he has a 30-year record of investing experience dedicated to the highest standards of service and that he founded ELIV Group after leaving the corporate financial industry upon concluding there had to be a better way for clients to achieve financial independence.  What he failed to disclose was that he twice filed for bankruptcy and started ELIV Group only after the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) permanently expelled him from the broker-dealer industry in 2009 for engaging in serial misconduct against numerous customers. , The SEC alleges that Valente and ELIV Group attracted clients by falsely assuring them that the principal amount of their investments was fully liquid and guaranteed because it was backed by a large money market fund.  Client funds were in fact never guaranteed or backed by any money market funds, and the majority of ELIV Groups investments were in highly illiquid investments in privately-held companies.  Valente and ELIV Group also assured clients that the firms books and records were audited independently.  However, ELIV Group never had an auditor, and the firm sent clients monthly investment reports in which they actually inflated the monthly returns, assets under management, and client account values., The SECs complaint charges Valente and ELIV with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5(b) as well as Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

No public information supports the claims Defendant Chang made about China Gold, namely that China Gold was a Hong Kong mining company that owned three gold mines in China worth $15 billion and possessed the capital to make a cash tender offer for Allied Nevada., The Commission further alleges that unbeknownst to Allied Nevada and the investing public, Defendant Chang, while driving the purported tender offer, had bought over 5% of the Allied Nevada stock through an entity he controls, Defendant Everbright Development Overseas Limited. Defendant Everbright sold its entire position in Allied Nevada into a falsely inflated market for a profit of over $7 million. Defendant Chang is now on the run in China, where Defendant Everbright has wired over $20 million., The court’s order, among other things, temporarily freezes the Defendants’ assets, temporarily restrains them from further similar misconduct, requires an accounting, prohibits document alteration or destruction, and expedites discovery. Pursuant to the order, the Commission has taken immediate action to freeze the Defendants’ U.S. assets, which include financial accounts and several properties in Nevada and California., The Commissions complaint alleges that Chang and Everbright violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 13(d)(1) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13d-1 thereunder. The Commission’s complaint also alleges that Chang violated Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14e-8 thereunder. The Commission’s complaint further alleges that, by virtue of his status as Everbright’s control person, Chang is liable under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act for Everbright’s Exchange Act violations. The Commission’s complaint seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, financial penalties, permanent injunctions, and other emergency relief. , <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2014/comp23020.pdf>SEC Complaint</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr23020.htm</i><br/>]"

Schmidt, a Washington D.C. resident, and several entities he controlled for defrauding investors across the country in an investment scheme involving unregistered debt offerings., The Complaint alleges that Schmidt defrauded investors by creating a web of seemingly legitimate companies, including Commercial Equity Partners, Ltd., and FutureGen Company (FutureGen), that were in fact simply designed to entice investment and conceal his misuse and commingling of funds.  Over a six year period, from 2008 through 2014, Schmidt raised nearly $22 million from over 200 unsuspecting investors who purchased notes from the various companies, siphoning off almost $2 million of investor funds for his own benefit, paying old investors with new investor money and ultimately firing all his employees and fleeing the country when his scheme collapsed. The notes had interest rates ranging from approximately 7% to 13% annually, with the proceeds to be used by the companies to purchase tax liens, distressed assets, and to provide commercial bridge and multi-family property loans.  In reality, the companies did not invest the proceeds as promised.  None of the relevant offerings were registered with the Commission, nor were the defendants registered., The Complaint claims that, based on this conduct, Schmidt and his companies violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, that Schmidt is liable as a control person of the companies under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act and that Schmidt is liable under Suction 20(e) of the Exchange Act for aiding and abetting his companies in their violations of the Exchange Act .  On the Commissions motion, the Court issued an Order Freezing Assets, Appointing a Receiver, Granting a Temporary Restraining Order and Other Emergency Relief, and Issuing an Order to Show Cause on a Preliminary Injunction on June 12, 2014.  Among other things, the Courts Order froze the assets of the defendants and provided for the appointment of a temporary receiver to preserve the property and assets of the companies and respond to investor inquiries.

23022,2014,[<h3>SEC Charges Four California Residents in $12 Million Insider Trading Scheme</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged four Northern California residents with insider trading in Ross Stores stock options based on nonpublic information about monthly sales results leaked by one of the retailer’s employees., The SEC alleges that Saleem Khan was routinely tipped by his friend Roshanlal Chaganlal, who was a director in the finance department at Ross headquarters in Dublin, Calif. Khan used the confidential information to illegally trade on more than 40 occasions ahead of the company’s public release of financial results. Besides trading in his own brokerage account, Khan traded in his brother-in-law’s account as well as an account belonging to another acquaintance. Khan also tipped his work colleagues Ranjan Mendonsa and Ammar Akbari so they too could trade in Ross stock options based on the nonpublic information. The insider trading resulted in collective profits of more than $12 million. , The SEC further alleges that at the outset of the scheme, Chaganlal gave $17,000 to Khan for the purpose of insider trading in Ross securities using the brother-in-law’s account. They attempted to disguise the exchange by using two cashier’s checks for $8,500 purchased in the name of Chaganlal’s wife of a different surname. Khan later funneled $130,000 of the generated trading profits back to Chaganlal by using third-party intermediaries. For example, Khan wrote Akbari a check for $35,000, and Akbari in turn wrote two checks totaling $35,000 to Chaganlal’s wife. Another $75,000 was routed in a roundabout way to a title company so it could be credited at closing toward Chaganlal’s purchase of a newly-built home. , According to the SEC’s complaint filed in federal court in San Francisco, Khan separately made approximately $450,000 in illicit profits by insider trading in stock options of software company Taleo Corporation ahead of its 2012 acquisition by Oracle Corporation. Khan began purchasing large numbers of options in Taleo six days before the merger announcement based on nonpublic information he received from an insider he knew at Oracle. Khan had never previously traded in Taleo securities. , The SEC alleges that the serial insider trading involving Ross securities began in August 2009 and continued until December 2012, when Chaganlal was terminated by the company. He had access to confidential sales figures on an internal webpage limited to a relatively small group of Ross employees. Chaganlal regularly communicated the confidential details to Khan so he could trade ahead of impending monthly sales announcements by Ross. Khan generated $5.4 million in profits in his own account, and $6 million in profits in his brother-in-law’s account. Khan’s supervisor Mendonsa made approximately $800,000 in insider trading profits based on the nonpublic information that Khan in turn tipped to him. Akbari made approximately $2,000 by insider trading on Khan’s illegal tips. , The SEC’s complaint names two relief defendants - Khan’s acquaintance Michael Koza and Khan’s brother-in-law Shahid Khan - for the purposes of recovering insider trading profits in their brokerage accounts through trades conducted by Khan. They each have agreed to settle the matter by paying the court the entire amount of insider trading profits remaining in their accounts, which total $240,741 for Shadid Khan and $31,713 for Koza., The SEC’s complaint charges Saleem Khan, Chaganlal, Mendonsa, and Akbari with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. The complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of illicit profits plus interest, and financial penalties. The complaint also seeks an officer-and-director bar against Chaganlal., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2014/comp-pr2014-117.pdf>SEC Complaint</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr23022.htm</i><br/>]"

The Courts preliminary injunction order continues the interim relief the Commission obtained on an emergency basis when it commenced its civil injunctive action against Defendants on June 3, 2014.  In its action, the Commission continues to seek, among other things, a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus pre-judgment interest and civil money penalties., The Commissions Complaint alleges that Valente and ELIV Group have fraudulently raised more than $8.8 million from approximately 80 clients by falsely claiming they have achieved consistent and outsized positive returns, among other misrepresentations about the safety of the investments.  The ELIV Group has in fact earned no positive results at all, instead sustaining consistent investment losses for the past three years.  Meanwhile, Valente has been making substantial cash withdrawals of client funds and spending their money on his home improvements and mortgage payments as well as jewelry and a vacation condominium.  Valentes unsuccessful trading strategies and misappropriations have severely diluted the amount of client funds on hand at ELIV Group., The preliminary injunction enjoins Valente and ELIV Group from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder, as well as Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers Act)., For further information, please see Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr23012.htm>23012</a> (June 3, 2014).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr23023.htm</i><br/>]"

Among other things, AutoChina has been ordered to pay a penalty of $4.35 million.  Yan has been ordered to pay a penalty of $150,000 and is barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  AutoChina and Yan each agreed to the entry of the final judgments., The Commissions enforcement action, filed April 11, 2012, alleged that AutoChina senior executive and director Yan and others fraudulently traded AutoChinas stock to boost its daily trading volume in order to create the appearance of liquidity of AutoChinas stock and thereby enhance the companys ability to get much-needed financing.  Starting in October 2010, the defendants and others deposited more than $60 million into U.S.-based brokerage accounts and engaged in hundreds of fraudulent trades over the next three months through these accounts and accounts with a Hong Kong-based broker-dealer.  The complaint alleged that the fraudulent trades included matched orders, where one account sold shares to another account at the same time and for the same price, and wash trades, which resulted in no change of beneficial ownership of the shares.  According to the complaint, AutoChina and the other defendants engaged in the scheme after lenders offered AutoChina unfavorable terms for a stock-backed loan due to low trading volume in its stock., The SEC complaint alleged that in the three months before the defendants opened the U.S.-based brokerage accounts, the average daily trading volume of AutoChinas stock was approximately 18,000 shares.  From November 1, 2010 through January 31, 2011, the average daily trading volume increased to more than 139,000 shares.  On some days, the defendants and related accounts trading accounted for as much as 70% of the trading of AutoChinas stock., The final judgment in the Commissions enforcement action enjoins AutoChina and Hui Kai Yan from violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 9(a)(1), 9(a)(2), and 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders AutoChina to pay a civil penalty of $4.35 million and Yan to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  Yan was also barred permanently from acting an officer or director of a public company., The Commissions action remains pending against ten other defendants., For further information, see Lit.

In its Complaint filed on September 27, 2013, the Commission alleged OMIM and Movalia falsely represented to a group of investors their interest in Facebook stock would be segregated in a special “side pocket” within the fund, when in reality, the shares were commingled with other fund investments. OMIM and Movalia also distributed false account statements to investors reflecting the purported value of their Facebook investments, even though the fund had sold all of its Facebook positions months earlier. In addition, Movalia, among other things (i) improperly used investor proceeds to make undisclosed loans to related third parties in contravention of the fund’s stated investment strategy; (ii) attempted to evade a corporate monitorship instituted in a related Florida state court private lawsuit by forming a new entity with an almost identical name to the fund and using that entity to solicit additional investments in the fund; and (iii) failed to register the fund as an investment company and also failed to register the offer and sale of investments in the fund., The Final Judgment follows a previous order by United States District Judge Jose E. Martinez in which the Court entered a Judgment of Permanent Injunction and Other Relief by consent against OMIM (i) enjoining the company from violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act; Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5; Sections 203A, 206(1), 206(2), 206(4) and 207 of the Advisers Act and Advisers Act Rules 206(4)-2 and 206(4)-8; and from aiding and abetting violations of Section 7(a) of the Investment Company Act; (ii) imposing an asset freeze and preventing the destruction or concealment of documents; and (iii) ordering an accounting., The Court also previously entered a Judgment of Permanent Injunction and Other Relief by consent against Movalia (i) enjoining him from violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act; Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5; Sections 206(1), 206(2), 206(4) and 207 of the Advisers Act and Advisers Act Rule 206(4)-8; and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 203A and 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Advisers Act Rule 206(4)-2; and Section 7(a) of the Investment Company Act; (ii) imposing an asset freeze and preventing the destruction or concealment of documents; and (iii) ordering an accounting.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr23034.htm</i><br/>]"

In the Order, Judge Frank imposed permanent injunctions against all three defendants, barred Duckson from serving as an officer or director of a publicly traded company for a period of ten years, and imposed financial sanctions exceeding $14.5 million against the Fund, $3.3 million against Duckson and TFFM, jointly and severally, and $1.8 million against Duckson individually., The Commissions complaint, which was filed in September 2010, alleged that the defendants engaged in securities fraud in connection with a series of unregistered offerings of interests in the Fund.  The complaint alleged that in written documents provided to investors between March 2008 and late 2009, the Defendants made materially false and misleading statements that effectively hid the Funds deteriorating financial condition. The complaint also alleged that the Fund represented that it would use proceeds raised in the offerings primarily to make real estate loans and other investments, when in fact the Fund used most of the proceeds to pay senior lenders on properties the Fund had acquired and to make interest payments to existing investors. Duckson played a key role in drafting the written documents provided to investors, first as the attorney for the Fund and, in and after November 2008, as the Funds manager., After a five-week trial, on October 22, the jury returned a verdict for the Commission and against all three Defendants, finding that Duckson and the Fund violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, that Duckson aided and abetted the Funds violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that TFFM violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The court entered final judgment of dismissal by consent on June 19, 2014., The Commissions complaint alleged that a hedge fund had been authorized to place market timing trades in the Gabelli Global Growth Fund (GGGF), a fund advised by Gabelli Funds, in exchange for an investment in a hedge fund advised by an affiliate of Gabelli Funds. The complaint also alleged that Alpert wrote a memorandum in September 2003 that was designed to assure investors that Gabelli Funds did not have a market timing problem.  However, the memorandum gave the misleading impression that any failure to exclude market timers resulted from procedural limitations, not intentional conduct., The Commissions announcement follows six years of litigation.  On March 17, 2010, the District Court dismissed the Commissions complaint in part.  On June 2, 2011, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the District Courts dismissal and reinstated the Commissions claims.

Ruehlen agreed to the entry of a final judgment enjoining him from aiding and abetting any violation of Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act., The SEC filed its complaint in <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22290.htm>February 2012</a> and alleged that Jackson and Ruehlen authorized the payment of bribes to customs officials to process false paperwork purporting to show the export and re-import of oil rigs, when in fact the rigs never moved.  The SEC alleged that the scheme was designed to save Noble Corporation from losing business and incurring significant costs associated with exporting rigs from Nigeria and then re-importing them under new permits.  At the same time it filed its action against Jackson and Ruehlen, the SEC also <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22290.htm>filed settled charges</a> against Thomas F.

The final judgment orders Babikian to pay a total of $3,730,000, comprised of $1,915,670 in disgorgement, together with prejudgment interest in the amount of $128,073, and a civil penalty in the amount of $1,686,257.  The final judgment also imposes a bar from participating in any offering of penny stock and enjoins Babikian from recommending, directly or indirectly, the purchase of any U.S. publicly traded or quoted stock without simultaneously disclosing any plans or intentions to sell such stock within 14 days of the recommendation.

McPhails source was an American Superconductor executive who belonged to the same country club as McPhail and was a close friend.  According to the complaint, from July 2009 through April 2011, the executive told McPhail about American Superconducters expected earnings, contracts, and other major pending corporate developments, trusting that McPhail would keep the information confidential., Instead, according to the SECs complaint, McPhail, of Waltham, Massachusetts, misappropriated the inside information about the energy technology company and fed it to his friends, often via email.  The insider-trading ring included a handful of golfing buddies, four of whom live in Massachusetts: Douglas A. Parigian of Lowell, John J. Gilmartin of Andover, Douglas Clapp of Walpole, and James A. (Andy) Drohen of Granville. The fifth, Drohens brother, John C. Drohen, is a resident of Cranston, Rhode Island.  In addition to the group of golfers, McPhail tipped a sixth man, his longtime friend Jamie A. Meadows, of Springfield, Massachusetts.  Each of the six traded and profited on the inside information McPhail supplied to them., According to the SECs complaint, in April 2011, McPhail tipped Parigian and Meadows a few days before American Superconductor announced that it expected its fourth quarter and fiscal year-end financial results to be weaker than expected due to a deteriorating relationship with its primary customer, China-based Sinovel Wind Group Co., Ltd.  Parigian and Meadows used the information to place bets, through option contracts, that the companys stock price would decline. When American Superconductor made the announcement on April 5, 2011, its stock price fell 42 percent and as a result of this one tip alone, Parigian made profits and avoided losses of $278,289, while Meadows made profits of $191,521., The SEC further alleges that McPhail tipped the various defendants on other occasions, funneling them inside information about American Superconductors quarterly earnings announcements in July and September 2009, and again in January 2010.  He also alerted them in the fall of 2009 to a contract worth $100 million, and in November 2010 to a likely drop in American Superconductors shares price, which occurred a few days later when AMSC announced a secondary stock offering., The complaint charges that McPhail, Parigian, Gilmartin, Clapp, the Drohens, and Meadows violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks to have them be enjoined, disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains with interest, and pay civil penalties of up to three times their gains.  Gilmartin, Clapp, and the Drohens agreed to settle the SECs charges, without admitting or denying the allegations, by consenting to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The Complaint further alleges that Williams and Parrish made material misrepresentations and omissions regarding the investment including, among other things, the risk of the investment and the use of investor funds.

Judge Kocoras also barred Rooney from operating a private investment fund and from serving as an officer or director of any public company, expect for Positron Corporation (Positron), for which Rooney currently serves as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board., According to the SECs complaint filed on November 16, 2011, Rooney and Solaris radically changed the investment strategy of the Solaris Opportunity Fund LP (the Fund), contrary to the Funds offering documents and marketing materials, by becoming wholly invested in Positron, a financially troubled microcap company.  The SEC alleges that Rooney, who has been Chairman of Positron since 2004 and received salary and stock options from Positron since September 2005, misused the Funds money by investing more than $3.6 million in Positron through both private transactions and market purchases.  Many of the private transactions were undocumented while other investments were interest-free loans to Positron.  Rooney and Solaris hid the Positron investments and Rooneys relationship with the company from the Funds investors for over four years.  Although Rooney finally told investors about the Positron investments in a March 2009 newsletter, the SECs complaint alleges he falsely told them he became Chairman to safeguard the Funds investments.  These investments benefited Positron and Rooney while providing the Fund with a concentrated, undiversified, and illiquid position in a cash-poor company with a lengthy track record of losses., On December 19, 2013, Judge Kocoras entered an order of permanent injunctions enjoining Rooney and Solaris Management from violating Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rules 206(4)-8(a)(1) and (a)(2) thereunder; Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933; and Sections 10(b) and 13(d)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 13d-1 thereunder., For additional information see Litigation Releases Number <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2013/lr22895.htm>22895</a> (Dec. 23, 2013) and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr22167.htm>22167</a> (Nov. 22, 2011) and Press Release Number 2011-252 (Dec. 1, 2011).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr23045.htm</i><br/>]"
23048,2014,[<h3>Spanish Trader Agrees to Pay Disgorgement and a Penalty to Settle Insider Trading Case</h3>],"[	The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that Cedric Cañas Maillard, a Spanish citizen and former high-ranking official at Madrid-based Banco Santander, S.A., has agreed to pay almost $2 million to settle charges that he traded on inside information in advance of a public announcement about a proposed acquisition for which the Spanish investment bank was acting as an adviser. , 	The SEC’s Complaint, filed in July 2013, alleged that Cañas, who served as an executive advisor to Banco Santander’s CEO, learned confidentially that the investment bank had been asked by one of the world’s largest mining companies, BHP Billiton, to advise and help underwrite its proposed acquisition of Potash Corporation, one of the world’s largest producers of fertilizer minerals.  In the days leading up to a public announcement of BHP’s bid, Cañas purchased Potash contracts-for-difference (CFDs), which were highly leveraged securities not traded in the U.S. but based on the price of U.S. exchange-listed Potash stock.  The CFDs mirrored the movement and pricing of that stock.  Cañas also tipped his close personal friend Julio Marín Ugedo about the potential acquisition and advised him to purchase Potash stock. , 	The SEC’s Complaint alleged that Cañas purchased 30,000 Potash CFDs from August 9 to August 13, 2010 based on material, non-public information he learned about BHP’s offer to acquire Potash.  Marín purchased 1,393 shares of Potash common stock based on material, non-public information through two Spain-based brokerage accounts.  Cañas liquidated his entire CFD position in Potash following the August 17, 2010 public announcement for an illicit profit of $917,239, and Marín sold his stock for net trading profits of $43,566. , 	The settlement was approved yesterday by Judge Valerie E. Caproni of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. , 	Cañas agreed to the entry of a final judgment ordering him to pay $960,806, the amount of the trading profits reaped by both Cañas and Marín, and a $960,806 civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the SEC’s allegations, he agreed to be permanently enjoined from future violations of Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder., 	The SEC’s litigation continues with respect to Marín., 	The SEC’s enforcement action against Cañas and Marín arose from its investigation into suspicious Potash trading ahead of the August 17, 2010 public announcement of BHP’s acquisition bid.  Another former Banco Santander analyst, Juan Jose Fernández García, previously agreed to pay more than $625,000 to settle insider trading charges by the SEC., 	The SEC’s investigation has been conducted jointly by staff in the Enforcement Division’s Market Abuse Unit and the Chicago Regional Office, including Kathryn A. Pyszka, Frank D. Goldman, and R. Kevin Barrett. The litigation is being handled by Robert M. Moye, Timothy Leiman, and Mr. Goldman.  The Market Abuse Unit is led by Daniel M. Hawke.

The SEC alleges that Cecil Franklin Speight, whose firm International Stock Transfer Inc. (IST) was a registered transfer agent, abused the transfer agent function by creating and issuing fake securities certificates to both U.S. and international investors.  While investors collectively sent in millions of dollars thinking they were purchasing high-yield investments and discounted stock, they ended up receiving counterfeit certificates that Speight and IST fooled them into thinking were legitimate., In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York announced Speight has pleaded guilty to a criminal charge., Speight and IST agreed to settle the SECs charges.  Speight will be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and from participating in any penny stock offering.  The court will determine monetary sanctions at a later date., According to the SECs complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, Speights scheme included multiple securities, including the issuance of fake foreign bond certificates and stock certificates for a publicly-traded microcap company with no connection to IST.  To bolster the appearance of the safety of the investments and conceal from investors how their money was really being spent, Speight enlisted two attorneys to receive investment funds into their own bank accounts.  From there, the money was transferred to IST.  Instead of making its way to any issuers, however, IST and Speight spent investors money almost as quickly as it came in.  They used it to pay Speights personal expenses, and in Ponzi scheme fashion new investor money was used to fund interest payments to prior foreign bond investors.  In all, Speight and IST stole more than $3.3 million from at least 70 investors., The SECs complaint charges Speight and IST with violating the antifraud provisions of the securities laws, including Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5.  The complaint charges IST with violating the transfer agent books and records requirements of Section 17(a)(3) of the Exchange Act, and Speight with aiding and abetting such violations.  Speight and IST have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future securities law violations and requiring them to pay disgorgement of all ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and penalties as determined by the court, which must approve the settlement., The SECs investigation was conducted by Sharon Binger, Adam Grace, Justin Alfano, John Lehmann, Elzbieta Wraga, and Jordan Baker in the New York office.  An examination of IST was conducted by Debra Williamson, Ileana Rodriguez, and Brian Dyer and supervised by John Mattimore and Nicholas Monaco in the Miami office.

Egan, Jr.</h3>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on July 18, 2014, the Honorable William H. Pauley III, United States District Judge for the Southern District of New York, entered a final judgment in the Commissions civil action against John (Jack) J. Egan, Jr. (Egan), the former chief financial officer of Volt Information Sciences, Inc. (Volt).  The Commissions litigation against Egan was assisted by cooperation from Debra L. Hobbs (Hobbs), the former chief financial officer of a Volt subsidiary.  As a result of Hobbs cooperation, the SEC did not to seek a financial penalty against her., The final judgment, to which Egan consented without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, permanently enjoins Egan from violating certain of the antifraud, representations to accountants, and certification provisions of the federal securities laws (Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5)  of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, 13b2-2, and 13a-14), and from aiding and abetting certain reporting, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws (Exchange Act Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B), and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-11). The final judgment also bars Egan from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and orders him to pay a $35,000 civil penalty. In addition, on July 24, 2014, the Commission instituted settled administrative proceedings pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the Commissions Rules of Practice against Egan.  In those proceedings, Egan consented to the entry of an order permanently suspending him from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant. , In its complaint, the Commission alleged that Egan participated in a scheme to materially overstate revenue. For Volts fourth quarter and fiscal year ended October 28, 2007, Egan signed and filed financial statements reporting $7.55 million of revenue that had not been earned and was not recognizable under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. The $7.55 million of improper revenue caused Volts net income for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended October 28, 2007, to be materially overstated. The complaint further alleges that the scheme relied on fabricated paperwork purporting to be a contract selling software to a customer. Egan knew that any sale of the software was impossible because Volt intended to lease the same software to the same customer the following year. Nevertheless, Egan authorized that the $7.55 million in improper revenue be included in the Companys consolidated income statement for 2007, which were included in Volts: (1) 2007 Form 10-K filed with the Commission on January 11, 2008, as amended by Form 10-K/A filed with the Commission on February 25, 2008; and (2) earnings release on Form 8-K furnished to the Commission on December 20, 2007. Egan signed the fraudulent 2007 Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings that included the same overstatement of revenue. In addition, the complaint alleges that Egan mislead Volts external auditors and he signed one or more certifications required by Section 302 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act that were false and misleading., In addition, on July 24, 2014, the Commission instituted settled administrative proceedings by consent against Hobbs, who was previously enjoined by consent in this matter, pursuant to rule 102(e) of the Commissions Rules of Practice. In those proceedings, without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions Order, Hobbs agreed to be suspended from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant, with the right to reapply for reinstatement after five years., For further information, see <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2013/lr22589.htm>SEC Litigation Release No. 22589</a> (January 11, 2013).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr23051.htm</i><br/>]"

Thornes also siphoned money out of a brokerage account for a trust set up to fund college scholarships for local high school graduates., According to the SECs complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, Thornes stole money from the two accounts from November 2010 to April 2013 primarily to benefit two of his friends, Christopher Burnell of Highland, Calif., and Kyle Larick of Redlands, Calif.  Thornes has tried to pass off the payouts as loans, however there were no loan documents, no stated interest, and no collateral for the funds given.  None of the money was ever repaid., The SEC alleges that Thornes deceived his own mother with respect to the educational trust.  She served as trustee, and he periodically asked her to sign blank checks that he then used in his misappropriation scheme.  Thornes never informed his mother about trades he made, and he converted the brokerage account to a margin account even though it was designated as a low or minimal-risk tolerance account.  He used the margin debt in his scheme and later sold securities from those accounts to avoid the margin calls.  Thornes did the same thing with the brokerage account for the elderly dementia patient., According to the SECs complaint, after Thornes liberally transferred money from the brokerage accounts to his friends, they used it to charter a private jet, buy a luxury car, and purchase a vacation home.  Burnell also used the funds to gamble at a nearby casino or pay gambling debts.  Thornes paid his mother about $84,000 in excess trustee fees., Thornes has agreed to settle the charges and consented to the entry of a final judgment ordering him to pay disgorgement of $4,366,790, prejudgment interest of $278,540, and a penalty of $4,366,790.

But the Ngs and their advisory firm, The Mortgage Fund LLC, immediately began transferring money raised by MF08 to R.E. Loans so that they could afford distributions to investors in that fund.  From December 2007 to March 2008, the Ngs transferred almost $39 million from MF08 to R.E. Loans.  They later attempted to justify the transfers by claiming MF08 had purchased three loans from R.E. Loans that totaled around $39 million., The SEC further alleged that both the Ngs and Horwitz lured investors into MF08 by making false claims about its performance and the R.E. Loans funds performance.  What investors did not know was that both R.E. Loans and MF08 began to experience significant and dramatic borrower defaults in 2008.  Despite the funds rapidly disintegrating portfolios, the Ngs and Horwitz repeatedly assured investors that R.E. Loans and MF08 were performing well and the underlying loans were safe and secure., Walter Ng, Kelly Ng, Horwitz, and The Mortgage Fund, LLC, without admitting or denying the SECs allegations, all consented to the entry of final judgments, which the court entered on August 1, 2014.  Under the terms of the settlements, Kelly Ng and the Ngs firm will pay a total of $4,480,025 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil monetary penalties and Horwitz will pay $725,342.  The Commission intends to ask the Court to authorize the transfer of any disgorgement, interest, and penalty payments collected to the MF08 Liquidating Trustee for distribution to MF08 investors.  All four agreed to be permanently enjoined from violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Kelly Ng, Walter Ng, and The Mortgage Fund further agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. , Walter Ng and Kelly Ng further agreed to be barred from the securities industry, including association with any brokerage firm or investment adviser.  Kelly Ng currently is incarcerated and serving an 18 month sentence after he pled guilty to twenty counts of structuring cash transactions to avoid bank reporting requirements., Previous release:  <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2013/lr22627.htm>Litigation Release No. 22627</a> (Feb. 28, 2013). ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr23059.htm</i><br/>]"
23060,2014,[<h3>Indiana Forex Trader Settles SEC Fraud Charges</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced today that on August 6, 2014, the Honorable Tanya Walton Pratt of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, entered final judgments against Ryan W. Koester and his company Rykoworks Capital Group, LLC (Rykoworks), in a fraudulent investment scheme case the SEC filed against Koester, Rykoworks, and others on September 24, 2012., The SECs complaint alleged that Koester held himself out as an expert foreign currency trader, and falsely represented to investors that his unique trading strategy offered investors a principal guaranteed investment opportunity.  As alleged in the complaint, Koester and Rudolf D. Pamejier, a career insurance salesman, agreed to a profit sharing arrangement for clients Pameijer brought to Rykoworks.  The complaint alleged that, starting in 2010, Pameijer and his daughter, Lindsay R. Sayer, began soliciting clients to invest with Rykoworks through promissory notes which purported to guarantee investor principal while offering risk free returns from forex trading.  As alleged in the complaint, Pameijer and Sayer misappropriated the majority of funds they raised from investors for personal use.  The complaint further alleged that the remaining investor funds Pameijer and Sayer transferred to Koester and Rykoworks, and additional funds that Koester raised from investors directly, Koester depleted through trading losses and misappropriation of funds for personal use., To settle the SECs charges, Koester and Rykoworks each consented to the entry of a final judgment that: (i) permanently enjoins them from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and (ii) orders disgorgement of $382,475 and prejudgment interest of $57,645.  The disgorgement obligation was offset, and no civil penalty imposed, in light of Koesters sentence in a related criminal case.  In that case, Indiana v. Ryan Koester, Crim. No. 41C01-1205-FB-00028 (Johnson Circuit Court), Koester pled guilty to state criminal charges and, on January 30, 2014, the court sentenced Koester to two years in prison and ordered him to pay restitution of $517,121. , For additional information, see Litigation Release Nos <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22492.htm> 22492</a> (Sept. 24, 2012) and <a href=http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2015/lr23251.htm>23251</a> (May 1, 2015)., <!-- End text --><!--Complaint  --><!-- <img src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10 height=9 alt= border=0>        <a href=/litigation/complaints/xxxx/compxxxxx.pdf>SEC Complaint</a>-->,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr23060.htm</i><br/>]"

Blumberg, engaged in a scheme that entailed concealing the practice  of routing orders to an offshore affiliate in Bermuda to add mark-ups or  mark-downs.Â  The hidden fees known as  “trading profits” or “TP” were in addition to and often much higher than the  commissions paid by customers to have their orders executed., The charges against Blumberg  follow those announced in December by the SEC against <a href=/News/PressRelease/Detail/PressRelease/1370540521484>three  ConvergEx subsidiaries that agreed to pay more than $107 million</a> and admit  wrongdoing to settle the matter. Two  former employees also settled charges with the SEC., According to the SEC’s complaint filed against  Blumberg in federal court in Newark, N.J., one university customer paid about  $93,000 in disclosed commissions and about $543,000 in undisclosed TP. In another case, $1.6 million in fees allegedly  went undetected. The SEC alleges that  Blumberg engaged in deceptive practices to conceal the additional fees, and he  encouraged traders under his management to do the same., The U.S. Department of Justice  today announced parallel criminal charges against Blumberg. In the prior parallel criminal proceeding  announced in December, ConvergEx Group and its Bermuda broker-dealer agreed to  pay $43.8 million, and the two former employees named in the SEC case pleaded  guilty in the criminal case., ConvergEx has since shut down trading operations at the  Bermuda broker-dealer subsidiary ConvergEx Global Markets Limited. Blumberg was CEO of ConvergEx Global Markets  Limited and ConvergEx Global Markets, which included a unit of U.S. broker  G-Trade Services LLC., The SEC’s complaint alleges that Blumberg directed  employees to suspend the taking of TP when customers were monitoring execution  prices. Blumberg made false and  misleading statements to a brokerage customer and authorized employees to  falsify trading data for customers who inquired about the details of their  securities transactions. , The SEC’s complaint alleges  that Blumberg violated the antifraud provisions of the  federal securities laws and an SEC antifraud rule. The complaint further alleges liability as a  control person and aiding and abetting violations by certain ConvergEx  subsidiaries and former employees. The  SEC is seeking disgorgement of any ill-gotten gains with interest, a financial  penalty, and permanent injunctive relief., The SEC’s investigation, which  is continuing, has been conducted by Sarah L.

Skaltsounis and Relief Defendants Allied Beacon Partners, Inc. (f/k/a Waterford Investor Services, Inc.), Advent Securities, Inc., and CL Wealth Management, LLC (f/k/a Allied Beacon Wealth Management, LLC and CBS Advisors, LLC).  These final judgments impose on Defendants AIC, Community Bankers Securities, and Skaltsounis permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and third tier civil penalties.  Also, orders of disgorgement and prejudgment interest were entered against the Relief Defendants.  Altogether, nearly $70 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties was imposed on the Defendants and the Relief Defendants., Defendant AIC was a financial services holding company for three broker-dealers and an investment adviser based in Richmond, Virginia.  Defendant Community Bankers Securities was one of the subsidiary broker-dealers.  Defendant Skaltsounis was the founder, President, and Chief Executive Officer of AIC and Community Bankers Securities.  The Commissions complaint, which was filed in April 2011, alleged that Skaltsounis devised and orchestrated an offering fraud by offering and selling millions of dollars of AIC promissory notes and stock.  The Commissions complaint alleged that, from at least January 2006 through November 2009, Skaltsounis, directly and through registered representatives associated with Community Bankers Securities, offered and sold AIC promissory notes and stock to numerous investors across multiple states, many of whom were elderly, unsophisticated brokerage customers of CB Securities.  The Defendants misrepresented and omitted material information to investors relating to, among other things, the safety and risk associated with the investments, the rates of return on the investments, and how AIC would use the proceeds of the investments.  AIC and its subsidiaries were never profitable.  AIC earned de minimis revenue, and its subsidiaries did not earn sufficient revenue to meet their expenses.

Brown and his firm Alliance Investment Management Limited (AIM) purported to be the custodian for assets under the management of Nikolai Battoo.  The SEC obtained a court-ordered freeze over Battoos assets after <a href=http://www.sec.gov/News/PressRelease/Detail/PressRelease/1365171484640>charging him in 2012 with defrauding investors</a> around the world by hiding major losses while falsely boasting that their investments were performing remarkably during the financial crisis., According to the SECs complaint filed today against Brown and AIM in federal court in Chicago, they misrepresented themselves to investors as Battoos custodian when, since at least 2009, their firm did not have custody of most of the assets listed on investor account statements.  Brown and AIM allowed Battoo to create false account statements on AIM letterhead that vastly overstated the value of investors assets by more than $150 million.  Brown and AIM then routinely provided the false account statements to auditors and others acting on behalf of Battoos investors., The SEC further alleges that Brown and AIM permitted Battoo to misappropriate at least $45 million of investor funds by transferring money at Battoos behest from investor accounts to Battoos direct control.  Battoo used investor funds to pay AIM and Brown more than $5 million in return for their critical assistance., The SECs complaint alleges that Brown and AIM violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, and aided and abetted Battoos violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws., The SECs investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John D.

Hayter of Brooklyn, N.Y., liable for five counts of violating the federal securities laws in connection with a scheme to pump up the stock of a microcap corporation purportedly headquartered in Fort Myers in which Hayter profited by approximately $500,000.  Hayter was the lone remaining defendant in the SECs enforcement case filed in 2010., Evidence at the trial showed that among other things, press releases that Hayter and BIH issued in 2008 and 2009 falsely claimed BIH was purchasing a restaurant services corporation that purportedly had contracts with such major corporations as Citi Field and Applebees Restaurants.  Other evidence showed that in order to hide his involvement in the scheme, Hayter and others created a fictitious businessman named Cris Galo who was allegedly an accomplished entrepreneur running BIH.  Evidence showed all of BIHs contact information traced back to Hayter and an associate in New York, with the Fort Myers office being only a mail drop.  Trading records showed the false press releases contributed to BIHs stock rising more than 2,700 percent in a matter of months, allowing colleagues of Hayter to sell stock and funnel approximately $500,000 in proceeds to his own corporations., The SEC filed its complaint against Hayter, BIH, Wayne A. Burmaster Jr. on Sept. 20, 2010, alleging that they had engaged in fraud and illegal sales of securities.  The SEC also alleged securities registration violations by Christopher L. Astrom and his company Bimini Reef Real Estate Inc., Damian B. Guthrie and his company Riverview Capital Inc., and Burmasters company North Bay South Corporation.  The SEC named Baron International Inc., Beaver Creek Financial Corporation, and The Caddo Corporation as relief defendants., According to the SECs complaint, Burmaster and Hayter released false information about BIHs operations and business relationships, the companys stock and dividend payments, and the identity of the individuals directing BIHs affairs.  The SEC alleged that as part of the scheme, Burmaster and Hayter illegally distributed BIHs stock to North Bay, Bimini Reef, and Riverview, and those entities then dumped more than $1 million of BIHs stock and divided illegally obtained sales proceeds among the defendants and relief defendants., On Oct. 25, 2010, the Honorable John E. Steele, United States District Court Judge for the Middle District of Florida, entered judgments of permanent injunction and other relief against Astrom and Bimini Reef Real Estate as well as Guthrie and Riverview Capital, enjoining them from violating Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933.  In addition to injunctive relief, the judgments order them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and penalties in amounts to be determined at a later date.  Astrom and Guthrie are barred from participating in the offering of any penny stock.  They consented to the entry of the judgments without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint., On Sept. 26, 2012, the court entered a default judgment against BIH and North Bay South Corporation and relief defendants The Caddo Corporation and Beaver Creek Financial, ordering disgorgement with a penalty against BIH and North Bay South Corporation to be determined at a later date.

23066,2014,[<h3>Jury Returns Verdict Against Massachusetts Investment Adviser in SEC Fraud Case</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that, on August 13, 2014, a federal court jury in Boston, Massachusetts, returned a verdict against registered investment adviser Sage Advisory Group, LLC, and its principal, Benjamin Lee Grant, both of Boston, MA, in a fraud case filed by the SEC., In its complaint, filed on September 29, 2010, the Commission alleged that starting on or about October 4, 2005, Grant engaged in a scheme to induce his former brokerage customers to transfer their assets to Sage, his new advisory firm., The Commissions complaint further alleged that prior to October 2005, Grant was a  registered representative of broker-dealer Wedbush Morgan Securities and had customer accounts representing approximately $100 million in assets, virtually all of which were managed by California-based investment adviser First Wilshire Securities Management.  According to the complaint, Grant resigned from Wedbush on September 30, 2005 so that he could operate Sage, his own investment advisory firm.  In a letter dated October 4, 2005, Grant told his former Wedbush customers that, at the suggestion of First Wilshire, their accounts were being moved from Wedbush to a discount broker and that Sage had been formed to handle their investments.  The complaint alleged that the letter told Grants customers that the charge for their accounts was changing from a 1% management fee paid to First Wilshire plus Wedbushs brokerage commissions to a 2% wrap fee paid to Sage, and that First Wilshire had indicated that the wrap fee had been historically less expensive than the previous arrangement.  According to the complaint, the letter also told Grants customers that if they wanted to avoid any disruption in First Wilshires management of their assets, they had to sign and return the new advisory and custodial account documents as soon as possible.  According to the complaint, in subsequent communication with customers, Grant told them that First Wilshire was no longer willing to manage their assets at Wedbush and that they had to transfer to the discount broker and sign up with Sage., The Commission contended that these statements were materially false and misleading because First Wilshire had not required a transfer from Wedbush, had not refused to continue managing the customers assets at Wedbush, and had not authorized Grants statements.  Moreover, Grants wrap fee statements were without factual basis.  The complaint further alleged that Grant failed to disclose that the switch from Wedbush to the discount broker would result in significant savings that would flow to Grant and Sage rather than to the advisory clients and that, as a result, Grant and Sages compensation would be substantially increased.  Indeed, once Grants customers transferred their accounts from Wedbush to Sage, Grant more than doubled his own compensation., After a trial that began on August 4, 2014, the jury deliberated for approximately two hours before rendering its verdict of liability against both defendants under Sections 204A and 206(1), (2), and (4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rules 204A-1 and 206(4)-7 thereunder.  The Court will later determine whether and what relief to impose against the defendants.  The case was tried by Marc Jones and J.R. Drabick, with assistance from Stephanie DeSisto and Frank Huntington, of the Commissions Boston Regional Office., For further information, see <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2010/lr21672.htm>Litigation Release No. 21672</a> (September 29, 2010)., On September 1, 2011, the Commission filed a separate civil injunctive action against Sage, Benjamin Lee Grant, and his father Jack Grant alleging that Jack Grant, a lawyer and former stockbroker, had violated a Commission bar from association with investment advisers by associating with his son Benjamin Lee Grants investment advisory firm, Sage, and by acting as an investment adviser himself.  The Complaint further alleged that Jack Grant, Benjamin Lee Grant and Sage fraudulently failed to disclose Jack Grants barred status and disciplinary history to Sages advisory clients.  On May 30, 2013, Jack Grant consented to settle the charges, but the action against Sage and Lee Grant is still pending and a trial date is to be determined.

23072,2014,[<h3>SEC Charges Company and Four Individuals Behind Pump-And-Dump Scheme Touting Technology to End Fracking</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced charges on August 14, 2013 against a Houston-based penny stock company and four individuals behind a pump-and-dump scheme that misled investors to believe the company was on the brink of developing revolutionary technology to enable environmentally friendly oil and gas production., The SEC alleges that Andrew I. Farmer orchestrated the scheme by creating a shell company called Chimera Energy, secretly obtaining control of all shares issued in an initial public offering (IPO) in late 2011, and launching an aggressive promotional campaign midway through 2012 to hype the stock to investors.  After never before issuing a press release, Chimera Energy issued around three dozen in a two-month period to entice investors with extravagant claims about the companys supposed licensing and commercial development of technology to help produce shale oil and gas without the perceived environmental impact of hydraulic fracturing, known as fracking.  However, Chimera Energy did not actually license or even possess the technology it touted, and had not achieved the claimed results in commercially developing it.  While the stock was being pumped by the false claims, entities controlled by Farmer dumped more than 6 million shares on the public markets for illicit proceeds of more than $4.5 million., The SEC <a href=http://www.sec.gov/litigation/suspensions/2012/34-68103.pdf>suspended trading in Chimera Energy stock</a> in 2012 and prevented Farmer and his associates from dumping additional shares or misleading new investors into their scheme., In addition to Chimera Energy and Farmer, the SECs complaint charges a pair of figurehead CEOs installed by Farmer.  The SEC alleges that Charles E. Grob Jr. and Baldemar Rios approved the misleading press releases and operated Chimera Energy at the minimum level necessary to lend the company a veneer of legitimacy while concealing Farmers involvement altogether.  The SECs complaint also charges Carolyn Austin with helping Farmer profit from his scheme by dumping shares of Chimera Energy stock in the midst of the promotional efforts., According to the SECs complaint filed in federal court in Houston, Farmer obtained control of all 5 million shares of Chimera Energy stock issued in the IPO by disguising his ownership through the use of nominee shareholders.  Farmers name and the nature of his control over the company were not disclosed to investors in any of Chimera Energys public filings.  Following the IPO, Farmer directed a press release barrage along with an Internet advertising campaign designed to increase investor awareness of Chimera Energys claims.  The initial press release issued by the company on July 30, 2012 sported the headline: CHMR Unveils Breakthrough Shale Oil Extraction Method to Safely and Effectively Replace Hydraulic Fracturing., The SEC alleges that Chimera Energy disclosed in public filings that an entity named China Inland had granted the company an exclusive license to develop and commercialize cutting edge technologies related to Non-Hydraulic Extraction.  The technology that China Inland purportedly licensed to Chimera Energy was described as an environmentally friendly oil &amp; gas extraction procedure for shale to replace hydraulic fracturing.  The SECs investigation found that the purported acquisition of a license to develop such technology and the license agreement itself are entirely fictitious.  No legitimate entity known as China Inland even exists., The SECs complaint charges Chimera Energy, Farmer, Grob, Rios, and Austin with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 15d-1, 15-11, and 15d-13 thereunder.

Villarreal, formerly of Gates Mills, Ohio.  The Commissions complaint alleges that Villarreal defrauded 51 investors out of more than $18 million in three securities offerings since 2009., The complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, alleges that from March 2009 through December 2010, Villarreal conducted a fraudulent offering, known as Fund III, which raised $9.2 million from 46 investors.  According to the complaint, Villarreal told investors that their money was to be used to make private equity investments in companies in the petroleum, steel, and other industries in Mexico.  Villarreal lied to these investors about the success of a previous fund he operated, lied in saying that he used their money to purchase and profitably operate a Mexican pipeline manufacturer, and lied by telling investors that Fund III had ownership interests in several U.S. and Mexican drilling companies.  Villarreal instead used $7.4 million of Fund III assets to trade in publicly traded securities in a brokerage account-contrary to his representations to investors-and sustained heavy losses, and also stole $5.8 million for himself.  By November 2011, Fund III was essentially insolvent., The Commissions complaint also alleges that, between August 2010 and March 2011, Villarreal conducted a second fraudulent offering, known as the Standard Asset Management Fund I, (SAM Fund), which raised $9 million from 11 investors, six of whom had previously invested in Fund III.  According to the complaint, Villarreal told these investors that the SAM Fund would invest in companies listed on the Mexican stock exchange.  Villarreal made numerous misrepresentations to these investors.  Among other things, Villarreal repeated his earlier lies about Fund II and Fund IIIs purported acquisition and profitable operation of a Mexican pipeline manufacturer,  he stole at least $327,000 of SAM Fund assets, and Villarreals trading was a massive failure, resulting in an 83% loss for the SAM Fund., The complaint also alleges that Villarreal defrauded the SAM Fund investors between March 2012 and May 2012 by offering to exchange limited partnership units he claimed he owned in Fund III for the SAM Fund investors limited partnership units in the SAM Fund.  Eight SAM Fund investors accepted Villarreals offer and exchanged their SAM Fund units, which they had purchased for a total of $3.1 million.  Villarreal, however, lied about the number of Fund III limited partnership units he owned and the value of the Fund III units.  Villarreal did not disclose to these investors that the Fund III limited partnership units were worthless., The Commissions complaint alleges that Villarreal violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.

The order granting summary judgment adopted the material findings of fact submitted by the Commission with its motion for summary judgment.  Richards had previously been permanently enjoined from further violations of the securities laws in connection with allegations that the registered representative misappropriated investor funds in an order dated August 20, 2013.  In the earlier order, Richards was permanently enjoined from further violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206 (1) and Section 206 (2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers Act)., Since at least 2008, Richards, a registered representative of a broker dealer, misappropriated approximately $1.7 million from at least seven investors.  The majority of the misappropriated funds constituted retirement savings and/or life insurance proceeds from deceased spouses.  Richards then instructed investors to write out checks to entities under his control with the understanding that Richards would invest their funds in fixed income assets, variable annuities and/or common stock, and that none of these investments were made as represented.  None of the investments appeared on the clients brokerage account statements, and Richards received no commission income from these investments.

23077,2014,[<h3>SEC Charges L.A.-Based Immigration Attorneys with Defrauding Investors Seeking U.S. Residency</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced charges against a Los Angeles-based immigration attorney, his wife, and his law firm partner for conducting an investment scheme to defraud foreign investors trying to come to the U.S. through the EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program., The SEC alleges that Justin Moongyu Lee along with Rebecca Taewon Lee and Thomas Edward Kent raised nearly $11.5 million from two dozen investors seeking to participate in the EB-5 program, which provides immigrants an opportunity to apply for U.S. residency by investing in a domestic project to create jobs for U.S. workers.  The Lees and Kent informed investors that they would be EB-5 eligible if they invested in an ethanol production plant they would build and operate in Ulysses, Kan.  However, investors money was misappropriated for other uses instead of the ethanol plant project.  The plant was never built and the promised jobs never created, yet the Lees and Kent continued to misrepresent to investors that the project was ongoing., The U.S. Attorneys Office for the Central District of California, which conducted a parallel investigation of the matter, announced that Justin Lee was indicted on nine counts of wire fraud., According to the SECs complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, the investors defrauded by the Lees and Kent were primarily of Chinese and Korean descent.  Justin Lee and Kent applied to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) in 2006 for designation as a regional center under the EB-5 program.  They claimed there would be substantial economic benefit and thousands of new jobs for this area in southwest Kansas.  However, by mid-2008, construction of an ethanol plant at the site was no longer economically feasible, and the Lees and Kent concealed their failure to generate the jobs required by the EB-5 program by submitting false documents to the USCIS., Meantime, the SEC alleges, when Justin Lee was running low on cash and having difficulty obtaining financing, he took money out of investor escrow accounts without their knowledge prior to the approval of an investors application for residency.  Lee and his wife subsequently misused several million dollars raised from the ethanol plant investors for other undisclosed purposes such as financing an iron ore project in the Philippines and repaying investors in other unrelated offerings., According to the SECs complaint, the Lees set up investor seminars in Los Angeles at which the purported ethanol plant project was the main part of the presentation despite the halt of construction in 2008.  Kent, who visited the site frequently in 2008 and 2009 and knew no construction was taking place, also participated in the seminars.  Investors continued to be misled that the proceeds from their investment were being used to construct an ethanol plant.  In particular, the business plan updated in June 2010 and distributed to investors falsely represented that construction was ongoing and the plant would be in operation before November 2011., The SECs complaint charges the Lees, Kent, and five companies founded and controlled by Justin Lee (American Immigrant Investment Fund I, Biofuel Venture IV, Biofuel Venture V, Nexland Investment Group, and Nexsun Ethanol) with violations of Sections 17(a)(1), (2), and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 as well as Rule 10b-5(a) and (c).  Justin Lee, Kent, and the entities also are charged with violating Rule 10b-5(b).

23078,2014,[<h3>Judgments Entered Against Company and Former CEO in Securities Kickback Scheme</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on September 4, 2014, the federal court in Boston, Massachusetts, entered judgments by consent against Massachusetts corporation ZipGlobal Holdings, Inc. and its former Chief Executive Officer and President, Michael Lee of Hingham, Massachusetts, in a fraud action that was filed in December 2011.  The fraud involved a kickback scheme that was exposed by an undercover operation of the Federal Bureau of Investigations Boston office.  Among other things, ZipGlobal and Lee were permanently enjoined from violating an antifraud statute, Lee was held liable for disgorgement of $105,603 of ill-gotten gains, and Lee was permanently barred from serving as an officer or director of public companies or participating in offerings of penny stock., ZipGlobal and Lee are two of several parties charged on December 1, 2011 by both the Commission and the U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts, alleging that they used kickbacks and other schemes to trigger investments in various thinly-traded stocks.  According to the Commissions complaint, the schemes involved secret kickbacks to an investment fund representative in exchange for having the investment fund buy stock in certain companies; the kickbacks were to be concealed through the use of sham consulting agreements.  What the participants in the scheme did not know was that the purported investment fund representative was actually an undercover agent of the FBI., The Commissions complaint alleged that in October 2010, Lee met with an individual who purported to be a Boston, Massachusetts-based representative of a major hedge fund.  In fact, the hedge fund representative was an undercover FBI agent.  The complaint alleged that Lee and the hedge fund representative agreed to a scheme whereby the hedge fund would purchase $5 million of ZipGlobal stock in return for the payment of kickbacks to the hedge fund representative.  Lee and the hedge fund representative agreed to structure the transaction in such a way that it would avoid detection by the hedge funds compliance personnel and securities regulators.  Among other things, they agreed to structure the transaction into smaller tranches of securities purchases, and to make the kickback payments to the hedge fund representative through a shell corporation pursuant to a consulting agreement to make it appear that the kickback payments were compensation for consulting services.  The complaint alleged that, from November 2010 to January 2011, ZipGlobal and Lee followed through by entering agreements whereby the hedge fund purchased a total of $113,775 worth of ZipGlobal stock and kickbacks totaling $39,821 were funneled back to the hedge fund representative., In the related criminal action, Lee was sentenced on March 6, 2014 to three years of probation (the first nine months to be served in home confinement with electronic monitoring) and was ordered to forfeit $105,603 after pleading guilty on January 11, 2012 to one count of mail fraud and one count of conspiracy., The judgments in the Commissions action, to which ZipGlobal and Lee consented, permanently enjoin ZipGlobal and Lee from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The judgment as to Lee holds him liable for $105,603 in disgorgement, but deems his disgorgement satisfied by the forfeiture order for the same amount of money in the related criminal action.  The judgment also prohibits Lee from acting as an officer or director of any issuer that has a class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act or that is required to file reports pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, and prohibits Lee from participating in any offering of penny stock, pursuant to Section 21(d)(6) of the Exchange Act., The Commission suspended trading in the stock of ZipGlobal on December 1, 2011. , The Commissions cases remain pending against James Wheeler, MicroHoldings US, Inc., Edward Henderson, and Paul Desjourdy, who were also charged on December 1, 2011 as a result of the FBI undercover operation., For further information, see Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr22177.htm>22177</a> (December. 2, 2011) (Complaints); Exchange Act Release No. <a href=/litigation/suspensions/2011/34-65857.pdf>65857</a> (December 1, 2011) (trading suspensions); and No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr23002.htm>23002</a> (May 23, 2014) (Lee and others sentenced in parallel criminal actions).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr23078.htm</i><br/>]"

The judgment of conviction was entered against Litvak on July 25, 2014.  Based on that judgment, the SECs Enforcement Division instituted administrative proceedings against Litvak on September 2, 2014 to determine what, if any, remedial action is appropriate in the public interest against Litvak.  Such action could include a bar from the securities industry., , The SEC had also charged Litvak separately in a civil action with making misrepresentations and engaging in misleading conduct while he sold mortgage-backed securities (MBS) in the wake of the financial crisis.  The Commissions civil action against Litvak remains pending.  In its civil complaint filed in District Court for the District of Connecticut on January 28, 2013, the SEC alleged that Litvak, a senior trader on Jefferies MBS Desk who worked at Jefferies office in Stamford, Connecticut, bought and sold MBS from and to his customers.  According to the SECs civil complaint, on numerous occasions from 2009 to 2011, Litvak lied to, or otherwise misled, those customers about the price at which Jefferies had purchased the MBS before selling it to another customer and the amount of his firms compensation for arranging the trades.  The SEC alleged that, on some occasions, Litvak also misled his customer into believing that he was arranging a MBS trade between customers, when Litvak really was selling the MBS out of Jefferies inventory.  According to the SECs civil complaint, Litvak also misled customers about how much money they were paying in compensation to Jefferies.  The customers included investment funds established by the United States government in the wake of the financial crisis to help support the market for MBS as well as other investment funds, including hedge funds., , The SECs complaint charged Litvak with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, particularly Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.

Markusen and an employee Jay C. Cope implemented a scheme to enrich themselves at the expense of investors in the funds.  Markusen routinely caused the funds to reimburse Archer for fake research expenses, and he eventually routed much of that money to his personal checking account and spent it on country club dues, boarding school tuition, and a Lexus among other luxury items.  Furthermore, Markusen devised a way to essentially charge fund investors twice for the same fake research expenses.  First, he billed the funds directly by falsely claiming that Archer had paid Cope to conduct research for the funds.  Second, he and Cope improperly diverted soft dollars from the funds to Cope for the same purported research and under the additional pretense that Cope was an independent consultant.  Soft dollars were supposed to be used to buy third-party investment research that benefited the funds.  Cope conducted no third-party research as an Archer officer whose main duties were placing trades and helping Markusen find new investors., The SECs complaint filed in federal court in Minneapolis also charges Markusen and Cope with conducting a separate scheme to manipulate the stock price of the funds largest holding in order to inflate the monthly returns reported to investors and conceal the true extent of the funds mounting investment losses., According to the SECs complaint, the scheme enabled Markusen to secretly pay Copes salary with fund soft dollars rather than out of Archers coffers.  Markusen and Cope disguised Copes $10,000 monthly salary payments as research fees because under the governing documents of the hedge funds they managed and SEC rules, Archer employees could not draw a salary from fund assets or receive fund soft dollars for non-research assistance.  The SEC alleges that Markusen and Cope traded excessively in the funds brokerage accounts in order to generate enough soft dollars to pay Copes monthly salary at Archer.  They misrepresented Copes relationship with Archer to the brokerage firms that administered the funds soft dollars, and created false and misleading monthly research invoices for the amount of Copes salary.  Markusen and Cope sent the invoices each month to the funds brokerage firms, who in turn paid fund soft dollars directly to Cope for the purported research expenses.  Markusen would then receive a $1,000 monthly kickback from Cope., According to the SECs complaint, Markusen and Cope carried out their portfolio pumping scheme by manipulating the price of the thinly-traded stock of CyberOptics Corp. (CYBE), which comprised over 75 percent of the funds portfolios and was by far the largest holding.  Knowing that Archers trading as CYBEs largest shareholder could materially impact the market price, Markusen and Cope marked the close in CYBE on the last trading day of the month at least 28 times.  In doing so, they sought to improperly drive up CYBEs closing price by placing multiple buy orders often seconds before the market closed to artificially pump up the value of the funds portfolios, which were valued as of the close of trading on the months last trading day.  Those valuations were used to calculate the funds monthly returns that Archer reported to investors as well as Archers monthly management fee, which was a fixed percentage of each portfolios value.  The higher CYBE closing price at the end of each month enabled Markusen to inflate the funds performance and extract more lucrative management fees., The SECs complaint charges Archer, Markusen, and Cope with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and certain reporting provisions., The SECs investigation was conducted by Nicholas Eichenseer, Luz Aguilar, and Paul Montoya of the Chicago Regional Office, with assistance from Kevin Vincent and Lorraine Ricci of the Offices examination program.

Nevdahl have settled charges arising out of their involvement with Heart Tronics, Inc., a microcap company formerly known as Signalife, Inc. that the SEC has alleged engaged in a series of frauds between 2006 and 2009.  As part of the settlement, Perkins will pay a penalty of $42,500 and is now barred for three years from serving as an officer or director of a public company or engaging in an offering of penny stock.   He also consented to the full injunctive relief sought by the SEC.  Nevdahl, in his settlement, will pay a civil penalty of $13,000 and was ordered to cease and desist from aiding or abetting or committing any future violations.  Nevdahl also was suspended for six months from associating with certain regulated entities and from participating in any offering of penny stock.  The SEC’s litigation against Heart Tronics, its co-CEO, Willie Gault, and a former attorney, Mitchell Stein, is continuing.  Stein is currently incarcerated while awaiting sentencing, after a jury returned a verdict in May 2013 convicting him of fourteen felonies for his role., According to the SEC’s complaint, Perkins, acting as CEO in 2008, signed and certified pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 three quarterly reports Heart Tronics filed with the SEC that contained material misstatements about the company’s sales orders, potential customers, and internal accounting and disclosure controls.  The SEC alleged, among other things, that Perkins knew of significant red flags indicating that Heart Tronics’ purported sales orders in 2007 and 2008 were fictional yet allowed the orders to be publicly disclosed without taking adequate steps to determine their validity.  Neither admitting nor denying the SEC’s allegations, Perkins consented to a final judgment ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $42,500 and enjoining him from violating Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 13a-14 thereunder, or aiding and abetting violations of Exchange Act Section 13(b)2)(B).  He also consented to court-imposed, three-year officer and director and penny stock bars. The court entered a final judgment against Perkins on September 4, 2014., The SEC’s complaint also alleged that Nevdahl, who, at the time, was a registered representative of an SEC-registered broker-dealer, served as the trustee for a number of nominee accounts and blind trusts that Mitchell Stein and his wife used to secretly and unlawfully sell millions of dollars’ worth of Heart Tronics stock.  According to the complaint, the trusts were designed to create the façade that the shares were under the control of Nevdahl as an independent trustee, but Nevdahl met the Steins’ regular demands for cash by continually selling Heart Tronics stock on the public market and in transactions negotiated by Stein.  Without either admitting or denying the SEC’s allegations, Nevdahl consented to pay a penalty of $13,000 to resolve the SEC’s action.  Nevdahl also consented to the institution and settlement of administrative cease-and-desist proceedings in which the SEC issued an order finding that he willfully violated Section 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act, ordering him to cease and desist from aiding or abetting or committing any future violations, and suspending him from participation in any penny stock offering for a period of six months.  The order also suspended Nevdahl for six months from associating with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, transfer agent, or nationally recognized statistical organization, and from serving or acting as an employee, officer, director, member of an advisory board, investment adviser or depositor of, or principal underwriter for, a registered investment company.  The court entered a final judgment against Nevdahl on August 29, 2014, and the Commission issued its Order on September 5, 2014., For further  information, see Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr22204.htm>22204</a> (Dec. 20, 2011).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr23081.htm</i><br/>]"
23082,2014,[<h3>Judgment Entered Against Former CEO in Securities Kickback Scheme</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on September 11, 2014, the federal court in Boston, Massachusetts entered judgment by consent against Paul Desjourdy of Medfield, Massachusetts, the former President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, General Counsel, Treasurer and a director of Massachusetts corporation Symbollon Pharmaceuticals, Inc., in a fraud action that was filed in December 2011.  The fraud involved a kickback scheme that was exposed by an undercover operation of the Federal Bureau of Investigations Boston office.  Desjourdy was permanently enjoined from violating an antifraud statute, held liable for disgorgement of $54,000 of ill-gotten gains, and was permanently barred from serving as an officer or director of public companies or participating in offerings of penny stock., Desjourdy is one of several parties charged on December 1, 2011 by both the Commission and the U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts, alleging that they used kickbacks and other schemes to trigger investments in various thinly-traded stocks.  According to the Commissions complaint, the schemes involved secret kickbacks to an investment fund representative in exchange for having the investment fund buy stock in certain companies; the kickbacks were to be concealed through the use of sham consulting agreements.  What the participants in the scheme did not know was that the purported investment fund representative was actually an undercover agent of the FBI., The Commissions complaint alleged that in May 2011, Desjourdy met with an individual who purported to be a Boston, Massachusetts-based representative of a major hedge fund.  In fact, the hedge fund representative was an undercover FBI agent.  The complaint alleged that Desjourdy and the hedge fund representative agreed to a scheme whereby the hedge fund would purchase $5 million of Symbollon stock in return for the payment of kickbacks to the hedge fund representative.  Desjourdy and the hedge fund representative agreed to structure the transaction in such a way that it would avoid detection by the hedge funds compliance personnel and securities regulators.  Among other things, they agreed to structure the transaction into smaller tranches of securities purchases, and to make the kickback payments to the hedge fund representative through a shell corporation pursuant to a consulting agreement to make it appear that the kickback payments were compensation for consulting services.  The complaint alleged that, in May and June 2011, Desjourdy followed through by entering agreements whereby the hedge fund purchased a total of $108,000 worth of Symbollon stock and kickbacks totaling $54,000 were funneled back to the hedge fund representative., In the related criminal action, Desjourdy was sentenced on January 16, 2014 to 18 months of probation and was ordered to forfeit $54,000 after pleading guilty on January 11, 2012 to one count of mail fraud and one count of conspiracy.  On February 28, 2014, based on his felony conviction in the criminal action, Desjourdy also was forthwith suspended from appearing or practicing before the Commission pursuant to Rule 102(e)(2) of the Commissions Rules of Practice., The judgment in the Commissions action, to which Desjourdy consented, permanently enjoins him from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The judgment further holds Desjourdy liable for $54,000 in disgorgement, but deems his disgorgement satisfied by the forfeiture order for the same amount of money in the related criminal action.  The judgment also prohibits Desjourdy from acting as an officer or director of any issuer that has a class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act or that is required to file reports pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, and prohibits Desjourdy from participating in any offering of penny stock, pursuant to Section 21(d)(6) of the Exchange Act., The Commission suspended trading in the stock of Symbollon on December 1, 2011, and, on June 6, 2014, instituted proceedings to determine whether Symbollons securities registration should be suspended or revoked based on its failure to file required periodic reports with the Commission since 2011.  On July 14, 2014, the ALJ issued an Initial Decision on Default finding Symbollon in default and revoking registration of each class of its registered securities.  On August 26, 2014, the Initial Decision became final., The Commissions cases remain pending against Edward Henderson, James Wheeler, and MicroHoldings US, Inc., also charged on December 1, 2011 as a result of the FBI undercover operation.

The SEC previously charged the operators of the scheme based in the South Florida and Los Angeles areas.  Seniors and other investors were pressured into purchasing stock in Thought Development Inc. (TDI), an unaffiliated Miami Beach-based company that stated its signature invention is a laser-line system that generates a green line on a football field for a first-down marker visible not only on television but also to players, officials, and fans in the stadium.  , The SEC charged four executives who helped make the scheme possible and three companies they operate - DDBO Consulting, Inc., DBBG Consulting, Inc., and CalPacific Equity Group, LLC.  Approximately $1.7 million was raised through these companies from more than 110 investors who were told that an initial public offering (IPO) in TDI was imminent and that their money would be used to develop the ground-breaking technology.  Instead, the SEC alleges that the IPO was not forthcoming as promised, and at least 50 percent of the offering proceeds were merely retained by these companies or paid to sales agents through undisclosed commissions and fees.  Certain executives, their sales agents and their companies lured investors by misrepresenting that TDIs technology was about to be used by the National Football League (NFL).  One investor even made an additional $75,000 investment on top of an initial $2,500 investment after being told that NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell purchased TDIs technology for use in the 2013 Super Bowl.  In fact, there was no such arrangement., In addition to the their companies, the SECs complaints charge brothers Dean R. Baker of Coral Springs, Fla., and Daniel R. Baker of Valley Village, Calif., along with Bret A. Grove of Delray Beach, Fla., and Demosthenes Dritsas of Newhall, Calif.  The SECs complaints allege violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 as well as Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.  The defendants all agreed to settle the SECs charges.

Stilwell to Testify in Response to SEC Investigative Subpoena</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that, on September 11, 2014, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York entered an order requiring Joseph D. Stilwell (Stilwell) to testify pursuant to an investigative subpoena.  , On August 13, 2014, the Commission filed an application to enforce its investigative subpoena.  According to the Commissions application, on November 27, 2012, the Commission issued a Formal Order Directing Private Investigation, entitled In the Matter of Stilwell Value, LLC.  Stilwell failed to comply with a validly issued and served subpoena for his testimony relating to this investigation.  On September 9, 2014, the court held a hearing on the Commissions application and ruled in the Commissions favor.

As disclosed in the Commissions earlier application, the Commission is investigating, among others things, whether Stilwell, Stilwell Value, and possibly others violated the anti-fraud or other provisions of the federal securities laws in connection with certain inter-fund loans at the Stilwell Funds.  The investigation relates, in part, to whether Stilwell and Stilwell Value accurately disclosed the existence and accurate terms of, as well as potential conflicts of interest created by, those inter-fund loans., The Commission is continuing to conduct its fact-finding inquiry and has not concluded that anyone has violated the securities laws.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr23084.htm</i><br/>]"

Holding Company Limited was granted in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida last week.  The SECs complaint alleged that Abatement Corp. and its now-deceased principal Joseph Laurer — who commonly used the name Dr. Josef V. Laurer — falsely promised investors safe, guaranteed returns while engaging in an offering fraud and Ponzi scheme from November 2004 until Laurers death on May 15, 2014., The SECs complaint also names Laurers widow Brenda Davis and another Laurer-controlled company International Balanced Fund as relief defendants because they received investor funds., The SECs complaint alleges that Laurer, through Abatement Corp., raised more than $4.6 million from approximately 50 investors residing primarily in South Florida.  Laurer, who was a member of the City of Homesteads General Employee Pension Board and president of the South Dade chapter of AARP, convinced investors to give him money through false claims that he would put their money into Abatement Corp.s purported bond fund that invested in triple-A rated corporate and government bonds.  Laurer also told investors that the fund would pay a guaranteed fixed return, with no risk to principal because of insurance from either or both the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Securities Investor Protection Corporation., The SEC alleges that by at least 2007, Laurer was operating a full-fledged Ponzi scheme and putting virtually no new investor money into securities, instead using investor funds to pay returns to investors, fund investor withdrawals, and pay personal expenses.  At the time of Laurers death, approximately $900,000 remained in Abatement Corp.s bank account in the Turks and Caicos Islands, and another $82,000 remains in a domestic bank account held by International Balanced Fund.  The SEC further alleges that Laurer used investor funds for the benefit of his wife, including paying premiums with investor funds on a half million dollar life insurance policy she received upon his death., The court order issued on September 12 temporarily freezes the assets of Abatement Corp. and International Balanced Fund and sets a hearing for September 22.  Davis agreed to a temporary freeze of certain assets of hers until November 6, pending a determination of the SECs claim against Davis for disgorgement. If the SEC and Davis have not resolved the claims against her or agreed to an extension of the temporary asset freeze by October 22, then the court will hold a hearing on the SECs motion against Davis on October 24., The SECs complaint charges Abatement Corp. with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.  In addition to seeking an asset freeze, the SEC also seeks an order directing Abatement Corp. and the relief defendants to pay disgorgement with prejudgment interest and provide a sworn accounting of all proceeds received and an order directing repatriation of any funds held at any offshore bank or other financial institution not subject to the jurisdiction of the court., The SECs investigation was conducted by Terence M. Tennant and Mark S. Dee under the supervision of Elisha L. Frank in the SECs Miami Regional Office.  They were assisted by Anson Kwong, Debra E. Williamson, George Franceschini, Nicholas A. Monaco and John C. Mattimore of the Miami offices examination program.  The SECs litigation is being led by Andrew Schiff.

23086,2014,[<h3>SEC Charges It Employee At Law Firm with Insider Trading Ahead of Merger Announcements</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday charged an employee in an international law firms IT department with insider trading ahead of several mergers and acquisitions involving firm clients being advised on the deals., The SEC alleges that Dimitry Braverman, a senior information technology professional at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &amp; Rosati, Professional Corporation (Wilson Sonsini) had access to nonpublic information in the firms client-related databases and garnered more than $300,000 in illicit profits by trading in advance of merger announcements.  Braverman began by insider trading in accounts in his own name, but shifted course when <a href=http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2011/2011-85.htm>a lawyer at his firm was charged by the SEC</a> and criminal authorities in an entirely separate insider trading scheme.  After immediately liquidating the remaining securities that he had purchased on the basis of nonpublic information, Braverman waited about 18 months and then continued his insider trading in a brokerage account held in the name of a relative living in Russia.  His concealment efforts failed, however, when SEC investigators were able to dissect a suspicious pattern of trades and trace them back to Braverman., In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York announced criminal charges against Braverman., According to the SECs complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan, Braverman began his scheme in 2010 by using nonpublic information to trade the stock or stock options in one of the companies involved in an upcoming merger or acquisition.  He typically sold his stock or exercised his options shortly after the deals were made public.  In advance of two deals, Braverman tipped his brother, who consequently made approximately $1,800 in profits., The SEC alleges that Braverman conducted insider trading in four companies prior to the separate insider trading charges against the Wilson Sonsini lawyer in 2011, and four more companies after he opened a brokerage account in late 2012 in the name of Vitaly Pupynin, a relative who that summer had visited Bravermans home in San Mateo, Calif., during a trip to the U.S. from Russia.  The e-mail address associated with the account was same one that Braverman had used twice before to open other brokerage accounts.  However, Braverman later created a new e-mail address using Pupynins first name and changed the e-mail address associated with the brokerage account to that address instead.  After Pupynin left the U.S. in October 2012, Braverman used the account to continue insider trading and profiting on the basis of material nonpublic information that he obtained.  Braverman continued his insider trading through 2013., The SECs complaint charges Braverman with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 as well as Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14e-3.  Pupynin is named as a relief defendant in the SECs complaint for the purposes of recovering Bravermans ill-gotten gains in the trading account held in Pupynins name., The SECs investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Charu A.

Both de Maisons are charged by the SEC in the case along with others enlisted to buy, sell, or promote stock in the company now called Gepco Ltd.  Zirk de Maison installed some of these associates as officers and directors of Gepco while he secretly ran the company behind the scenes.  Collectively, they amassed large blocks of shares of Gepco common stock while the de Maisons manipulated the market to create the appearance of genuine investor demand, allowing an associate to sell his stock at inflated prices to make hundreds of thousands of dollars in illicit profits., In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Northern District of Ohio and the Cleveland Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation today announced criminal charges against Zirk de Maison., The SEC has obtained an emergency court order to freeze the assets of the de Maisons and others who profited illegally through the alleged scheme., According to the SECs complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Zirk de Maison has secretly controlled the shell company now known as Gepco since its incorporation in 2008 under a different name.  During the next five years, he caused the company to enter into a number of reverse mergers and its reported business evolved from equipment leasing to prepaid stored value cards related to electronic devices until the company eventually became known as WikiFamilies and claimed to own and operate a social media website.  The company name changed to Gepco in 2013, and after a failed attempt to merge it into a private mixed martial arts company, de Maison created his own private company purportedly in the high-end diamond business and merged Gepco into it., The SEC alleges that the de Maisons, who reside in Redlands, Calif., brought at least six others into the fold to coordinate various components of the scheme.  They each are charged in the SECs complaint:, According to the SECs complaint, Zirk de Maison exchanged e-mails and text messages with many of his co-conspirators as they openly discussed coordinating their promotional activities and manipulative trading in Gepcos stock in order to create a false impression of market activity.  They stood to earn exponentially more illicit profits given that they continue to beneficially own tens of millions of shares of Gepco stock, so the <a href=/litigation/suspensions/2014/34-73136-o.pdf>SEC today suspended trading in Gepco securities</a> in order to prevent any further manipulation or dumping of the stock., The SECs complaint, which additionally charges several companies connected to the scheme, alleges violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 9 and 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.  The complaint seeks a permanent injunction and disgorgement of ill-gotten gains along with prejudgment interest, financial penalties, and penny stock bars.

Karlis, 54, of Hopkinton, MA, was sentenced by U.S. District Court Senior Judge Mark L. Wolf to nine years in prison, three years of supervised release, and ordered to pay $4,378,306 in restitution to the fraud victims.  In March 2014, Karlis pleaded guilty to nine counts of wire fraud, among other charges.  , Karlis business partner, Ahmet Devrim Akyil, was also charged, but according to a September 16, 2014 press release issued by the United States Attorneys Office for the District of Massachusetts (USAO), Akyil remains a fugitive and is believed to be in his native Turkey.  The USAO unsealed an indictment charging Karlis and Akyil with criminal violations on October 28, 2010., Also on October 28, 2010, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action in federal district court in Massachusetts against BTR, and its principals Ahmet Devrim Akyil and Craig Karlis for fraudulently raising millions of dollars from investors in a purported foreign currency (Forex) trading venture. Among other things, the Commission alleges that the defendants misappropriated some investor funds and lost the vast majority of remaining investor funds through Forex trading activity after promising investors that most of their funds were protected from such trading losses., According to the Complaint, BTR collapsed in September 2008 due to significant losses accrued as a result of concealed trading far past the stop loss limits promised to investors. Ultimately, BTR distributed the remaining funds, which accounted for only approximately 10% of account balances, to its investors., The Commissions complaint, which is pending, alleges that BTR, Akyil, and Karlis violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

In a separate complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, the SEC now identifies Frank Tamayo as that middleman.  The SEC alleges that Tamayo received material nonpublic information from Steven Metro about 13 impending corporate deals involving clients of the law firm where Metro worked.  Tamayo then tipped his stockbroker Vladimir Eydelman, who used the confidential information to illegally trade for himself and for Tamayo and other customers.  Tamayo allocated a portion of his ill-gotten profits for eventual payback to Metro for the inside information., In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the District of New Jersey announced criminal charges against Tamayo.  The U.S. Attorney previously brought criminal actions against Metro and Eydelman.  Those criminal cases and the SECs civil case against Metro and Eydelman are pending., According to the SECs complaint against Tamayo, the scheme was deliberately structured to avoid detection, enabling Eydelman and Tamayo to profit without connecting the trades to an insider source and also allowing Metro to share in the trading proceeds.  For a five-year period, Metro repeatedly accessed confidential information in his law firms computer systems and met with Tamayo at bars and coffee shops in New York City to provide tips about firm clients ready to participate in a corporate transaction.  Tamayo typically would then connect with Eydelman near the clock at the information booth at Grand Central, where he would show him a post-it note or napkin on which Tamayo wrote the stock ticker symbol of the company to be acquired.  Tamayo then chewed up and sometimes even ate the post-it note or napkin to destroy evidence of the tip.  Tamayo also conveyed to Eydelman the approximate transaction price and timing of the deal.  After Eydelman returned to his office and gathered research about the target company, he would e-mail Tamayo supposed thoughts about why buying the stock made sense.  Their intent was to create a paper trail of e-mails to make it appear they were making their trading decisions based on research and analysis rather than inside information., The SECs complaint charges Tamayo with violations of Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder, as well as Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933., The SECs investigation was conducted by Jason Burt and Carolyn Welshhans in the Market Abuse Unit with assistance from John Rymas, Mathew Wong, Daniel Koster, and Leigh Barrett.

Shavers, A/K/A/ Pirateat40 - Operator of Bitcoin Ponzi Scheme Ordered to Pay More Than $40 Million in Disgorgement and Penalties</h3>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that, on September 18, 2014, a United States District Court in Sherman, Texas entered final judgment against Trendon T. Shavers and Bitcoin Savings and Trust (BTCST), the online entity Shavers created and used to operate his Ponzi scheme, and through which he defrauded investors out of more than 700,000 bitcoins.  The Courts judgment requires Shavers and BTCST to pay more than $40 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and orders each Defendant to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  , The Commission established, and the Court found, that from February 2011 through August 2012, Shavers offered and sold investments in BTCST over the internet.  Shavers solicited all investments, and paid all purported returns, in bitcoins.  Operating under the internet name, pirateat40, Shavers solicited investors in online chat rooms and on the Bitcoin Forum, an online forum dedicated to Bitcoin, promising them up to 7% returns weekly based on his claimed trading of bitcoin against the U.S. dollar, including selling bitcoins to individuals who wanted to buy them off the radar.  In reality, Shavers used new bitcoins received from BTCST investors to pay purported returns on outstanding BTCST investments, and diverted BTCST investors bitcoins for his personal use.  The Court further found that, even as he publicly denied the Ponzi scheme on the Bitcoin Forum, Shavers knowingly and intentionally operated BTCST as a sham and a Ponzi scheme, and repeatedly made materially false and misleading representations to BTCST investors and potential investors concerning the use of their bitcoins, how he would generate the promised returns, and the safety of their investments. , The Courts judgment permanently enjoins Shavers and BTCST from future violations of Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; orders them to disgorge, on a joint and several basis, $39,638,569, plus $1,766,098 prejudgment interest thereon, for a total of $40,404,667; and orders Shavers and BTCST each to pay a $150,000 penalty.  ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr23090.htm</i><br/>]"
23091,2014,[<h3>SEC Obtains a TRO and Asset Freeze to Stop an Ongoing Pyramid Scheme</h3>],"[On September 22, 2014, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the Northern District of Georgia against Zhunrize, Inc. (Zhunrize) and its CEO, Jeff Pan (Pan).  In connection with the filing of this action, the Commission obtained a temporary restraining order against the defendants and an order freezing all of defendants assets.  The Commission alleges that Zhunrize, an Atlanta-based multi-level marketing company, and Pan have been operating a fraudulent pyramid scheme that has raised over $100 million from investors worldwide., According to the Commissions complaint, Zhunrize purports to be a legitimate multi-level marketing business by which members purchase online stores and then sell merchandise through them, while earning commissions on products purchased by their customers and through store sales to other members and hosting fees paid by those members.  In fact, the company is operating as a pyramid scheme because its commission structure is based on the continual recruitment of new members, with the most lucrative returns dependent on the downline recruitment of other members through store sales irrespective of any product sales.  To date, the company has taken in approximately $105 million from approximately 77,000 investors since 2012., The Commissions complaint further alleges that in its promotional materials, Zhunrize touts the ability to earn commissions from the sale of products, both through the owners store and through downstream owners stores.  For example, a Zhunrize promotional video differentiates Zhunrize from other on-line multi-level marketing plans, claiming that Zhunrize has sustainability.  According to the video, the Zhunrize model will sustain itself because we will have millions more customers than distributors.  Later, the narrator in the video claims we have the Vendor Relationships, the Logistics, the Payment Gateways to reach millions of new customers each month. , The Commissions complaint also alleges that Zhunrize does not disclose, however, that to date substantially all of its revenue has comes from the sale of memberships (referred to as stores) and the corresponding monthly internet hosting fees associated with operating those stores, rather than the sale of products.  Indeed, both Pan and a Zhunrize vice-president testified that the company currently derives 80-90% of its revenue from selling online stores and the monthly internet hosting fees for them, as opposed to actual products from these stores.  Thus, contrary to the representations to potential investors, Zhunrize is actually a fraudulent pyramid scheme. , The Commissions complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, alleges that each defendant violated Sections 5(a), (c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks against each defendant permanent injunctions, disgorgement with prejudgment interest and civil monetary penalties pursuant to Section 21A of the Exchange Act., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2014/comp-pr2014-217-zhunrize.pdf>SEC Complaint</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr23091.htm</i><br/>]"

(Spencer), a microcap pharmaceutical company with addresses in both Boston and Canada.  Among other relief, the final judgments impose permanent injunctions against future violations of certain antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and order Arella and Morrice to each pay $50,000 penalties., According to the Commissions complaint, filed on December 17, 2012, Spencer, its officers and directors, and other associated parties were involved in a pump-and-dump scheme in 2010 and 2011 involving Spencers stock.  The scheme was orchestrated by co-defendant Jean-FranÃ§ois Amyot, a Canadian resident who controlled Spencer.  Amyot worked with Arella and Morrice, Canadian residents who were Spencers officers and directors, to create and disseminate false and misleading press releases and to otherwise promote Spencers stock, including via Internet websites and newsletters.  Among the false and misleading press releases were a series of releases that claimed that Spencer had received an unsolicited buyout offer from a Mideast company for $245 million when, in fact, the purported buyout offer was not real.  The promotional campaign significantly pumped up the price of Spencers stock - at one point causing the price to more than double in two days - and consequently enabled Amyot to dump tens of millions of shares into the market at artificially inflated prices for gross proceeds in excess of $5 million.  The complaint further alleged that Spencer, Amyot, and Arella violated certain registration provisions of the federal securities laws for transfers of millions of Spencer shares done to evade registration requirements., Arella and Morrice each consented to the entry of the final judgments against them without admitting or denying the charges.  The final judgments permanently enjoin both Arella and Morrice from violating Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and bar both Arella and Morrice for a period of five years from serving as a director or officer of a public company and from participating in a penny stock offering.  The final judgments also require Arella and Morrice to each pay $50,000 penalties.  The final judgment against Arella also permanently enjoins Arella from violating Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act.  , The Commissions action against Spencer, Amyot, and two companies controlled by Amyot (Hilbroy Advisory Inc. and IAB Media Inc.) is still pending.  The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Quebec Autorité des Marchés Financiers in connection with this matter., The Commission suspended trading in Spencer securities on December 17, 2012 (Release 34-68447).

Montgomery, of the U.S. District Court in Minneapolis, Minnesota, issued an Opinion and Order imposing sanctions against defendants Marlon Quan, Acorn Capital Group, LLC (Acorn), Stewardship Investment Advisors, LLC (SIA) and ACG II, LLC (ACG II).  In the Opinion and Order, Judge Montgomery imposed permanent injunctions against the defendants, and imposed financial sanctions of over $80 million against Marlon Quan and the three other defendants that he controlled., The Commissions complaint, which was filed in March 2011, alleged that Marlon Quan helped to facilitate the massive fraud of Tom Petters by funneling several hundred million dollars of investor money into the Petters Ponzi scheme.  According to the SECs 2009 complaint against Tom Petters, he sold promissory notes to feeder funds like those controlled by Quan and his firms.  Petters used some of the note proceeds to pay returns to earlier investors, diverting the rest of the cash to his own purposes. Petters had promised investors that their money would be used to finance the purchase of vast amounts of consumer electronics by vendors who then re-sold the merchandise to such retailers as Wal-Mart and Costco. In reality, this purchase order inventory financing business was merely a Ponzi scheme -- there were no inventory transactions., The SEC alleged that Quan and his firms (SIA and Acorn) invested hundreds of millions of hedge fund assets with Petters while pocketing tens of millions of dollars in fees.  Marlon Quan and his companies falsely assured investors that their money would be protected by various safeguards such as lock box accounts.  The complaint also alleged that when Petters was unable to make payments on investments held by the funds that Quan managed, Quan and his firms concealed Petterss defaults from investors.  , The Commission had previously charged Petters and Illinois-based fund manager Gregory M. Bell with fraud, and filed additional charges against Florida-based hedge fund managers Bruce F. Prévost and David W. Harrold for similarly defrauding their investors in connection with investments in the Petters Ponzi scheme.  Subsequent to filing the complaint against Marlon Quan and his companies, the SEC also charged James Fry, a Minnesota-based hedge fund manager, with similar misconduct.  , After a nine-day trial, on February 11, 2014, the jury returned a verdict for the Commission and against the defendants, finding Marlon Quan and his three companies liable for securities fraud.  In her September 19th Opinion and Order, Judge Montgomery permanently enjoined the Marlon Quan, Acorn, SIA and ACG II from violating, or aiding and abetting violations of, Section 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.

Based on this and related misconduct, the SEC charged China Valves and the three senior officers with violations of anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws; China Valves with related violations of the reporting, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws; and Fang, Wang, and Tang with falsely certifying that China Valvess filings contained no material misstatements and aiding and abetting China Valvess violations of the reporting and books and records provisions.  China Valves is a China-based U.S. issuer formed through a reverse merger in 2007., The case is the latest from the SECs Cross-Border Working Group that focuses on companies with substantial foreign operations that are publicly traded in the U.S.  The Commissions complaint alleges that China Valves, Fang, Wang, and Tang intentionally misled investors about China Valvess 2010 acquisition of Watts Valve Changsha Co., Ltd. (Changsha Valve) in an effort to mask the subsidiarys prior investigation of violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and China Valves decision to pay sales commissions to employees that potentially violated the FCPA.  Among other things, China Valves and its officers fraudulently misstated or failed to disclose certain facts about the acquisition, including:  (1) the purchase price, (2) the true seller, (3) the form of the acquisition, (4) the FCPA investigation, (5) the payment of commissions that the seller had declined to pay because of suspected FCPA violations, and (6) the role of related parties in the acquisition., The complaint further alleges that, in 2011, China Valves materially overstated income and understated liabilities incurred by a wholly-owned subsidiary, Shanghai Pudong Hanwei Valve Co., Ltd (Hanwei Valve).  Hanwei Valve purchased a valve with the plan to reverse engineer the product but, because of intellectual property concerns, intentionally disguised the payments for the valve in its books and records as Value Added Tax (VAT) payments purportedly made to the local tax authorities., The Commissions complaint alleges that China Valves, Fang, Wang, and Tang violated antifraud provisions of the securities laws in Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5(b). The complaint further alleges that China Valves violated reporting, recordkeeping and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws, Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13.  Finally, the complaint alleges that Fang, Wang, and Tang falsely certified that China Valvess filings contained no material misstatements in violation of Exchange Act Rule 13a-14, and aided and abetted China Valvess violations of the reporting and books and records provisions., The Commission also announced today the temporary suspension, pursuant to Section 12(k) of the Exchange Act, of trading in the securities of China Valves, at 9:30 a.m. EDT on September 29, 2014, and terminating at 11:59 p.m. EDT on October 10, 2014.

Also listed in the complaint as relief defendants were Nancy Gainer, NATG, LLC, Kelly Hood, and Turnbury Consulting Group, LLC. , The SECs complaint alleges that Grant and Abdallah marketed KGTA to investors as a petroleum company that earns profits by buying and reselling crude oil and refined fuel products. The complaint further alleges that they told investors that they had relationships with third-party purchasers and that they would use investor funds to buy fuel at a discount that would then be sold at a substantial profit.  The complaint goes on to allege that Grant and Abdallah helped convince prospective investors to invest by promising an important safeguard: the investment funds and the returns would flow through an escrow account monitored by attorney Mark George, who acted as the escrow agent.  , The SECs complaint alleges that the KGTA oil business was a sham and the escrow safeguard was a mirage. In reality, the complaint alleges, Grant and Abdallah operated KGTA as a Ponzi scheme, George never followed the promised escrow procedures, and KGTA did not generate revenue through the purchase and resale of oil products., The SECs Complaint also alleges that Grant and Abdallah sold the fraudulent investments through Jeffrey Gainer and Jerry Cicolani - two registered representatives with a Cleveland-based broker-dealer. The complaint alleges that Defendants Gainer and Cicolani committed their own violations of federal securities law including selling away and selling unregistered securities.  The complaint also alleges that Gainer and Cicolani committed fraud by recklessly selling KGTA investments despite glaring red flags that signaled that KGTA was a scam, and by hiding from investors the fact that they were being paid enormous fees by KGTA to sign up investors.  The complaint alleges that Gainer and Cicolani received over $6 million for their sales efforts.

Sullivan of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York issued an opinion and order imposing financial sanctions of more than $29.6 million on Lee Cole and Linden Boyne, the former CEO and CFO of Electronic Game Card Inc. (EGMI)., The Commissions complaint, filed in November 2012, alleged that Cole and Boyne orchestrated a fraudulent scheme in which EGMI enticed investors by claiming, among other things, that it had millions of dollars in annual revenue, millions of dollars in investments, and an off-shore bank account worth more than $10 million. In fact, many of EGMIs purported contracts were phony, the purported investments were actually in related-party entities affiliated with Cole or Boyne, and the bank account did not exist. Cole and Boyne bolstered these lies by providing falsified documents to the companys outside auditors. As a result of these and other false statements, EGMIs outstanding common stock was once valued as high as $150 million. The company subsequently filed for bankruptcy protection and its stock is now worthless. While they were making material misrepresentations to inflate EGMIs stock price, Cole and Boyne funneled millions of shares of EGMI stock to entities based in Gibraltar that they secretly controlled. They directed the Gibraltar-based entities to sell the shares, reaping proceeds of more than $12.3 million. , In August 2013 and based upon Coles and Boynes failure to comply with multiple court orders, Judge Sullivan entered default judgment against Cole and Boyne with respect to each of the Commissions 14 claims against them. Granting a motion for relief made by the Commission, Judge Sullivans recent order holds Cole and Boyne jointly and severally liable for disgorgement of $12,345,908.74 plus $2,324,842.25 in prejudgment interest and requires each to pay a civil penalty of $7,500,000.00.

According to the complaint, Villarreal told investors that their money was to be used to make private equity investments in companies in the petroleum, steel, and other industries in Mexico.  Villarreal lied to these investors about the success of a previous fund he operated, lied in saying that he used their money to purchase and profitably operate a Mexican pipeline manufacturer, and lied by telling investors that Fund III had ownership interests in several U.S. and Mexican drilling companies.  Villarreal instead used $7.4 million of Fund III assets to trade in publicly traded securities in a brokerage account-contrary to his representations to investors-and sustained heavy losses, and also stole $5.8 million for himself.  By November 2011, Fund III was essentially insolvent., The Commissions complaint also alleges that, between August 2010 and March 2011, Villarreal conducted a second fraudulent offering, known as the Standard Asset Management Fund I, (SAM Fund), which raised $9 million from 11 investors, six of whom had previously invested in Fund III.  According to the complaint, Villarreal told these investors that the SAM Fund would invest in companies listed on the Mexican stock exchange.  Villarreal made numerous misrepresentations to these investors.  Among other things, Villarreal repeated his earlier lies about Fund II and Fund IIIs purported acquisition and profitable operation of a Mexican pipeline manufacturer,  he stole at least $327,000 of SAM Fund assets, and Villarreals trading was a massive failure, resulting in an 83% loss for the SAM Fund., The complaint also alleges that Villarreal defrauded the SAM Fund investors between March 2012 and May 2012 by offering to exchange limited partnership units he claimed he owned in Fund III for the SAM Fund investors limited partnership units in the SAM Fund.  Eight SAM Fund investors accepted Villarreals offer and exchanged their SAM Fund units, which they had purchased for a total of $3.1 million.

Puglisi and Progressive are defendants in a state court litigation brought by CMS Life Insurance Opportunity Fund, L.P. (which is also a respondent in the subpoena enforcement action) and CNF II Partners, in which it is alleged that Puglisi and Progressive-instead of safeguarding certain investments they were retained to make-had been stealing the investments and selling them for their own benefit.  As set forth in the Commissions Application, the staff of the Commissions Philadelphia Regional Office is investigating whether there were misstatements and omissions related to the use of investor funds and the profitability, safety, value, and existence of assets purportedly owned by CMS Life Insurance Opportunity Fund and others., Among other things, the subpoena enforcement action was filed because, despite the issuance of administrative subpoenas duces tecum to Puglisi and Progressive, they have not produced any documents and, thus, have not complied with the subpoenas.  Pursuant to its Application, the Commission is seeking an order from the federal district court compelling compliance with various subpoenas and for other relief.  The Commission notes that it is continuing to conduct a fact-finding inquiry and has not concluded that anyone has broken the law.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr23105.htm</i><br/>]"

Kelly of Levittown, Pennsylvania.  Kelly was the Chief Executive Officer of 8000, Inc., a now defunct Virginia-based company whose stock was quoted on OTC Pink operated by OTC Markets Group LLC.  Kelly and 8000, Inc. were defendants in a civil fraud action filed by the Commission on September 27, 2012.  Also charged were an undisclosed principal in 8000, Inc., Jonathan E. Bryant of Nantwich, United Kingdom, and the companys attorney, Carl N. Duncan of Bethesda, Maryland., The Commissions complaint alleged that the defendants participated in a scheme to manipulate the trading volume and price of 8000 Inc.s common stock by disseminating false information about the company and simultaneously selling, or facilitating the sale of its securities which were not for sale to the general public.  According to the complaint, from November 2009 through October 2010, Kelly and Bryant disseminated financial reports and press releases falsely representing that 8000, Inc. had millions of dollars in capital financing and revenues when, in fact, the company had neither.  As 8000, Inc.s stock price rose based on the false information they were disseminating, Bryant is alleged to have sold 56.8 million restricted shares of 8000, Inc. into the market with the assistance of Duncan who provided false legal opinions removing the restrictions, and Kelly to have bought and sold the companys securities in the secondary market.  The complaint alleged that the defendants scheme increased the volume of trading in 8000, Inc. by 93% and the companys stock price from less than $0.01 per share to $0.42 per share between November 2009 and October 2010., The Final Judgment orders Kelly to disgorge the $415,592 in profits that he realized from trading in 8000, Inc.s securities and to pay $ 46,697in pre-judgment interest.  The Final Judgment follows the Judgment that the court entered against Kelly on June 6, 2013, with Kellys consent and without him admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions Complaint.  That Judgment permanently enjoins Kelly from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The SEC alleged that the defendants raised more than $800 million from thousands of investors living primarily in Japan under the ruse that MRI was using their investments to buy medical accounts receivable from medical providers at a discount to recover their full value from insurance companies.  The SEC alleged that the defendants used the investments to pay back earlier investors, and that Fujinaga used investor funds for his own purposes, including to buy property and luxury cars.

The defendant, Anthony M. Knight co-founded iShop, and was formerly the Chairman of iShops Board of Directors.  He also served at various times as iShops Secretary and Chief Executive Officer.  The Commission had charged that from the fall of 1999 until the summer of 2000, iShop, Knight and others conducted a fraudulent securities offering scheme that defrauded over 350 investors who invested approximately $2.3 million.  iShop also failed to file any registration statement with the Commission as to the securities sold., United States District Judge Denis R.

Knight and others also made oral misrepresentations to investors to persuade them to invest in iShop stock.  Knight also supervised Scott W. Brockop, iShops former Vice President of Sales and Marketing, who oversaw an operation at iShop through which employees cold-called potential investors, and made material misrepresentations to induce them to purchase iShop stock.  Through the offering, iShop sold nearly 6.75 million shares of stock to over 350 investors, and obtained proceeds of approximately $2.3 million.  iShop did not file a registration statement for the sale of these securities, and there was no registration statement otherwise in effect., The Commission also charged iShop, Brockop, and Moussa Yeroushalmi a/k/a Mike Yeroush, iShops former President.  On October 26, 2006, the District Court entered a final judgment by default against Brockop, and on February 15, 2007, a Commission administrative law judge entered an order by default against Brockop barring him from association with any broker or dealer.  On January 21, 2011, the District Court entered a final judgment by consent against Yeroush.  On April 30, 2014, the District Court entered a final judgment by consent against iShop, leaving Knight as the sole remaining defendant in the litigation., The jury found that defendant Knight violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The Court found that McClain Sr. violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws by making misrepresentations and omissions and that McClain Sr. and McClain Jr. engaged in insider trading., The SEC filed this action against the defendants in August 2011, alleging that McClain Sr., McClain Jr., Immunosyn Corporation (Immunosyn) Argyll Biotechnologies, LLC (Argyll), Stephen D. Ferrone, and James T. Miceli (Miceli) committed securities fraud in connection with materially misleading statements during 2006-2010 regarding the status of regulatory approvals for Immunosyns sole product, a drug derived from goat blood referred to as SF-1019.

The complaint alleges that these statements misled investors because the statements omitted to disclose that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had already twice issued clinical holds on drug applications for SF-1019, which prohibited clinical trials involving SF-1019 from occurring.  , After completion of discovery, the SEC moved for summary judgment, and for partial summary judgment, respectively, against McClain Sr. and McClain Jr.  In granting the SECs motion for summary judgment, the Court found that McClain Sr. committed securities fraud by taking money from investors and failing to deliver Immunosyn shares and by telling investors that Immunosyn would secure approval for SF-1019 from the FDA in about a year and that the U.S. Department of Defense had purchased SF-1019.

The complaint alleges that the business that Subaye had presented to investors and described in filings with the Commission was imaginary and non-existent., The complaint further alleged that Crane signed Subayes materially misleading filings with the Commission that contained false statements about Subayes revenues, business, number of employees, and number of paying customers.  According to the complaint, Crane also falsified the books, records, and accounts of Subaye and provided false information to Subayes outside auditors.  The Commissions complaint also charged Crane with violating a bar from the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB).  According to the complaint, in January 2011, Crane and his Cambridge, Massachusetts-based accounting firm were sanctioned by the PCAOB, which permanently revoked his firms registration and barred him from being associated with a registered accounting firm or being associated with any public company in an accounting or financial management capacity.  The complaint allege that, in violation of the January 2011 PCAOB order, Crane remained as the CFO of Subaye until March 2011, even after the PCAOB denied his request to remain as Subayes CFO for those two months., Crane consented to the injunction and penalty components of the final judgment.  The court determined the length of the officer and director bar after considering the filings in the case.  The final judgment permanently enjoins Crane from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder, and Section 105(c)(7)(B) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and from aiding and abetting any violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, thereunder, and orders Crane to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.

Slawson was initially tipped with nonpublic information about Carters by a hedge fund investment consultant named Dennis Rosenberg, who received the inside information from a Carters executive.  Slawson later communicated directly with that executive: Eric Martin, who at the time was vice president and director of investor relations., The SEC alleges that based on the illegal tips that Slawson received from Rosenberg and Martin, his insider trading in Carters stock generated more than $500,000 in profits or avoided losses., The SECs complaint alleges that Slawson violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws: Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5. The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement with prejudgment interest and civil monetary penalties pursuant to Section 21A of the Exchange Act.  , Previously, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Northern District of Georgia <a href=http://www.justice.gov/usao/gan/press/2014/05-29-14c.html> announced that a grand jury had indicted Slawson</a> and charged him with one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and wire fraud, 25 counts of securities fraud, and nine counts of wire fraud, based on substantially similar conduct as alleged in the SECs complaint.

The SEC <a href=http://www.sec.gov/News/PressRelease/Detail/PressRelease/1370543164784#.VE6iT2PgdnM>charged his source of information earlier this month.</a> , The SEC alleges that David Post of Livingston, N.J., was tipped with confidential details about the impending deals by his former business school classmate who was tasked with evaluating potential acquisitions in his financial analyst job at a major pharmaceutical company.  Post and his friend, Zachary Zwerko, used prepaid burner cell phones to exchange coded text messages in advance of Posts trading.  They also used a dummy e-mail account they could both access to draft an e-mail message in code and leave it in the draft folder for the other to read and then delete.  In exchange for the illegal tips, Post paid Zwerko $7,000 at a Halloween party following his profitable trading in 2012, and gave him $50,000 in a shoebox when Zwerko visited his home after additional insider trading occurred earlier this year. , The U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York announced parallel insider trading cases against Post on October 24, 2014 and against Zwerko earlier this month., According to the SECs amended complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Post traded on the basis of confidential details about two acquisition targets of the pharmaceutical company where Zwerko then worked.  The insider trading first occurred in 2012 when Zwerko learned his employer was among several other pharmaceutical companies in a competitive bidding process for Ardea Biosciences Inc.  In the several weeks leading up to Ardeas public announcement, Post received regular updates from Zwerko about the status of confidential negotiations and purchased $227,000 worth of Ardea securities - the most he had ever invested in a single company.  Post had never before purchased Ardea securities.  After Ardea publicly announced that it had accepted an acquisition bid and its stock price rose by 51 percent, Post sold all of his shares and reaped profits of approximately $105,000. , The SEC further alleges that Zwerko tipped Post with confidential details about his employers nonpublic negotiations to acquire Idenix Pharmaceuticals Inc. earlier this year.  Although not directly involved in the deal, Zwerko accessed confidential files in the companys database during the negotiations and gleaned additional nonpublic information in his communications with others at the company.  Post, who had never before purchased Idenix securities, made purchases totaling $219,000 from May 21 to June 6.  After a public announcement was made on June 9, Post sold his Idenix securities for a profit of approximately $579,000. , The SECs amended complaint charges Zwerko and Post with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.

The Commission alleged in its complaint that AutoChina International Limited, a China-based company whose stock traded in the U.S., and others, including the above ten against whom judgments were recently entered, orchestrated a market manipulation scheme to create the false appearance of a liquid and active market for AutoChinas stock.  Among other things, each of these ten defendants has been ordered to pay a penalty of $150,000., The Commissions enforcement action, filed April 11, 2012, alleged that AutoChina senior executive and director Hui Kai Yan and others, including the ten defendants against whom judgments were just entered, fraudulently traded AutoChinas stock to boost its daily trading volume in order to create the appearance of liquidity of AutoChinas stock and thereby enhance the companys ability to get much-needed financing.  Starting in October 2010, the defendants and others deposited more than $60 million into U.S.-based brokerage accounts and engaged in hundreds of fraudulent trades over the next three months through these accounts and accounts with a Hong Kong-based broker-dealer.  The complaint alleged that the fraudulent trades included matched orders, where one account sold shares to another account at the same time and for the same price, and wash trades, which resulted in no change of beneficial ownership of the shares.  According to the complaint, AutoChina and the other defendants engaged in the scheme after lenders offered AutoChina unfavorable terms for a stock-backed loan due to low trading volume in its stock., The SEC complaint alleged that in the three months before the defendants opened the U.S.-based brokerage accounts, the average daily trading volume of AutoChinas stock was approximately 18,000 shares.  From November 1, 2010 through January 31, 2011, the average daily trading volume increased to more than 139,000 shares.  On some days, the defendants and related accounts trading accounted for as much as 70% of the trading of AutoChinas stock., The U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts entered the final judgments by default against ten defendants on October 27, 2014.  The final judgments enjoin Rui Ge Dong, Victory First Limited, Rainbow Yield Limited, Yong Qi Li, Ai Xi Ji, Ye Wang, Zhong Wen Zhang, Li Xin Ma, Yong Li Li, and Shu Ling Li from violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 9(a)(1), 9(a)(2), and 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders each of them to pay a civil penalty of $150,000., The judgments entered on October 27, 2014 bring the Commissions case to a conclusion against all defendants in this case.  The court previously entered final judgments by consent against defendants AutoChina and Hui Kai Yan in June 2014 that, among other things, ordered AutoChina to pay a civil penalty of $4.35 million and Yan to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, and barred Yan permanently from acting an officer or director of a public company., For further information, see Lit.

Coughlin and two entities, OICU Ltd. and OICU Investments Corp., that did business as Oxford International Credit Union or Oxford International Cooperative Union.  The SEC charged the defendants with defrauding thousands of investors who collectively suffered millions of dollars in losses by investing in a fictitious, offshore credit union., Pursuant to the judgments docketed on October 30, 2014, the court ordered OICU Ltd. and OICU Investments Corp., jointly and severally, to pay disgorgement of $10,053,234 plus prejudgment interest thereon of $1,466,479, and to each pay a civil penalty of $775,000, enjoined Coughlin and the two entities from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer or sale of any security, permanently barred Coughlin from acting as an officer or director of any public company, and permanently enjoined Coughlin and the two entities from violations of the registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The judgment against Coughlin did not order monetary relief  in consideration of the forfeiture, restitution and incarceration to which he was sentenced in the parallel criminal action, US v. Coughlin, Crim. No. 1:14-CR-221 (E.D. Va.).  On October 24, 2014, Coughlin was sentenced to 90 months imprisonment and three years of supervised release and ordered to pay restitution of $10,084,625.

According to the SECs complaint, to facilitate and further the fraud, the defendants posted false information to members online accounts to create the appearance that their deposits were earning substantial daily investment returns.  The Oxford International Credit Union website, for example, showed investors that their deposits were purportedly earning investment returns that averaged, during the January 2007 through December 2009 period, 0.471% compounded daily.  The credit union, however, was a fiction, and the defendants did not actually make investments with the members deposits sufficient to generate the returns they boasted.  Coughlin and Oxford International Credit Union also falsely claimed that member accounts were insured by a private insurance company.  , The SECs complaint further alleged that, beginning in December 2008, Coughlin began operating a successor to Oxford International Credit Union, called Oxford International Cooperative Union.  Oxford International Cooperative Unions website also boasted bogus investment returns from its inception in late 2008 through December 2011.  , For further information, please see Litigation Release Number 22972 (April 11, 2014).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr23123.htm</i><br/>]"

According to the Commissions complaint, since at least 2006, Defendants have engaged in a fraudulent shell factory scheme through which they formed and promoted at least eight public shell companies, four of which they have sold in reverse merger transactions and four of which remained under the control of the Smiths during the course of their scheme.  Simultaneously with filing the complaint, the Commission has issued an order that temporarily suspends trading in the four companies they continued to control., The SEC alleges that the Smiths carried out the scheme by renting legitimate operating companies from small business owners in exchange for the promise of additional financing through an initial public offering (a/k/a an IPO).  The Smiths then installed the small business owners as nominal officers and directors of the public shell companies that they secretly controlled.  They funded the IPOs by soliciting their friends, family and affiliates to buy shares in the now-public shell companies.  However, contrary to promises made by the Smiths to the small business owners and to information disclosed to the public, most of the money raised in the IPOs was retained by the public shell companies instead of being used to finance the operating companies.  The SEC also alleges that to further their scheme, the Smiths caused the small business owners to submit materially false and misleading registration statements and periodic reports to the SEC.  These false documents gave the public companies the appearance of legitimacy, which allowed the Smiths to sell the public shells for a higher value in the reverse merger transaction.  The Smiths received significant cash proceeds and stock from these reverse merger transactions, while the small business owners were left with little or no benefit from their association with the Smiths., The SECs complaint charges Charles Smith with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the Securities Act) and Sections 10(b), 13(b)(5) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 15(d) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13, 13b2-2, 15d-1, and 15d-13 thereunder.  The SECs complaint also charges Mark Smith with violating Section 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act and Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1, and with aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 15(d) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13, 13b2-2, 15d-1, and 15d-13 thereunder., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, the Smiths have consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the applicable provisions of the federal securities laws, orders them to pay disgorgement plus prejudgment interest totaling $78,750.52, orders that Charles Smith pay a civil penalty of $150,000 and be subject to five-year officer and director and penny stock bars, and orders that Mark Smith pay a civil penalty of $50,000 and be subject to a three-year penny stock bar.  The settlement remains subject to court approval., Simultaneously with filing its Complaint, the Commission has issued an order temporarily suspended trading in the securities of the four public shell companies the Smiths have not sold in reverse merger transactions-(Hall Tees, Inc.

Afsarpour, a restaurant owner in the United Kingdom, traded on the inside tips that Sabrdaran communicated to him about the progress of Esbriets EU marketing application by purchasing securities in his own accounts and using money obtained from friends to trade on their behalf., According to the SECs complaint filed yesterday in U.S. District Court in the Northern District of California, InterMune submitted its marketing application to the European Medicines Agency in March 2010.  While in possession of material nonpublic information received from Sabrdaran, Afsarpour placed orders in early December 2010 through a UK-based spread betting firm to buy spread bets on InterMune securities.  A spread bet is purchased from a counterparty in order to have the opportunity to profit from changes in the price of an underlying asset, which in this case was InterMune common stock and call options being traded on U.S. exchanges.  Besides the spread bet orders, Afsarpour also bought InterMune common stock., The SECs complaint alleges that Afsarpour urged approximately a dozen friends to purchase InterMune securities, and some gave him money that he used to buy spread bets on their behalf through his personal account.  Afsarpour also tipped two other friends who traded on their own.  InterMune announced in mid-December 2010 that the EMA advisory subcommittee assessing the application had issued a positive opinion for Esbriet, causing InterMunes stock and options prices to soar., The SECs complaint charges Sabrdaran and Afsarpour with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.

Berman, United States District Court Judge for the Southern District of New York, entered on October 30, 2014 an order that modified the Order of Preliminary Injunction, Asset Freeze, and Other Ancillary Relief that the Court had entered on July 14, 2014 to authorize the payment of certain expenses and the redemption of investors investments in Aphelion US Fund, LP and Aphelion Offshore Fund, Ltd. (collectively, the Funds)., The order authorizes Funds administrator, Pinnacle Canada Fund Administration, Ltd. (Pinnacle), to distribute $5,562,135.55 to investors in the Funds on a ratable basis in accordance with their respective account balances and $72,333.78 to service providers to cover due and owing expenses which are appropriately payable under the terms of the Funds organizational documents.  The order also authorizes the Funds to hold a total of $615,525.29 in cash as a reserve to address uncertain future expenses.  This $615,525.29 shall remain frozen pending further order of the Court. , As previously announced, on May 5, 2014, the SEC filed fraud charges and sought emergency relief against Aphelion, Aphelions chief investment officer, Vineet Kalucha, and Aphelions chief financial officer, George Palathinkal. The SECs complaint alleges that Kalucha fraudulently altered an outside audit firms report reviewing the performance of an investment account he managed, that Palathinkal allegedly learned about Kaluchas falsifications, which essentially changed an investment loss into a major investment gain in the account, and that the falsified report showing the phony gain instead of the actual loss was distributed to prospective investors. The complaint further alleges that investors were separately provided false information about Aphelions assets under management and Kuluchas litigation history, and that Kalucha allegedly siphoned investor proceeds for his luxury car payments and settlements of legal actions against him personally that are unrelated to Aphelion., For further information, please see Litigation Release Number LR-22988 (May 9, 2014) [SEC Announces Charges and Asset Freeze Against Hedge Fund Advisory Firm Distributing Falsified Performance Results], Litigation Release Number LR-22994 (May 16, 2014) [Court Extends Asset Freeze and Temporary Restraining Order], Litigation Release Number LR-23030 (June 24, 2014) [Court Modifies and Extends Asset Freeze and Temporary Restraining Order],  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr23126.htm</i><br/>]"
23127,2014,[<h3>Judgments Entered Against Company and CEO in Securities Kickback Scheme</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on October 31, 2014, the federal court in Boston, Massachusetts, entered judgments by consent against Oklahoma corporation MicroHoldings US, Inc., and its Chief Executive Officer, James Wheeler of Camas, Washington, in a fraud action that was filed in December 2011.  The fraud involved a kickback scheme that was exposed by an undercover operation of the Federal Bureau of Investigations Boston office.  Among other things, MicroHoldings and Wheeler were permanently enjoined from violating an antifraud statute, and Wheeler was held liable for disgorgement of $24,000 of ill-gotten gains and permanently barred from serving as an officer or director of public companies or participating in offerings of penny stock., MicroHoldings and Wheeler are two of several parties charged on December 1, 2011, by both the Commission and the U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts, alleging that they used kickbacks and other schemes to trigger investments in various thinly-traded stocks.  According to the Commissions complaint, the schemes involved secret kickbacks to an investment fund representative in exchange for having the investment fund buy stock in certain companies; the kickbacks were to be concealed through the use of sham consulting agreements.  What the participants in the scheme did not know was that the purported investment fund representative was actually an undercover agent of the FBI. , The Commissions complaint alleged that in May 2011, Wheeler met with an individual who purported to be a Boston, Massachusetts-based representative of a major hedge fund.  In fact, the hedge fund representative was an undercover FBI agent.  The complaint alleged that Wheeler and the hedge fund representative agreed to a scheme whereby the hedge fund would purchase $5 million of MicroHoldings stock in return for the payment of kickbacks to the hedge fund representative.  Wheeler and the hedge fund representative agreed to structure the transaction in such a way that it would avoid detection by the hedge funds compliance personnel and securities regulators.  Among other things, they agreed to structure the transaction into smaller tranches of securities purchases, and to make the kickback payments to the hedge fund representative through a shell corporation pursuant to a consulting agreement to make it appear that the kickback payments were compensation for consulting services.  The complaint alleged that, in May and June 2011, MicroHoldings and Wheeler followed through by entering agreements whereby the hedge fund purchased a total of $48,000 worth of MicroHoldings stock and kickbacks totaling $24,000 were funneled back to the hedge fund representative.  , In the related criminal action, Wheeler was sentenced on January 16, 2014 to 18 months of probation and was ordered to forfeit $24,000 after pleading guilty on January 18, 2012 to one count of mail fraud and one count of conspiracy. , The judgments in the Commissions action, to which MicroHoldings and Wheeler consented, permanently enjoin MicroHoldings and Wheeler from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The judgment as to Wheeler holds him liable for $24,000 in disgorgement, but deems his disgorgement satisfied by the forfeiture order for the same amount of money in the related criminal action.  The judgment also prohibits Wheeler from acting as an officer or director of any issuer that has a class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act or that is required to file reports pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, and prohibits Wheeler from participating in any offering of penny stock, pursuant to Section 21(d)(6) of the Exchange Act., The Commission suspended trading in the stock of MicroHoldings on December 1, 2011. , The Commissions case against Edward Henderson, also charged on December 1, 2011 as a result of the FBI undercover operation, remains pending.   Judgments by consent were entered again Michael Lee and ZipGlobal Holdings, Inc. on September 4, 2014 and against Paul Desjourdy on September 11, 2014.  , For further information, see Litigation Release No. 22177 (December 2, 2011) (Complaints); Exchange Act Release No. 65857 (December 1, 2011) (trading suspensions); Litigation Release No. 23002 (May 23, 2014) (Wheeler and others sentenced in parallel criminal actions); Litigation Release No. 23078 (September 4, 2014) (judgment by consent against Lee and ZipGlobal); and Litigation Release No. 23082 (September 12, 2014) (judgment by consent against Desjourdy). ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr23127.htm</i><br/>]"
23129,2014,[<h3>SEC Charges California Lawyer and Two Massachusetts Men Behind Scheme to Manipulate Stock of Sports Ticket Broker</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission has charged an attorney in Orange County, California, and two men in Massachusetts behind a pump-and-dump scheme that defrauded investors in a Boston-based ticket brokering business., The SEC alleges that Richard Weed, a partner in a Newport Beach law practice, facilitated a scheme to pump and dump the stock of CitySide Tickets Inc., which he helped structure into a publicly traded company through reverse mergers.  Weed created backdated promissory notes and authored false legal opinion letters that enabled Thomas Brazil and Coleman Flaherty to obtain millions of purportedly unrestricted shares of stock in the company.  Investors were then blitzed with a false and misleading promotional campaign touting CitySide Tickets as a budding national leader on the verge of acquiring smaller ticket firms across the country and positioning itself as an attractive takeover target for Ticketmaster.  As the companys stock price increased on the false hype, Brazil and Flaherty sold their shares to unsuspecting investors for illicit proceeds of approximately $3 million, and Weed was well-compensated for his role in the scheme.  Shortly thereafter, the market for CitySide Tickets stock collapsed and the company eventually went out of business., In a parallel case, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the District of Massachusetts has announced criminal actions against Weed, Brazil, and Flaherty., According to the SECs complaint filed in federal court in Boston, all of the false promotions painted a rosy, optimistic picture of a company that was actually in dire financial straits.  For example, one promotional alert falsely claimed that CitySide Tickets was in the process now of swallowing up 5 smaller ticket resellers that could send next years profits through the roof.  In reality, CitySide Tickets lacked the means for such acquisitions.  The alert further embellished that the companys growth from purportedly swallowing up smaller fish in the ticket-selling market would make CitySide Tickets an irresistible takeover target for Ticketmaster, the biggest fish of all.  The alert estimated that a Ticketmaster acquisition of CitySide Tickets could easily jump this under-50-cent stock to $2.50 - $3.50 overnight., The SECs complaint alleges that all defendants violated the antifraud provisions of the securities laws in Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder, and Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act).  The complaint further alleges that Weed aided and abetted Brazils and Flahertys violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and that Weed also violated Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder as well as Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act.  Finally, the complaint charges all defendants with violations of Section 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act.  As relief, the SEC seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus pre-judgment interest and penalties as well as penny stock bars and permanent injunctions against further violations of the securities laws.  The SEC also seeks to bar Weed from serving as an officer or director of any public company.  Weed lives in Newport Beach, California; Brazil lives in Topsfield, Massachusetts, and Flaherty lives in Hingham, Massachusetts., The SECs investigation was conducted by Andrew J. Palid and Mark Albers of the SECs Boston Regional Office and supervised by Michele T. Perillo.  The SECs litigation will be led by Martin F. Healey.  SEC attorney Eric A.

Bray (Bray) was arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and charged by a criminal complaint with participating in an insider trading conspiracy for trading in the stock of Wainwright Bank &amp; Trust Company (Wainwright) based on a tip he received from a friend., The Commission previously charged Bray and J. Patrick ONeill (ONeill) with insider trading in a civil action filed on August 18, 2014.  The criminal charges are based on the same conduct underlying the SECs action. The SECs complaint alleged that ONeill, a former senior vice president at Eastern Bank Corporation, learned through his job responsibilities that his employer was planning to acquire Wainwright.  According to the SECs complaint, ONeill tipped Bray, a friend and fellow golfer with whom he socialized at a local country club.  In the two weeks preceding a public announcement about the planned acquisition, Bray sold his shares in other stocks to accumulate funds he used to purchase 31,000 shares of Wainwright. After the public announcement of the acquisition caused Wainwrights stock price to increase nearly 100 percent, Bray sold all of his shares during the next few months for nearly $300,000 in illicit profits., The Commission also announced that on October 31, 2014, the United States Attorneys Office for the District of Massachusetts filed a criminal Information against ONeill.  The criminal Information charges ONeill with one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud.  ONeill was initially charged by a criminal complaint when he was arrested in August 2014., The SECs action, which is pending, seeks injunctions against each of the defendants from further violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, and civil penalties., For further information, see Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr23070.htm>23070</a> (August 18, 2014) [Civil Complaint]. ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr23131.htm</i><br/>]"

The agency also charged a former stockbroker for participating in the scheme., The SEC alleges that Wilfred T. Azar III sold investors purported bonds in his company Empire Corporation, which he touted as a successful and profitable business with the resources to pay promised annual returns of 10 percent.  Along with Joseph A. Giordano, Azar and his company raised more than $7 million by making these and other false and misleading statements exaggerating the safety and low risk of the bonds.  However, Empire Corporation was functionally insolvent in reality, and despite saying investor funds would be used for various corporate purposes, Azar used the money to pay personal expenses as well as thousands of dollars in compensation to Giordano for participating in the fraud.  Giordano also steered a mutual fund that he managed into purchasing the bonds despite knowing the company was nearly broke.  The scheme collapsed when they were unable to recruit new investors to fund Empire Corporations operations and repay existing investors, who did not receive their promised returns and lost substantially all of their investments., In a parallel case, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the District of Maryland today announced criminal charges against Azar., The SECs complaint filed in federal court in Baltimore charges Empire Corporation, Azar, and Giordano with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 as well as Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.

Noel in federal district court in San Francisco, the deceptive press releases about his company YesDTC Holdings touted exclusive distribution rights, licensing agreements, and certain products purportedly certified by the government.  Noels promotional campaigns based on such false information caused a spike in YesDTCs thinly-traded stock and enabled him to dump millions of his own shares for a profit.

These materials, which Anguka and Ghaznawi posted on the internet under fake and assumed names, made false and misleading statements about Forum, fabricated quotes and buy recommendations from stock analysts who did not cover the company, and claimed that a fictitious entity named Welsson Financial Media funded the promotion.  At the same time, the complaint alleges, Clozza caused Forum to issue press releases that made false and misleading statements about the company, including the launch and success of a non-existent bond offering.  The defendants scheme caused significant increases in the trading volume and price of Forum stock - from $0.36 per share on a volume of 15,000 shares to $1.90 on a volume of 254,000 shares - from which Clozzas relatives and associates, including Dunn, profited by selling more than one million shares in the public markets., The Commissions complaint alleges that Forum, Clozza, Dunn, Anguka, and Ghaznawi violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, that Anguka and Ghaznawi violated Section 17(b) of the Securities Act of 1933 and that Dunn aided and abetted those violations, and that Forum violated Section 13(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 13a-1 thereunder.

Scipione and his business partner solicited investors to establish accounts at their company called Traders Café for the purposes of day trading, which entails the rapid buying and selling of stocks throughout the day in hope that the stock values continue climbing or falling for the seconds to minutes they own them so they can lock in quick profits.  Scipione touted Traders Cafés software trading platform and made a series of false misrepresentations to investors about low commissions and fees, high trading leverage, and safety of their assets.  More than $500,000 was raised from investors who were assured that funds invested with Traders Café would be segregated and used only for day trading or other specific business purposes.  However, many customers encountered technical service problems that prevented them from trading at all, and Scipione and his business partner squandered nearly all of the money in investor accounts for their personal use.  Meanwhile, Traders Café was never registered with the SEC as a broker-dealer as required under the federal securities laws., The SEC previously charged Scipiones business partner Matthew P. Ionno, who agreed to settle the case and <a href=/litigation/admin/2014/34-72859.pdf>has been barred from the securities industry</a>.  Financial penalties will be decided by the court at a later date., In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Middle District of Florida has announced that Scipione has pleaded guilty to criminal charges.  The U.S. Attorneys Office previously brought a criminal case against Ionno., According to the SECs complaint filed against Scipione in federal court in Tampa, customers across the country deposited approximately $367,000 with Traders Café from December 2012 to October 2013 with the intention of opening day trading accounts.  Traders Café also received approximately $150,000 from an investor who invested directly in Traders Cafés business. Customers encountered problems with Traders Café from the outset, and many of them cancelled their accounts and requested refunds of their remaining account balances.  Scipione and Ionno tried to cover up their fraudulent scheme by offering excuses and delays for why customers could not get refunds.  Eventually less than $1,200 remained in Traders Cafés accounts primarily due to the repeated misuse of investor funds by Scipione and Ionno. , The SECs complaint against Scipione alleges that he violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 as well as Section 15(a) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.

After creating demand for the stock and increasing the value, they sold their holdings at the higher prices and earned significant profits.  Once they stopped their promotional efforts, the demand for the stocks subsided and the prices dropped, leaving investors who had purchased the promotersâ shares with significant losses., The complaint alleges that the newsletters published by Thompson, Fung, and Van Nguyen misleadingly stated that they may or might sell shares they owned when in reality their intentions always were to sell the stocks they were promoting.  In fact, in some instances they already were selling the stocks to which they were saying may or might sell.  They also failed to fully disclose in their newsletters the amounts of compensation they were receiving for promoting the stocks, cloaking the fact that they were coordinating their promotion of the penny stocks to deliberately increase the prices and dump their own shares., According to the SECs complaint, the three promoters conducted five separate schemes that resulted in more than $10 million in ill-gotten gains.  The penny stocks they manipulated were Blast Applications Inc., Smart Holdings Inc., Blue Gem Enterprise Inc., Lyric Jeans Inc., and Mass Hysteria Entertainment Company Inc.  Thompson, who lives in Bethesda, Md., distributed several electronic penny stock promotion newsletters with such names as FreeInvestmentReport.com and OxofWallStreet.com.

The Court has scheduled a hearing to set the amount of restitution to be ordered on December 15, 2014.   Fisher, 44, of La Crescent, Minnesota, had previously pled guilty to two counts of wire fraud for his role in stealing over $1 million from 18 victims in an investment scam.  The U.S. Attorneys Office for the Central District of Florida filed criminal charges against Fisher on January 14, 2014.   Fisher was ordered to surrender on December 1, 2014, to begin serving his prison sentence., The criminal charges arose out of the same facts that were the subject of a settled civil enforcement action that the Commission filed against Fisher on September 30, 2013. The Commissions complaint alleges that from at least August 2009 through December 2012, Fisher raised approximately $1.04 million from approximately 18 investors who invested in unregistered securities offerings conducted by Fisher through his two companies.  Fisher offered investors the opportunity to invest their money through a special trading platform that supposedly generated significant returns.  Fisher told investors that their money would be deposited in an overseas bank account and used as collateral for the purchase and sale of collateralized debt obligations and medium term notes on the trading platform.   However, Fisher instead fraudulently misappropriated and converted investors funds for his personal use to pay previous investors, to purchase a house and car and to pay his daughters tuition and other personal and business expenses.  Fisher also provided quarterly statements to investors which falsely represented that investors were earning money on their investments.  The Commissions complaint alleged that Fisher and his companies violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The SEC also charged John Leonard, a salesman residing in Naples and Chicago, with acting as an unregistered broker in offering and selling the investment., The SEC alleges that between January 2010 and May 2011, the father-son duo of Paul and Jeffry Downey used Quest, an Albany, Texas-based oil and gas company, to fraudulently offer Quest preferred stock and limited partnership units in an entity called Permian Advanced Oil Recovery Investment Fund I, LP (PAOR).  Investors were told that PAOR would acquire working interests in oil and gas leases from Quest and receive revenue from those leases.  With assistance from unregistered salesman John Leonard, the Downeys raised $4.8 million from approximately 17 investors.  The PAOR offering was fraudulent on account of blatantly deceptive misstatements about Quest and PAOR.  More particularly, the Downeys made false statements in the private placement memorandum about the financial viability of Quest; the purchase debt and liens associated with certain leases in which PAOR was acquiring an interest; the current and projected petroleum production from the leases; the use of investor funds raised in the offering; independent audits of PAOR; and foreseeable litigation against Quest and the Downeys., On May 24, 2013, the U.

23154,2014,[<h3>California Attorney Indicted for Securities Fraud in Scheme to Manipulate Stock of Sports Ticket Broker</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that on December 4, 2014, Richard Weed (Weed), a partner in a Newport Beach, California law practice, was indicted on eleven criminal charges by a grand jury in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts in connection with an alleged pump-and-dump scheme that defrauded investors in a Boston-based ticket brokering business.  The indictment charges Weed with one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and wire fraud, one count of securities fraud, and nine counts of wire fraud.   , The allegations in the criminal indictment stem from the same misconduct underlying the Commissions pending action filed against Weed and two other defendants on November 6, 2014.  In that case, the SEC alleges that Weed facilitated a scheme to pump and dump the stock of CitySide Tickets Inc., which he helped structure into a publicly traded company through reverse mergers.  Weed created backdated promissory notes and authored false legal opinion letters that enabled Thomas Brazil and Coleman Flaherty to obtain millions of purportedly unrestricted shares of stock in the company.  Investors were then blitzed with a false and misleading promotional campaign touting CitySide Tickets as a budding national leader on the verge of acquiring smaller ticket firms across the country and positioning itself as an attractive takeover target for Ticketmaster.  As the companys stock price increased on the false hype, Brazil and Flaherty sold their shares to unsuspecting investors for illicit proceeds of approximately $3 million, and Weed was well-compensated for his role in the scheme.  Shortly thereafter, the market for CitySide Tickets stock collapsed and the company eventually went out of business., Weed was originally charged by a criminal complaint and arrested on November 6, 2014.  The SECs action, which is pending, seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus pre-judgment interest and penalties as well as penny stock bars and permanent injunctions against further violations of the securities laws.  The SEC also seeks to bar Weed from serving as an officer or director of any public company., For further information, see Litigation Release No. 23129 (November 7, 2014) [Civil Complaint].,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr23154.htm</i><br/>]"

Johnson, formerly a Managing Director of The NASDAQ Stock Market (NASDAQ), ordering Johnson to disgorge insider trading profits of $755,066.20, together with prejudgment interest thereon in the amount of $143,041.72, for a total payment of $898,107.92.  Johnson consented to the entry of the final judgment.  The Court previously had entered a judgment permanently enjoining Johnson from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, representing the full injunctive relief sought by the SEC in the same civil action., In its Complaint, filed in May 2011, the SEC had alleged that Johnson had unlawfully traded in advance of nine announcements of material nonpublic information involving NASDAQ-listed companies from August 2006 to July 2009.  According to the SECs Complaint, Johnson took advantage of both favorable and unfavorable information that was entrusted to him in confidence by NASDAQ and its listed companies, shorting stocks on several occasions and establishing long positions in other instances.  The SEC alleged that Johnson reaped illicit profits in excess of $755,000 from his illegal trading., On May 26, 2011, Johnson pleaded guilty to a federal criminal charge of securities fraud in a parallel criminal action arising out of certain of the conduct underlying the SECs action.  On August 12, 2011, Johnson was sentenced to forty-two months in prison and ordered to forfeit $755,066., Following the entry of the final judgment against Johnson, which provided for payment of full disgorgement with prejudgment interest, the SEC voluntarily dismissed its relief defendant claim against Johnsons wife, Dalila Lopez.

(SearchPath). , The Commissions complaint alleges that from at least September to December 2010, Furth engaged in a fraudulent broker bribery scheme designed to manipulate the market for SearchPath stock through matched trades.  The complaint also alleges that Furth entered into a kickback arrangement with an individual (Individual A) who claimed to represent a group of registered representatives with trading discretion over the accounts of wealthy customers.  Furth promised to pay a 30% kickback to Individual A and the registered representatives he represented in exchange for the purchase of up to $10-30 million of SearchPath stock., The Commissions complaint further alleges that on October 13-15 and December 6-10, in accordance with the illicit arrangement, Furth instructed Individual A to purchase approximately 52 million shares of SearchPath stock for a total of approximately $80,000. Furth gave Individual A detailed instructions concerning the size, price and timing of the orders.

23158,2014,[<h3>SEC Charges New Orleans Oil-And-Gas Company with Fraudulent Stock Manipulation</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a New Orleans-based oil-and-gas company and five executives with running a stock trading scheme in which they claimed to have struck oil in Belize in order to manipulate the price of the companys stock as they illegally sold restricted shares to the public., The SEC also charged a Houston-based attorney with facilitating the scheme by issuing false legal opinion letters that allowed free trading of the restricted company stock., According to the SECs complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Treaty Energy Corporation issued deceptive press releases touting drilling successes in Belize and Texas to induce investor demand for its unregistered stock, which was then illegally distributed to the public.  The SEC alleges that Treaty Energys founder Ronald Blackburn and four company officers — Andrew V. Reid, Bruce A. Gwyn, Lee C. Schlesinger, and Michael A. Mulshine — obtained at least $3.5 million in illicit profits from the scheme., The SECs complaint further alleges that Treaty Energys outside counsel Samuel Whitley abused his gatekeeper role and enabled the scheme by authoring improper legal opinion letters that allowed the company and its officers to illegally distribute unregistered stock to the public.  Whitley was aware that Blackburn was running the company and Treaty Energy was abusing registration rules under the federal securities laws.  Yet these facts did not deter him from issuing the opinion letters that allowed the scheme to proceed., According to the SECs complaint, the scheme had three basic components.  The first part began in January 2012 when Blackburn directed Treaty Energy to issue a press release claiming that its purported oil strike in Belize contained an estimated five to six million barrels of recoverable oil.  Treatys stock price shot up nearly 80 percent that day.  However, the Belize government publicly refuted Treaty Energys purported oil strike the very next day, calling the companys statement false and misleading and irresponsible.  The SEC alleges that despite Belizes denial, Blackburn and the companys officers continued to mislead investors by claiming that Belize was merely downplaying an actual oil strike for strategic reasons., The SEC alleges that the second part of the scheme entailed Treaty Energys failure to disclose in public filings from 2009 to 2013 that Blackburn — previously convicted of federal income tax evasion — actually controlled the company and was a de facto officer.  The SEC alleges that Reid, Gwyn, Schlesinger, and Mulshine all knew Blackburns true role at the company, but intentionally kept this fact out of its disclosures to conceal from the public that a convicted felon was in charge., According to the SECs complaint, the final part of the scheme got underway in November 2013 when Treaty Energy began offering investors working interests in a well in West Texas.  Investors were enticed with claims that the working interests were low-risk and expected to yield a return of 111.42 percent over a 10-year period.  The SEC alleges that Treaty Energy and its officers knew these claims were baseless because the well was producing only marginal amounts of oil.  In fact, the well produced 235 total barrels from October 2013 to October 2014., The SECs complaint charges Treaty Energy, Blackburn, Reid, Gwyn, Mulshine, and Schlesinger with securities fraud as well as violations of the registration and reporting violations of the federal securities laws.  The SEC seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest plus financial penalties as well as penny stock bars, officer-and-director bars, and permanent injunctions against them.  Reid and Gwyn are additionally charged with signing false certifications in Treaty Energys SEC filings, and Whitley is accused of securities registration violations., The SECs investigation was conducted by Samantha Martin, Keith Hunter, and Joann Harris of the Fort Worth Regional Office.

(Avon), a global beauty products manufacturer and seller, with failing to put in place controls that could have detected and prevented payments made to Chinese government officials by employees and consultants at an Avon Chinese subsidiary from 2004 through the third quarter of 2008.  In addition, Avons books and records failed to accurately record the details and purpose of the payments.  The SEC alleged that the conduct violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).  Avon has agreed to pay more than $67 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest to settle the SECs charges., The SECs complaint alleges that the Chinese subsidiary made $8 million worth of payments in cash, gifts, travel, and entertainment to various Chinese officials to gain access to officials drafting and implementing direct selling regulations in China, to be among the first allowed to test the regulations, to be the first to receive a direct selling license, and, subsequently to keep the clean corporate image required to retain the license.  Avon received approval to test direct selling in China in 2005, and in March 2006, it received the first direct selling business license., Through an internal audit report, Avon management learned in late 2005 of potential FCPA problems in China.  Management consulted an outside law firm, directed that reforms be instituted, and sent internal audit back to follow up.  However, ultimately, no such reforms were instituted at the Chinese subsidiary.  Avon began a full-blown internal investigation in 2008, after its CEO received a letter from a whistleblower in China., Some examples of payments alleged in the complaint include payments for travel within China or to the United States or Europe, corporate box tickets to the China Open tennis tournament, gifts of Louis Vuitton merchandise, Gucci bags, and Tiffany pens, and $1.65 million for meals and entertainment.  The complaint also alleges payments made to avoid fines or negative news articles that might have impacted Avons corporate image and affected the Chinese subsidiarys direct selling license.  In some instances, the payments were concealed by falsely recording the transactions as employee business expenses or as re-imbursement of a third-party vendor.  In other instances, the records for the payments set forth almost no detail at all.  The resulting books and records did not allow a reviewer to ascertain the government official or state-owned entities that received the payments or the purpose for which the payments were made., The SECs complaint charges Avon with violating Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 -- the books and records and internal controls provisions of the FCPA.  Avon consented to the entry of a proposed final judgment ordering the company to pay disgorgement of $52,850,000 in benefits resulting from the alleged misconduct, plus prejudgment interest of $14,515,013.13, permanently enjoining the company from violating Exchange Act Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B), and requiring the company to retain an independent compliance monitor to review its FCPA compliance program for a period of 18 months, followed by an 18-month period of self-reporting on its compliance efforts.  The settlement is subject to the approval of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York., In reaching the proposed settlement, the SEC took into account Avons cooperation and significant remedial measures, including its implementation of an enhanced compliance program and worldwide FCPA training., In related criminal proceedings, the U.S. Department of Justice and the United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York today announced a deferred prosecution agreement with Avon and criminal charges against Avons Chinese subsidiary.

Saranello who participated in a pump-and-dump scheme involving the stock of Rudy Nutrition, a now defunct Nevada corporation.  The SEC previously charged thirteen other individuals in the District of Nevada for engaging in this scheme to manipulate the stock of Rudy Nutrition that netted over $11 million in illicit profits., The SECs complaint against Saranello, also filed in the District of Nevada, alleges that he set up phony Panamanian companies and opened brokerage accounts that he and others used in the scheme.  According to the complaint, Saranello did so at the direction of Chad Smanjak, who sought to conceal his involvement in the scheme.  The complaint alleges that Saranello, Smanjak and others arranged for these companies to receive large blocks of purportedly unrestricted Rudy Nutrition stock.   The complaint charges that Saranello, Smanjak and others then sold that stock to the public after participants in the scheme had artificially inflated the price and volume of Rudy Nutrition stock through fraudulent touting and manipulative trading., The SECs complaint charges that Saranello violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Rules 10b-5(a) and 10b-5(c) thereunder.

They cold-called names from a list they maintained at Premier Links Inc. and used high-pressure sales tactics to convince seniors to invest in companies purportedly on the brink of conducting initial public offerings (IPOs).  They never disclosed to the investors that only a small fraction of the money would be transmitted to the promoted companies, and Premier Links diverted investor funds to other entities controlled by the sales representatives or other associates., According to the SECs complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, Premier Links has never been registered with the SEC as a broker-dealer as required under the federal securities laws to conduct this type of business with investors.  Premier Links, Malloy, Damon, and Ruffin fraudulently obtained at least $9 million from more than 300 investors across the country by building a relationship of purported trust and confidence with them.  In one particularly egregious example, Damon and Malloy spent months earning the trust of an elderly veteran in order to defraud him of $300,000.  In many instances, investors were provided with misleading account statements showing the shares they purportedly purchased as being held for safekeeping in their Premier Links accounts while awaiting the promised IPOs.  Yet transfer agent records for the relevant companies indicate that shares were never purchased for these investors.  Investor money was simply stolen instead., In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York filed criminal charges., The SECs complaint charges Premier Links, Malloy (who was company president from 2007 to 2012), Damon, and Ruffin with violating the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as well as the broker-dealer registration provisions of the Exchange Act.

These judgments enjoin Defendants from future violations of Sections 5(a), (c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10b of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.  The judgments further provide that upon motion of the Commission, the Court will set disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Defendants consented to the entry of these judgments without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions complaint., The Commissions complaint, filed on August 22, 2014, alleges that Zhunrize is operating as a pyramid scheme because its commission structure is based on the continual recruitment of new members, with the most lucrative returns dependent on the downline recruitment of other members through store sales irrespective of any product sales.  According to the complaint, Zhunrize has taken in approximately $105 million from approximately 77,000 investors since 2012., The Commissions complaint further alleges that in its promotional materials, Zhunrize touts the ability to earn commissions from the sale of products, both through the owners store and through downstream owners stores.  For example, a Zhunrize promotional video differentiates Zhunrize from other on-line multi-level marketing plans, claiming that Zhunrize has sustainability.  According to the video, the Zhunrize model will sustain itself because we will have millions more customers than distributors.  Later, the narrator in the video claims we have the Vendor Relationships, the Logistics, the Payment Gateways to reach millions of new customers each month.  The Commissions complaint also alleges that Zhunrize does not disclose, however, that to date substantially all of its revenue has comes from the sale of memberships (referred to as stores) and the corresponding monthly internet hosting fees associated with operating those stores, rather than the sale of products.  Indeed, Pan testified that the company currently derives 80-90% of its revenue from selling online stores and the monthly internet hosting fees for them, as opposed to actual products from these stores.

The signals were based on an algorithm, and F-Squared and Present used the signals to create a model portfolio of sector ETFs that could be rebalanced periodically as the signals changed.  They named the new product AlphaSector and launched the first index a month later.  AlphaSectors indexes quickly became the firms largest revenue source, and F-Squared went from losing money to becoming a highly profitable investment manager., The SEC alleges that while marketing AlphaSector into the largest active ETF strategy in the market, F-Squared falsely advertised a successful seven-year track record for the investment strategy based on the actual performance of real investments for real clients.  In reality, the algorithm was not even in existence during the seven years of purported performance success.  The data used in F-Squareds advertising was actually derived through backtesting, which is the application of a quantitative model to historical market data to generate a hypothetical performance during a prior period.  F-Squared and Present specifically advertised the investment strategy as not backtested.  Furthermore, the hypothetical data contained a substantial performance calculation error that inflated the results by approximately 350 percent., According to the SECs complaint against Present filed in federal court in Boston, he was responsible for F-Squareds advertising materials that were often posted on the company website and sent to clients and prospective clients.  Present also was responsible for the descriptions of AlphaSector in its filings with the SEC, and he certified the accuracy of those filings.  F-Squared and Present made the false and misleading statements about AlphaSector from September 2008 to September 2013.  The SEC alleges that they claimed AlphaSector was based on an investment strategy that had been used to invest client assets since April 2001.  Yet Present knew that the algorithm was not finalized until late summer 2008 when he devised rules for turning the signals into a model ETF portfolio and directed an assistant to calculate hypothetical returns for the portfolio going back to April 2001., The SEC further alleges that the F-Squared analyst who calculated the backtested AlphaSector performance inadvertently applied the buy/sell signals to the week preceding any ETF price change that the signals were based on.  The mistake carried the model portfolios backtested buy and sell decisions back in time one week, enabling the model to buy an ETF just before the price rose and sell an ETF just before the price fell.  The SEC alleges that the analyst tried to explain this possible calculation error to Present in late September 2008, yet F-Squared went on to advertise the inflated data for the next five years and overstated that AlphaSector significantly outperformed the S&amp;P 500 from April 2001 to September 2008., F-Squared consented to the entry of the order finding that it violated Sections 204, 206(1), 206(2), 206(4), and 207 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rules 204-2(a)(16), 206(4)-1(a)(5), 206(4)-7, and 206(4)-8.  The order also finds that F-Squared aided and abetted and caused certain mutual funds sub-advised by F-Squared to violation Section 34(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940.  F-Squared acknowledged that its conduct violated federal securities laws, and agreed to cease and desist from committing or causing violations of these provisions.  F-Squared agreed to retain an independent compliance consultant and pay disgorgement of $30 million and a penalty of $5 million. , The SECs complaint against Present alleges that he violated Sections 206(1), 206(2), 206(4), and 207 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8., The SECs investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Bill Donahue, Robert Baker, Jose Santillan, and John Farinacci of the Asset Management Unit as well as Rachel Hershfang, Frank Huntington, Mayeti Gametchu, Jennifer Cardello, and Rory Alex of the Boston Regional Office.
