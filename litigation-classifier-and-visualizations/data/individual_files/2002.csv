Bruce Acacio, Civil Action No. 2:01CV-1010ST</u>, The Commission filed a civil Complaint against R. Bruce Acacio, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of California Software Corp. alleging violations of certain provisions of the federal securities laws and seeking penalties.  The Complaint alleges that Acacio:  (1) violated the provisions of the federal securities laws which prohibit providing false and misleading information in the offer and sale of securities, falsifying the books and records of an issuer of securities and providing false information to auditors in connection with the audit of financial statements; and (2) aided and abetted California Softwares violations of the provisions of the federal securities laws which require issuers to file accurate annual and quarterly reports, maintain manually signed signature pages for reports filed with the Commission, and maintain books and records that accurately reflect a companys financial condition.  Simultaneously with the filing of the complaint, Acacio consented to the entry of an injunction enjoining him from future violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Rules 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 12b-11, 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.  Acacio also agreed to pay $30,000 in penalties in the action.  , The Complaint alleges that from September 1999 through May 2000, California Software filed periodic reports containing audited and unaudited financial statements overstating the companys revenues, earnings, assets and shareholders equity, primarily as a result of an improper revenue recognition practice utilized by the company.  It is further alleged that the overstatements of revenues and earnings were included in a private placement memorandum used in an offering of California Software stock that raised over $8.7 million.  It is further alleged that Acacio failed to sign and caused California Software to fail to maintain manually-signed signature pages, with respect to its filings with the Commission.  , It is alleged that until September 2000, California Software had recognized revenue upon shipment of the software to potential customers, whether or not persuasive evidence existed of an arrangement to purchase the software by the potential customer.  Finally it is alleged that in October 2000, California Software restated its financial statements for the year ended December 31, 1999 and for the quarter ended March 31, 2000, upon learning from newly-retained auditors that its revenue recognition practice did not comply with generally accepted accounting procedures. , ]"

Carter of the United States District Court for the Central District of California granted the Commissions motion for entry of default judgment and entered a Final Judgment Of Permanent Injunction And Other Relief Against Jerry A. Womack (Final Judgment).  Womack is enjoined from violating the registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Investment Advisers Act.  Under the terms of the Final Judgment, Womack is also required to pay disgorgement in the amount of $18,993,869.06, plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty in the amount of $110,000.   , In November 2000, the Commission charged Womack with committing securities fraud in offering and selling $19 million in securities to about 400 investors nationwide between August 1997 and June 1999.  Womack represented to investors that he would invest their money in the stock market pursuant to an investment strategy that he claimed to have developed and used successfully called the Womack Dow Principle.  He also represented to investors that, to implement his Womack Dow Principle, he had retained traders on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.  Additionally, Womack represented to investors that the trading activity was yielding profitable results.  , In fact, Womack utilized only about a quarter of the investors money for securities trading and suffered a net loss on that trading.  Womack misused the majority of investor funds for personal and unrelated expenses and to pay some investors their purported profits and principal.  Among other things, Womack used the funds to purchase homes, real property, artwork, jewelry and cars and to pay for his honeymoon, for cosmetic surgery for his wife and for his divorce settlement.  , In May 2001, Womack was convicted of wire fraud and money laundering in a criminal proceeding before the United States District Court for the Central District of California, arising out of the same facts as the Commissions case.

(Extreme Networks), a Santa Clara technology company, was acquiring Viasource Communications, Inc. (Viasource), a small Florida technology company.  The phony news caused Viasources stock price and volume to spike until the companies denied that an acquisition was planned.  , In its complaint, the Commission alleges that on October 8, 2001, Ned C. Sneiderman, of Louisville, Kentucky, posted a fake press release on a Yahoo Finance message board, which announced a cash tender offer by Extreme Networks for the shares of Viasource.  In the hour following the posting, Viasource stock doubled in price to $.22 per share, on volume of more than 950,000 shares, nearly seven times higher than the previous trading day.  The fraud artificially inflated Viasources market capitalization by almost $4.7 million.     , The complaint also alleges that Sneiderman purchased shares of Viasource stock minutes before he posted the false press release.  However, within an hour after the false posting, Extreme Networks and Viasource denied the existence of a tender offer, and trading in both stocks was halted temporarily, which prevented Sneiderman from realizing substantial profits from the fraud.  Both companies issued corrective press releases and, once trading was resumed, the price of Viasource shares dropped by almost 50% from the days high.  , The Commissions complaint charges that Sneiderman committed securities fraud in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.   The complaint seeks a permanent injunction against future violations and a monetary penalty from Sneiderman.   , ]"

Dec. 13, 2001)  , On December 13, 2001, as part of its real time enforcement initiative, the SEC filed an enforcement action to stop an ongoing fraud by Invest Better 2001 (IB2001), before having identified the individuals behind the scheme.  Today, the SEC amended its complaint to add Cole Bartiromo (Bartiromo), a 17-year-old high school student, who the SEC has now identified as a principal behind IB2001as well as an additional defendant.  In a settlement also announced today, the SEC is recovering from Bartiromo approximately $900,000 obtained from investors in the scheme.   , The Amended Complaint alleges that from at least November 1, 2001, through approximately December 15, 2001, Bartiromo, through IB2001, raised more than $1 million from more than 1,000 investors through the offer of purportedly guaranteed and risk-free investment programs in which IB2001 pooled investor funds to bet on sporting events, and promised to repay investors between 125% to 2500% of their principal within specified periods ranging from three days to several weeks, depending on the program selected.  The Amended Complaint alleges that in December 2001, Bartiromo transferred approximately $900,000 of investor funds to an account he controls at a casino in Costa Rica.    , The Amended Complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges the defendants with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Also today, the Court issued a partial final judgment and order, on consent, which permanently enjoins Bartiromo and IB2001, directs Bartiromo and IB2001 to repatriate all assets outside the United States and deposit such assets into the Courts account, freezes Bartiromos and IB2001s assets, directs Bartiromo and IB2001 to provide an accounting, and grants other expedited and equitable relief.  , The Amended Complaint names as defendants:, , , , According to the Amended Complaint:    , Since at least November 1, 2001, through approximately December 15, 2001, Bartiromo, through the IB2001 website and bulletin board, offered investments into four Investment Programs:  (a) the 125% 3 Day Ongoing Program, through which IB2001 promised a supposed 125% return after a three-day investment; (b) the 250% 1 Week Ongoing Program, through which IB2001 guaranteed a supposed 250% return after one week; (c) the 1250% 1 Month Program, through which IB2001 guaranteed a supposed 1250% return after a one-month investment; and (d) the 2500% Christmas Miracle Program through which IB2001 guaranteed a supposed 2500% return beginning December 26, 2001, on funds invested between November 10, 2001, and December 15, 2001.  Bartiromo, through the IB2001 website and bulletin board, represented to investors that the investments in, and returns from, the four Investment Programs are safe and guaranteed.  Bartiromo further represented that IB2001 generated profits for the Investment Programs by pooling investors money and placing safe bets with three online sportsbooks.    , These representations were materially false and misleading.  Among other things, gambling by its very nature requires the undertaking of risk, and Bartiromo and IB2001 could not provide risk-free exorbitant returns on investments in the Investment Programs by betting on sporting events.  In addition, it is economically not feasible for an issuer of fixed-instruments to provide exorbitant short-term financial returns, in an open-ended offering, which are risk-free.    , The litigation is pending as to the issues of the amounts of disgorgement of ill-gotten gains and civil penalties.    , For more information contact Alexander M.

Samuelson, of Gretna, Nebraska, InaComs assistant controller, for violations of the antifraud, periodic reporting, record keeping, internal controls, and lying to auditors provisions of the federal securities laws.  InaCom, a Delaware corporation headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska, was primarily a value-added computer reseller that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on June 16, 2000.  , According to the Complaint, Guenthner and Samuelson engaged in a scheme to manage earnings in InaComs Form 10-Qs filed with the Commission on or about May 11, 1999, August 10, 1999, and November 9, 1999.  During the first three quarters of 1999, the Commission claims that Guenthner and Samuelson improperly accrued unallocated, general reserves, then reversed $7.1 million of these reserves into income in the third quarter of 1999.  The Complaint states these unjustified reversal of reserves in the third quarter of 1999 lacked any credible basis.  Also, according to the Complaint, in the third quarter of 1999, Guenthner and Samuelson knowingly posted $10.8 million of inventory cost reductions that related to prior quarters, thereby further artificially inflating income in the third quarter of 1999.  The Commission alleges that because of these inappropriate accounting practices in the third quarter of 1999, the company reported a profit when in reality the company had suffered a loss.  In addition, the Complaint states that throughout the first three quarters of 1999, that Guenthner caused InaCom to recognize manufacturer rebates to which it was not entitled, thereby understating its cost of goods sold and overstating net income.  According to the Complaint, this inclusion of improper manufacturer rebates overstated InaComs income by more than $13 million in its 1999 Form 10-Qs.  , The complaint alleges that Guenthner and Samuelson violated Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder, and aided and abetted InaComs violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-13 thereunder., ]"

The defendants consented to the entry of the preliminary injunction and order without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations in the action.  A trial date in the action has not been set.  , The Commissions complaint alleged that the defendants claimed to be selling bank-issued, federally insured certificates of deposit (CDs), but that the defendants were in fact selling uninsured securities.  Although the defendants were using at least some investor funds to buy CDs, the terms of the CDs often varied substantially from those of the securities defendants were selling.  The Commission also alleged that, in many cases, investors had to rely on the defendants ability to attract new investors in order for previous investors to receive repayment of their principal.  Accordingly, investors were not buying the low-risk, federally-insured CDs that they were promised.  Rather, they were buying higher risk securities issued by defendants, whose business was uninsured, unaudited and unregulated.

Through these schemes, the defendants raised approximately $457,300 from approximately fifteen investors and misappropriated a large percentage of those funds.  , The defendants are as follows:, , , , The complaint alleges as follows:  , From July 1997 to October 1999, Jean Pierre raised approximately $304,700 through the sale of unregistered limited partnership interests in JB Stanley, an unregistered hedge fund.  Jean Pierre and Lee told investors, orally and in writing, that JB Stanley was a hedge fund that pooled investor funds to purchase and sell securities.

The complaint alleges that defendants made the mini-tender offers by means of separate, but substantially similar three-page offering circulars.  The complaint further alleges that the defendants deliberately designed the circulars to conceal from investors the true offering price by stating a certain offering price in large, bold print on the first page and burying deductions in very small, closely spaced print on the second page.  According to the complaint, the defendants paid investors who tendered their limited partnership units pursuant to such mini-tender offers only a small fraction of the offering price stated on the first page of the circular because of deductions buried on the second page of the circular.  As a result of the fraudulent mini-tender offers, the defendants obtained more than 80,000 units of five limited partnerships from more than 4,000 investors.

(filed January 15, 2002), <p align=CENTER>SEC SETTLES CASE AGAINST BELLSOUTH CORPORATION, The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a settled civil action in federal court, in which BellSouth Corporation (BellSouth) consents to a judgment directing it to pay a $150,000 civil penalty.  The Commissions Complaint (Complaint) alleges that BellSouth violated certain provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).  Specifically, the Complaint alleges that BellSouth violated the books and records provisions - Section 13(b)(2)(A) - and internal  controls provisions - Section 13(b)(2)(B) - of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in connection with payments made by BellSouths Venezuelan and Nicaraguan subsidiaries.  BellSouth settled the civil action without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations.  ,   According to the  Complaint, between September 1997 and August 2000, former senior management of BellSouths Venezuelan subsidiary, Telcel, C.A. (Telcel), authorized payments totaling approximately $10.8 million to six offshore companies and improperly recorded the disbursements in Telcels books and records, based on fictitious invoices, as bona fide services.  Telcels internal controls failed to detect the unsubstantiated payments for a period of at least two years.  As an additional consequence of this control deficiency, the Complaint alleges that BellSouth was unable to reconstruct the circumstances or purpose of the Telcel payments, or determine the identity of their ultimate recipients.   Telcel is Venezuelas leading wireless provider, contributing more revenue to BellSouths Latin American Group segment than any other Latin American BellSouth operation., The Complaint also alleges that, between October 1998 and June 1999, BellSouths  Nicaraguan subsidiary, Telefonia Celular de Nicaragua, S.A.s (Telefonia), improperly recorded payments to the wife of the Nicaraguan legislator who was the chairman of the Nicaraguan legislative committee with oversight of Nicaraguan telecommunications.  , According to the Complaint, in 1997 BellSouth acquired a 49 percent ownership interest in Telefonia, and an option to acquire an additional 40 percent.   At the time of BellSouths acquisition of its minority interest in Telefonia, a Nicaraguan law prohibited foreign companies such as BellSouth from acquiring a majority interest in Nicaraguan telecommunications companies (foreign ownership restriction).   BellSouth intended to exercise its 40 percent option, but could do so only in the event that the Nicaraguan legislature repealed the foreign ownership restriction.   ,  The Complaint alleges that, in October 1998, Telefonia retained the wife of the Nicaraguan legislator to provide various regulatory and legislative services, including lobbying for repeal of the foreign ownership restriction.   The wife (lobbyist) had prior financial and operations experience in the telecommunications area, but no prior legislative experience.  Because the lobbyists husband chaired the legislative committee with jurisdiction over the foreign ownership restriction, BellSouth International (BSI), an indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary of BellSouth, knew that payments to the lobbyist could implicate the FCPA.  Nevertheless, a former BSI in-house attorney approved Telefonias retention of the lobbyist.  BSI officials, however, knew or should have known that the attorney lacked sufficient experience or training to enable him properly to opine on the matter., According to the Complaint, the lobbyist worked predominantly on the repeal of the foreign ownership restriction.  The Complaint further alleges that, during the lobbyists retention, the legislator/husband drafted the text of the proposed repeal of the foreign ownership restriction and enlisted support for the proposed repeal from other Committee members.   The husband scheduled and presided at a hearing in April 1999, during which his Committee heard arguments from BSI and others advocating repeal of the foreign ownership restriction. , In May 1999, Telefonia terminated the lobbyist.  In June 1999, Telefonia made a severance payment to her.  Telefonia recorded the total sum of $60,000 paid to the lobbyist as consulting services and as a severance payment.   In September 1999, the Committee referred the proposed amendment for approval by the Nicaraguan National Assembly.   In December 1999, the National Assembly voted to repeal the foreign ownership restriction.   BellSouth exercised its 40 percent option and increased its ownership interest in Telefonia to 89 percent in June 2000, In a related proceeding, the Commission today also issued a settled cease-and-desist order (Order) against BellSouth in which the Commission finds that BellSouth violated the books and records provisions and internal accounting controls provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in connection with payments made by BellSouths Venezuelan and Nicaraguan subsidiaries.  Without admitting or denying the Commissions findings, BellSouth consented to the entry of the Order that requires BellSouth to cease and desist from violating those provisions.  The Order notes that in determining to accept Bellsouths settlement offer, the Commission considered Bellsouths cooperation with the Commission staff after being advised of the staffs investigation.  The Order also notes that BellSouth undertook several remedial measures, including the disciplining and termination of various employees.  Finally, the Order notes that BellSouth has taken steps designed to enhance its compliance program, which currently consists of a number of components, including corporate governance, policies and procedures, training, internal auditing, and corrective action and discipline.]"

Franklin devised a fraudulent scheme that began in January 1997 and continued into 1998 to use Red Hot Stocks (Red Hot ), an Internet website, as a vehicle to tout stocks that he and others<b> </b>had acquired cheaply through private offerings and open market purchases so that they could sell their shares at a profit following Red Hots buy recommendations.  The Complaint alleges that defendant Samuel Wolanyk operated the Red Hot website, interviewed certain of the issuers, and drafted and disseminated some or all of the on-line recommendations.  The Complaint also alleges that defendant Dieter Raabe participated in the fraudulent scheme by issuing trading instructions for stocks profiled on Red Hot that were held in a Canadian brokerage account of defendant Vector Keel Ltd.  The Complaint alleges that both Raabe and Franklin had a beneficial interest in the Vector Keel account and that illegal trading profits from that account were wired to various entities affiliated with Franklin or Raabe, and that a portion of these illegal trading profits were received by defendant Net Income, a nominee corporation that Franklin set up to operate the Red Hot website.  The Complaint alleges that Franklin also sold stock of a company profiled on Red Hot through brokerage accounts of defendants Initial Public Offering Consultants, Inc. (IPO) and Avalon Trust.  Further, according to the Complaint, certain of defendants sales were part of an illegal unregistered distribution. ,  The Complaint alleges that statements in Red Hots profiles were materially false or misleading because, among other things, they contained unreasonable price predictions, they failed adequately to disclose that defendants owned stock in profiled companies or expected to be compensated for promoting companies profiled on Red Hot and because defendants were engaged in a pattern of acquiring stocks profiled on Red Hot with the intent to sell in coordination with the touts, while Red Hot recommended that others purchase the stock, a fraudulent practice called scalping., The Complaint charges all of the defendants with violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws:  Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act); Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Sullivan of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia entered a Final Judgment As To Vincent D. Celentano (Final Judgment) in the above-captioned civil action.  The Commission sued Vincent D. Celentano (Celentano), a Hillsboro Beach, Florida resident, for his role in two separate but related frauds concerning the securities of HealthCare, Ltd. (HealthCare), a company purportedly based in Russia, and Novatek International, Inc. (Novatek) of Columbia, Maryland.  , Celentano consented, without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions complaints, to entry of a Final Judgment that i) permanently enjoins him from violating or aiding and abetting the violation of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and (B), 15(a)(1) and 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-13, 13b2-1, 13d-1 and 16a-3 promulgated thereunder, ii) permanently bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and iii) orders him to pay a $350,000 civil money penalty.  The Commission also dismissed Mary N. Celentano, Celentanos wife, as a relief defendant., On June 18 and August 12, 1998, the Commission filed its complaint and amended complaint (Complaints), respectively, against Celentano and others based on their participation in fraudulent pump and dump schemes involving the purchase and sale of HealthCare and Novatek securities, both of which claimed to own licenses to distribute medical diagnostic test kits designed to rapidly diagnose HIV, cholera and other diseases.  In 1995, HealthCare, a shell company controlled by Celentano and another defendant, raised approximately $2.5 million from investors, primarily friends and family members.  HealthCare falsely claimed to have signed contracts worth millions of dollars with Russian governmental entities for the sale of the test kits.  The Complaints allege, among other things, that 1) Celentanos offers and sales of HealthCare securities were not registered with the Commission, as required by law; 2) Celentano and others defrauded investors by knowingly making false and misleading statements regarding the existence of the multi-million dollar contracts; and 3) Celentano was not licensed to sell securities, as required by law.  In fact, no such contracts ever existed and HealthCare never sold any product for commercial purposes.     , In 1996, Celentano and others orchestrated a second fraudulent scheme whereby they obtained more than $10 million from investors in connection with sales of Novatek securities.  Novatek claimed to own a license to distribute test kits in South and Central America.  Through a series of press releases, Novatek stated that it had entered into contracts worth more than $400 million with several South American entities.  The purported contracts, however, never existed and Novatek never made any commercial shipments of any test kits.  In connection with the Novatek fraud, the Complaints allege, among other things, that 1) Celentano and others artificially inflated the value of Novatek securities through a series of sham transactions; 2) Celentano caused Novatek to file reports with the Commission containing false and misleading financial statements; and 3) Celentano knowingly made false and misleading statements to investors and prospective investors concerning the existence of purported contracts.  , Additionally, in two related matters, the U.S. Department of Justice has filed criminal charges against Celentano and William P. Trainor in the U. S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida.  In <u>United States v. Celentano</u>, 01-6179-CR-WDF, Celentano pleaded guilty to violating 18 U.S.C. §1001 for making a false statement to the Commission and was sentenced by Judge Wilkie D. Ferguson to two years probation and assessed a $5,000 fine.  The indictment against Trainor charges him with twenty-one counts of wire fraud and money laundering in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§1345, 1956, 1957 and 2 in <u>United States v. Trainor</u>, 01-6215-CR-Jordan.  This matter is still pending.      , On January 10, 2002, Judge Sullivan entered an order staying the Commissions action against the remaining defendants in the Commissions case, pending the outcome of the criminal proceeding against Trainor., For additional information, see Litigation Release Nos. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr15786.txt>15786</a> and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr15786.txt>15844,</a> and Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Release Nos. <a href=/litigation/admin/3440169.txt>40169</a>, <a href=/litigation/admin/3440170.txt>40170</a> and <a href=/litigation/admin/3440171.txt>40171</a>.]"

Friedlander, 62, and four related entities, in a case involving portfolio pumping and other securities fraud pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.  In a hearing in December, Judge Kimba M. Wood also granted the Commissions request for the appointment of a receiver for the related entities, Friedlander International Limited, Friedlander Management Limited, Friedlander Limited Partnership, and Friedlander Capital Management Corporation.  Judge Wood appointed Andrew Irving of the New York City firm Robinson, Silverman, Pearce, Aronsohn &amp; Berman as the receiver for those entities.  Friedlander, a securities trader, is a resident of Greenwich, Connecticut.  The defendants have filed a notice of appeal of Judge Woods decision.  , The Commission filed its complaint in May of this year, alleging fraud in connection with Friedlanders management of the assets of Friedlander International Limited, an overseas hedge fund.  The Commission contended that Friedlander inflated the Hedge Funds net asset value by improperly and arbitrarily valuing certain unlisted securities of a company in which Friedlander and entities he controlled had heavily invested.  The Commissions complaint also alleged that, between at least August 2000 and December 2000, Friedlander engaged in purchases of a thinly traded common stock as part of a manipulative scheme to inflate the value of that stock and to inflate the Hedge Funds net asset value. SEC Litigation Release No. 17021 (June 1, 2001)  , In granting the preliminary injunction, Judge Wood determined that Friedlander had disregarded a court-ordered process for obtaining input from the investors and had attempted to withdraw money from a Hedge Fund account despite a prior commitment not to do so without obtaining a court order.  Judge Wood cited Friedlanders past conduct, the danger of wasting investor assets, and the need to determine the hedge funds activities as the bases for ordering the preliminary injunction.  Judge Wood also found that a receiver should be in place because the costs of a receiver were outweighed by the likelihood of future harm to the investors.  , In addition to the relief granted, the Commission seeks permanent injunctive relief against Friedlander and the other defendants, accountings, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, civil monetary penalties, and other relief.

(MSA); Merrill Scott &amp; Associates, Inc. (MSAI); Phoenix Overseas Advisers, Ltd. (Phoenix); Gibraltar Permanente Assurance, Ltd. (Gibraltar); Patrick M. Brody; and David E. Ross II from violations of the antifraud and broker registration provisions of the federal securities laws.  The court also froze the assets of the four entities and Brody. , The complaint alleges MSA, a Bahamian entity, and many of its affiliates, including Phoenix, Gibraltar, and their domestic affiliate, MSAI (collectively Merrill Scott), are engaged in an ongoing scheme in which they have obtained investments of cash and marketable securities from U.S. citizens primarily seeking tax advantages through offshore investments.  It is alleged that since at least 1999 Merrill Scott has been operating at a loss due to:  (1) misappropriations of an estimated $9.5 million by Brody, the control person of the Merrill Scott organization, to finance his personal expenses; (2) Merrill Scotts operating expenses; and (3) Merrill Scotts attempts to realize huge returns on its investments by investing heavily in start-up companies.  It is further alleged that in order to keep the Merrill Scott organization afloat and keep clients satisfied, Brody has operated the organization as a giant Ponzi scheme, using newly invested money to pay returns to earlier investors., The complaint alleges Merrill Scott sells its clients a Master Financial Plan (MFP) which establishes for each client a complex program involving the creation of offshore entities and accounts into which the clients income and assets are placed to generate investment income, reduce taxes and protect assets.  It is further alleged that various Merrill Scott entities control the assets and ostensibly implement the instructions of the client as set forth in the clients MFP; however, Brody has sole signatory authority for all accounts established for the benefit of clients and, with the assistance of Ross and Michael Licopantis, a former employee also named as a defendant in the complaint, has used this authority to transfer and invest client funds at will.  It is further alleged that MSA, MSAI and Brody have operated as unregistered brokers., The complaint charged the defendants with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

Charles Reives, and Tri-Star Investment Group, L.L.C. a/k/a Tri-Star Investment Group, as defendants, and Lazor, Ltd. as a relief defendant, alleging a multimillion-dollar, nationwide, prime bank type and other securities fraud.  The complaint charges that Lazorwitz, a Texas resident, and Reives, a North Carolina resident, promoted the fraudulent scheme as Tri-Stars general partners.  The complaint also charges that relief defendant Lazor, Ltd. received ill-gotten assets from the fraud without any legitimate claim to those assets.  , The Commissions complaint alleges that Lazorwitz and Reives used Tri-Star to offer and sell unregistered securities in Tri-Star to over 900 investors in at least 35 states, and to raise over $15 million and that Tri-Star, through Lazorwitz and Reives, initially represented that Tri-Star would invest in bank debentures and later claimed that it might invest in other international trade opportunities.  The complaint also alleges that Lazorwitz and Reives promoted Tri-Star directly and through independent agents around the United States known as Facilitators and led investors to expect profits of 20% per month in so-called 13-month trading programs, after an initial 90-day waiting period.   , According to the Commissions complaint, Tri-Star, Lazorwitz, and Reives made material misrepresentations and omissions of fact to investors concerning, among other things, the use of investor funds, the expected returns, and investment risks.  For example, the complaint alleges that Tri-Star, through Lazorwitz and Reives, misrepresented that investor funds would be used for lucrative trade opportunities when, in fact, Tri-Star invested relatively little of the funds collected, and never earned significant profits. It also alleges that they falsely represented to investors that the investors funds would be collateralized by an insured certificate of deposit, that they caused false account statements to be issued to the investors and that they failed to disclose to investors that Tri-Star used investor funds to pay alleged profits and commissions to investors and Facilitators.  The complaint further alleges that Lazorwitz and Reives misappropriated investor funds for their personal benefit. , The Commissions complaint charges Lazorwitz, Reives, and Tri-Star with violations of  Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Conlon of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois ordered Philip J. Yoder (Yoder) to appear and show cause why he should not be held in civil contempt for failing to produce documents and give testimony pursuant to the courts December 13, 2001 order.  The December 13, 2001 order arises out of a subpoena enforcement action the Commission filed against Yoder, a resident of Goshen, Indiana, for his failure to comply with two Commission investigative subpoenas requiring the production of documents and testimony.  Pursuant to the courts order and agreement of the parties, Yoder was required to produce documents by December 19, 2001 and appear for testimony on December 27, 2001.  Yoder failed, however, to appear for testimony or produce documents pursuant to the order.  Consequently, the Commission filed a motion for entry of an order to show cause why Yoder should not be held in civil contempt for failing to obey the court order.  , The subpoenas were issued in a non-public investigation into whether Yoder and others participated in one or more fraudulent investment schemes.  According to papers filed with the court, the Commission is investigating whether Yoder, through an entity called All the Way to the Top (ATWTTT), may have fraudulently raised over $700,000 from approximately 160 investors by misrepresenting the nature and risk of the investment.  In addition, the court papers alleged that Yoder may be involved in a prime bank scheme by selling mid-term notes trading on overseas markets which allegedly generate huge returns for the investor.  These instruments, however, do not exist.  The Commissions investigation will seek to determine whether Yoder may have fraudulently raised over $1.2 million and made over $18 million in connection with such trades.  , The judge has set the show cause hearing for January 29, 2002.  ,  For more information about prime bank frauds, visit the SECs website at <a href=/divisions/enforce/primebank.shtml target=_top>http://www.sec.gov/divisions/enforce/primebank.shtml</a>.<!--<pre></pre><table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5><tr><td><IMG SRC=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=9 ALT=*  BORDER=0 ALIGN=absmiddle>&nbsp;</td><td><a href=/litigation/complaints/complr17318.htm>SEC Complaint</a> in this matter.</td></tr></table>-->]"

Lambach, a former Controller and Chief Financial Officer of a subsidiary unit of Atchison Casting Corporation (Atchison), with accounting fraud.  The Commissions Complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, alleges that, while Lambach was employed with Atchisons Pennsylvania Foundry Group (PFG), he stole more than $900,000 of corporate funds and made numerous false accounting entries in the PFGs books and records, which had the effect of concealing his theft and making the PFG and, in turn, Atchison, appear more profitable than they were., Specifically, the Complaint alleges that Lambach made or caused to be made miscellaneous adjustment journal entries over a multi-year period to alter balances in various of the PFGs accounts.  These adjustments lacked any economic or accounting justification.  Mr. Lambach also allegedly created fictitious asset and other accounts that lacked any support or substance.  During the same period, Lambach stole more than $900,000 of corporate funds by writing numerous unauthorized checks payable to himself from certain Atchison bank accounts.  , The Complaint further details that Lambach, in his position as CFO of the PFG, regularly compiled and transmitted the fraudulent accounting information for the PFG to Atchisons corporate offices for inclusion in the companys consolidated financial statements.  As a result of Lambachs conduct, the periodic reports filed by Atchison with the Commission for its fiscal years ending June 30, 1997, 1998, 1999, and 2000, contained materially false and misleading consolidated financial statements.  More specifically, the Complaint alleges that, over that period, Atchisons net income was overstated by between 12% and 575% and its operating income was overstated by as much as 1580%.  The Commission also alleges that Lambach actively attempted to conceal his accounting fraud and theft by interfering with an audit conducted by Atchisons independent auditors in July and August 2000.     , Lambach resigned his position in October 2000, and, on November 2, Atchison announced that it had discovered accounting errors involving the PFG and that it had begun an investigation into the matter.  On April 24, 2001, Atchison announced it had completed its investigation and restated its financial statements for the fiscal years ended June 30, 1997 through June 30, 2000, including a reduction in net income of approximately $24.5 million over that period.    , The Commission alleges that Lambachs conduct violated Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder.  Lambach has agreed to settle the charges brought against him without admitting or denying the allegations set forth in the Complaint.  Lambach has consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder.  In addition, the final judgment to which Lambach consented provides that he is permanently barred from acting as an officer or director of any public company.  , The United States Attorneys Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania has filed criminal charges against Lambach related to the same conduct.  The thirteen-count indictment, filed on December 6, 2001, charges Lambach with twelve counts of wire fraud and one count of conspiracy.  , ]"

WOOD,</u> United States District Court for the District of Columbia, Civil Action No. 02 0075 RCL, On January 16, 2002, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a securities fraud case in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that Lewis J. McConnell, Jr., Ned L. Huggins, and Gregory T. Wood engaged in the fraudulent offering of unregistered prime bank note securities.  , The Commissions complaint alleges that the defendants raised over $7 million from at least 21 investors by promoting their Secure Private Placement Program, which purportedly generated risk-free returns of 20-25% per week.  In material distributed to investors, the Secure Private Placement Program was described as a joint venture between the investor and Gold Stream Holdings, Inc., in which the investor would participate in a program of trading certain highly rated financial instruments.  However, according to the complaint, the Secure Private Placement Program was merely a ploy by McConnell to obtain financing for Gold Stream Holdings, which was a company through which he was conducting or trying to conduct his entertainment business.  The complaint further alleges that McConnell hired Huggins and Wood to distribute certain materials to the investors, and that these materials contained numerous material misrepresentations and omissions concerning, among other things, the existence of such highly rated financial instruments, Gold Stream Holdings ability to participate in such a trading program, and the intended use of the investors funds., The Commissions complaint charges all of the defendants with violations of the registration and antifraud provisions of the securities laws [Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder].

Under the terms of the settlement, defendants Kurtis Keith Lowe, Woody Keith Lowe, Jerry Lynn Ruyle and Robert Alen Blackburn, agreed to a permanent injunction against future violations of the securities laws.  Previously, in a South Carolina criminal proceeding, all were ordered to disgorge commissions each received from their participation in the ponzi scheme.  In that proceeding, Kurtis Keith Lowe was ordered to disgorge $244,084 in unlawful commissions, Woody Keith Lowe $365,560, Ruyle $135,000 and Blackburn $69,259.  The Commission decided not to seek a civil penalty against each based upon his demonstrated financial inability to pay a penalty.  , In its civil action, the Commission alleged that defendants sold promissory notes issued by Chemical Trust, a purported business trust, as part of a nationwide ponzi scheme.  The promissory notes were claimed to be secured by surety bonds issued by United States Guarantee Corporation, an Arizona based surety company.  In reality, the control persons behind Chemical Trust were diverting investor funds to their own use and the surety company was being run by a convicted felon and held no assets with which to secure the promissory notes.  The Commission alleged that the defendants were in a position to learn of the issuers fraudulent scheme, but failed to conduct any meaningful due diligence before selling the securities to their insurance clients.  The Commission further alleged the defendants made fraudulent statements in connection with the sale of the Chemical Trust promissory notes and acted as unregistered brokers.  , The defendants consented, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining each from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

HERULA  (United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island, Misc No. 2-008ML)   , The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that, on January 14, 2002, it filed an action to enforce a forthwith subpoena against Dennis S. Herula, a former broker at the Cranston, Rhode Island branch of Raymond James Financial Services, Inc.  The Commission served the subpoena on Herula at the San Francisco Airport on January 9, 2002, requiring him to immediately turn over financial account records and other documents he was carrying into the U.S. from Bermuda. When served with the subpoena, however, Herula refused to comply, claiming he did not have any such documents in his possession. The Commission alleges in its papers that, contrary to his representations, Herula did have responsive financial account records with him when he was served with the subpoena.  Accordingly, the Commission filed its Application for an Order to Show Cause and For an Order Requiring Compliance with Administrative Subpoena Against Dennis S. Herula.  The action was filed in Rhode Island federal district court.  , In its Application and supporting papers, the Commission alleges that, on December 26, 2001, the Commission issued an Order Directing Private Investigation and Designating Officers to Take Testimony (Formal Order) in the matter of Brite Business Corporation.  The Formal Order authorizes the staff to conduct an investigation into whether Brite Business or others violated the federal securities laws in connection with the solicitation of investments, and whether investor funds subsequently were misappropriated.  According to the Commission, Herula, who was terminated by Raymond James in January 2001, served as the broker for at least two Raymond James accounts that may have held millions of dollars in investor funds raised by Brite Business.  The Commission staff has been investigating Herulas activities to determine, among other things, what happened to Brite Business investor funds.    , The Commission alleges that Herula was arrested in Bermuda in December 2001 after he purportedly submitted false documents to a Bermuda bank in connection with an attempt to transfer $10 million from banks in Europe and South America.  When Herula was arrested, the Bermuda police seized from him two laptop computers and numerous documents.  According to the Commission, the Bermuda police confirmed that the documents and laptops they seized contained financial account information that would have been responsive to the Commissions January 9 subpoena.  Herula subsequently pled guilty to the offense of uttering a forged document and was given a one month prison sentence in Bermuda.  According to the Commission, upon Herulas release from jail on January 9, 2002, the Bermuda Police returned to him the documents and laptops they had seized, and Herula subsequently boarded a flight to the United States carrying the materials with him.  The Commission alleges that, when Herula arrived at his final destination in San Francisco on the evening of January 9, he was carrying a black bag similar to the one that had contained the laptops earlier that day.   According to the Commission, the Bermuda police also confirmed that there was enough room in the black bag for Herula tohave fit the documents that were returned to him as well.  Despite this evidence, the Commission alleges that Herula claimed, first to the process server and subsequently to the Commission staff in a telephone call the next day, that he did not have any responsive materials in his possession when he was served with the subpoena. According to the Commission, Herula told the process server that the documents were in Boston, and then contradicted himself the next day when he told the Commission staff the documents were in Rhode Island.  , Pursuant to its Application, the Commission is seeking an order directing Herula to show cause why the Court should not enter an order requiring Herula to comply with the Commissions subpoena for documents, and an order compelling Herula to immediately produce the subpoenaed documents.<!--<pre></pre><table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5><tr><td><IMG SRC=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=9 ALT=*  BORDER=0 ALIGN=absmiddle>&nbsp;</td><td><a href=/litigation/complaints/complr17325.htm>SEC Complaint</a> in this matter.</td></tr></table>-->]"

CREDIT SUISSE FIRST BOSTON CORPORATION,</i>  ,  02 CV 00090  ( RWR) (D.D.C.), <p align=center><b>SEC SUES CSFB FOR IPO VIOLATIONS;<br/> CSFB WILL PAY $100 MILLION</b>, WASHINGTON - The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it settled charges against Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation (CSFB), a New York-based brokerage firm and investment bank, relating to the Commissions investigation of the firms IPO allocation practices.  CSFB agreed (1) to pay a total of $100 million in the Commissions action and in a related action announced today by the National Association of Securities Dealers Regulation, Inc. (NASDR); (2) to be enjoined by a federal court from future violations; and (3) to adopt extensive new policies and procedures.  The $100 million payment is composed of $70 million in disgorgement of improper gains, and $30 million in civil penalties or fines.  , In connection with this matter, the Commission today filed a Complaint against CSFB in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, alleging violations of certain Conduct Rules of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD), and of books and records requirements under the federal securities laws.  Given the nature and scale of the misconduct alleged in the Complaint, the Commission determined to seek an injunction based, in part, on violations of NASD Conduct Rules.  According to the Complaint, in exchange for shares in hot IPOs, CSFB wrongfully extracted from certain customers a large portion of the profits that those customers made by immediately selling (flipping) their IPO stock.  The profits were channeled to CSFB in the form of excessive brokerage commissions generated by the customers in unrelated securities trades that the customers effected solely to share the IPO profits with CSFB.  , The Commissions Complaint alleges as follows:, From at least April 1999 through June 2000, CSFB employees allocated shares of IPOs to over 100 customers who were willing to funnel between 33 and 65 percent of their IPO profits to CSFB.  The profits were channeled to CSFB in the form of excessive brokerage commissions generated by the customers in unrelated securities trades that the customers effected solely to satisfy CSFBs demands for a share of the IPO profits., The profit-sharing activity was pervasive in certain customer accounts serviced by CSFBs Institutional Sales Trading Desk, Private Client Services (PCS) Group and Technology PCS Group (Tech PCS).  Generally, these customers received no more than 10 percent of the IPO stock that CSFB allocated as lead managing underwriter during the relevant time period.  Nonetheless, IPO trading was so profitable during this period that the relevant customers funneled tens of millions of dollars in profits to CSFB through improper commission payments., Employees of CSFBs Equity Capital Markets, PCS, and Tech PCS divisions informed the relevant customers, both implicitly and explicitly, that they were expected to pay a portion of profits earned on their IPO flipping to CSFB in order to continue to receive allocations in hot IPOs.  Customers who refused to funnel a portion of their profits to CSFB received smaller allocations, and in some instances were denied allocations altogether.  , To maximize commission payments to CSFB, the relevant customers paid excessive commissions on off-setting trades in large capitalization, highly liquid, exchange-listed securities otherwise unrelated to the IPOs.  CSFB employees sometimes assisted certain of the customers in effecting these off-setting trades. The sole purpose of this trading activity was to generate commissions for CSFB.  Customers frequently executed one side of the trade with CSFB (e.g., a purchase at a commission as high as $3.15 per share) and then virtually simultaneously executed the off-setting side of the trade through another broker-dealer (e.g., a sale of the same quantity of the same stock) at the standard commission of $.06 per share., Each of the CSFB business units that participated in the IPO allocation process engaged in explicit and implicit policies and practices to obtain improper payments from certain customers in exchange for allocations in hot IPOs.  Participation in this conduct extended to senior levels of these business units and was widespread within the relevant business units.  Senior executives in managerial and supervisory roles knew of the practices described in the Complaint, encouraged many of the practices described in the Complaint, directed CSFB employees to urge customers to maintain specified ratios of commissions to IPO profits, and, in some instances, personally engaged in some of the practices described in the Complaint. , The practices described in the Complaint were not isolated occurrences.  Rather, these practices were a fundamental part of the manner in which CSFB dealt with a small but significant portion of its customer base.  The prevalence of these practices is reflected in numerous e-mail messages and other communications, several of which are cited in the Complaint.  , CSFB has agreed to settle the Commissions action and has consented, without admitting or denying the allegations of the Complaint, to the entry of a final judgment that: (1) permanently enjoins CSFB, directly or indirectly, from certain violations of NASD Conduct Rules 2110 and 2330 and Section 17(a)(1) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78q, and Rule 17a-3, 17 C.F.R § 240.17a-3, thereunder; (2) orders disgorgement of $70 million, which would be reduced to $35 million in recognition of CSFBs anticipated payment of $35 million in disgorgement to NASDR in a related NASDR proceeding against CSFB; (3) orders a civil penalty of $30 million pursuant to Section 21(d) of the Exchange Act, which would be reduced to $15 million in recognition of CSFBs payment of a $15 million penalty to NASDR in the related NASDR proceeding against CSFB; and (4) orders CSFB to comply with certain undertakings discussed below.  , As part of the settlement, CSFB has undertaken to establish a broad range of new policies and procedures relating to IPO allocations to prevent a recurrence of the misconduct described in the Complaint.  Among the undertakings to which CSFB has consented, the firm will implement extensive new policies and procedures relating to the allocation of IPO shares, the account opening process, commission levels, and supervisory practices.  The new policies include a prohibition against the following conduct:  (1) making a wrongful arrangement or a wrongful <u>quid</u> <u>pro</u> <u>quo</u> of any kind with customers in exchange for IPO allocations; and (2) improper sharing of profits or losses with a customer who receives an IPO allocation or allocations.  CSFB also has agreed to retain an Independent Consultant to conduct a review to provide reasonable assurance of the implementation and effectiveness of its new policies and procedures.  This review will begin one year after the date of the entry of the Final Judgment.  , <p align=center>*   *   *, The Commission acknowledges the invaluable assistance of the United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York and NASDR in the investigation of this matter., ]"

It is further alleged that many of these shares were issued to Ferguson and Donahue, or entities controlled by them.  Ferguson and Donahue sold these shares into the market and remitted most of the proceeds to World Homes, which used the funds to finance the issuers operations.

To induce institutional investors and lenders to allow them to do so, the Defendants misrepresented and omitted material facts concerning the legitimacy of the bonds.

Wooten has agreed to plead guilty to the charges., The Commissions complaint alleges that on or about March 6, 2000, Wooten learned that the Tribune Company planned to acquire Times Mirror Company.  The complaint alleges that Wooten acquired this information at a meeting he attended at Rustic Canyon Group, a Los Angeles-based venture capital firm hired to assist in the acquisition.  Wooten was informed that the planned acquisition of Times Mirror was not yet public during this meeting.  On March 13, 2000, Times Mirror and Tribune publicly announced their merger agreement.  The price of Times Mirror stock rose 37 11/16 per share or 78% on news of the announcement.  The complaint further alleges that on March 8, 2000, and on March 10, 2000, Wooten purchased a total of 2,285 shares of Times Mirror stock, ultimately realizing illegal profits of over $76,000.

Koeltl, United States District Judge for the Southern District of New York, entered a final judgment of permanent injunction and other relief against defendant Stephen J. Cowley, a British subject and resident.  The judgment settles the Commissions claims against Cowley in a civil action filed by the Commission on November 28, 2000, which alleged that Cowley violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws when he engaged in insider trading in the securities of 4Front Technologies, Inc. in advance of the August 3, 2000 public announcement that NCR, Inc. would acquire 4Front.  At the time the Complaint was filed, the Commission also sought and obtained a freeze of Cowleys assets located in the U.S.  The final judgment permanently enjoins Cowley from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, and orders Cowley to pay disgorgement in the amount of $127,288, pre-judgment interest in the amount of $11,068, and a civil penalty of $127,288, for a total payment of $265,644.  Cowley consented to entry of the final judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint., As alleged in the Complaint, in the three weeks immediately preceding the 4Front/NCR merger announcement, Cowley purchased 8,000 shares of 4Front common stock and 460 4Front call options (August $12.50 series) at a total cost of over $250,000, through a U.S. brokerage account he maintained at Salomon Smith Barney.  Cowleys 4Front purchases began shortly after 4Front and NCR began merger negotiations.  His options purchases aroused suspicion because he had never purchased options before, and was essentially the only purchaser of that particular series of 4Front call options at the time. Cowley also liquidated a substantial portion of his Salomon portfolio in order to fund his 4Front securities purchases.  According to the Complaint, taped recordings of conversations between Cowley and his broker revealed Cowleys knowledge of very specific details concerning the ultimately-announced merger, including the price of the proposed transaction and the timing of the contemplated agreement and announcement., On August 3, 2000, 4Front and NCR jointly announced their agreement to merge.  Cowley immediately sold all his 4Front stock and call options, realizing illicit trading profits of $127,288., <i>See also</i>:  <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr16812.htm>L.R. 16812</a> (November 29, 2000),  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr17331.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Hurley, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Florida, entered an order of preliminary injunction and other relief against Genesis Leasing IX, Inc.; Kadie Corp.; George Robert Hoffman; Lisa Klinger Paonessa (Klinger); Brian Dominick Paonessa; Rainwater Investment Group Holdings XI LLC; Excalibur investment Group PAIF II, Inc.; Excalibur Investment Group Holdings, Inc.; Excalibur Investment Group, Inc.; Trident/KD Investment Group, Inc.; and Endeavor Investment Group, Inc.  The defendants consented to the entry of the order of preliminary injunction and other relief without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint., The Commissions complaint alleges that individual defendants Hoffman, Klinger, and Paonessa controlled and caused the corporate defendants to make at least 21 fraudulent mini-tender offers for the securities of five publicly traded limited partnerships since 1997.  The complaint alleges that defendants made the mini-tender offers by means of separate, but substantially similar three-page offering circulars.  The complaint further alleges that the defendants deliberately designed the circulars to conceal from investors the true offering price by stating a certain offering price in large, bold print on the first page and burying deductions in very small, closely spaced print on the second page.  According to the complaint, the defendants paid investors who tendered their limited partnership units pursuant to such mini-tender offers only a small fraction of the offering price stated on the first page of the circular because of deductions buried on the second page of the circular.  As a result of the fraudulent mini-tender offers, the defendants obtained more than 80,000 units of five limited partnerships from more than 4,000 investors.  Based on the prices the defendants actually paid for the units and the market prices of the units, the defendants appear to have profited by more than $2 million.  , The Courts order enjoins defendants from violating Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, freezes the assets of the defendants, and grants other expedited relief.  The Courts order also allows any investor who tendered limited partnership units pursuant to a the mini-tender offer named in the complaint and whose units were to be transferred to defendants after the date of the order to rescind their tender.,  The complaint seeks permanent injunctions against defendants to prevent future violations of Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also seeks an accounting, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against the defendants. The complaint also seeks a civil penalty against Paonessa based upon his violation of a prior cease-and-desist order entered against him by the Commission.  <i>See</i> Stuart, Coleman &amp; Co., Inc., <a href=/litigation/admin/33-7290.txt>Exchange Act Rel.

The Commission issued the subpoena on December 26, 2001, requiring Capalbo to appear for testimony at the Commissions Boston District Office on December 31.  According to the Commission, although Capalbo was personally served with the subpoena on December 29, she failed to appear on December 31 and also refused to testify on January 16, 2002, a new date requested by her attorney.  Accordingly, the Commission filed its Application for an Order to Show Cause and For an Order Requiring Compliance with Administrative Subpoena Against Mary Lee Capalbo.  The action was filed in federal district court in Rhode Island., In its Application and supporting papers, the Commission alleges that, on December 26, 2001, the Commission issued an Order Directing Private Investigation and Designating Officers to Take Testimony (Formal Order) in the matter of Brite Business Corporation.  The Formal Order authorizes the staff to conduct an investigation into whether Brite Business or others violated the federal securities laws in connection with the solicitation of investments, and whether investor funds subsequently were misappropriated.  According to the Commission, Brite Business maintained millions of dollars in investor funds in brokerage accounts at the Cranston, Rhode Island branch of Raymond James Financial Services, Inc.  Capalbos husband, Dennis Herula, served as the broker for at least two of those accounts.  The Commission alleges that approximately $15 million was transferred from the Brite Business accounts to an account held in Capalbos name., The Commission alleges in its papers that, shortly after Capalbo failed to appear for testimony on December 31, Capalbos attorney contacted the Commission staff and requested that her testimony be rescheduled to January 16, 2002.  He further requested that the staff take Capalbos testimony in San Francisco instead of Boston.  The staff agreed to these requests to accommodate his schedule.  On January 15, 2002, less than 18 hours before testimony was to begin, and after a staff attorney had traveled from Boston to San Francisco to take Capalbos testimony, Capalbos counsel informed the staff that Capalbo would neither testify nor assert a valid privilege the following day because she needed more time to prepare.  Although Capalbo appeared with her counsel the next day, she refused to testify or assert any privilege. , Pursuant to its Application, the Commission is seeking an order directing Capalbo to show cause why the Court should not enter an order requiring her to comply with the Commissions subpoena for testimony, and an order compelling her to appear for testimony at the Commissions Boston District Office.

(Emsanet), a start-up company purportedly attempting to create an Internet Service Provider, and others, offered and sold stock to investors in an unregistered offering and defrauded approximately 492 investors of $3.2 million.  , In its complaint, the Commission charged the following defendants:, The Commissions complaint alleges as follows:, Beginning in approximately March 1999, Emsanet and Abel planned to raise money for Emsanet by selling stock to investors through a private placement offering.  Abel hired U.S. Funding, an unregistered broker-dealer, to conduct this offering.  Restivo, Liantonio, and Iori managed U.S. Fundings operations, and they personally sold Emsanet stock, and hired salespersons to sell Emsanet stock to investors.<br/>, In connection with the sale of Emsanet stock, Abel drafted a Private Placement Memoranda (PPM), which was distributed to investors.  The PPM contained numerous materially misleading statements.  For instance, the PPM stated that Abel had substantial industry experience when, in fact, he did not.  In the PPM, Emsanet predicted that by the end of 2001, its Internet Service Provider would have 1.7 million subscribers and the company would generate $254,800,000 in revenues.  Emsanet, however, lacked any operational infrastructure, and the company had no reasonable basis in fact to make this projection.    , To facilitate the sale of Emsanet stock, U.S. Funding, Restivo, Liantonio, and Iori, directly and through U.S. Fundings salespersons, made materially misleading statements and failed to disclose material facts to investors.  For instance, Restivo posted messages on various Internet message boards stating that Emsanet planned shortly to conduct an initial public offering at a price of $20 per share, and that investors who had purchased stock in the private placement at $3.50 per share would then be able to sell their shares.  In fact, Emsanet had not undertaken steps to conduct an IPO, and Restivo had no basis in fact to make this statement.  U.S. Funding, Restivo, Liantonio, and Iori also failed to disclose to investors that Emsanet was compensating U.S. Funding with approximately 25% commissions, in cash and stock, to sell Emsanet stock.   , The Commission charged Emsanet, Abel, U.S. Funding, Restivo, Liantonio and Iori with violating Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.  The Commission also charged U.S. Funding, Restivo, Liantonio and Iori with violating Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

The SECs complaint alleges that Tel-One and defendant Media Broadcast Solutions, Inc. (Media Broadcast), a Tampa stock promoter, and certain of their principals have been involved in a pump-and-dump scheme that included false statements in advertisements in local and national newspapers, including the January 16, 2002 edition of the Wall Street Journal.  The SECs complaint and its motion for a temporary restraining order allege that the defendants, some of whom have recent felony convictions, dumped hundreds of thousands of Tel-One shares during their pump-and-dump scheme.  , The TRO issued by the Court  enjoins Tel-One, Media Broadcast, W. Kris Brown (Tel-Ones president), George Carapella (a Tel-One director at the time of the misconduct), Alan S. Lipstein (a former Tel-One director) and George LaFauci (Carapellas cousin and a principal of Media Broadcast) from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, and freezes their assets.  , According to the SECs complaint and motion for a TRO, Tel-One is a start-up company in the videoconferencing industry.  The SEC alleges that Carapella, who has multiple fraud convictions, and Lipstein, who is awaiting sentencing on a federal money laundering conviction, control both Tel-One and Media Broadcast.  Since November 2001, Media Broadcast has sent unsolicited mass fax messages to prospective investors and published advertisements in local and national newspapers that make false claims regarding, among other things:  (a) that investors should buy Tel-One stock now and that Tel-One is a good investment, when, in fact, Carapella and Lipstein were dumping hundreds of thousands of Tel-One shares; (b) that Tel-Ones stock price (which was quoted at approximately $2.50 per share at the time of the trading suspension) will reach a target of $21 per share; and (c) that Tel-One is at the forefront of the videoconferencing industry and has a network of relationships with Fortune 2000 companies.  The SEC also alleges that the defendants have tried to capitalize on the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks by touting Tel-One as a leader in the videoconferencing industry, which the defendants claim will grow substantially as a result of travel and safety concerns.  , Carapella and Lipstein paid for all of Tel-Ones and Media Broadcasts touting activities, according to the SECs motion for a TRO, including the recent Wall Street Journal advertisement.  The SEC also alleges that since late November 2001, Carapella and Lipstein, through companies they control, have sold approximately $1.7 million worth of Tel-One stock., The SECs complaint alleges that the above conduct violated the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

This continues the freeze of the assets of the four entities and Brody that was previously entered on January 15, 2002.  , The complaint alleges MSA, a Bahamian entity, and many of its affiliates, including Phoenix, Gibraltar, and their domestic affiliate, MSAI (collectively Merrill Scott), were engaged in an ongoing scheme in which they obtained investments of cash and marketable securities from U.S. citizens primarily seeking tax advantages through offshore investments.  It is alleged that since at least 1999 Merrill Scott has been operating at a loss due to:  (1) misappropriations of an estimated $9.5 million by Brody, the control person of the Merrill Scott organization, to finance his personal expenses; (2) Merrill Scotts operating expenses; and (3) Merrill Scotts attempts to realize huge returns on its investments by investing heavily in start-up companies.  It is further alleged that in order to keep the Merrill Scott organization afloat and keep clients satisfied, Brody operated the organization as a giant Ponzi scheme, using newly invested money to pay returns to earlier investors., The complaint charged the defendants with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

Wallenbrock &amp; Associates, Larry Toshio Osaki, Van Y. Ichinotsubo<i> </i>and Citadel Capital Management Group, Inc.,<i> </i>from engaging in fraud, unregistered sales of securities, and acting as unregistered brokers, in violation of federal securities laws.  The Order was entered with the consent of the Defendants, who neither admitted nor denied the allegations in the Commissions Complaint.  The Court also froze the assets of the Defendants and required them to produce an accounting of the uses to which investors funds have been made.  The Commissions Complaint also asks the Court for orders of preliminary and permanent injunctions and other relief against the Defendants. , In its Complaint, the Commission alleges that the Defendants knowingly or recklessly made misrepresentations or omitted to state material facts in the offer and sale of promissory notes issued by Wallenbrock.  Since at least 1999, the Defendants have raised at least $170 million through the offer and sale of three-month promissory notes promising a 20% return (for each three-month period), which were generally automatically rolled over upon maturity, to at least 1,000 investors throughout the United States.  Many investors hold the notes in individual retirement accounts.  The Complaint alleges that Defendants told investors that the proceeds of the notes would be used in Wallenbrocks factoring business in which Wallenbrock purchases receivables of Malaysian latex glove manufacturers for 70% to 80% of the balance due on the receivables.  When the accounts receivable are collected, investors receive a 20% return on their investment.  The Complaint alleges that, in the offer and sale of the Wallenbrock notes, the Defendants made material misrepresentations to investors that include: (1) the claim that the Wallenbrock notes are secured by an undivided interest in the accounts receivable of Wallenbrock; (2) the risks associated with the investments; and (3) the assurance of profits.   , The Courts Order: (1) temporarily enjoins all Defendants from engaging in fraud or the sale of unregistered securities in violation of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; (2) and temporarily enjoins Osaki, Ichinotsubo and Citadel from acting as unregistered brokers in violation of Sections 15(a) and 15(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 15c1-2 thereunder.

Honigman (Honigman) to a prison term of 3-9 years.   Honigman, a former top producing broker at now-defunct brokerage Duke &amp; Co. (Duke), as well as a supervisor and part owner of Duke, was prosecuted by the New York County District Attorneys office.  Honigman pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit enterprise corruption in September 1999., Honigman was prosecuted for some of the same conduct that underlies a civil complaint filed by the Commission against Honigman, along with co-defendants Victor M. Wang, Gregg A. Thaler, and Charles T. Bennett.  As part of his settlement with the Commission, Honigman agreed to an injunction and to pay disgorgement of $302,286 (including pre-judgment interest), which represented Honigmans ill-gotten gains.   But Honigman then paid only a portion of that judgment and claimed a financial inability to pay the remainder.  The staff rejected Honigmans claim of financial hardship because Honigman had made substantial transfers of assets to his parents that could be used to pay the Commissions judgment in full., The staff of the Commission made a submission to Justice Wetzel detailing Honigmans failure to pay the judgment and his earlier transfer of assets., In rejecting a request for leniency and sentencing Honigman to 3-9 years, Justice Wetzel took note that Honigman had transferred $750,000 in assets to his parents after the Commission began its investigation and that those assets subsequently were transferred to an offshore account in the Channel Islands.  In imposing sentence, although he took note of Honigmans cooperation in the criminal prosecution of Duke, Justice Wetzel nevertheless termed Honigmans transfer suspicious and stated that those assets would have been made available to defrauded investors if Honigman felt true remorse for his crimes., The Commission acknowledges the outstanding work of the Office of the New York County District Attorney in the Duke criminal actions., For further information about the Commissions action, see Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr16256.htm>16256</a>.]"

(RBManagement).  The Commission had charged RBManagement with knowingly causing its affiliate, Rupay-Barrington Funds, Inc. (Fund), a registered investment company, to carry, as an asset, a worthless receivable at face value from Rupay-Barrington Financial Group, Inc. (Group), the parent of both companies.  The fact that Group was deeply insolvent and unable to pay the receivable was never disclosed to investors.  , On July 10, 2000, the Commission filed a complaint against RBManagement, Group and the Fund in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, Dallas Division (District Court), <i>SEC v. Rupay-Barrington Capital Management, Inc., et al</i>, Civ. No. 3:00-CV-1482-D (N.D. Tex.).  The Commissions complaint alleged that, from at least January 1999, RBManagement caused the Fund, its advisory client, to carry an uncollectable receivable from Group, which was insolvent.  This receivable arose from Groups agreement to pay Fund expenses that exceeded a certain percentage of the Funds net assets.  According to the complaint, this receivable was uncollectable from at least January 1999 through June 2000, but Rupay Management caused the Funds books to reflect the receivable at full face value.  The complaint further alleged that the receivable grew steadily over this period to a peak of approximately $250,000, which inflated the net asset value of the Funds three portfolios, meaning that the Fund sold and redeemed shares at improperly high prices.  Ultimately, the complaint alleged, the Fund improperly suspended redemptions of the portfolio that held the largest portion of the receivable.  At the Commissions request, and with the consent of the defendants, a court- appointed Special Master took control of Rupay-Barrington Funds, Inc., and the court entered a preliminary injunction against RBManagement and Group.  , RBManagement consented to the entry of a final judgment enjoining it from future violations of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, Sections 34(b) and 36(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 5(b) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.  RBManagement also consented to a censure and an administrative order requiring it to withdraw its registration with the Commission as an investment adviser, cease soliciting new clients and prepare a plan to close or transfer all of its existing client accounts within 180 days of the entry of the administrative order.  Group consented to the entry of a final judgment enjoining it from future violations Section 17(a)(3) of the Investment Company Act of 1940.

Gallers, and Robert L. Carberry</i>, Case No. 02-60131-CIV-GRAHAM (S.D. Fla.) , On January 30, 2002, the Commission filed two related enforcement proceedings arising from a wide-ranging accounting fraud at CyberGuard Corporation, a Fort Lauderdale-based company in the business of developing and selling computer network security systems.  First, the Commission filed a lawsuit in federal court in Miami charging three former CyberGuard officers - Patrick O. Wheeler, Steven S. Gallers, and Robert L. Carberry - with securities fraud and other violations.  Second, the Commission issued a settled cease-and-desist order finding that CyberGuard and two other former officers - William D. Murray, and Tommy D. Steele - violated the periodic reporting, books-and-records, and internal accounting controls provisions of the federal securities laws., As described in the Commissions complaint and order, CyberGuard engaged in a number of improper accounting practices that required the company to restate its financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1997 (including all interim quarters and its beginning balance sheet as of July 1, 1996) and for the first three quarters of its fiscal year ended June 30 1998.  According to the Commission, CyberGuards improper accounting practices departed from both generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and CyberGuards own stated revenue recognition policies.  Specifically, the Commission found that CyberGuard: (i) improperly wrote off $3.244 million in capitalized software costs at the end of its 1996 fiscal year, which inflated the companys reported profit margins by approximately 43.5% for its 1997 fiscal year and by approximately 4.4% for the first three quarters of its 1998 fiscal year; and (ii) improperly recognized revenue during its 1997 and 1998 fiscal years, which inflated the companys reported revenues by approximately $1.4 million (or 9.8%) for the 1997 fiscal year and by approximately $2.2 million (or 17%) for the first three quarters of the 1998 fiscal year., In the federal lawsuit, the Commission alleged that Wheeler (CyberGuards former chief financial officer and vice president of North American sales, and current vice president of business development) and Carberry (CyberGuards former chairman of the board, chief executive officer, and president) signed off on the improper write-off of capitalized software costs when they knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that the write-off was improper under GAAP.  The complaint further alleges that Wheeler and Carberry made, directly or indirectly, materially false and misleading statements, and omitted to state material facts, in their communications with CyberGuards outside auditors about the reasons for the write-off.,  According to the complaint, Wheeler, Carberry, and Gallers (CyberGuards former controller and assistant treasurer) were all involved in CyberGuards improper revenue recognition during its 1997 and 1998 fiscal years.  Wheeler allegedly knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that CyberGuard materially misstated its reported revenues during the 1997 fiscal year and certain quarters of the 1998 fiscal year as a result of improperly booking revenue from contingent sales.  Wheeler is further alleged to have misrepresented to the auditors, in connection with the companys 1997 fiscal-year audit, that CyberGuard had no contingent agreements.  Carberry allegedly knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that CyberGuard improperly booked revenue from a contingent transaction accounting for substantial revenues reported for the quarter ended September 30, 1997, and accelerated revenue recognition during the March 31, 1998 quarter on incomplete sales transactions.  Gallers is alleged to have improperly booked revenue from contingent transactions, and accelerated revenue recognition on after-quarter shipments of product, over the seven quarters ended March 31, 1998, which he knew, or was reckless in not knowing, materially misstated CyberGuards financial results.     , The Commission charged Wheeler, Carberry, and Gallers with securities fraud in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and with knowingly falsifying the books, records, and accounts of CyberGuard, and knowingly circumventing or failing to implement adequate internal controls, in violation of Exchange Act Section 13(b)(5) and Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1.  The Commission also charged Wheeler and Carberry with misleading CyberGuards auditors in violation of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-2.  The Commission is seeking injunctions and civil penalties against all three defendants, and officer-and-director bars against both Wheeler and Gallers.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, Carberry consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the foregoing provisions, and requiring him to pay a $50,000 civil penalty.  , In the related cease-and-desist order, the Commission found that CyberGuard violated the periodic reporting provisions of Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13, the books-and-records provisions of Exchange Act Section 13(b)(2)(A), and the internal accounting controls provisions of Exchange Act Section 13(b)(2)(B), and ordered CyberGuard to cease and desist from violating those provisions in the future.  The Commissions order further found that Murray (a former chief financial officer of CyberGuard) and Steele (a former chief operating officer of CyberGuard) knowingly circumvented or failed to implement internal controls at CyberGuard, and knowingly falsified CyberGuards books and records, in violation of Exchange Act Section 13(b)(5) and Rule 13b2-1, and were causes of CyberGuards violations, and ordered them to cease and desist from committing or causing such violations in the future.  Without admitting or denying the Commissions findings, CyberGuard, Murray, and Steele each consented to entry of the Commissions order.  ,  ,  ]"

The complaint alleges that from January 1992 through March 1998, Perusquia secretly invested client funds in a series of speculative companies in return for broker kickback commissions from the companies, which later collapsed.  In a separate matter, the United States Attorneys Office for the Northern District of California also announced today the filing of criminal charges against Perusquia for the same conduct that is alleged in the Commissions complaint., The Commissions complaint alleges that Perusquia, formerly a Senior Vice President at PaineWebber and Lehman Brothers, defrauded a wealthy client of at least $68 million by funneling tens of millions of dollars of client funds into a group of speculative gold mining companies from which Perusquia was secretly receiving millions of dollars in kickback commissions and stock.  According to the complaint, Perusquia forged client signatures on private placement memoranda, powers of attorney and other documents to carry out his fraud; misappropriated at least $1.6 million of client funds for personal use; and engaged in unauthorized margin trading during a six year period beginning in 1992 and ending in March 1998.

The Commission filed its complaint in the Northern District of Georgia, Atlanta Division, on August 19, 1999.  , According to the Complaint, Amy Goodson learned of the impending acquisition of VeriFone by Hewlett-Packard during a VeriFone corporate retreat.  That night, concerned about the possible impact the acquisition would have on her career, Amy telephoned Floyd G. and told him about the acquisition and her career concerns.   Floyd G. then telephoned his father, James G., and informed him of the pending acquisition.  Hours later, James G. purchased VeriFone option contracts.

Previously, on January 18, 2002, the Commission temporarily suspended trading in New Energy securities (OTC BB: NECO) because of questions concerning the adequacy and accuracy of publicly disseminated information.  Late Friday afternoon, the Honorable Margaret M. Morrow, United States District Judge for the Central District of California, issued a temporary restraining order halting the manipulative scheme., Named in the emergency action are:  New Energy, a San Diego startup company that markets solar generators; Marcelino Colt (Colt), a Panamanian citizen residing in Panama and Mexico, who claims to be an investment banker; Geneva Financial Ltd. (Geneva), a Nevis corporation which purports to be an international investment banker; Magnum Financial, LLC, dba Stratos Research LLC (Magnum), a California limited liability company that provides public and investor relations services; Michael S. Manahan (Manahan), age 46, of Harbor City, California, who is Magnums president; and Tor Ewald (Ewald), age 36, of La Jolla, California, who is New Energys Secretary,  Treasurer, and largest shareholder., The Commissions complaint alleges that Colt orchestrated an Internet scheme, including the hiring of an investor relations firm to post a false and misleading buy recommendation, the distribution of mass e-mails or spam containing fraudulent statements, and posting a false and misleading press release onto New Energys website.  The scheme artificially inflated New Energys stock price 122%, from $4.75 on December 19, 2001 to a high of $10 per share on January 9, 2002, and continuing until January 18, 2002, when the Commission suspended trading.  During the pump, Colt, Geneva and other members of the scheme sold their New Energy shares into the rising market., <u>The False Research Report</u>.  At Colts urging, as the complaint further alleges, New Energy hired Manahan and his investor relations firm, Magnum, to post a purported stock analysts research report onto the Internet about New Energy under the name of Magnums research arm, Stratos Research LLC (Stratos).  The Commission further alleges that Magnum merely copied a research report that Colt supplied to it, without doing any actual analysis or investigation.  Magnums research report touts New Energy in glowing terms stating: This is one of the highest recommended BUYS <i>ever</i> published.  (Emphasis in the original)  The research report makes at least five false and misleading statements, including false and misleading claims regarding a relationship with the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (DWP), negotiations with Coca-Cola bottlers in Mexico for thermal generators, and false claims that New Energys partner had a virtual <i>lock</i> on the world market for high concentration (HCPV) solar cells (emphasis in the original)., <u>The False Press Release</u>.  The Commission further alleges that, on January 3, 2002, New Energy issued a press release containing false and misleading statements about a contract between New Energy and an agricultural packaging concern.  The release, which was posted onto New Energys website, falsely claims that the contract was for 10 years with a potential to supply up to 100 megawatts of power.  In fact, the Commission alleges, the contract is only for five years, with the potential for only 10 megawatts of power.  The Commission further alleges that the press release contains a made-up quote purportedly from the agricultural packaging concerns president.  , <u>Post Trading Suspension Press Releases</u>.  The complaint alleges that Ewald failed to take any action to correct the false statements in the research report and press release.  The Commission further alleges that on January 31, 2002, the defendants posted two additional press releases onto the Internet which perpetuated the fraudulent scheme.  The first press release, listing New Energy as the source, claims to correct the January 3 press release but fails to correct the key false and misleading claims about the contract, namely its duration and the actual planned needs of the customer, and fails to acknowledge that the January 3 press release contains a made-up quote from New Energys purported customer.  The second press release, listing Stratos as the source, states that the research report has been withdrawn temporarily pending review and that the report may contain errors, even though, as the Commission alleges, the defendants previously admitted to the false statements., On Friday, the Court:  (1) granted the Commissions application for a temporary restraining order; (2) froze the assets of several of the defendants; (3) prohibited the destruction of documents by the defendants; (4) ordered accountings from several of the defendants; and (5) granted expedited discovery.  A hearing on whether a preliminary injunction should be issued against the defendants is scheduled for February 11, 2002.   , The Commission obtained an order temporarily restraining the defendants from committing securities fraud in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The order also temporarily restrains Geneva and Colt from violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.  In addition to the interim relief granted Friday, the Commission seeks a final judgment against the defendants enjoining them from future violations of the foregoing antifraud provisions, and ordering Geneva and Colt to disgorge all ill-gotten gains, and assessing civil penalties against them., The Commission also sought and obtained an order temporarily freezing the assets of relief defendants Hector Campa (Campa), of San Ysidro, California; Burke T. Maxfield (Maxfield), age 52, of Kaysville, Utah; York Chandler (Chandler), of Salt Lake City, Utah; Barclay Davis (Barclay), age 54, of Las Vegas, Nevada; and his wife, Loretta Davis (Loretta), age 58, also of Las Vegas, Nevada, who together received more than $440,000 in cash and New Energy stock from Geneva and Colt during the scheme.  The Commission also seeks a final judgment against Campa, Maxfield, Chandler, Barclay and Loretta, ordering them to disgorge all ill-gotten gains.  The Commission does not allege that these relief defendants violated the securities laws, but rather that they received proceeds from the fraud.  , The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the National Association of Securities Dealers in this investigation. , For tips on how to avoid Internet investment schemes, visit <a href=/investor/pubs/cyberfraud.htm>http://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/cyberfraud.htm</a>. , For more information about Internet fraud, visit <a href=/divisions/enforce/internetenforce.htm> http://www.sec.gov/divisions/enforce/internetenforce.htm</a>. , To report suspicious activity involving possible Internet fraud, visit <a href=/complaint.shtml>http://www.sec.gov/complaint.shtml</a>., ]"

Brenden Gebben (Gebben) violated Section 17(b) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), the anti-touting provision of the Securities Act.   The previous day, on January 29, 2002, U.S. District Court Judge Jeanne E. Scott directed a verdict in the Commissions favor on its claim that Gebben violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act)., Gebben was the Lead Analyst and Assistant Director of Research and Communications of Strategic Investment Advisory (SIA), a company based in Springfield, Illinois.   The Commissions complaint alleged that Gebben, along with co-defendants Wayne F. Gorsek, Lyndell Parks, and Troy Justus, fraudulently promoted approximately 20 microcap companies through SIA.  The Complaint alleged that SIA deceived investors into believing that it was an independent securities research firm providing objective investment advice about undiscovered companies.  In fact, the SEC alleged, SIA was merely a paid promotional firm that uncritically published glowingly optimistic recommendations of the securities of its clients in exchange for cash and securities.    , In April 2001,  Judge Scott granted the Commissions motion for summary judgment against defendants Gorsek and Parks and found them liable for violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(b) of the Securities Act for their conduct at SIA.   The Court will hold further proceedings on the Commissions claims that Gorsek and Parks defrauded their brokerage customers in violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder,  while they were registered representatives and owners of Strategic Investments, Inc., a Springfield, Illinois-based broker-dealer.  , The Court also previously entered a consent judgment against defendant Justus that permanently restrained and enjoined him from violating Sections 17(a) and (b) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Cal.) (Feb. 5, 2002), <p align=CENTER><b>SEC CHARGES TWO FORMER CRITICAL PATH EXECUTIVES<br/>WITH SECURITIES FRAUD</b>, The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil action today charging two former executives of Critical Path, Inc., a California company that provides e-mail services, with participating in a scheme to inflate the companys revenues and earnings for fiscal 2000.  Named in the complaint were David A. Thatcher, 46, of Rancho Santa Fe, California, the former president of Critical Path, and Timothy J. Ganley, 45, of Aptos, California, a former vice-president of sales at the company.  Separately, the Commission instituted and settled an administrative proceeding against Critical Path charging the firm with violations of the periodic reporting, books and records, and internal control provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  , The complaint filed in the civil action alleges that during 2000 and early 2001 Thatcher and other Critical Path employees caused Critical Path to record revenue from eight fictitious, contingent, or backdated transactions in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2000.  As a result, Critical Path improperly recorded revenue totaling approximately $10.8 million during fiscal 2000.  During part of that period Thatcher was the acting Chief Financial Officer for the company.  As a result of the conduct, the net loss reported by Critical Path in its Form 10-Q for the third quarter of 2000 was understated by over 50 percent.  On January 18, 2001, Critical Path issued a press release announcing its financial results for 2000, and the improperly recorded revenue was included in the results released, causing Critical Paths net loss for the year to be understated by over 27 percent.  Before Critical Path filed its annual report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2000, the scheme unraveled, and in February 2001, the company announced that it would revise its previously reported results to reverse improperly recorded transactions.  Following that announcement, Critical Paths share price plunged approximately 70 percent.  , The Commissions complaint also charges that Ganley participated in one of the eight transactions, a fictitious sale for which Critical Path improperly recorded revenue of $2 million, and alleges that Ganley then illegally sold 1,300 shares of Critical Path stock in January 2001 based on information he possessed about the fraud and the companys true financial condition.  , Simultaneously with the filing of the Commissions complaint, without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, Thatcher and Ganley consented to the entry of final judgments imposing the relief detailed below.  , As to Thatcher:, , , , In addition, Thatcher has agreed to the issuance of a Commission order, pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the Commissions Rules of Practice, denying him the privilege of appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant, based on the entry of the injunction.   , As to Ganley:, , , , , , In the related administrative proceeding against Critical Path, without admitting or denying the Commissions findings, Critical Path consented to an order finding that the company violated the periodic reporting, books and records, and internal control provisions of the Exchange Act.  The order directs Critical Path to cease and desist from committing or causing violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 13a-13.  <i><a href=/litigation/admin/34-45393.htm>In the Matter of Critical Path, Inc.</a>,</i> Exchange Act Release No. 34-45393, February 5, 2002.    , In a related matter, the United States Attorneys Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Thatcher and Ganley.  , The Commission thanks the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Northern District of California and the Federal Bureau of Investigation for their cooperation in this matter.  , The Commissions investigation in this matter is continuing., ]"

The judgment requires Silverman to pay a civil penalty of $20,000, and the judgment requires Prodani to pay $35,000 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and a $15,000 penalty. , In related administrative proceedings instituted February 6, 2002, the Commission suspended Silverman from associating with a broker or dealer for a period of six months and suspended Prodani from associating with a broker or dealer for a period of nine months.  , Both Silverman and Prodani consented to the entry of the judgments and the suspensions without admitting or denying the allegations made by the Commission.  , In the injunctive action, the Commission alleged the following:    , From approximately June through September 1994, David Blech, the chief executive officer of D. Blech &amp; Co., Inc., orchestrated a massive manipulative scheme designed to increase or stabilize the prices of a number of the biotechnology securities for which D. Blech &amp; Co. was a market maker.  Silverman, the head trader at D. Blech &amp; Co., and Prodani, a trader at another broker-dealer, participated in this scheme.  As part of this scheme, David Blech routinely sold biotechnology stocks from D. Blech &amp; Co.s inventory accounts to brokerage accounts that Blech controlled that were in the names of other individuals and entities.  These controlled accounts then sold the biotechnology stocks back to the brokerage firm or to other accounts controlled by David Blech.  These trades created the appearance of active trading in the biotechnology stocks.  Additionally, through this trading, Blech was able to reduce D. Blech &amp; Co.s inventory position in the biotechnology stocks, yet still artificially withhold from the market the supply of the biotechnology stocks.  , Silverman personally executed manipulative trades at David Blechs direction and supervised other traders at D. Blech &amp; Co. who executed manipulative trades.  For instance, Silverman executed unauthorized transactions in customer accounts, including wash sales and matched orders, and parked securities in various customer accounts.  Prodani also executed numerous manipulative trades in firm accounts and customer accounts maintained at the broker-dealer, including wash sales and matched orders.  Additionally, Prodani, who was the registered representative for various customer accounts at the broker-dealer, executed purchases and sales in those accounts at David Blechs direction without consulting the account holders.]"

Moody, Virtual Private Marketplace, Ltd., and Billpay Systems LLC from engaging in the fraudulent offer and sale of securities.  , The Commissions complaint alleges that, beginning in 2001, Gary Moody and his brother Steven Moody, lured investors to send their money to Virtual Private Marketplace, Ltd. and Billpay Systems LLC by promising them astronomical investment returns in a short time to be paid out in coupons that could be used at various retail stores.  Defendants have raised over $500,000 by falsely claiming that the Moodys were experienced businessmen, had raised a billion dollars, and that Gary Moody was soon to receive four doctorate degrees from Harvard University.

In addition, there is no evidence that the investors funds have been placed in income generating investments.  Instead, investors funds have been placed in bank accounts controlled by the Moodys and investors are currently being paid their alleged returns with checks that have bounced, while others have received just a fraction of their original investment., In addition to temporary restraining orders prohibiting further violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, the Court ordered an asset freeze, expedited discovery, an accounting, and other interim relief.

Goldstein and Noe and their Great American Trust companies served as the primary offerors of the investment programs that comprised the fraud scheme, while the other defendants served as finders or selling agents, locating and luring potential investors to Goldstein and Noe and receiving finders fees.  , The programs, which were promoted <i>via</i> the Internet and an intricate network of so-called consultants or finders, featured the use of so-called prime bank instruments, wholly fictional securities purportedly traded on an equally fictitious secondary market., <b><u>The Venture Capital Financing Program</u></b>, In this program, Goldstein and Noe offered, at a price of  $10,000 per each $1,000,000 of financing sought by the investor, so-called prime bank guarantees and standby letters of credit, promising that the purchasers of these instruments could use them as collateral to secure much larger bank loans.  After obtaining the bank loans, the alleged victims were required to provide the loan proceeds to Goldstein and Noe, who promised to place the funds in a high-yield investment program or HYIP.  Goldstein and Noe promised that the HYIP would, through private financing transactions with unknown foreign persons or entities, not only generate returns sufficient to pay back the original bank loan, but also generate millions of dollars in additional returns.   The Commissions Complaint alleges that the Venture Capital Financing Program was simply a sham, through which Goldstein and Noe would appropriate investor funds for their own personal use.  , <b><u>The 100% Return High-Yield Program</u></b>, The Complaint further alleges that Goldstein and Noe also offered to place investor funds into a series of complex (and wholly fabricated) trading programs that involved obtaining letters of credit, selling those letters of credit at a discount, and then using the proceeds from these sales to fund a high-yield trading program that promised astronomical returns of up to 100% per week.  The Complaint alleges that this program was also a total sham that only profited Goldstein, Noe and the other defendants.  , Concurrently with the SEC action, the Office of the United States Attorney for the District of South Carolina has filed criminal charges against Goldstein and Noe for their roles in the investment scheme, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation has arrested those individuals. , In its Complaint, the Commission alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Commission seeks permanent injunctions against future violations of the anti-fraud provisions, disgorgement of defendants ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. , The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the South Carolina offices of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the United States Attorney., For more information about prime bank frauds, visit the SECs Prime Bank Information Center at <a href=/divisions/enforce/primebank.shtml>http://www.sec.gov/divisions/enforce/primebank.shtml</a>.

Named also in the complaint as relief defendants are John Kramers wife Nancy Kramer, his daughter Elizabeth Kramer Whitney, his client Lucien D. Yokana, and two family partnerships he controlled, Northeast Investment Properties (Northeast Investment) and Vermont Capital Investors (Vermont Capital).  Jeffrey Kramer, Richard Pulling, Keith Pulling, and Yokana have agreed to settlements with the Commission.      , The complaint alleges that on two separate occasions in 2000, Jeffrey Kramer obtained material nonpublic information while working in the trust division of a national bank located in Hartford, Connecticut, and misused that information to earn illegal profits trading stock.  The complaint further alleges that in each instance, he also tipped his father John Kramer and his friend Richard Pulling, and Richard Pulling then tipped his brother Keith Pulling.  Both times, John Kramer, Richard Pulling, and Keith Pulling made improper use of the nonpublic or inside information to obtain illegal trading profits.  The complaint alleges that collectively, the defendants made approximately $620,000 in illegal trading profits.  , The complaint alleges that no later than June 14, 2000, Jeffrey Kramer learned that a customer of the bank he worked for was forming a trust for the purpose of acquiring Justin Industries, Inc. (Justin).  Between June 14 and June 19, 2000, Jeffrey Kramer, John Kramer, Richard Pulling. and Keith Pulling purchased 40,750 shares of Justin stock.  On June 20, 2000, Justin announced that it had agreed to a cash tender offer made by another company, and the price of Justin stock rose in response to the announcement.  Following the June 20, 2000 announcement, the defendants sold the Justin stock they had purchased for total illicit profits of $185,650.  The complaint further alleges that by August 7, 2000, Jeffrey Kramer learned that the same customer was forming another trust for the purpose of acquiring Republic Group, Inc. (Republic).

No. 96-2416) (USDC/DC), On January 28, 2002, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia entered a Final Judgment of Permanent Injunction against Don Haywood Pace.  Don Pace was the chief executive officer and a director of Pace American Group, Inc., a holding company that wrote surety bonds and insurance products through wholly-owned subsidiaries.  Pace American and its chief financial officer had previously been sanctioned in settled actions., The Commission filed this civil lawsuit against Pace in October 1996.  The complaint alleged violations of the antifraud, proxy, books and records and other provisions of the federal securities laws.    The Commissions lawsuit was stayed for several years pending the outcome of Paces criminal trial in U.S. District Court in Tucson, Arizona on related criminal charges.  After a jury trial in the criminal case in late 2000, Pace was convicted on some wire fraud and tax fraud charges, and acquitted on others.  He was found to have diverted for his own use more than $36,000 in bond premiums that a Mexican surety insurance company had deposited into two of the companys corporate financial accounts in Mexico.  On July 23, 2001, the criminal court sentenced Pace to serve four months in prison and four months house arrest, and it ordered him to pay restitution of the $36,659.28 that he was found to have taken from Pace American.  Pace has appealed his criminal conviction.  , Following the criminal trial, the Commission amended its civil complaint, leaving the two allegations on which Pace was tried criminally.  The Commission then sought summary judgment on the allegation related to the criminal conviction.  On November 29, 2001, United States District Judge James Robertson granted summary judgment in favor of the Commission on that allegation.  The court ruled that Pace had committed antifraud violations by failing to disclose in Pace Americans annual reports, proxy materials and registration statements filed with the Commission that he had received these bond premiums, and that Pace had caused Pace American to maintain false books and records because he failed to have the companys books and records reflect that he diverted these bond premiums to his personal bank account.  Accordingly, on January 28, 2002, the court entered a Final Judgment of Permanent Injunction enjoining Pace from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b), 13(b)(5) and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13b2-1 and 14a-9 thereunder.

The Commissions Complaint alleges that over the last six years, while he worked at two different brokerage firms, Gruttadauria, 44, of Gates Mills Ohio, stole at least $40 million in the course of defrauding more than 50 clients.  Also charged with securities fraud were two entities controlled by Gruttadauria, DH Strategic Partners, Inc. and JYM Trading Trust, which Gruttadauria used to misappropriate the funds from his clients.  The Commission also is seeking a temporary restraining order, a preliminary injunction, asset freezes, accountings, the appointment of a receiver for Gruttadauria, DH Strategic Partners, and JYM Trading Trust, as well as other emergency relief.  A hearing has been scheduled for Tuesday, February 26 on the Commissions motions., The Commissions complaint alleges that over a period of many years, Gruttadauria falsely told customers that he had bought or sold securities for their accounts, when, in fact, he had misappropriated their funds for his own purposes.  He also materially misrepresented the value of and the positions held in customer accounts, often falsely telling customers that their accounts contained a wide variety of holdings worth millions of dollars.  In some instances, Gruttadauria induced customers to give him funds by claiming that he had opened accounts for them when, in fact, no account ever existed for the client and he simply misappropriated the funds., The complaint alleges that Gruttadauria misappropriated funds from customers and directed the funds to other customers either as purported returns on non-existent investments or to satisfy withdrawal requests from accounts as to which Gruttadauria had deceived the account holders into believing that they had sufficient funds to make transfers.  In particular, from at least 1996 through October 2000, while employed at Cowen &amp; Co. and SG Cowen Securities Corporation, Gruttadauria misappropriated over $25 million in customer funds by fraudulently directing the money into an account that he controlled in the name of JYM Trading Trust, and using it to make payments to other customers.  Beginning in October 2000, Gruttadauria similarly misappropriated and funneled over $15 million in customer funds through a bank account he controlled in the name of DH Strategic Partners, Inc., The complaint further alleges that, to conceal his fraud, Gruttadauria created and sent defrauded customers unauthorized and falsified account statements that greatly overstated the value of the customers accounts, reflected holdings that did not exist and securities transactions that had never occurred, and failed to disclose the unauthorized withdrawals from the accounts.  The most recent false account statements for the accounts of at least 50 of Gruttadaurias customers reflected an aggregate value of about $278 million, whereas the actual value of accounts held for these customers at Lehman Brothers was about $1.8 million.  Without the knowledge or authorization of these customers, Gruttadauria caused their actual brokerage account statements to be sent to entities or post office boxes under his control., The Commissions complaint charges Gruttadauria, DH Strategic Partners, Inc. and JYM Trading Trust with violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5., The complaint also names as relief defendants Sarah Z.

Tyler, of Fort Worth, Texas, and his company, Advanced Financial Services, Inc. (AFS), a Texas corporation headquartered in Fort Worth.  The Court found that Tyler and AFS made material misrepresentations and omissions that were unquestionably deliberate and clearly intentional in connection with fraudulent sales of AFS-issued investments backed by viaticals. (Viaticals are interests in the death benefits of insurance policies insuring the lives of terminally ill persons.)  The Court further stated that Tyler and AFS made false guarantees about the investments liquidity, interest rates and `fixed maturity dates and that Tyler failed to disclose his commissions for the sales.  Thus, the Court concluded that the Defendants actions adequately demonstrate an intentional pattern to deceive.  In addition to the granting of a preliminary injunction and the appointment of a receiver, the court also ordered an asset freeze and an interim accounting, prohibited the alteration or destruction of documents and authorized expedited discovery., The Commission alleged in its complaint, filed February 11, 2002, that since May 1998, the defendants raised at least $30 million and that Tyler personally reaped over $5.2 million in undisclosed commissions, by fraudulently enticing more than 480 mostly elderly investors into purchasing investments issued by his company, AFS.  According to the Commission, Tyler deceived the elderly investors with false guarantees about the AFS investments liquidity, above-market interest rates and fixed maturity dates.  Tyler used investors funds to buy viaticals which rendered the guarantees false because, by definition, viaticals are illiquid investments with no fixed maturity dates and uncertain rates of return.  Tyler hid the fact that the underlying viaticals could not fulfill the promises that he had made to investors and that the investors had to rely on him and AFS to carry through on the promises of guaranteed returns, fixed maturities and liquidity.  Two weeks before the Commission filed its suit, Tyler and AFS both filed for bankruptcy., The Commission also named as relief defendants in its action two Tyler-controlled limited partnerships, Granbury Plaza Ltd. (Granbury Plaza) and Benbrook Lake L.P. (Benbrook Lake), and a Tyler-controlled Texas corporation, FWLT Holding Company (FWLT).  The relief defendants received investor funds totaling $116,000, $1,000,000 and $325,000, respectively.  The court also subjected the relief defendants to his receivership order and further ordered an asset freeze of their assets and an interim accounting.  The Commission seeks the return of all investor funds received, with pre-judgment interest., In its complaint, the Commission charges Tyler and AFS with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In addition, the Commission charges the defendants with violations of the securities registration provisions, Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act.  The Commission also seeks disgorgement with pre-judgment interest and a civil money penalty against the defendants.  Further, the Commission seeks an order finding that Tyler is in violation of a May 17, 2001, Order to Cease and Desist entered in <i>the Matter of Larry W.

Specifically, Trans Energy issued press releases in October 2000 touting a supposed $612 million worth of oil reserves.  The Complaint alleged that Trans Energy had no reasonable basis to value the potential reserves at that amount.  The Complaint further alleged that in a November 2000 posting on its website, Trans Energy inaccurately minimized the significance of the going concern statement included in its most recent filing with the Commission at a time when Trans Energys ability to continue as a going concern was greatly in doubt.  Additionally, the Commission claimed that in a December 2000 press release about its Chapter 7 bankruptcy, Trans Energy misled the investing public by failing to disclose that the bankruptcy arose from Trans Energys inability to pay a $600,665.36 consent judgment entered earlier that year, and that a Chapter 7 trustee had been appointed.  Finally, the Complaint alleged that Trans Energys Commission filings from 1998 through 2000 misrepresented the status of, or failed to disclose the existence of, material lawsuits that resulted in over $1 million in consent judgments against the company.  The Complaint alleged that Bagley and Woodburn, as Trans Energys only officers, knew or were reckless in not knowing that the above statements were false and misleading.]"

The action alleges that Haver, age 43, of Akron, Ohio, intentionally or recklessly caused Telxon to improperly recognize revenue of $23.1 million from three significant transactions.  Havers improper conduct inflated Telxons quarterly revenues by 23% and quarterly profits by 270%, from a loss of $7.3 million to a falsely stated profit of $4.1 million.  The suit also alleges that Haver aided and abetted reporting, books and records, and record keeping violations by Telxon related to the September 1998 quarter and related to additional violations by Telxon from its two previous fiscal years, involving a further $16.6 million of profits that were restated.  Telxon is headquartered in Akron, Ohio and, prior to being acquired by another company in December 2000, was a leading manufacturer of hand held computers and related systems., The Commissions complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, alleges that Havers fraudulent actions took place shortly after Telxon had rejected merger offers from a competitor.  One of the September 1998 transactions involved a $2 million sale of software that was not yet written.  A second transaction involved a $7 million lease-purchase by a near-bankrupt customer and Havers agreement, on Telxons behalf, to guarantee the customers lease payments.  The third transaction involved a $14.1 million sale to a financing company and Havers agreement, on Telxons behalf, to accept unlimited return of the product.  The $16.6 million in profits restated for Telxons fiscal years prior to September 1998 concerned Havers failure, as Chief Financial Officer, properly to account for several customers that had delayed or disputed various payments due Telxon.  , In a related action, the Commission also announced that it has instituted, and settled, an administrative proceeding against Telxon and two of its former officers:  Gary L.

In response to this tip, Villa instructed one of his senior colleagues at Multinvestments to buy Nalco stock for Multinvestments proprietary account.  Pursuant to Villas instructions, Multinvestments, through its proprietary account, purchased 50,000 Nalco shares for $2,015,625.  In purchasing Nalco shares, Multinvestments used margin privileges and also used the maximum amount available in its proprietary account without violating the firms net capital requirements. , On June 28, 1999, Nalco and Suez jointly announced that they had signed a definitive merger agreement, calling for Suez to pay $53.00 per Nalco share, representing a $10.50 premium over the June 25 closing price of $42.50.

A single message about Hayes, and the first of three       messages concerning ChatCom, contained materially false information       intended to make the recipient believe that the stock price of each       company was going to skyrocket.       , The complaint specifically alleges that Lester sent his false e-mails       in the hopes of fooling the recipient into thinking that he or she had       accidentally been copied on a private e-mail between two other persons.       According to the complaint, Lester wanted to make the spam e-mails seem       believable and intended for the recipients to purchase the stock of Hayes       and ChatCom. Lesters scheme was designed to drive up the stock price and       thus provide him the opportunity to sell at a profit the stock that he had       previously purchased.       , With respect to Hayes, Lester sent a single e-mail falsely claiming       that Hayes was about to announce a deal with AT&amp;T to make all the       cable modems for AT&amp;T, Comcast, and Microsoft. Lester sent this e-mail       to a large number of persons using a mass-mailing program that he had       previously downloaded from the Internet. Lesters fraudulent July 28, 1999       spam e-mail concerning Hayes had a material impact on its stock price and       trading volume. Over the next trading day, the closing price of Hayes       stock more than doubled, its market capitalization increased by over $1       million, and its trading volume spiked 77-fold.       , The complaint further alleges that Lester took steps to hide his       identity. He created a fictitious pseudonym and disguised the spam e-mails       with a forged message header to make it appear that the pseudonym had sent       the messages. He also transmitted the fraudulent spams through the e-mail       accounts of two persons for whom he had installed AOL accounts. At the       time, Lester was a part-time computer network installer through his       company, Chattanooga Business Systems. While installing those customers       AOL accounts, he had kept their passwords.       , Simultaneously with the filing of the complaint, Lester consented,       without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions       complaint, to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him       from violating the antifraud provisions contained within Section 17(a) of       the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange       Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, but which does not       impose a monetary penalty based upon his sworn Statement of Financial       Condition and other documents submitted to the Commission.       , For tips on how to avoid Internet pump and dump stock manipulation       schemes, visit <a href=http://www.sec.gov/investor/online/pump.htm target=_top>http://www.sec.gov/investor/online/pump.htm</a>.

Raece Richardson, David McKenzie, Cameron Gorges, and Freestar Technologies, Civil Action No. 1:02CV00426 (Judge Friedman) (filed March 6, 2002), <p align=CENTER><b>SEC CHARGES FORMER OFFICERS OF FREEDOM SURF, INC.</b><br/><b>WITH ACCOUNTING FRAUD</b><br/><b>FORMER AUDITOR NAMED IN ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING</b>, The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed an action charging Raece Richardson and David McKenzie, formerly the President and Vice President of Freedom Surf, Inc., respectively, with securities fraud, for falsifying Freedom Surfs financial statements.  Richardson, 37 years old, is a resident of Huntington Beach, California.  McKenzie, 42 years old, is a former resident of Huntington Beach, who is currently living in Costa Rica.    The Commissions complaint alleges that the two included $5.18 million in fraudulently-valued assets on Freedom Surfs financial statements filed with the Commission between January and November 2000.  Freedom Surf, now known as Freestar Technologies, Inc., is located in the Dominican Republic.  Also charged were Cameron Gorges, a friend of Richardson, who provided a phony appraisal of the equipment to assist the scheme, and Freestar Technologies as successor to Freedom Surf.  The companys former auditor, James P. Slayton, CPA, was charged in a separate administrative proceeding., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, Freestar Technologies McKenzie and Gorges each consented to the entry of final judgments of permanent injunction.  Under the terms of the settlements, the Court did not order McKenzie or Gorges to pay civil money penalties based on their sworn statements of financial condition and other documents submitted to the SEC.  Richardson is currently a defendant in another securities fraud action that the Commission filed in April 2001. See <u>SEC v. First Americap Corp, et. al.</u>, Civil Action No. H 01-1153 (S.D. Tex.), Lit. Release No.16960 (April 12, 2001).  In the action filed today, the Commission is seeking an injunction, civil money penalties, and an order barring Richardson from serving as an officer or director of a public company in the future., The Commissions Complaint alleges that Richardson and McKenzie orchestrated a scheme to inflate Freedom Surfs assets with certain equipment located in Costa Rica and fraudulently valued at $5.18 million.  During the relevant period, this equipment comprised virtually all of Freedom Surfs assets.  Freedom Surf purportedly acquired the equipment in exchange for stock and a note in December 1999.  Richardson had Gorges fabricate and sign an appraisal, which valued the equipment at $5.18 million.  Gorges merely used numbers that McKenzie gave him.  Gorges had no experience valuing this type of equipment, never saw the equipment, and never performed any appraisal.  Gorges appraisal was then given to Slayton, the auditor, who failed to perform an audit and instead relied on the fabricated appraisal to issue an audit opinion for Freedom Surfs financial statements.  Subsequently, Freedom Surf reported the sale of the equipment in a sham transaction with another company controlled by Richardson.  Freedom Surf included the fraudulent equipment valuation or the sham sale of the equipment in a registration statement, periodic reports, and other filings with the Commission between January and November 2000., The Commissions Complaint alleges violations of the antifraud, record keeping, internal controls, and periodic reporting provisions of the federal securities laws.  Specifically, the Complaint charges Richardson and McKenzie with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting Freestars violations of Sections 12(g), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13.  Freestar Technologies is charged with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b), 12(g), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13.  Cameron Gorges is charged with aiding and abetting Richardsons, McKenzies, and Freestars violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Richardsons and McKenzies violations of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-2.      , Simultaneous with the filing of the Commissions Complaint, the Division of Enforcement and the Office of the Chief Accountant instituted an administrative proceeding against Slayton charging that he violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5, caused and willfully aided and abetted Freestars violations of Section 12(g) and Rule 12b-20 of the Exchange Act; and engaged in improper professional conduct in his audit of Freedom Surf.   Slayton is currently a respondent in another Commission administrative proceeding that charges similar violations in connection with Slaytons audits of another company, California Software Corporation.  <u>In the Matter of James E. Slayton, CPA</u>, Exchange Act Release No. 45245 (Jan. 7, 2002).      , In a related matter, the Commission today issued an order barring John C. Cruickshank, Jr., a former Freedom Surf director, from appearing or practicing before the Commission based on his disbarment by the State Bar of California and on his prior felony conviction for cocaine distribution. Cruickshank prepared and filed all of Freedom Surfs SEC filings involved in this matter.      , The investigation is continuing to determine if there were other violations of the federal securities laws., ]"

The judgment, entered by U.S. District Judge Virginia A. Philips on July 28, 2000 after the defendants default, permanently enjoins all three defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws:  Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The judgment also enjoins American Telephone + Data, Inc. from violating the periodic reporting, books and records and internal controls provisions of the securities laws:  Exchange Act Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(b) and Rules 12b-20, 13a-11 and 13a-13 thereunder.  It also enjoins William Posnett Lynas, III and his wife, Janeen Hauxhurst-Lynas, from violating the accounting controls provisions of the securities laws, Section 13(b)(5) and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder, permanently bars both of them from acting as an officer or director of a public company, pursuant to Section 21(d)(2) of the Exchange Act, and orders them to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $1,679,669.07, for which they are jointly and severally liable.  , The default judgment was entered on the Commissions complaint alleging that William Posnett Lynas, III, and his wife, Janeen Hauxhurst-Lynas, both of Newport Beach, California, controlled American Telephone + Data, Inc., a Costa Mesa company purportedly engaged in telecommunication businesses. The complaint alleged that during 1993 Lynas and Hauxhurst-Lynas filed with the Commission a series of materially false and misleading financial statements. Those financial statements included fictional assets, which resulted in the overstatement of the companys total assets by between 74% and 87%. Chief among these bogus assets were certain purported licensing rights to a high-speed facsimile transmission system that were valued on the companys balance sheets at $10 million. The licensing rights did not exist.  The complaint also alleged that Lynas and Hauxhurst-Lynas misappropriated corporate funds to pay personal expenses and engaged in insider trading. , The Commissions enforcement action is part of the Commissions four-pronged approach to attacking microcap fraud:  enforcement, inspections, investor education and regulation.

The Commissions complaint further alleges that Chrysikos acquired the material nonpublic information in the course of his employment at GE Capital, a wholly owned subsidiary of General Electric Company, and then tipped Michael Martello, in breach of Chrysikos duties to General Electric Company and to its shareholders. , The complaint alleges the following facts:  On July 26, 2001, at 9:48 p.m. E.S.T., a phone call was placed from Chrysikos home phone in New Jersey to Marie Martello in Whitestone, New York.  The next morning, at 8:25 a.m. E.S.T. and again at 9:55 a.m. E.S.T., calls were placed from Marie Martello to Michael Martello, who was in Taiwan at the time.  At 11:14 a.m. E.S.T., a phone call was placed from the Whitestone residence to Chrysikos direct dial number at GE Capital in Connecticut.  Three minutes later, at 11:17 a.m. E.S.T., another phone call was placed from the Whitestone residence to Taiwan.  Approximately twenty minutes later, at 11:38 a.m. E.S.T., a call was placed to the Whitestone residence from GE Capital in Connecticut.  Shortly thereafter, at 12:16 p.m. E.S.T., Marie Martello deposited $9,200 in cash at a Queens branch office of Citibank.  The cash was deposited into a Citibank account held in Michael Martellos name.  Twenty-one minutes later, at 12:37 p.m. E.S.T., Michael Martello began a dialogue by phone from Taiwan with a registered representative at Citicorp Investment Services, where Michael Martello maintained a brokerage account.  During the call, Michael Martello stated that he wanted to buy the maximum number of call options that he could with the approximately $11,000 he now had in his Citibank bank account, an account that is linked to his Citicorp Investment Services account.  After some back-and-forth, Michael Martello ultimately purchased 130 Heller Financial call options, leaving approximately $30 remaining in his account.  On July 30, 2001, the next trading day, GE Capital announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Heller Financial for a cash tender offer of $5.3 billion, or $53.75 per share.  On July 31, 2001, Michael Martello sold all 130 call options for $168,274.87, yielding a total realized profit of $157,259.09.  On that same day, Michael Martello transferred the $168,274.87 to a Citibank account held in Marie Martellos name.  Between August 27, 2001, and October 22, 2001, Marie Martello withdrew a total of $34,000 from the Citibank account.  Michael Martello is currently living in Belgium, and some of the proceeds have been transferred to him overseas.  , The Commission alleges that Chrysikos and Michael Martello, through tipping and insider trading, each violated Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3.  In its action, the Commission is seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement, with prejudgment interest thereon, and civil penalties from each of the defendants.  The Commission also sought, and today obtained, a temporary restraining order freezing certain Citicorp and Citibank brokerage and bank accounts that are held in the name of Michael Martello or Marie Martello and that received proceeds from the illegal trades.  , The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the American Stock Exchange in the investigation of this matter., ]"

The Commissions complaint alleges that beginning in 1997, AppOnline suffered operating losses and a cash shortage.  To address this problem, Paul Skulsky directed AppOnline to divert funds borrowed by AppOnline from warehouse banks that were specifically designated to fund specific mortgage loans and, instead, use those diverted funds to pay normal operating expenses.  From 1997 to 2000, Paul Skulsky, Jeffrey Skulsky, Capuano, and Eisele falsified AppOnlines accounting records and filed false and misleading quarterly and annual reports with the Commission.  AppOnlines filings on Forms 10-KSB for December 31, 1997 and 1998, and on Form 10-K for December 31, 1999 misrepresented, among other things, that the funds AppOnline had misappropriated from its lenders was a debt owed to The Skulsky Trust (a related party controlled by Paul Skulsky and Jeffrey Skulsky).

The complaint further alleges that Casuccio, Schneider, Chaitovsky, and Glass issued audit opinions that falsely stated that AppOnlines financial statements had been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and that these auditors had conducted their audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.  Finally, the complaint alleges that Chaitovsky and Glass violated the federal securities laws by failing to notify the Commission when they learned, during the course of their audit, that AppOnline had previously filed false financial reports with the Commission., <u>The Stock Manipulation Scheme</u>.  The Commissions complaint alleges that Paul Skulsky conspired with Nemiroff, Siclari, Carhart, Zelin, DElia, Brandwein, and Catapano (the Broker Defendants) to manipulate the public market for AppOnline stock.  As part of the scheme, Paul Skulsky paid bribes to the Broker Defendants in exchange for Ash, Worthington, and IBS agreeing to recommend the purchase of AppOnline stock to retail customers.  The complaint alleges that Paul Skulsky deposited AppOnline stock with Ash, Worthington, and IBS, and that those firms then sold more than 1.4 million AppOnline shares to investors, who paid more than $5.5 million for those shares. , The Commissions complaint charges that, as a result of the conduct described above: (i) Paul Skulsky, Jeffrey Skulsky, Capuano, Eisele, Casuccio, Schneider, and the Broker Defendants violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; (ii) Paul Skulsky, Jeffrey Skulsky, Capuano, Eisele, Casuccio and Schneider violated Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1; (iii) Chaitovsky and Glass violated Sections 10(b) and 10A of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5; (iv) Paul Skulsky, Jeffrey Skulsky, and Capuano are liable as control persons for AppOnlines violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13; and (v) Eisele, Casuccio, Schneider, Chaitovsky, and Glass are liable for aiding and abetting AppOnlines violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1.  The Commissions complaint seeks an order permanently enjoining each defendant and ordering them to pay civil penalties, and directing Paul Skulsky, Jeffrey Skulsky, Capuano, Eisele, Casuccio, Schneider, and the Broker Defendants to pay disgorgement plus prejudgment interest thereon.  The Commissions complaint also seeks an order barring Paul Skulsky, Jeffrey Skulsky, and Capuano from acting as an officer or director of a public company.  , The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in connection with this matter. , ]"

Worth Division)  , <p align=CENTER>OIL AND GAS STOCK PROMOTER RECEIVES 17 ½ YEAR PRISON SENTENCE FOR CONTEMPT, OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE AND MONEY LAUNDERING, The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on March 8, 2002, U. S. District Judge Sam R. Cummings in Lubbock, Texas, sentenced Sidney Wade Sers to 210 months in federal prison based on Sers guilty pleas to contempt of court, obstruction of justice and money laundering charges.  The criminal charges related to Sers illegal transfer of nearly $1million, in violation of 1997 and 1998 court orders issued by U. S. District Judge Terry Means of Fort Worth.  These orders were entered in a 1997 Commission enforcement action and enjoined the transfer of Sers assets, those of Trinity Gas Corporation (Trinity) and the proceeds of any sale of Trinity stock., At the time of the transfers, Sers, age 57, formerly of Brownwood, Texas, was the president and chief executive officer of Trinity, a Brownwood publicly traded oil and gas exploration and development company.  From January 1998 until his arrest, Sers was a fugitive hiding in Columbia.  Colombian authorities detained Sers on November 21, 2000 and deported him to Miami, Florida, where Sers was arrested by Federal Bureau of Investigation agents., In his guilty pleas before the Court, Sers admitted transferring $800,000 of Trinity stock proceeds deposited in a Natchitoches, Louisiana bank account bearing his daughters name to a Cayman Islands bank account styled in the name of Trinity Gas Colombia - a Cayman Islands company owned and controlled by Sers.  Sers also admitted laundering these proceeds through a number of transactions that involved the transfer of monies to Colombia, where he was hiding.  Among other illegal transfers, Sers also admitted transferring roughly $100,000 through a Brownwood, Texas abstract company, converting the proceeds into cashiers checks and subsequently cashing the checks., The Courts sentence stems from Judge Means contempt referral to the U.S. Attorneys Office which developed during the course of the Commissions enforcement action in which the Commission charged Trinity and Sers with bilking Trinity investors out of over $11 million in an illegal pump and dump scheme - a scheme in which a companys share price is pumped up through false representations followed by company principals dumping their individual shares at the illegally and artificially inflated price.  Judge Means later granted summary judgment in favor of the Commission against Sers and permanently enjoined him from violating the anti-fraud and securities registration provisions of the federal securities laws.  Additionally, Judge Means ordered Sers to disgorge $11,607,442.00, representing his profits from the unlawful scheme.  In the criminal case, Judge Cummings ordered Sers to make restitution of the same amount. , The Commissions staff worked closely with the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Northern District of Texas (Lubbock Division) and the FBI.

Gallo (Gallo), the former President and Chief Operating Officer of IGI, Inc. (IGI), for violations of the antifraud, periodic reporting, record keeping, internal controls and lying to auditors provisions of the federal securities laws.  The Complaint alleges that Gallo engaged in a fraudulent scheme to inflate IGIs assets, revenues and net income and to manage the companys reported earnings.  IGI, a small animal health and cosmetics company with its principal offices located in Buena, New Jersey, manufactures, among other things, poultry vaccines and other animal health products, pet products, and cosmetics and skin care products.  , In related actions, the Commission filed a settled antifraud injunctive action against Lawrence N. Zitto (Zitto), IGIs former Vice President of Operations, a settled civil penalty proceeding against Donald J. MacPhee (MacPhee), IGIs former Chief Financial Officer, and instituted and simultaneously settled administrative cease-and-desist proceedings against IGI, MacPhee, William A. Dickson (Dickson), IGIs former Production Manager for Poultry Vaccines, and Stephen P. Collins (Collins), IGIs former Manager of International Sales. , The Complaint against Gallo alleges that: , From fiscal year 1995 through the third quarter of fiscal year 1997, Gallo directed the former Vice President of Operations, the former Production Manager for Poultry Vaccines and, until the second quarter of fiscal year 1997, the former Chief Financial Officer, not to record properly the costs associated with reductions in IGIs inventory for large quantities of poultry vaccine that either were destroyed or were defective and could not be sold.  Gallo further directed IGIs former Chief Financial Officer to improperly account for destroyed or defective poultry vaccines as inventory reserves, instead of writing them off as the losses were realized in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.  Gallo also directed the former Chief Financial Officer to adjust inventory reserve balances to achieve his desired financial results.  , Gallo directed the former Vice President of Operations and the former Manager of International Sales to record revenue from the sale of IGI products prior to shipment in order to fraudulently increase IGIs revenues and to manipulate its earnings.  Gallo directed these individuals and the former Chief Financial Officer to hold IGIs books open after the quarter had ended and directed the former Vice President of Operations and the former Manager of International Sales to backdate sales invoices and shipping documents.  , Gallo directed the former Vice President of Operations and the former Manager for International Sales to delay approval of large sales credits until revenue levels were high enough to allow write-offs of the credits without affecting the companys ability to announce realization of its quarterly earnings targets.  Finally, in connection with the annual audits of IGIs financial statements for fiscal years 1995 and 1996, Gallo signed IGIs management representation letters, later given to IGIs independent auditors, that he knew, should have know, or was reckless in not knowing were materially false and misleading. , As a result of Gallos fraudulent conduct, IGI materially overstated its assets, revenues and net income for fiscal years 1995 and 1996, the interim quarters thereof, and for the first three quarters of fiscal year 1997, and IGI filed materially false and misleading reports and financial statements with the Commission for fiscal years 1995 and 1996, and for the first three quarters of fiscal year 1997., In its Complaint, the Commission requests that the Court issue a final judgment of permanent injunction and other relief restraining and enjoining Gallo from violating and/or aiding and abetting violations of the antifraud, periodic reporting, record keeping, internal controls and lying to auditors provisions of the federal securities laws, Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2.  In addition to civil money penalties, the Commission is seeking an order that Gallo be permanently barred from acting as an officer or director of any public company.  The Complaint also seeks an order that Gallo prepare an accounting of (a) all compensation and other remuneration he received as a result of IGI fraudulently misrepresenting that it had attained or exceeded any revenue, net income or other performance targets for fiscal years 1995, 1996 and 1997, including all bonuses or stock options he received, and (b) profits from all sales by him of IGI securities between January 1, 1995 and November 17, 1997, and from the sale of IGI securities resulting from his exercise of stock options after November 17, 1997.  Finally, the Commissions Complaint seeks an order that Gallo disgorge all such compensation, remuneration and trading profits, with prejudgment interest, and surrender to IGI all unexercised stock options.  , <b>SEC SETTLES FRAUD CHARGES WITH LAWRENCE N. ZITTO </b>, In a related action, the Commission filed a settled injunctive action against Lawrence N.

Polozola of the United States District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana issued a preliminary injunction with findings of fact and conclusions of law against Harral Dunbar, Jr., in his individual capacity and d/b/a Ghost International, an Internet Website operation.  The Courts order imposed a freeze on the defendants assets and ordered an accounting within 30 days.  The Court found that Dunbar, of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, owned the Ghost International Website and used it to solicit investors in investment contracts by promises of inordinate amounts of guaranteed returns and promises of no-risk investing, and further found that investors have received little or no return despite several months of promises by Dunbar that returns would be paid.    , In its order of preliminary injunction, the Court found that between mid-2001 and the present, Dunbar obtained over $7,500 from eleven investors in Canada, Australia and the United States by touting Ghost Internationals private contribution and investment program which allegedly paid, for example, $100,000 on a $200 investment over a few weeks.  Dunbar made various promises of returns, including ones up to 1000 percent.  Dunbar made various representations to fraudulently induce investors including that his company dealt in high yield investments and that funds were to be placed in offshore bank accounts, which would pay promised returns for five months of a supposed seven-month program.  The Court also concluded that Dunbar lulled investors by making promises that payments would be made shortly.   However, when the time elapsed, the promised payments were not forthcoming.   , The complaint charged Dunbar with, and the Court preliminarily enjoined Dunbar from, violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Piromalli, requiring him to pay $5,218,531.61 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest as well as an $110,000 civil penalty.  Piromalli masterminded a nationwide Ponzi scheme involving the offer and sale of unregistered nine-month promissory notes issued by World Vision Entertainment, Inc.

On August 27, 2001, Judge Graham had previously entered an Order of Permanent Injunction against Piromalli for his role in the World Vision scheme., Specifically, the Commissions Complaint, filed on June 1, 2000, alleged that from June 1996 to August 1999, Piromalli, Steven Brewer, A. Michael Jaillett, Richard Mann and Seth Miller (collectively, the Defendants), through World Vision, raised at least $64 million from approximately 1,200 investors in 33 states from the sale of promissory notes.  The Defendants offered and sold securities in the form of nine-month promissory notes without registering them with the Commission.  In furtherance of the scheme, the Defendants, directly and indirectly, through a nationwide sales network, made numerous false and misleading statements to investors about the World Vision notes.  For example, the Defendants misrepresented that the notes were unconditionally guaranteed and insured and that all of the proceeds of the offering would be used to develop World Visions products.  In reality, the notes were not guaranteed and the Defendants used the proceeds of the note offering to pay for the personal and business expenses of company officers and directors, to cover interest and principal payments to investors and to pay large, undisclosed commissions to the sales network.  As a result, when World Vision filed for bankruptcy protection in September 1999, investors lost approximately $52 million., On August 27, 2001, Piromalli was permanently enjoined from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

On February 21, 2002, the Commission filed a complaint charging Gruttadauria and two entities controlled by him, DH Strategic Partners, Inc. and JYM Trading Trust, with securities fraud.  On February 26, 2002, Judge Gaughan had granted the Commissions motion for a temporary restraining order against Gruttadauria and froze his assets.  Gruttadauria, who is in federal custody awaiting criminal charges, waived an appearance at the March 11 hearing and did not contest the entry of a preliminary injunction.  The court also continued the freeze on Gruttadaurias assets., The Commissions complaint alleges that over at least the last six years, while he worked at Lehman Brothers, Inc. and SG Cowen Securities Corporation, Gruttadauria, 44, of Gates Mills Ohio, stole at least $40 million in the course of defrauding more than 50 clients.  Gruttadauria falsely told customers that he had bought or sold securities for their accounts, when, in fact, he had misappropriated their funds for his own purposes.  He also materially misrepresented the value of and the positions held in customer accounts, often falsely telling customers that their accounts contained a wide variety of holdings worth millions of dollars.  In some instances, Gruttadauria induced customers to give him funds by claiming that he had opened accounts for them when, in fact, no account ever existed for the client and he simply misappropriated the funds.  The complaint also alleged that Gruttadauria misappropriated funds from customers and directed the funds to other customers either as purported returns on non-existent investments or to satisfy withdrawal requests from accounts as to which Gruttadauria had deceived the account holders into believing that they had sufficient funds to make transfers.  , The complaint further alleges that, to conceal his fraud, Gruttadauria created and sent defrauded customers unauthorized and falsified account statements that greatly overstated the value of the customers accounts, reflected holdings that did not exist and securities transactions that had never occurred, and failed to disclose the unauthorized withdrawals from the accounts.  The most recent false account statements for the accounts of at least 50 of Gruttadaurias customers reflected an aggregate value of about $278 million, whereas the actual value of accounts held for these customers at Lehman Brothers was about $1.8 million.  Without the knowledge or authorization of these customers, Gruttadauria caused their actual brokerage account statements to be sent to entities or post office boxes under his control.  , The Commissions complaint charged Gruttadauria, DH Strategic Partners, Inc. and JYM Trading Trust with violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws; Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5.  , The complaint also named as relief defendants Sarah Z.

Mallory, 41, of Boston, Massachusetts.  The court granted the emergency relief against Mallory and Anamar on March 15, based on the Commissions allegations in its complaint, filed the same day, that Mallory fraudulently offered and sold shares of Anamar stock, via the Internet and other means, to investors in at least four states.  The Commission alleged in its papers that, since August 2001, Mallory has raised at least $130,000 from at least 14 investors in Massachusetts, Ohio, Virginia and California, promising them they would double their money in as little as 90 days without risk.  Mallory falsely promised investors Verizon Communications, Inc. would buy the company by the end of 2001.  According to the Commission, several investors borrowed money from family members or high interest credit cards to invest, and some invested substantial portions of their life savings.    , According to the Commissions complaint, Mallory falsely told investors that, if they purchased Anamar stock at five cents per share, they would double their money in as little as 90 days because Verizon had agreed to purchase the company for ten cents per share by December 31, 2001.  Mallory also falsely told investors their investments would be risk-free because Verizon had agreed to pay Anamar an opt-out fee if the deal fell through.  According to the Commission, however, Verizon never offered or agreed to purchase Anamar, and investors have been unable to recover any of their investments.  The Commission alleges that Mallory offered additional shares of Anamar for sale in January 2002, falsely telling investors the Verizon transaction had closed, and that he had a meeting scheduled with Bill Gates of Microsoft Corporation.  According to the Commission, Mallory continues to solicit investments via Anamars Internet web site.

DISCOVERY CAPITAL GROUP, ERIK WALSH, AND JOHN ABRESCH, Case No. 02-60363-CIV-HUCK (S.D. Fla., filed March 14, 2002), The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC or the Commission) announced that on March 14, 2002 it filed an emergency federal civil action against Discovery Capital Group, Inc., a broker-dealer registered with the Commission since 1992, Erik Walsh, the Companys CEO, and John Abresch, the Companys vice president and director of institutional sales (collectively, defendants).  On the next day, the Honorable Paul T. Huck, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Florida, entered, among other things, a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze to halt the alleged on-going offering of securities by Discovery Capital, Walsh and Abresch.  The Court also entered an order appointing a Receiver over Discovery Capital., The Complaint, alleges the following: since at least June 2001 through the present, Discovery Capital has raised at least $2.7 million from investors in the U.S. and abroad through the sale of securities in the form of promissory notes and preferred stock.  Using high pressure, boiler-room tactics, sales agents employed by Discovery Capital falsely tell prospective investors, among other things, that Discovery Capital is affiliated with the well-known brokerage firm, E.F. Hutton, has partnered with major banks, or is poised to go public through an initial public offering (IPO).  In reality, Discovery Capital is a registered broker-dealer with minimal legitimate business activities - its primary business activity since November 2001 has been to raise investor funds for the benefit of its principals and sales agents, including over $500,000 to Defendant John Abresch.  The E.F. Hutton affilation was with a company recently formed by Walsh called E.F. Hutton &amp; Company, Inc. that had no ties to the original, and now defunct, E.F. Hutton.  In addition to paying themselves lucrative salaries and commissions, Defendants have failed to record on the books and records of Discovery Capital at least $1.3 million worth of loans, placing Discovery Capital in violation of net capital rules under the securities laws and, thereby, placing its brokerage customers at risk.  The Complaint also alleges that Walsh misappropriated at least $130,000 of the money raised from investors by improperly crediting those funds in Discovery Capitals books and records as his <i>own</i> capital contributions., As a result, the Commission alleges that Discovery Capital, Walsh and Abresch with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and Discovery Capital with additionally violating Sections 15(c) and 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 15c1-2, 15c3-1, 17a-3, 17a-4, 17a-5 and 17a-11 thereunder.

RICHARD GOETTLICH, ET AL., 97 Civ. 1144 (JAG)(D.N.J.), The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) announced today that First Interregional Equity Corp. (FIEC), a registered broker-dealer now in Securities Investor Protection Company (SIPC) liquidation, and First Interregional Advisors Corp. (FIAC), formerly an equipment lease finance company and now a debtor in bankruptcy proceedings under Chapter 11, agreed to settle a civil action charging FIEC and FIAC with participating in a massive Ponzi scheme that resulted in investor losses of over $100 million.    , In a complaint for injunctive and other relief filed on March 6, 1997, the Commission alleges, among other things, that defendants FIEC, FIAC and their former President, Richard Goettlich (Goettlich), defrauded investors by offering and selling purported interests in equipment leases.  Specifically, the defendants systematically purported to assign the entire receivable streams from individual equipment leases to investors after assigning them to one or more prior investors.  As a result of the fraud, FIEC, FIAC and Goettlich obtained approximately $295 million from investors -- an amount that exceeded FIACs actual lease receivable inventory by over $100 million., The Commissions complaint charged FIEC, FIAC and Goettlich, with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Sections 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5, and as to FIEC, violations of Section 15(c)(1) of the Exchange Act and Rule 15c1-2., When the action was commenced, the Commission obtained emergency relief to halt the fraud, including temporary restraining orders, preliminary injunctions, the appointment of receivers and asset freezes.  In addition, the Commission sought civil penalties and disgorgement of the defendants ill-gotten profits.  , Without admitting or denying the charges brought against them, the Chapter 11 Trustee for FIAC and the Trustee appointed under the Securities Investor Protection Act (SIPA) for FIEC consented to the entry of final consent judgments permanently enjoining them from violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities law on February 26, 2001 and December 21, 2001, respectively.  , On May 20, 1999, the Court entered a final judgment by default against Richard Goettlich, which permanently enjoined him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, ordered him to disgorge $123,900,000 in ill-gotten gains plus $23,275,277 in prejudgment interest; and required him to pay $123,900,000 in civil penalties.  The default judgment was entered after Goettlich failed to answer or otherwise respond to the Commissions complaint.  , In a separate action, the Commission has charged two other individuals for their roles in the FIAC-FIEC Ponzi scheme -- Anthony Gianninoto, formerly a financial operations principal of FIAC and FIEC, and Eileen Laine, formerly a data processing manager for those companies.  The Commissions case against those two individuals, who have also pleaded guilty to criminal charges arising out of this fraud, remains pending.   , For more information see Litigation Release Nos. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr15276.txt>15276</a>, <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr15979.txt.>15979</a> and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr16160.htm>16160</a>. <!-- <pre></pre><table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5><tr><td><IMG SRC=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=9 ALT=*  BORDER=0 ALIGN=absmiddle>&nbsp;</td><td><a href=/litigation/complaints/complr17421.htm>SEC Complaint</a> in this matter.</td></tr></table> -->]"

The Commission alleges that defendants raised at least $800,000 from at least 30 investors by fraudulently offering and selling membership units in Ace Payday through telemarketers called independent sales offices or ISOs.  The Complaint alleges that defendants told investors that 90% of the offering proceeds would be used to develop Ace Paydays business when, in truth, 40% to 45% went to the ISOs as sales commissions.  The Complaint also alleges that defendants lured investors by promising excessive investment returns and by baselessly projecting wildly optimistic profits of up to 720% per year.  On the Commissions motion, the court issued an order temporarily restraining defendants from violating the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws, freezing defendants assets, and granting other emergency relief.  A hearing on the Commissions motion for a preliminary injunction is scheduled for April 5, 2002., The Complaint names as defendants:, <b>Ace Payday</b>, a Florida limited liability company headquartered in North Miami Beach, Florida., <b>Bianco, </b>a resident of North Miami Beach, Florida, and the chief executive of Ace Payday, Ace Management, LLC, and Ace Payday Management, Inc., <b>Ace Management, LLC</b>, identified in the offering materials as a Florida limited liability company, Ace Paydays Manager, and a professional payday advance and check cashing Management Co., <b>Ace Payday Management, Inc.</b>, a Florida corporation identified on Ace Paydays Florida state filings as the LLC manager for Ace Payday., The Complaint alleges that:, Defendants have conducted the offering by means of various written materials, which they sent to prospective investors at the direction of the ISOs.  In these materials, defendants describe Ace Payday as a start-up company in the business of providing retail payday advance and check cashing services, claim that check cashing is possibly the fastest growing industry in America today, and encourage investors to [t]ake advantage of participating in this lucrative industry.  Defendants project that the companys payday loan operations will yield an average of up to 360% profit per year and that the companys check cashing operations will generate up to 720% per year.  They offer investors (a) interest at the rate of 20% per annum to be paid at a rate of 5% each quarter for three years, and (b) a pro-rata share of the companys profits.  In truth, between 40% and 45% of the offering proceeds have been used to compensate the ISOs, which act as unregistered brokers soliciting unsophisticated investors.  Defendants have no basis for promising 20% interest payable quarterly or projecting such optimistic profits - especially now, as Ace Payday already has failed to meet its quarterly obligations to investors., The Commissions complaint charges all of the defendants with violating the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The complaint alleges that Harbottle learned that Sage Group plc intended to acquire Interact in early 2001, and that he used this material, nonpublic information to trade in Interact common stock. Interact is located in Scottsdale, Arizona, and is now a subsidiary of Sage., The Commissions complaint alleges that, in his role as an officer of Interact, Harbottle directly participated in discussions between Interact and Sage in February 2001 concerning a potential corporate transaction.  Harbottle also attended a meeting of Interacts Board of Directors on February 13, 2001, during which the Board and senior management discussed Sages potential interest in acquiring Interact.

Macsata, who was the former Vice President of Finance, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer of USA Detergents, Inc.  Macsata, without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, has consented to the entry of a Final Judgment that would settle the Commissions action against him.  The Commission also instituted and simultaneously settled administrative proceedings against seven other former members of USA Detergents management.  USA Detergents was a Delaware corporation that had its principal executive offices in North Brunswick, New Jersey, and was a manufacturer and marketer of laundry and household cleaning products.  In May 2001, Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc. acquired the outstanding common stock of USA Detergents pursuant to a cash tender offer.  , The <a href=/litigation/complaints/complr17426.htm>Commissions complaint</a> against Macsata alleges that he violated Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2, and aided and abetted violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13, by resorting to fraudulent methods to increase the companys reported income during the third and fourth quarters of its fiscal year ended December 31, 1996.  As a result of the fraudulent acts, USA Detergents filed with the Commission and released to the public a false and misleading quarterly report on Form 10-Q for its quarter ended September 30, 1996, and a false and misleading annual report on Form 10-K for its fiscal year ended December 31, 1996.  The reports included financial statements that materially misrepresented the companys results of operations, significantly overstating its income.  The companys subsequently restated 1996 financial statements reduced the companys net income for the third quarter of 1996 by $1.5 million from the amount reported originally and reduced the companys net income for the fourth quarter of 1996 by $3 million from the amount reported originally., The Commissions complaint alleges that Macsata used several methods in an attempt to inflate the companys income.  The Commissions complaint alleges that Macsata directed the improper reclassification of certain marketing costs (which must be expensed when occurred) as slotting fees (fees the company paid for placing its products on merchants shelves and which the company could amortize).  The complaint alleges that Macsata kept approximately $2 million in vendor invoices off the companys books during 1996, concealing the invoices until the 1996 books were closed.  The complaint further alleges that Macsata recorded bogus vendor rebates and credits.  The Commission also alleges that Macsata lowered the companys 1996 expenses by improperly shifting ordinary labor costs onto capital projects.  The complaint alleges that Macsata was also involved in the improper recognition of revenue in 1996 from post-period sales and from 1996 shipments for which no firm customer orders had yet been entered, including directing the companys Vice President for Distribution to backdate bills of lading for the post-period shipments.  Finally, the complaint alleges that, with knowledge that the companys financial statements had been fraudulently and materially misstated, Macsata signed the companys quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the third quarter of 1996 and its annual report on Form 10-K for 1996.  Macsata, without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, consented to entry of a Final Judgment that would enjoin him from future violations of the federal securities laws and order him to pay a civil money penalty of $50,000.  , The Commission today also issued administrative Orders instituting settled administrative proceedings against seven other former members of USA Detergents management.  In the first of five separate administrative Orders, the Commission found that Keith Spero, the companys Vice President for Distribution, violated the corporate record-keeping provisions of the federal securities laws and was a cause of violations of the antifraud, periodic reporting, corporate record-keeping, and lying to auditors provisions of the federal securities laws, in connection with the companys improper revenue recognition at year-end 1996.  The Commission found that, when the company remained open on January 1, 1997, to ship merchandise, Spero caused the resulting bills of lading to be backdated to December 31, 1996.  The Commission also found that Spero shipped merchandise at year-end 1996 even though no firm orders had been received for the goods.  Simultaneous with the institution of the administrative proceeding, and without admitting or denying the findings contained therein, Spero consented to the issuance of the Commission Order ordering him to cease and desist from future violations of the federal securities laws.  , In three separate administrative Orders, the Commission found that three former members of USA Detergents management participated in improper practices, or directed acts, that they knew or should have known would have a material impact on the companys financial statements.  In those Orders, the Commission found that Frank Valdez, the companys President; Harlan Schier, the Controller; and Daniel Parker, the Vice President for Materials Management, caused violations by USA Detergents of the periodic reporting provisions of the federal securities laws.  Simultaneous with the institution of the administrative proceedings, and without admitting or denying the findings contained therein, each of Valdez, Schier, and Parker consented to the issuance of a Commission Order ordering him to cease and desist from future violations of the periodic reporting provisions. , In a fifth administrative Order, the Commission found that three former officers of USA Detergents knew, or should have known, of facts that should have put each of them on notice that the companys financial statements might well be false.  Nevertheless, while on such notice, each of them, without further inquiry, signed the companys annual report on Form 10-K for 1996.  In a joint Order, the Commission found that Uri Evan, the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors; Joseph S. Cohen, the Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors; and Frederick J. Horowitz, an Executive Vice President, the Chief Administrative Officer, and a director, each caused violations by USA Detergents of the periodic reporting provisions of the federal securities laws.

First, iMC falsely represented that various high profile figures in the Internet and payment systems industries had invested in iMC, served on iMCs Board of Directors or were a part of iMCs management team.  These misrepresentations were designed to provide potential investors with the impression that highly successful business executives were guiding the development of iMC when, in fact, Sendo directed iMCs operations.  Second, iMCs offering materials present a misleading portrayal of Sendo.  Sendo is described in offering materials as a successful professional who worked for highly reputable brokerage firms.

Interested investors responded over the Internet by providing contact information, which Grabarnick and Shiner then sold as leads to defendants Donald LaBarre and Sarah Jane Peck.  The complaint alleges that LaBarre and Peck used boiler room sales tactics to offer and sell the LLP units.  Investors were told they would benefit from the deregulation of the electric service provider market in California.  According to the complaint, Grabarnick, Shiner, LaBarre and Peck made numerous material misrepresentations and omissions to investors regarding, among other things, the profitability of the investment, its likelihood of success, the risk and safety of the investment, and the need to invest quickly.  For example, one investor was allegedly told that the only risk was that Los Angeles could fall into the Pacific Ocean; others were falsely led to believe that former President Clinton  and Hillary Clinton had made money in similar investments., According to the complaint, more than 580 people nationwide invested over $10 million by purchasing units, or fractions thereof, in eight LLPs.  Each LLP consisted of 80 partnership units, each valued at $19,675, for a total of $1,547,000 per fully funded partnership.  Many investors were elderly; many rolled over money from IRA and 401(k) accounts.  According to the compliant, after all 80 units were sold, or as many as could be, investors were told that the partnerships would not be viable and they were offered Over-the-Counter penny stock in exchange for their escrowed funds.  None of the partnerships ever became operational electric companies.

Graham of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, permanently enjoined defendant Seth Miller for his role in the World Vision Entertainment, Inc. (World Vision) Ponzi scheme.  On March 6, 2002, the Court entered a Final Judgment of Equitable Relief against defendant Seth Miller, ordering him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $327,192, but waiving payment and not imposing a civil penalty based on Millers demonstrated inability to pay.  Miller processed the notes and acted as an unregistered broker-dealer in a nationwide Ponzi scheme involving the offer and sale of unregistered nine-month promissory notes issued by World Vision, a company located in Altamonte Springs, Florida., Specifically, the Commissions Complaint, filed on June 1, 2000, alleged that from June 1996 to August 1999, Miller, Jamie P. Piromalli, Steven Brewer, A. Michael Jaillett and Richard Mann (collectively, the Defendants), through World Vision, raised at least $64 million from approximately 1,200 investors in 33 states from the sale of promissory notes.  The Defendants offered and sold securities in the form of nine-month promissory notes without registering them with the Commission.  In furtherance of the scheme, the Defendants, directly and indirectly, through a nationwide sales network, made numerous false and misleading statements to investors about the World Vision notes.  For example, the Defendants misrepresented that the notes were unconditionally guaranteed and insured and that all of the proceeds of the offering would be used to develop World Visions products.  In reality, the notes were not guaranteed and the Defendants used the proceeds of the note offering to pay for the personal and business expenses of company officers and directors, to cover interest and principal payments to investors and to pay large, undisclosed commissions to the sales network.  As a result, when World Vision filed for bankruptcy protection in September 1999, investors lost approximately $52 million., On December 5, 2001, the Court permanently enjoined Miller from violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), and Sections 10(b), 15(a) and 15(c) of the Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5 and 15c1-2 thereunder.

D/B/A AGS, INC., ET AL., Defendants</u>, Civil Action No.  3-02CV-606-L, <b><u>SEC FILES CHARGES IN CONNECTION WITH FRAUDULENT INTERNATIONAL GOLD TRADING SCHEME.</u></b>, On March 22, 2002, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a securities fraud case in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, Dallas Division, charging two companies and four individuals with selling unregistered securities and misleading investors in connection with an international gold trading deal.  According to the Complaint, between February 2000 and January 2001, the defendants raised over $1.3 million by offering and selling unregistered promissory notes to investors in several states, and made false and misleading claims, and failed to disclose material facts, about the risks of the investment and the results the investors could expect.  The SEC alleges that one of the participants in the deal stole most of the investors money, resulting in substantial losses to investors., In its complaint, the Commission charged the following defendants:, , , , , , , The SECs complaint alleges that the defendants assured investors they could liquidate their principal upon thirty days notice; promised investors monthly returns of five percent to ten percent; and represented to investors that AGS could earn sufficient profits to be able to pay those returns, because AGS and an associated Ghanaian corporation - Africa Gemstone - would use the investors money to buy gold bullion in Ghana and sell it in England at a 12% profit.  The SEC further alleges that the defendants said the risk to investors was minimal, because of built-in safety factors, such as oversight by the government of Ghana and verification of the investment by AGS, through investigation and through the AGS officers experience as the ventures seminal investors.  , In fact, according to the SECs complaint, the AGS principals had not truly tested the investment, because they never attempted to liquidate their principal, and they received only a handful of interest payments.  They essentially took Sarpongs word that their principal was safe, and that profits from gold trading would be sufficient for AGS to meet its obligations to investors.  The Commission alleges that the Ghanaian government never monitored Sarpongs handling of investor funds and gold, and the AGS principals took virtually no steps to ensure or verify that Sarpong was using investor funds appropriately and in accordance with his promises to AGS.  , The SEC further alleges that, although Sarpong agreed to trade gold for AGS on an ongoing basis - continually returning any sale proceeds to Ghana to purchase more gold - he instead diverted more than half of the sale proceeds (over $750,000) to his personal bank account.  The SEC also alleges that Sarpong stole two gold shipments valued at approximately $250,000.  As a result of Sarpongs thefts, the Commission contends, the investment was never profitable, AGS never earned sufficient profits to be able to pay the investors the returns it had promised them, and AGS is now unable to repay the investors principal, to say nothing of doing so on thirty days notice., The Commissions complaint charged that AGS, Gaither, Temple, Tuley, Africa Gemstone and Sarpong directly or indirectly sold unregistered securities, in violation of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933; and committed securities fraud, in violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In its Complaint, the Commission requested that the defendants be enjoined from future securities violations and be ordered to disgorge their illegal profits and pay civil money penalties., Simultaneously with the filing of its action, the Commission accepted an offer of settlement from AGS, Gaither, Temple and Tuley, in which those defendants agreed, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions Complaint, to the entry of an order enjoining them from further violations of the securities laws; to pay civil money penalties of $20,000 each; and to pay disgorgement of $200,000 in illegal profits, plus $22,840 in prejudgment interest.

Founder and Five Other Former Top Officers Sued for Massive Earnings Management Fraud</h2>]","[LITIGATION RELEASE NO. 17435 / March 26, 2002, ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING ENFORCEMENT<br/>, RELEASE NO. 1532 / March 26, 2002, , <b><i>Securities and Exchange Commission v. Dean L. Buntrock, Phillip B. Rooney, James E. Koenig, Thomas C. Hau, Herbert A. Getz, and Bruce D. Tobecksen</i>, Civil Action No. 02C 2180 (Judge Manning) (N.D. Ill. March 26, 2002)</b>, The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) today filed a Complaint charging the founder and five other former top officers of Waste Management, Inc. (Waste Management or Company) with perpetrating a massive financial fraud lasting more than five years. The Commission alleged that, beginning in 1992 and continuing into 1997, defendants engaged in a systematic scheme to falsify and misrepresent Waste Managements financial results and thereby enrich themselves and keep their jobs. The scheme was orchestrated and implemented by Waste Managements most senior officers: , , , The Commission brought its action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The Complaint alleges that the defendants violated, and aided and abetted violations of, antifraud, reporting, and record-keeping provisions of the federal securities laws. As relief, the Commission seeks final judgments permanently enjoining defendants from further violations of these provisions, ordering disgorgement of defendants ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment thereon, imposing civil money penalties, and prohibiting defendants from serving as officers or directors of public companies.,  In its Complaint, the Commission alleges the following:, Defendants fraudulently manipulated the Companys financial results to meet predetermined earnings targets. The Companys revenues and profits were not growing fast enough to meet these targets, so defendants instead resorted to improperly eliminating and deferring current period expenses to inflate earnings. They employed a multitude of improper accounting practices to achieve this objective. Among other things, defendants, , Defendants improper accounting practices were centralized at corporate headquarters. Each year, Buntrock, Rooney, and others prepared an annual budget in which they set earnings targets for the upcoming year. During the year, they monitored the Companys actual operating results and compared them to the quarterly targets set in the budget. To reduce expenses and inflate earnings artificially, defendants then primarily used top-level adjustments to conform the Companys actual results to the predetermined earnings targets. The inflated earnings of prior periods then became the floor for future manipulations. The consequences, however, created what Hau referred to as a one-off problem. To sustain the scheme, earnings fraudulently achieved in one period had to be replaced in the next.,  Defendants concealed their scheme in a variety of ways. They made false and misleading statements about the Companys accounting practices, financial condition, and future prospects in filings with the Commission, reports to shareholders, and press releases. They also used accounting manipulations known as netting and geography to make reported results appear better than they actually were and avoid scrutiny. Defendants used netting to eliminate approximately $490 million in current period operating expenses and accumulated prior period accounting misstatements by offsetting them against unrelated one-time gains on the sale or exchange of assets. They used geography entries to move tens of millions of dollars between various line items on the Companys income statement to, in Koenigs words, make the financials look the way we want to show them.,  Defendants were aided in their fraud by the Companys long-time auditor Arthur Andersen LLP (Andersen), which repeatedly issued unqualified audit reports on the Companys materially false and misleading annual financial statements. At the outset of the fraud, management capped Andersens audit fees and advised the Andersen engagement partner that the firm could earn additional fees through special work. Andersen nevertheless identified the Companys improper accounting practices and quantified much of the impact of those practices on the Companys financial statements. Andersen annually presented Company management with what it called Proposed Adjusting Journal Entries (PAJEs) to correct errors that understated expenses and overstated earnings in the Companys financial statements. ,  Management consistently refused to make the adjustments called for by the PAJEs. Instead, defendants secretly entered into an agreement with Andersen fraudulently to write off the accumulated errors over periods of up to ten years and to change the underlying accounting practices, but to do so only in future periods. That signed, four-page agreement, known as the Summary of Action Steps (attached to the Commissions complaint), identified improper accounting practices that went to the core of the companys operations and prescribed thirty-two must do steps for the company to follow to change those practices. The Action Steps thus constituted an agreement between the company and its outside auditor to cover up past frauds by committing additional frauds in the future.,  Defendants could not even comply with the Action Steps agreement. Writing off the errors and changing the underlying accounting practices as prescribed in the agreement would have prevented the company from meeting earnings targets and defendants from enriching themselves.,  Defendants profited handsomely from their fraud. All of the defendants received performance-based bonuses based on the Companys inflated earnings, retained their high-paying jobs, and received stock options. Some also received enhanced retirement benefits based on the improper bonuses, and some received lucrative employment contracts. Buntrock, Rooney, and Koenig also avoided losses by cashing in their Waste Management stock while the fraud was ongoing. For example, just ten days before certain of the accounting irregularities first became public, Buntrock enriched himself with a tax benefit by donating inflated Company stock to his college alma mater to fund a building in his name.,  Defendants scheme eventually unraveled. In mid-July 1997, a new CEO ordered a review of the Companys accounting practices. That review ultimately led to the restatement of the Companys financial statements for 1992 through the third quarter of 1997. When the Company filed its restated financial statements in February 1998, the Company acknowledged that it had misstated its pre-tax earnings by approximately $1.7 billion. At the time, the restatement was the largest in corporate history.,  As news of the Companys overstatement of earnings became public, Waste Managements shareholders (other than the defendants who sold Company stock and thus avoided losses) lost over $6 billion in the market value of their investments when the stock price plummeted by more than 33%.,  The Complaint details the roles that each of the individuals played in the scheme. Buntrock was the driving force behind the fraud. He set earnings targets, fostered a culture of aggressive accounting, personally directed certain of the accounting changes to make the targeted earnings, and was the spokesperson who announced the Companys phony numbers. Rooney was in charge of building the profitability of the Companys core solid waste operations and at all times exercised overall control over the Companys largest subsidiary. He ensured that required write-offs were not recorded and, in some instances, overruled accounting decisions that would have a negative impact on operations. Koenig had primary responsibility for executing the scheme. He also ordered the destruction of damaging evidence, misled the Companys audit committee and internal accountants, and withheld information from the outside auditors. Hau was the accounting expert who, among other things, devised many one-off accounting manipulations to deliver the targeted earnings and carefully crafted the deceptive disclosures. Tobecksen, another accounting expert, was enlisted in 1994 to handle Haus overflow. Getz, the general counsel, blessed the Companys fraudulent disclosures.,  As a result of defendants conduct, the Commission alleges that Buntrock, Rooney, and Getz violated, or aided and abetted violations of, section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), sections 10(b) and 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Exchange Act rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13. The Commission further alleges that Koenig and Hau violated, or aided and abetted violations of, section 17(a) of the Securities Act, sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act, and Exchange Act rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2. The Commission alleges that Tobecksen violated, or aided and abetted violations of, section 17(a) of the Securities Act, sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act, and Exchange Act rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, and 13b2-1.,  Previously, the Commission instituted and simultaneously settled the following proceedings against Andersen and four of its partners: , <p style=margin-left:2em><i><a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17039.htm>SEC v.

On March 25, 2002, Judge Jerry Buchmeyer, United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, Dallas Division, granted the Commissions  Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and issued an <i>Ex Parte</i> Order Freezing Assets and Requiring an Accounting, Preservation of Documents, Repatriation of Assets, Surrender of Passports and Authorizing Expedited Discovery, and appointed a receiver for all defendants and relief defendants.  In its action, the Commission sued the following defendants:, , , , , , , , , , , , Specifically, the Commission charges that from January 1999 through the present, defendants RDI scheme has raised approximately $98 million from more than 1300 investors nationwide, targeting persons seeking to invest retirement funds.  In the course of marketing the RDI trading program, defendants D. Edwards, J. Edwards, Stock, Lynds and Whelan acted as unregistered broker-dealers.  Defendants falsely claimed to investors, among other things, that their money would be used in Europe to trade financial instruments with top 25 or top 50 banks in a program sponsored by the Federal Reserve and global organizations, generating annual returns of 48 to 120 percent with complete safety of principal.  In reality, the prime bank program marketed to investors does not exist and investor funds have been misappropriated for personal and unauthorized uses, including making Ponzi payments.  Moreover, while RDI has ceased making payments of any kind to its investors, tens of millions of dollars collected by the defendants simply cannot be accounted for.  The Commissions complaint further charges that J. Edwards and D. Edwards diverted funds to buy property and a home for their personal use, and that relief defendants PILP, IER, Galaxy and David Cluff, individually and d/b/a Rivera Bench Trust 410, have received at least $6 million, and possibly as much as $13 million, of RDI investor funds or control property derived from investor funds., The Commissions complaint charges that RDI, the Edwards, Jade, SFS, Whelan, Stock, Lynds, Intercoastal I, Intercoastal II and Blackwolf violated Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint also charges the Edwards, Lynds, Stock and Whelan with violations of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act.  In addition to the emergency relief set out above, the Commission seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions, disgorgement and civil penalties, and repatriation orders against all the defendants, and disgorgement and prejudgment interest against the relief defendants., Unscrupulous promoters continue to victimize the public with Prime Bank schemes.  Accordingly, investors are advised to access the Commissions Prime Bank Investor Alert, which provides tips on how to avoid being a victim of these scams.  The investor alert can be found on the Commissions web site, at www.sec.gov/divisions/enforce/primebank.shtml., The Commission acknowledges the assistance and cooperation of several other government agencies in this matter, including the State of Washington Department of Financial Institutions Securities Division; the Alabama Securities Commission; the State of Wisconsin Department of Financial Institutions; the District Attorneys Office of Santa Clara County, California; the Arizona Corporation Commission, Securities Division; the Arizona Attorney Generals Office; and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System., ]"

Dale Peterson et al. </i>(United States District Court for the Northern District of California C.A. No. C02-01467)     , The Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday filed a civil fraud action against seven former senior officers of Signal Technology Corp., a Danvers, Massachusetts defense contractor formerly located in Sunnyvale, California.  In the suit, filed in federal court in the Northern District of California, the Commission alleged that defendants caused Signal Tech to inflate its reported earnings by over $9 million from January 1996 through June 1998.  According to the Complaint, each of the individual defendants personally directed or participated in the companys improper accounting practices at its Florida-based Keltec division, when it failed to record known losses on major contracts, prematurely recognized revenue, and failed to write off worthless inventory.  The Commission alleged that the defendants conduct violated the antifraud, periodic reporting, record keeping, internal controls and lying to auditors provisions of the federal securities laws.   , All of the individual defendants were members of senior management at Signal Tech or its Keltec division.  The Complaint alleges that defendants flouted accounting principles to improve the companys bottom line and repeatedly failed to follow generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).   The Complaint alleges that the companys disregard for proper accounting came from the top, with the companys former CEO, defendant Dale Peterson, remarking that he was sick of people thinking GAAP was important.  As a result of its accounting fraud, the Complaint alleges, Signal Tech misstated its net income by amounts ranging from 8% to 294% in financial statements filed for reporting periods during January 1996 through March 1998 and reported a profit, rather than its actual loss, for the year 1997. , <b><u>Individual defendants</u></b>, In its complaint, the Commission named the following defendants:, Dale Peterson, age 66, who resides in Saratoga, California.  Peterson was Signal Techs Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board from 1994 to mid-1998. , Russell Kinsch, age 52, who resides in Saratoga, California.  Kinsch was Signal Techs Chief Financial Officer from February 1996 through June 1997., James Walsh, age 68, who resides in Sunnyvale, California.  Walsh was president of Signal Tech from May 1993 until August 1997; and vice chairman and chief technical officer from August 1997 until December 1997.   He served as Keltecs <i>de facto </i>president during the third quarter of 1997., Richard Nabozny, age 68, who resides in Panama City Beach, Florida.  Nabozny was vice president of operations of Signal Tech from 1992 through June 1998 and served as Keltecs president from January through June 1998., Michael Smith, age 53, who resides in Chelmsford, Massachusetts.  Smith was vice-president of marketing for Signal Tech beginning in February 1995.  Smith served as president of the companys Keltec division from February 1996 until March 1997.  , Charles Balentine, age 54, who resides in McElhattan, Pennsylvania.  Balentine was controller of the Keltec division from February 1996 to March 1998., Wayne Armstrong, age 55, who resides in Navarre, Florida.  Armstrong was president of Keltec from March 1997 through December 1997., <b><u>Defendant officers individual roles in alleged fraudulent accounting</u></b>, Specifically, the Complaint alleges that from 1996 through 1998, Signal Techs Keltec division was experiencing severe financial difficulties due to cost overruns on its defense contracts.  Signal Techs CEO, Dale Peterson, and its CFO, Russell Kinsch, knew of, directed and approved of Keltecs failure to record contract losses, but signed Signal Techs materially misleading Forms 10-K and 10-Q, knowing that they incorporated misleading financial results for Keltec.  Peterson and Kinsch also signed false management representation letters to Signal Techs auditors.  , The other defendants, James Walsh, Richard Nabozny, Michael Smith and Wayne Armstrong, who served as Keltecs division presidents, and Charles Balentine, its division controller, participated in Signal Techs filing of false financial reports by directing Keltec to provide inaccurate figures for inclusion in Signal Techs consolidated financial statements. Walsh directed Keltec to conceal over $1 million in contract costs during 1997.  Nabozny directed concealment of costs, made unsupported reductions to Keltecs reserves which improved its profit figures, and approved Keltecs failure to write off worthless inventory.   Smith approved Keltecs failure to record contract cost increases and its premature recognition of revenue. Balentine implemented directives by Keltecs president to record revenues prematurely and not to record contract costs.  He directed inadequate write-offs of worthless inventory.  Armstrong knew of Keltecs failure to record contract cost increases, but allowed Keltec to report the misleading results.  , According to the Complaint, the accounting improprieties came to light after a change in Signal Techs management in mid-1998.  Balentines replacement discovered unrecorded losses at Keltec.  Signal Techs board of directors initiated an examination of the companys books which led to the restatement of its financial results for 1996 and 1997.  By the time of the restatement, none of the seven defendants remained at Signal Tech., <b><u>Commission seeks permanent injunctions, civil money penalties and officer and director bars</u></b>, In its Complaint, the Commission requests that the court issue a final judgment of permanent injunction and other relief enjoining each of the individual defendants from violating or aiding and abetting violations of the antifraud, periodic reporting, record keeping and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws, Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13 and 13b2-1, and additionally as to Peterson and Kinsch, Rule 13b2-2, which prohibits officers of a company from lying to auditors.  In addition to civil monetary penalties from all individual defendants, the Commission is seeking an order permanently barring Peterson, Kinsch, Walsh, Nabozny and Smith from acting as officers or directors of any public company.  , <b><u>Commission settles Cease-and-Desist proceeding with Signal Tech</u></b>, In a related action, the Commission instituted and simultaneously settled an administrative cease-and-desist proceeding against Signal Tech pursuant to which the company, without admitting or denying the Commissions findings, consented to an order requiring it to cease and desist from committing or causing any violation, and any future violation, of the periodic reporting, record keeping and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws, Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13.  The Commission found that in 1996 and 1997 and for the first quarter of 1998, Signal Tech overstated its revenues and net income in annual and periodic filings with the Commission. , <b> (<a href=/litigation/admin/34-45655.htm>Release No. 34-45655</a>)</b>, ]"

Strauss</i> (United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts C.A. No. 02-CV-10576-REK)   , The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action against Leonard J. Guida of Sudbury, Massachusetts, the former Vice President of Finance, Worldwide Sales and Service for PictureTel Corp.s sales department, alleging that Guida orchestrated a $12 million fraud at PictureTel by negotiating, approving and recording revenue from sales transactions for which the purported customers had no obligation to pay.  The Complaint alleges that because of Guidas conduct, PictureTel materially overstated its revenues from the third quarter of 1996 through the second quarter of 1997.  Guida agreed, without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, to pay a civil penalty of $50,000, to disgorge his 1996 annual bonus of $13,500 plus prejudgment interest, postjudgment interest of $894.59, and to the entry of a permanent injunction prohibiting him from further violations of the antifraud, public company reporting, record-keeping and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws., According to the Commissions Complaint, Guida entered into a series of transactions involving undisclosed side agreements which provided that the customers had no firm commitment to pay. The Commission further alleged that after improperly causing PictureTel to recognize revenue from certain of these purported sales, Guida falsely told the companys auditors that the transactions would be paid.  The Commission alleges that this statement was not true because the PictureTel customers had no obligation to pay unless the goods were sold through to end users or involved other significant contingencies.  According to the Commissions Complaint, PictureTel materially overstated its revenues from the third quarter of 1996 through the second quarter of 1997 by approximately $17.8 million, of which approximately $12 million was attributable to Guidas conduct.   , The Commissions Complaint alleges that Guida violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, including Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder.  In addition, the Complaint alleges that Guida aided and abetted PictureTels violations of the public company reporting, record-keeping and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws, including Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1, 13a-13 and 12b-20 thereunder. , The Commission also instituted settled cease-and-desist proceedings against PictureTel and Les B. Strauss, the companys former CFO.  The Commissions Order found that PictureTels filings with the Commission were materially false and misleading from the third quarter of 1996 through the second quarter of 1997.  In its Order, the Commission also found that Strauss failed to devise or maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls at PictureTel by, among other things, eliminating the important segregation of duties between the companys sales and accounting functions and vesting unchecked authority in Guida.  Without admitting or denying the Commissions findings, PictureTel and Strauss consented to the entry of the Order which prohibits future violations of the public company reporting, record-keeping and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws.  In a companion civil action filed in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts which alleged facts similar to the findings in the Commissions Order, Strauss consented to pay a $30,000 civil penalty., In another related matter, the Commission instituted a settled cease-and-desist proceeding against David T. Dodge, the general manager of a leasing company customer.  The Commissions Order found that Dodge participated in Guidas scheme by negotiating undisclosed side agreements that relieved his leasing company of any obligation to pay PictureTel unless the goods were sold through to end users.  In addition, the Commissions Order found that Dodge assisted Guidas efforts to conceal the scheme by misleading PictureTels outside auditors about his companys payment obligations for transactions that PictureTel had booked as accounts receivable at the end of 1996.  Dodges statements to the auditors were misleading because his company did not have a firm commitment to pay PictureTel for a substantial portion of the receivable balance.  Without admitting or denying the Commissions findings, Dodge consented to the entry of the Order which prohibits him from committing or causing any future violations of the antifraud, public company reporting, record-keeping and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws, including Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 10b-5, 13a-1, 13a-13, 12b-20, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder.]"

Mallory, 41, of Boston, Massachusetts.  The courts order was based on the Commissions prima facie showing that Mallory fraudulently offered and sold shares of Anamar stock, via the Internet and other means, to investors in at least four states.  The Commission alleged in its complaint, filed on March 15, 2002, that, since August 2001, Mallory has raised at least $130,000 from at least 14 investors in Massachusetts, Ohio, Virginia and California, promising them they would double their money in as little as 90 days without risk.  Mallory falsely promised investors Verizon Communications, Inc. would buy the company by the end of 2001.  According to the Commission, several investors borrowed money from family members or high interest credit cards to invest, and some invested substantial portions of their life savings.    , In its complaint, the Commission alleges that, Mallory falsely told investors that, if they purchased Anamar stock at five cents per share, they would double their money in as little as 90 days because Verizon had agreed to purchase the company for ten cents per share by December 31, 2001.  Mallory also falsely told investors their investments would be risk-free because Verizon had agreed to pay Anamar an opt-out fee if the deal fell through.  According to the Commission, however, Verizon never offered or agreed to purchase Anamar, and investors have been unable to recover any of their investments.  The Commission alleges that Mallory offered additional shares of Anamar for sale in January 2002, falsely telling investors the Verizon transaction had closed, and that he had a meeting scheduled with Bill Gates of Microsoft Corporation.  According to the Commission, Mallory continues to solicit investments via Anamars Internet web site.  The web site has a direct link to an online payment service that allows investors to purchase Anamar stock with a credit card.              , The Commission alleged in its complaint that Anamar and Mallory violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

District Judge for the Western District of Virginia, issued a preliminary injunction against three participants in a Ponzi scheme that raised over $50 million.  The SEC alleged that Defendants Vavasseur Corporation, a Bahamian corporation, Kenneth G. Mason, an attorney residing in Wilmette, Illinois and Birgit Mechlenburg, a resident of  Lenox, Massachusetts, offered fictitious prime bank securities that they claimed would provide virtually risk-free returns of  4 percent per week for 40 weeks per year - up to 160% per year.  Judge Michael had previously issued a preliminary injunction by consent against Defendants Terry L. Dowdell and Dowdell, Dutcher &amp; Associates, Inc., both of Charlottesville, Virginia., The Court found that the SEC showed it was likely to prove that the Vavasseur trading program being marketed by Dowdell, Mason and Mechlenburg was fraudulent.  Although the defendants represented that funds invested in Vavasseur would be placed in trading accounts in the Bahamas and profits would be generated by trading activity, the Court found that investor funds were never transferred to such accounts and that Vavasseur engaged in no trading.  , The Court found that the SEC showed it was likely to prove that Vavasseur Corporation, Mason and Mechlenburg engaged in and are likely to engage in violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder..  , The Court found that the SEC showed it was likely to prove that Mason was reckless in recommending the Vavasseur program.  The Court stated that the danger of the Vavasseur program was so obvious that Mason must have been aware of it.  The Court found that Masons due diligence was inadequate, particularly where Mason admitted to knowing of no other successful high yield program, knowing that Dowdell had no track record in program management, and knowing that Vavasseur bore striking similarities to the prime bank schemes about which the SEC had issued an investor alert.  , The Court also found that the SEC showed it was likely to prove that Mechlenburg was reckless in promoting the Vavasseur program.  Unlike Mason, who expressed some doubt about the legitimacy of Vavasseur, Mechlenburg stated that she continues to believe that Vavasseur is a legitimate trading program.  In the mid-1990s Mechlenburg was permanently enjoined from violating certain sections of the federal securities laws and barred from association with any broker or dealer.  The Court found that, regardless of whether it was the result of deliberate ignorance or remarkable gullibility, her conduct rose to the level of recklessness.  The Court also found that the SEC showed it was likely to prove that Mechlenburg unlawfully acted as an unregistered broker-dealer, in violation of Section 15(c) of the Exchange Act and Rule 15c1-2 thereunder.  , In addition, the Court found Mason to be in civil contempt because he withdrew $5,000 from his business bank account shortly after being served with the TRO and asset freeze.  The Court ordered Mason to return the sum of $5,000 to his bank account within the next two months.  , For more information on prime bank fraud, see the investor information section of the SECs web-site, www.sec.gov. , See previous Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17242.htm>17242</a>, November 19, 2001.]"

Santos told those investors who believed that they had invested in PinPoint that the company was doing well when, in fact, it was not., The Complaint alleges that the defendants violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement together with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties from all defendants., In a related matter, the Commission is also instituting public administrative proceedings against Santos.  In those proceedings, the Commission alleges that on January 8, 2001, in the case of <u>United States of America v. Joao Santos</u>, Crim. No. 00-762, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, Santos pled guilty to one count of mail fraud (18 U.S.C. 1341), and was subsequently sentenced to five years probation, fined $10,000 and ordered to make restitution of $12,890.  The criminal information alleged that, between September 1998 and June 1999, while employed at First Liberty Investment Group, Inc., a broker-dealer registered with the Commission, Santos improperly diverted approximately $108,000 in customer funds and converted them for his personal use., ]"

Carroll of the United States District Court for the District of Arizona granted the Commissions request for various emergency orders to halt a nationwide, $88 million investment scam, and to recover and conserve assets for the benefit of victims of the scam.  , The Commission alleges in its complaint that the defendants, operating from Phoenix, Chicago and Houston, sold several bogus investments, including prime bank investments, treasury futures pools and certificates of deposit (CDs) from a purported Native American chartered bank. , The Court entered <i>ex parte</i> orders freezing assets, and requiring an accounting, the preservation of documents, and the repatriation of funds and assets that had been moved offshore.  The Court also appointed a receiver to recover and conserve assets for the benefit of investors., It its complaint, the Commission alleges that the U.S. Reservation Bank &amp; Trust (USRBT), a non-incorporated entity granted business charters by the Rosebud Sioux based in Scottsdale, Arizona, and Global-Link Capital Markets, Ltd. (Global-Link), a limited liability company headquartered in Houston, Texas, raised $78 million through sales of an investment combining a Leveraged Profit Sharing Agreement (LPSA) with an uninsured CD issued by USRBT.  , According to the Commission, USRBT and Global-Link officials promised investors that their funds, while held in safekeeping, would be leveraged to fund participation in trading programs involving United States Treasury notes and bank debentures.  The Commission further alleges that USRBT and Global-Link officials promised the investors that they would receive the greater of 20% of the profits from the trading programs or the interest on the USRBT-issued CD.  , The Commission claims in its complaint that, in reality, USRBT never leveraged any investor funds for investment in trading programs; rather, USRBT used most of the investor funds to make Ponzi payments of interest and principal to the investors.  In addition, according to the Commission, USRBT officials misused investor funds by spending over $4 million on salaries, commissions and personal and business expenses, including a horse racing stable and a purported casino development company., The Commission also alleges in its complaint that in a USRBT spin-off scheme, Higher Investments Technologies, Inc. (HIT), a Nevada corporation headquartered in Mundelein, Illinois, fraudulently raised over $10.6 million from at least six investors or investment groups.  According to the Commission, HIT offered investors an opportunity to participate in its Capital Management Agreements (CMAs), in which HIT, according to its representations to investors, would use their funds to trade in Treasury bond futures and then share the profits with the investors.  , In reality, HIT used only about 10% of the investors funds for such trading, and HIT misused most of the remaining investors funds by spending them on its office expenses, including rent, supplies, computers, office repairs, payroll, and travel, according to the complaint., The Commission staff coordinated its investigation and lawsuit with several other federal and state law enforcement agencies.  The U.S. Attorneys Offices in Phoenix and Cincinnati filed civil forfeiture actions against USRBT and HIT, and seized $20 million and $10.2 million, respectively, against the two entities.  The Commission, in its action, is seeking, among other things, recovery of additional funds from these and other entities and individuals involved in the scheme.  , In its action, the Commission named as defendants, in addition to USRBT, Global-Link and HIT, the following individuals, and characterized them in its complaint as follows:, Edward J. Driving Hawk, Sr., a resident of Mesa, Arizona, is the president of USRBT, which he has controlled since at least May 1992.  He is the father of Leo and James Driving Hawk.  , Leo R. Driving Hawk, Sr., a resident of Higley, Arizona, is currently listed as vice president of USRBT, with which he has been associated since at least November 2001.  , John M.

Smedley, a resident of Harrison, Ohio, has been associated with USRBT since at least January 1996.  Smedley is currently a vice president of USRBT.   , Kenneth S. Harrison, a resident of Houston, Texas, is the registered agent for Global-Link.  Through his association with Global-Link, Harrison solicited investors for USRBT.  , William J. Herisko, a resident of Palm Springs, California, solicited USRBT investors through his association with Global-Link.  , Thomas T. Emerton, III, a resident of Palm Springs, California, is a principal of Global-Link.

Dennis Herula et al. (United States District Court for the District of Rhode Islands, C.A. No. 02 154 ML, filed April 1, 2002)</i>, The Commission announced today the filing of an emergency action against Martin D. Fife, a Dreyfus fund director, Dennis Herula, a former Raymond James broker, Mary Lee Capalbo, a Rhode Island attorney, Charles Sullivan, a former New England Patriots official, and others in connection with a fraudulent scheme that raised at least $52 million from investors between 1999 and 2001.   the federal district court in Rhode Island on April 3 entered <i>ex parte</i> temporary restraining orders and asset freezes against Fife and others in connection with this conduct.  The Commission alleged in its complaint, filed on April 1, that British citizen Michael Clarke and others promised investors exorbitant returns (such as a nearly 300% return in twelve banking days) through a high yield trading program purportedly operated by Fife under various names, including Brite Business and Seaview Development and Holdings, Ltd.  According to the Commissions complaint, these representations were false because such high yield trading programs do not exist, and several of the defendants have misappropriated or otherwise failed to return over $20 million to investors.  The complaint alleges that, within the past few months, certain of the defendants have either continued to attempt to solicit investors or have made misrepresentations to investors regarding their investments.  , According to the Commissions complaint, Clarke began soliciting investors through Brite Business in 1999.  Fife, who currently serves as a director of several Dreyfus mutual funds, purportedly ran the Brite Business trading program, which he described as a credit enhancement or balance sheet enhancement program involving, among other things, the purchase of T-bills on margin.  The complaint alleges that Fife told one investor that his funds were absolutely safe and that his trading program had been successful when, in fact, Fife had already lost a significant amount of investor funds in his trading program.  The complaint alleges that, between 1999 and 2001, Clarke and Fife misappropriated, transferred or lost approximately $13 million in investor funds.  During this period, most of the Brite Business investor funds were maintained in a brokerage account in Rhode Island at Raymond James Financial Services, Inc. The complaint alleges that Dennis Herula, the registered representative for the Brite Business account, and his wife, Rhode Island attorney Mary Lee Capalbo, played integral roles in the fraudulent scheme and also misappropriated approximately $8 million in investor funds. According to the complaint, Herula solicited an investor for Fifes trading program in 2001, and Herula and Capalbo have both made false statements or provided forged account statements to investors within the past several months.  The complaint alleges that Herula and Capalbo have recently taken steps to dissipate assets, including placing their $5.5 million house on the market and attempting to transfer money to offshore accounts.    , The complaint alleges that several other individuals participated in the fraudulent scheme. Sullivan, a non-practicing New York lawyer whose family formerly owned the New England Patriots NFL franchise, incorporated Brite Business in the U.S. and made false statements to investors concerning their investments.  The complaint also alleges that Robert Wachtel, of California, and Johan Hertzog, of Florida, collectively helped Clarke solicit $20 million in investor funds, and that, in December 2001, Fifes associate, Farouk Khan, of New Jersey, attempted to solicit an additional investment in the trading program from a Brite Business investor.    , The Commission alleged in its complaint that (i) defendants Herula, Capalbo, Fife, Khan, Seaview, Clarke, Wachtel and Hertzog violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; (ii) Sullivan and Capalbo aided and abetted violations of the above provisions of the securities laws; and (iii) Fife violated Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  The Commission also named as a relief defendant David L. Ullom of Rhode Island, who served as Herulas supervisor at Raymond James and received approximately $190,000 in Brite Business investor funds.  The Commission obtained entry of an order temporarily restraining Herula, Capalbo, Fife, Khan and Seaview from directly or indirectly continuing to violate the federal securities laws, an asset freeze against all defendants except for Sullivan, and other emergency relief.  A hearing on the Commissions request for a preliminary injunction has been set for Tuesday, April 9, at 10 a.m.  , The Commission previously filed subpoena enforcement actions against Herula concerning his failure to produce documents in response to a forthwith subpoena, and against Capalbo concerning her failure to comply with a subpoena for testimony.

Initially, defendants falsely claimed, among other things, that Stand-By was in the process of developing personal oxygen dispensers and inhalation masks.  Subsequently, they represented that development was complete and manufacturing had begun.  In reality, little work was ever conducted to develop the oxygen systems.  In fact, a working prototype was never developed.  The defendants also misrepresented the returns associated with the investment, and falsely claimed that investor funds would be used solely for operating expenses of Stand-By.  Contrary to this representation, Palmer diverted a large portion of investor funds for unauthorized personal and business expenditures, including automobiles, maintenance of his boat, settlement of a personal judgment against him, club memberships and living expenses.  Palmer also used investor funds to purchase a residence and an airplane, purportedly for Stand-By business use.  However, Palmer personally held title to the residence and, shortly after its purchase, obtained a loan on the residence and used a large portion of the loan proceeds for personal expenses.  Moreover, Palmer later sold the airplane and placed the proceeds into his personal account.

(April 11, 2002)</h2>, <h2>Xerox Settles SEC Enforcement Action Charging Company with Fraud, Agrees to Pay $10 Million Fine, Restate Its Financial Results and Conduct Special Review of Its Accounting Controls</h2>]","[On April 11, 2002, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil fraud injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging that from at least 1997 through 2000, Xerox Corporation, a Stamford, Connecticut-based public company, employed a variety of undisclosed accounting actions to meet or exceed Wall Street expectations and disguise its true operating performance from investors.  These actions, most of which violated generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), accelerated Xeroxs recognition of equipment revenue by over $3 billion and increased its pre-tax earnings by approximately $1.5 billion over the four-year period from 1997 through 2000., The complaint alleges that these accounting actions, which often were approved, implemented and tracked by senior Xerox management, had a substantial impact on Xeroxs reported performance.  For example, in the fourth quarters of both 1998 and 1999, accounting actions generated 37% of Xeroxs reported pre-tax profit.  The Commissions complaint further alleges that by 1998, nearly $3 of every $10 of Xeroxs annual reported pre-tax earnings resulted from undisclosed accounting actions.  Without these accounting actions, the complaint alleges, Xerox would have fallen short of market earnings expectations in virtually every reporting period from 1997 through 1999., The allegations in the complaint center around seven different accounting actions that Xerox used to help meet or exceed market expectations from 1997 to 2000.  Many of these actions accelerated Xeroxs recognition of revenue into current periods at the expense of future periods.  According to the complaint, Xerox fraudulently disguised these actions so that investors remained unaware that the company was meeting earnings expectations only by using accounting maneuvers that could compromise future results. , The complaint alleges that several of the accounting actions related to Xeroxs leasing arrangements.  Under these arrangements, the revenue stream from Xeroxs customer leases typically had three components:  the value of the box, a term Xerox used to refer to the equipment; revenue that Xerox received for servicing the equipment over the life of the lease; and financing revenue that Xerox received on loans to its lessees.  Under GAAP, Xerox was required to book revenue from the box at the beginning of the lease, but was required to book revenue from servicing and financing over the course of the entire lease.  According to the complaint, Xerox relied on accounting actions to justify shifting more lease revenue to the box, so that a greater portion of that revenue could be recognized immediately., The complaint alleges that the two accounting actions with the largest impact on Xeroxs financial statements were methodologies that Xerox called return on equity and margin normalization.  Xerox used the return on equity method to shift revenue to equipment that the company historically had allocated to financing.  Margin normalization shifted revenue to equipment that historically had been allocated to servicing.  These two methodologies, which did not comply with GAAP, increased Xeroxs equipment revenues by $2.8 billion and its pre-tax earnings by $660 million from 1997 to 2000.  The complaint alleges that Xerox fraudulently failed to disclose to investors its use of and changes to these methodologies  which were changes in accounting methods and changes in accounting estimates. , The complaint also alleges that Xerox used approximately $1 billion of additional accounting actions to artificially improve its operating results.  By using these accounting actions and failing to disclose their use, Xerox violated GAAP as well as disclosure requirements.  These additional actions included the improper use of cushion or cookie jar reserves, the improper recognition of the gain from a one-time event, and miscellaneous lease accounting related actions., In addition, the complaint alleges that Xerox misled investors by failing to disclose the impact that approximately $400 million in sales of leases had on its 1999 operating results.  The effect of these undisclosed sales was to immediately recognize income that otherwise would have been recognized in future periods.  Although the company earlier had entered into similar transactions in small amounts, none compared in size or scope to the 1999 sales, which added $182 million in pre-tax profits to Xeroxs 1999 results., As alleged in the complaint, Xeroxs fraudulent failure to disclose these accounting actions, most of which violated GAAP, resulted in Xerox filing periodic reports with the Commission that contained materially false and misleading statements and omissions, including 12 quarterly and four annual reports covering the period 1997-2000, and seven registration statements that were filed or in effect during this period which included four offerings that registered nearly $9 billion dollars worth of debt securities., Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, Xerox consented to the entry of a Final Judgment that permanently enjoins the company from violating the antifraud, reporting and recordkeeping provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 13a-1, 13a-13, 12b-20 and 13b2-1 promulgated thereunder.

Judge Nathaniel M. Gorton sentenced Paradis, based on his guilty plea to one count of conspiracy to defraud, to 24 months imprisonment, to be followed by two years of supervised release. Judge Gorton sentenced Snyder, based on his guilty plea to one count of conspiracy to defraud, to 14 months imprisonment, to be followed by two years of supervised release.  In addition, Judge Gorton ordered Paradis and Snyder to make restitution to victims in a total amount of $277,769., According to the indictment filed in this matter, Paradis and Snyder raised more than $600,000 from four individuals between January 1995 and March 1998 by falsely claiming that they could obtain funding for business projects by acquiring letters of credit from international prime banks.  Paradis and Snyder falsely represented that the business funding could be obtained only if the individuals made substantial up-front payments to Snyder and Paradis. According to the indictment, the individuals were told that these payments  which ranged as high as $200,000  were to pay fees charged by the prime banks issuing the letters of credit. The individuals were assured that the payments would be maintained in escrow accounts administered by Snyder, who was a licensed attorney in Massachusetts, and refunded if the promised financing did not materialize within seven to thirty days.  Contrary to these assurances, the funds were withdrawn from the escrow accounts shortly after being deposited.  Paradis and Snyder used the funds for their own benefit and that of their relatives, and to pay for items such as rent, clothing, gas and a hairdressing salon., In an earlier, related proceeding, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil enforcement action against Paradis and Snyder on April 13, 1998 alleging that they violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws in connection with the scheme described above.

One defendant, Dr. Jui-Teng Lin, was also indicted today by the United States Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York on related criminal charges.   , The Commissions complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, alleges that Dr. Lin and his wife, Yuchin Lin, reaped over $1,700,000 in ill-gotten gains from manipulating the common stock of Surgilight.  According to the complaint, the Lins artificially inflated the market price of Surgilight stock tenfold (from approximately $2.50 to over $25 per share) through a series of false and misleading press releases issued by Surgilight.  The press releases detailed the companys purported ability to cure age-induced vision deterioration known as Presbyopia.  The Lins simultaneously dumped a substantial amount of Surgilight stock on an unsuspecting public through two nominee accounts and moved the proceeds through a series of offshore accounts to a domestic bank account held in Surgilights name that they controlled.  The Lins settled a prior civil action brought by the Commission involving another laser eye surgery company in September 1998 [see SEC v. Jui-Teng Lin and Yuchin Lin, <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr15870.txt>Litigation Release No. 15870</a> (Sept. 3, 1998)]., The Commission further alleges that the Lins were assisted by Aaron Tsai of Henderson, Kentucky.  According to the complaint, Tsai sold the Lins the publicly traded shell that became Surgilight, supplied the stock that was dumped out of the nominee accounts and, after Surgilight became a publicly-held entity, remained with the company as a consultant.  At the height of the manipulation, Tsai sold over $1,000,000 worth of Surgilight stock for his own account.  , The Commission charges Dr. Lin with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Sections 10(b), 13(d), and 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 13d-1, 13d-2, 16a-2, and 16a-3 thereunder.  Ms. Lin and Surgilight are charged with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Tsai is charged with violations of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act and aiding and abetting Dr. Lin and Ms. Lins violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 thereunder.

Specifically, the complaint alleged that from July 1995 to February 2000, TFC and Isaacs knowingly or recklessly made material false and misleading representations in the offer and sale of promissory notes to the investing public. According to the complaint, investors in the offering were told that their funds would be used to purchase retail automobile installment loan contracts (vehicle loans) and that their investment would be 100% collateralized. , Contrary to these representations, the complaint alleged that investments were not fully collateralized, as only $1.4 million was actually used by TFC to purchase vehicle loans. According to the SEC, the remaining investor funds were used to pay TFCs operating costs and unrelated expenses. The Complaint further alleged that TFC used some of the monies received from new investors to repay interest to existing investors and was thereby engaged in a Ponzi scheme., On October 23, 2001, pursuant to the Commissions motion, the Court ordered Isaacs to disgorge $112,000, with prejudgment interest in the amount of 12,477.44, and imposed a penalty in  the amount of $110,000.<!-- <table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5><tr><td><IMG SRC=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=9 ALT=*  BORDER=0 ALIGN=absmiddle>&nbsp;</td><td><a href=/litigation/complaints/complr17471.htm>SEC Complaint</a> in this matter.</td></tr></table> --><!-- End text -->,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr17471.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Polozola of the United States District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana issued an order of permanent injunction against Harral Dunbar, Jr., in his individual capacity and d/b/a Ghost International, an Internet Website operation.  In an earlier order, the Court found that Dunbar, of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, owned the Ghost International Website and used it to solicit investors in investment contracts by promises of inordinate amounts of guaranteed returns and promises of no-risk investing, and further found that investors have received little or no return despite several months of promises by Dunbar that returns would be paid.  Dunbar consented to the permanent injunction without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions complaint.    , The Commissions complaint alleged that between mid-2001 and March 2002, Dunbar obtained over $7,500 from eleven investors in Canada, Australia and the United States by touting Ghost Internationals private contribution and investment program which allegedly paid, for example, $100,000 on a $200 investment over a few weeks.  Dunbar made various promises of returns, including ones up to 1000 percent.  Dunbar made various representations to fraudulently induce investors including that his company dealt in high yield investments and that funds were to be placed in offshore bank accounts, which would pay promised returns for five months of a supposed seven-month program.  The complaint also alleged that Dunbar lulled investors by making promises that payments would be made shortly.   However, when the time elapsed, the promised payments were not forthcoming.   , The complaint charged Dunbar with, and the Court permanently enjoined Dunbar from, violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Courts order directed that Dunbar pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties, and held that the amounts to be paid shall be resolved upon motion of the Commission at a later date.      , <u>See also</u>:  L.R. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17411.htm>17411</a> (March 14, 2002); L.R. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17400.htm>17400</a> (March 7, 2002)]"

The Commissions complaint alleges that Lerner caused Teltran to materially overstate its reported financial results during its fiscal year ended December 31, 1999 and to make other materially false and misleading statements.  Specifically, the Commissions complaint alleges that during 1999, Teltran entered into a contract to acquire Channelnet Limited, a company located in the United Kingdom.  The contract was signed on July 15, 1999 and the transaction closed on August 16, 1999.  Teltran, however, recorded the acquisition as of June 1, 1999, before Teltran had effective control of Channelnet.  The use of the earlier effective date was not in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and caused Teltran to materially overstate its reported revenues in its June 30 and September 30, 1999 Forms 10-Q and December 31, 1999 Form 10-K., The complaint also alleges that during 1999, Teltran projected that it would generate $30 million in revenue and earn $.30 per share for the year.  Teltran made false and misleading statements concerning its prospects for 1999 after it became known that it would not meet its projections.  During 1999, Teltran also adopted analyst reports by republishing them on its Internet website.  Certain reports contained baseless stock price and earnings per share projections and misleading statements concerning Teltrans chances for obtaining a listing on the American Stock Exchange.  Finally, the Commissions complaint alleges that, during the relevant time period, Lerner obtained an improper benefit of approximately $78,000 by selling Teltran stock. , Lerner consented, without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, to be permanently enjoined from violating or aiding and abetting violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13 and 13b2-1 thereunder, and pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $87,500 and a $50,000 civil penalty., In a separate administrative proceeding, Teltran, without admitting or denying the Commissions findings, consented to cease and desist from committing or causing any violation and any future violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.

In June 1993, Greenberg consented to a judgment enjoining him from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, and, in September 1994, Greenberg pleaded guilty to two felony counts in a related federal criminal proceeding.  The Commissions complaint alleged that Greenberg prepared or directed the preparation of numerous statements by USDL to the press and to shareholders which identified him as an officer of USDL and purported to discuss his background, but which fraudulently failed to disclose his criminal conviction and previous injunction.  The Commissions complaint further alleged that, although Greenberg operated as an officer of USDL, was represented as such in statements disseminated to the press and investors, and held himself out as such, Greenberg was not identified as an officer in USDLs filings with the Commission, and his conviction and injunction were not disclosed in those filings.  Although Greenberg was aware of the fraudulent omissions in those filings, he did nothing to correct or prohibit them.  The complaint also alleged that Coyote, through the activities of Greenberg, acted as a broker without registering with the Commission.  Coyote is a Florida limited liability company owned by a Greenberg family trust and Greenbergs wife and controlled by Greenberg.  , The Final Judgment by Default permanently enjoins Greenberg from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, and from aiding and abetting violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13.

Hoover, and his registered investment advisory firm, Hoover Capital Management (HCM), and adding Hoovers unregistered investment advisory firm, Chestnut Management, as a defendant.  The amended complaint alleges that the defendants solicited and obtained investments in the Chestnut Fund LP, a domestic hedge fund established by Hoover in April 2000, by making fraudulent misrepresentations to prospective investors, both orally and in writing in the funds private placement memorandum.  The amended complaint also alleges that during an 18 month period after establishing the hedge fund, the defendants misappropriated more than $625,000 from the hedge fund, improperly used these funds for personal and business expenses, and concealed the misappropriation by distributing fictitious account statements to investors.  At the same time defendants were depleting the hedge funds assets, Hoover was also using his position as the funds investment adviser for his own personal gain.  In February 2001, Hoover agreed that the hedge fund would purchase convertible debentures in a privately held company.  During negotiations over the terms of the debentures, Hoover, in breach of his fiduciary duties to the hedge fund, offered that the company could pay a lower interest rate on the hedge funds investment in return for Hoover receiving both a higher finders fee, and options to purchase common stock in the company.  Lastly, the amended complaint alleges that to satisfy the hedge funds obligation to purchase the convertible debentures, Hoover invested $700,000 that belonged to another client, a private charitable foundation.  This investment was not disclosed to the foundation, and the foundations investment management agreement with Hoover expressly prohibited investments in privately-held companies.  , The Commission filed its initial complaint on May 2, 2001 charging Hoover and HCM among other things, with misappropriating $475,000 from HCM clients between 1995 and 1998. On November 15, 2001, the Commission filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and asset freeze based on allegations that Hoover and HCM has misappropriated more the $470,000 from the Chestnut Fund.  The court entered a temporary restraining order against Hoover and HCM on November 19, 2001.  On December 13, 2001, with defendants consent, the court entered a Preliminary Injunction and froze Hoover and HCMs assets (except for funds unrelated to the fraud acquired after November 21, 2001).  , For more information see Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17248.htm>17248</a>, December 19, 2001; Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17240.htm>17240</a>, November 19, 2001; Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17236.htm>17236</a>, November 16, 2001; and Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr16983.htm>16983</a>, May 2, 2001., ]"

In reality, the Schwab funds he described did not exist and he simply deposited the money into his personal brokerage account.  , In a complaint filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, the Commission alleges that William M. Ucherek, through his work selling municipal bonds, developed relationships with many elderly investors.  Beginning in at least 1998, Ucherek offered at least 20 clients investments in what he claimed were pooled municipal bond funds that would pay a fixed rate of interest, tax-free.  Ucherek called these funds the Schwab 12, Schwab 24, and Schwab 36 (depending on the term of the investment).  In fact, no such funds exist.  Ucherek used the money to pay personal expenses, including car payments, credit card bills and gambling debts.  In addition, Ucherek used some of the proceeds to pay prior investors, and also provided phony account statements to create the appearance of a bona fide investment fund.  , According to the complaint, in late 2001 one of the investors contacted Schwab, which initiated an internal investigation and traced the scheme back to Ucherek.  Ucherek subsequently admitted his misconduct to the staff of the Commission., The Commissions complaint charges that Ucherek committed securities fraud in violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint seeks a permanent injunction against future violations, disgorgement of all ill gotten gains and a civil monetary penalty from Ucherek.   ]"

Tinder, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Indiana, sentenced Kenneth R. Payne (Payne), a resident of Indianapolis, Indiana, to seventeen years and seven months in prison, and ordered him to pay restitution of more than $27 million for orchestrating a $29 million Ponzi scheme.  In January, Payne, former president of Heartland Financial Services, Inc. (Heartland), entered a guilty plea to five counts of mail fraud and one count of money laundering based on his fraudulent conduct in connection with the Ponzi scheme.  The criminal case was prosecuted by the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of Indiana., Previously, on August 10, 2000, Judge Tinder, who also presides over a lawsuit filed by the SEC captioned SEC v. Payne, et al., IP00-1265 C, entered a temporary restraining order in that case against Payne, Daniel G. Danker (Danker), Heartland, JMS Investment Group, LLC (JMS), Johann M. Smith (Smith) and Constance Brooks-Kiefer (Brooks-Kiefer) for their involvement in the Ponzi scheme.  The SECs complaint in the civil lawsuit alleged that from at least January 1998 to the present, the defendants defrauded investors, many of whom were elderly, through the offer and sale of three bogus investment opportunities: (1) initial public offerings of financial institutions and technology companies represented by units of JMS; (2) interests in an offshore bank located in Belize; and (3) units of Heartland as well as stocks, money markets and mutual funds through Heartland.  Rather than use investor funds for legitimate securities transactions, the SEC alleged that the defendants commingled investors funds from all three schemes in a common bank account controlled by Smith and Brooks-Kiefer and used most of the $29 million raised from investors to repay investors in the Ponzi scheme and for other non-investment related purposes [See SEC v. Kenneth R. Payne, et al., Litigation Release No. 16650]., Additionally, on August 21, 2000, Judge Tinder entered orders of preliminary injunction against Payne and Heartland [See SEC v. Kenneth R.

Specifically, the complaint alleges that Mallory falsely told investors that he had entered into a contract with Verizon Communications whereby Verizon agreed to purchase 80% of Anamar at $.10 per share. According to the complaint, Mallory offered the investors the opportunity to purchase Anamar stock at $.05 per share and told them that they would double their money and that their investment would be virtually risk-free, because if for any reason Verizon decided not to go through with the deal, Anamar would receive an opt-out fee and would then be free to sell to another bidder.  The stockholders, in turn, could decide to stay in or sell their shares back to Anamar for their original purchase price.  The complaint alleges that at least ten or eleven investors paid Mallory a total of $131,500 for their Anamar stock based upon Mallorys misrepresentations.  If convicted, Mallory faces up to five years imprisonment, to be followed by three years of supervised release and a $250,000 fine.  , In an earlier, related proceeding, the Securities and Exchange Commission obtained an ex parte temporary restraining order and asset freeze against Mallory and Anamar on March 15, 2002 and a preliminary injunction on April 1, 2002 from the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts based on the Commissions prima facie showing that Mallory and Anamar had violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws by fraudulently offering and selling shares of Anamar stock via the Internet and other means in connection with the scheme described above. , For further information, please see Litigation Release Numbers <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17452.htm>17452</a> (April 1, 2002) and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17419.htm>17419</a> (March 15, 2002).]"

OH) (May 2, 2002), Today, the Commission filed a civil action charging Edward Fruchtenbaum, the former COO and President of American Greetings, with fraud in connection with his sale of 30,000 shares of American Greetings stock on December 21, 1998.  , Specifically, the Commissions complaint alleges that in November 1998, internal plans prepared by Fruchtenbaum and other senior managers projected a large earnings shortfall during American Greetings upcoming fiscal year.  The Commission also charges that in November and December 1998, Fruchtenbaum knew the Companys senior managers were moving toward implementing a new inventory system in the next fiscal year, and that implementing the new system would reduce revenue significantly.  The Commission alleges that before Fruchtenbaum traded on December 21, 1998, he met with the Companys CEO and General Counsel, who both told him he should not trade at that time.  Despite the disapproval of the General Counsel and the CEO, however, Fruchtenbaum went through with his plans.  On December 21, 1998, Fruchtenbaum exercised all his then exercisable options to purchase 30,000 shares of American Greetings common stock at prices ranging from $19.25 to $29.50 per share.  He then immediately sold the resulting shares for prices ranging from $40.00 to $41.63 per share.  Of the shares Fruchtenbaum traded on December 21, 1998, 4,500 were Class A shares which he sold in the open market, and 35,500 were Class B shares which he sold back to the Company itself., The Commission charges that Fruchtenbaum engaged in manipulative and deceptive conduct in that he did not inform the CEO or General Counsel that he was proceeding with the trades despite their disapproval; he did not inform the American Greetings employees who processed the trades that the CEO and General Counsel had disapproved of his trades; and he did not publicly disclose his material, nonpublic information about the Companys financial condition before he sold his Class A shares to the public.  , According to the Commissions complaint, American Greetings announced on February 24, 1999 that it was implementing the new inventory system and that it projected a $100 million revenue shortfall for its upcoming fiscal year.  The day of the announcement, the price of American Greetings stock fell 32% from $35.06 to $23.875.  By exercising all his exercisable options and selling the resulting 30,000 shares before the public announcement, Fruchtenbaum earned approximately $490,625 more than he would have earned had he waited until after the announcement., Based on the foregoing, the Commissions complaint charges that Fruchtenbaum violated Sections 17(a)(1), 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint seeks the entry of a permanent injunction against Fruchtenbaum, the entry of an order barring Fruchtenbaum from serving as an officer or director of any reporting company, as well as disgorgement of his ill-gotten gains, plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. , ]"

According to the Commission, U.S. Funding Corporation guaranteed investors annual returns of 20% to 25%.  Instead, the complaint alleges that U.S. Funding diverted so much of the investment proceeds to its president, Angelica Gwinnett of Paramus, New Jersey, and to its telemarketers, that it is impossible for investors to recover their principal, much less earn the promised returns.  On the Commissions motion, the court issued an order temporarily restraining defendants from violating the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws, freezing defendants assets, and granting other emergency relief. , In a complaint filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, the Commission alleges that U.S. Funding and Gwinnett hired telemarketers to solicit investors in its accounts receivable factoring business - the practice of buying a companys receivables at a discount. Persons responding to the spam e-mail received documents in which U.S. Funding claimed to have been in business since 1998, as well as financial statements showing substantial assets and revenue.  The Commission alleges that the representations were entirely false; in fact, U.S. Funding did not even begin operations until December 2001, several months after it had begun to spam investors., According to the complaint, U.S. Funding promised to pay investors 20% in annual returns, or 25% annually for a two-year investment, plus the full return of their principal at the end of the term.  Although U.S. Funding used some of the proceeds to purchase accounts receivable, the Commission alleges that, unbeknownst to investors, 35% of investor funds were going to U.S. Fundings telemarketers.  In addition, Gwinnett misappropriated over $300,000 for personal use.  Among other things, Gwinnett withdrew $75,000 of investor funds for a weekend in Las Vegas.  As a result of these and other undisclosed expenditures, investors cannot possibly earn the promised returns., The Commissions complaint charges U.S. Funding and Gwinnett with violating the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Carl E. Putnam, Donald C. Welchko, John P. Figurelli, Daryl T. Spinell, Ronald M. Bandyk, and Renee L. LeVault </i>(United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois No. 02C 3235)., On May 6, 2002, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil enforcement action alleging that from January 1, 1998 through March 30, 2000 six Anicom, Inc. executives and other employees carried out a massive financial fraud at the now-bankrupt company.  In the suit, filed in federal court in the Northern District of Illinois, the Commission alleged that during this period, the defendants falsely reported millions of dollars of non-existent sales, including sales to a fictitious customer, and used other fraudulent techniques to inflate Anicoms revenues by over $38 million and net income by over $20 million.  To conceal the fraud, certain of the defendants lied to Anicoms outside auditors, lied to the Audit Committee of Anicoms Board of Directors in an internal investigation, and withheld information from the Commissions staff.  When aspects of the fraud were eventually revealed to the public, Anicoms shareholders lost more than $80 million., The Commissions complaint alleged that the fraud had two distinct aspects.  First, President and Chief Executive Officer Carl E. Putnam, along with Vice President of Sales Daryl T. Spinell, Chief Operating Officer John P. Figurelli, and Billing Manager Renee L. LeVault improperly recognized numerous sales that inflated reported revenues and net profits.  Additionally, Chief Financial Officer Donald C. Welchko, with assistance from Figurelli, LeVault, and Vice President of Accounting Ronald M. Bandyk, C.P.A., and with at least Putnams knowledge, caused Anicom in 1999 to improperly recognize over $11.7 million in sales to a fictitious customer called SCL Integration in order to minimize the effect on income of writing off earlier improper sales.  Second, Welchko and Bandyk engaged in fraud by entering journal entries that improperly charged certain expenses to an inadvertently created reserve account and a Restructuring Charge, unjustifiably inflated purchase rebates accrued, and accelerated the recognition of sales between reporting periods., The Commission also alleged that in 1999 Putnam and Welchko misled two investigations into allegations of improper sales at Anicom.  In October 1999, Putnam and Welchko directed an employee to lie about his knowledge of improper sales during an internal investigation into allegations of sales misconduct.  At the time, Putnam told the employee that Anicom was doing the internal investigation just in case the SEC came calling.  In December 1999, the Commission requested that Anicom voluntarily produce information related to sales credits issued in 1999.  Welchko instructed an Anicom employee to compile the responsive data but to remove all sales credits relating to SCL Integration.  As a result, Anicom produced the requested information to the Commission having removed all evidence of the fictitious customer., <u>Defendants</u>, The Commissions complaint named the following defendants:, <u>Carl E. Putnam</u>, age 52, resides in Naperville, Illinois.  Putnam had overall responsibility for Anicoms sales.  He became Anicoms President in 1993, a Director in 1994, and was made Chief Executive Officer in September 1999.  Putnam signed Anicoms annual report, and participated in making public statements about that and other reports filed with the Commission.  On July 18, 2000, the Board of Directors placed him on administrative leave.  On September 11, 2000, he resigned all positions., <u>Donald C. Welchko</u>, age 47, resides in Willow Springs, Illinois.  Welchko had overall responsibility for Anicoms accounting and finance functions.  In 1995, he became Anicoms Chief Financial Officer, and in 1998 was made a Director and an Audit Committee member.  Welchko participated in preparing Anicoms annual and quarterly reports filed with the Commission.  He also signed Anicoms annual and quarterly reports, and participated in making public statements about those reports.  On July 18, 2000, the Board placed him on administrative leave.  On September 11, 2000, he resigned all positions., The complaint also names the following people as defendants.  <u>John P. Figurelli</u>, 54, a resident of Libertyville, Illinois, was Anicoms Chief Operating Officer.  <u>Daryl T. Spinell</u>, 38, a resident of Naperville, Illinois, was Anicoms Vice President of Sales.  <u>Ronald M. Bandyk</u>, 37, a resident of LaGrange, Illinois, was Anicoms Vice President of Accounting.  <u>Renee L. LeVault</u>, 33, a resident of Huntley, Illinois, managed Anicoms Billing Department., <u>Anicom, Inc.</u>, Prior to its January 2001 bankruptcy, Anicom was a wire and cable distribution company that employed nearly 1,200 people nationwide and was based in Rosemont, Illinois., <u>The Commission Seeks Permanent Injunctions, Civil Monetary Penalties, Disgorgement of Ill-Gotten Gains, and Officer and Directors Bars</u>, In its complaint, the Commission alleged that the defendants conduct violated the antifraud, periodic reporting, record keeping, internal controls, and lying to the auditors provisions of the federal securities laws.  Accordingly, the Commission requests that the court issue a final judgment of permanent injunction and other relief, enjoining them from violating Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b), and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 promulgated thereunder, and aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 promulgated thereunder.

(Home Port) stock in July 2000 while in possession of material, nonpublic information concerning an impending merger involving Home Port.  Among other relief, the defendant consented to a civil penalty that is equal to two times the amount of his illegal trading profits.  , Named in the Commissions complaint is Steven S. Goldberg (Goldberg), age 58, an attorney admitted to the New York State Bar, and a registered representative from 1987 until 2001 associated with MML Investors Services, Inc., a registered broker-dealer and wholly owned subsidiary of Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company.  , The Commissions complaint alleges that: , <b>STEVEN S. GOLDBERG </b>engaged in illegal insider trading by purchasing Home Port Bancorp, Inc. (Home Port) stock while in possession of material, nonpublic information concerning an impending merger involving Home Port.  In mid to late May, Home Ports management agreed upon the essential terms of a merger with Seacoast Financial Services Corporation.  On or around June 7, 2000, Goldberg met with a longstanding client who was an officer of Home Port to provide legal advice.  At that meeting, the client communicated to Goldberg that: (i) Seacoast had agreed to acquire Home Port for $37 per share in cash; (ii) the client would receive a large sum of money as a result of the transaction; (iii) Goldberg needed to know about the transaction because he was doing estate work for the client; and (iv) the transaction was going to be completed.  On July 18, 2000 Goldberg purchased 2,000 shares of Home Port common stock, and caused a trust account maintained for the benefit of his mother to purchase 1,000 shares of Home Port, despite having been warned by his client that the information was confidential.  The merger was announced on July 21, 2000 and Home Port stock rose over 40 percent.  By purchasing Home Port stock in advance of the merger announcement, Goldberg illegally profited  $28,546., Simultaneous with the filing of the complaint, Goldberg consented, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, to the entry of a final judgment: (1) permanently enjoining him from violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; (2) ordering him to disgorge $28,546 in illegal profits and to pay prejudgment interest of $3,553; and (3) ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $57,092, which represents two times the amount of his illegal profits.  The Commission will also institute an administrative proceeding to which Goldberg has consented, barring him from association with a broker or dealer.  The Commission considers the conduct alleged in this case to be especially egregious particularly considering the defendants breach of his professional obligations., ]"

The TRO also froze Corrieres assets, as well as those of the relief defendants, Maria Rosa Corriere, Quantum Equities, Inc. and The Kings Fellowship, Inc., whom the Commission alleged received proceeds from the fraud.   , The Commissions complaint alleged that Corriere, age 64, a resident of Clearwater, Florida, raised almost $3 million from investors located across the country.  The Complaint alleged that Corriere offered participation interests in fictitious prime bank trading programs involving medium term notes or MTNs.  Corriere promised investors a return of 100 percent per week, guaranteed investors that they could not lose their initial investment, and told investors that these trading programs were risk-free and safe.  According to the Commissions complaint, these trading programs do not exist, investors never received the returns promised, and most investors lost their initial investment.

The Commissions complaint charges that Pinnacle, Lo Castro and Turino violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.  , The Commissions complaint alleges that the April 2, 2002 press release materially misled investors regarding a proposed spin-off of a Pinnacle subsidiary known as All Pro.  In the press release, Pinnacle stated that after a spin-off to Pinnacle shareholders, All Pro will seek a listing on the American Stock Exchange (AMEX), and that its initial trading price will be $4.00 per share.  Pinnacles shareholders are scheduled to receive one share of All Pro for every fifty shares of Pinnacle stock that they own.  Under Pinnacles formulation, an investment of $0.35 for fifty Pinnacle shares (Pinnacle shares trade for approximately $0.007) would pay a $4.00 dividend when All Pro begins trading on the AMEX in June 2002.  The Commissions complaint alleges that Pinnacle lacked a reasonable basis for stating that All Pro will trade at $4.00 per share, that Pinnacle misquoted an AMEX floor broker to convey a false and misleading endorsement of the companys claims, that Pinnacle overstated the likelihood that All Pro will obtain an AMEX listing, and that given Pinnacles nearly two billion shares of common stock outstanding, an implied initial market capitalization of $160 million for All Pro is materially misleading., The Commission is seeking permanent injunctions and civil penalties against Pinnacle, Lo Castro and Turino.

Brown Cummins agreed to the Order without admitting the allegations contained in the Commissions Motion.  The Commissions Motion for an Order to Show Cause, filed on July 13, 2001, alleged that after entry of the Courts Order of Permanent Injunction on February 26, 2001, Brown Cummins transferred funds belonging to Defendant Stephen G. Donahue into its general operating account to pay Donahues legal fees in violation of the asset freeze imposed by the Order of Permanent Injunction.  The Motion also alleged that Brown Cummins failed to turn over funds belonging to Donahue to the court-appointed Receiver as required by the Courts Order Appointing a Receiver entered on March 6, 2001.  , The Commissions Complaint in this matter alleged that Donahue engaged in a 12-year scheme to misappropriate at least $6 million from at least 200 of his brokerage clients.  The Courts Order of Permanent Injunction, entered pursuant to Donahues consent, permanently enjoined Donahue from further violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, froze all funds belonging to Donahue or in which he held a beneficial interest and ordered Donahue to pay disgorgement and civil penalties in amounts to be determined in a separate hearing.  The Courts Order Appointing a Receiver ordered all persons to turn over to the Receiver any property owned by Donahue or in which Donahue had an interest.    , For further information, see <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr16909.htm>LR-16909</a> (February 28, 2001) and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17075.htm>LR-17075</a> (July 24, 2001).]"

MICHAEL GAUSE</u>, Criminal Action No. 99 Cr. 1100 (JGK)(S.D.N.Y., October 24, 1999), MICHAEL GAUSE SENTENCED TO 10 YEARS AND 7 MONTHS IN PRISON FOR ROLE IN CASH 4 TITLES PONZI SCHEME, On May 1, 2002, Michael Gause, the leader of an international Ponzi scheme that defrauded more than 1,800 investors out of more than $157 million, was sentenced in Manhattan federal court by United States District Judge John G. Koeltl to 10 years and 7 months in prison.  Gause was arrested on October 15, 1999 by the FBI.  The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) and the United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York (S.D.N.Y.) coordinated the civil and criminal actions.  The S.D.N.Y. prosecuted the criminal case.  In addition to the term of imprisonment, Judge Koeltl also ordered Gause to pay restitution to his victims in the amount of $157,993,830., Gause previously pled guilty to conspiracy, securities fraud, and international money laundering charges relating to his participation in the sale of high-interest debt securities, the proceeds of which were supposedly for the use of Cash 4 Titles, an Atlanta, Georgia, finance company that made high-interest consumer loans secured by car titles pledged as collateral by borrowers.  Gause and others represented to investors that the proceeds from the sale of the securities would be provided to Cash 4 Titles and then lent at high-interest rates to consumers.  In truth, however, virtually all of the proceeds were used for the improper and undisclosed purposes of paying principal and interest due to earlier investors in the scheme, paying business expenses necessary to promote the scheme, and paying commissions and personal expenses of Gause and others.  Gause conducted much of the fraudulent investment scheme from the Cayman Islands, where he controlled a network of offshore corporations, trusts, and bank accounts.  , In the Commissions related civil action filed on October 15, 1999, the Court has imposed asset freezes on Gause and the 44 other defendants and relief defendants named in the scheme.  On January 14, 2000, the Court entered a permanent injunction against Gause, by consent, against future violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the securities laws, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  On December 10, 1999, the Court appointed Phillip S. Stenger as Receiver.  Mr. Gause has turned over to the Receiver assets valued at over $9 million including a bank account and houses in Cummings Georgia and Fort Lauderdale Florida.  The case is still pending against all defendants.  , Gause, who has been in custody since his arrest in 1999, was a former resident of Fort Lauderdale, FL, Cummings, GA, and Georgetowne, Cayman Islands., For more information, go to the Receivers website at www.cash4titles.com., [See SEC v.

Fla.)</h2>, <h2>SEC Wins Jury Verdict Against Penny Stock Trader Jerry Rosen and Accomplices for Role in Systems of Excellence Manipulation; Final Judgments Order Disgorgement, Prejudgment Interest, Civil Penalties and a Personal Trading Ban Against Rosen</h2>, <h2>Final Judgment Against Rosen</h2>, <h2>Final Judgments Against Diversified and Calvo  </h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on April 24, 2002, the Honorable Donald M. Middlebrooks, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Florida, entered final judgments against penny stock trader Jerome E. Rosen, disbarred attorney William A. Calvo III, and Calvos company, Diversified Corporate Consulting Group.  Rosen, the trader exclusively responsible for his firms market making activity in Systems of Excellence, Inc. (SOE), accepted a bribe, in the form of free SOE stock, in exchange for his efforts to manipulate the price of SOE.  Diversified, a company controlled by Calvo, among others, supported Rosens fraudulent and manipulative trading activity and sold unregistered shares of SOE while one of its principals was touting SOE in a popular penny stock newsletter.  The final judgments, which follow a March 7, 2002 jury verdict in favor of the SEC, permanently enjoin (i) Rosen and Diversified from future violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and (ii) Calvo, Rosen and Diversified from future violations of the registration provisions.  In total, Rosen, Calvo and Diversified were ordered to pay more than $3.8 million in ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest and civil penalties, all arising from their respective roles in the manipulation of SOE stock.  Additionally, the Court enjoined Rosen from buying and selling individual stocks.  With these final judgments, the Commission has now successfully concluded seven separate enforcement actions arising from its investigation of SOE, assisted in obtaining four criminal convictions, deregistered the securities of SOE, and recovered approximately $15 million for defrauded investors.  Two related lawsuits against other defendants are still pending., The jury found that Rosen, a well-known penny stock trader working from the Aventura, Florida branch office of J. Alexander Securities, Inc. (J. Alexander) manipulated the price of SOE stock.  Rosen accepted a bribe in the form of SOE stock from Charles Huttoe, then the President of SOE, as an inducement to manipulate the price of SOE stock.  Rosen then conspired with Huttoe, Sheldon Kraft (a stock promoter previously charged in this scheme), Diversified and Joseph D. Radcliffe (a co-defendant who settled upon the Commissions filing of its complaint) to obtain an exclusive supply of SOE stock, at favorable prices, in order to support his fraudulent and manipulative trading activity.  The jury also found that Rosen had engaged in insider trading during the same period as a result of his access to material, nonpublic information supplied by Huttoe.  The manipulative conduct and insider trading both violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Finally, the jury found that Rosen resold unregistered SOE stock in violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act., In addition to enjoining Rosen from violating the antifraud and registration provisions, the Courts order requires Rosen to disgorge $992,891.01, representing $615,966.50 in ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $376,925.01, and pay a separate $100,000 civil penalty.  The disgorgement figure represents Rosens share of trading profits that J. Alexander paid Rosen for his fraudulent SOE market-making activity and profits Rosen earned on the resale of SOE stock that he received from Huttoe.  Further, the Court enjoined Rosen from directly or indirectly buying or selling securities registered with the SEC pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act or securities meeting the definition of penny stock set forth in Exchange Act Rule 3a51.  Finally, the Court required Rosen to maintain records relating to the activities described in the Complaint for three years and to provide the SEC with a sworn accounting of all his assets and liabilities., The jury also found against Diversified for its involvement in Rosens manipulation of SOE stock and for its participation in the scalping of SOE shares, in violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act.  The scalping related to Diversifieds resale of SOE shares while one of Diversifieds principals, Theodore Melcher, Jr., was touting SOE in a popular penny stock newsletter.  Previously, in a February 21, 2002 ruling on the Commissions motion for summary judgment, the Court found that Diversified and Calvo had violated Section 5 of the Securities Act by reselling, or by being a necessary or substantial participant in the resale of, unregistered SOE shares. , In addition to enjoining Diversified from violating the antifraud and registration provisions and enjoining Calvo from violating the registration provisions, the Court entered orders against Diversified and Calvo requiring them to jointly and severally disgorge $2,511,145.70, representing $1,636,556.51 in gains from their illegal resales of unregistered SOE stock plus prejudgment interest of $874,589.19, and to pay a civil penalty of $50,000 each.  Further, the Court required Calvo and Diversified to maintain records relating to the activities described in the complaint for three years and to provide the SEC with a sworn accounting of all their assets and liabilities., The Commission previously has made several announcements concerning these matters.  <i>See</i> <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr16881.htm>Lit Rel. 16881</a> (January 31, 2001); <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr16804.htm>Lit.

Tank Black, a former professional sports agent, was sentenced to serve 60 months in prison and ordered to pay $12 million in restitution stemming from charges that he defrauded his athlete-clients in multiple investment schemes over a three-year period.  The Hon. Stephan P. Mickle imposed the maximum sentence after a hearing in United States District Court in the Northern District of Florida (Gainesville Division)., On January 31, 2002, a jury found Black guilty of conspiring to commit mail fraud, to commit wire fraud, to obstruct the SECs parallel investigation and to defraud the United States gvernment.  The United States Attorney for the Northern District of Florida prosecuted Black for the same conduct that underlies a civil enforcement action brought by the Commission in February 2000 against Black and others in United States District Court in the Middle District of Florida.  The Commissions lawsuit, which has been stayed pending resolution of the criminal case, alleges that Black and his sports agency business, Professional Management, Inc., defrauded nearly two dozen client-athletes of millions of dollars they entrusted to Black for investment purposes.   The Commissions complaint alleges: , , , , The guilty verdict included, as an object of the conspiracy, Blacks obstruction of the Commissions parallel investigation.  At trial, the jury heard evidence that Black lied under oath in his SEC testimony, produced fabricated documents to the SEC and failed to produce numerous other documents in response to Commission subpoenas. , Judge Mickle ordered that Black serve his 60-month sentence after completing a prior sentence of nearly seven years for his role in laundering $1.1 million for a drug ring in Detroit.  In the Detroit case, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan prosecuted Black for laundering drug money through the same Cash 4 Titles Ponzi scheme that he pitched to his client-athletes.  Black began serving the Detroit sentence in June 2001.  Additionally, Black still faces an additional money laundering conspiracy charge in the Northern District of Florida.

(MIR), Joseph Rubbo (J. Rubbo), MIRs president and CEO, and Peter D. Ragofsky (Ragofsky), a salesperson who touted investments in MIR. The Amended Complaint charges the following additional defendants with violations of the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws: Cine Star, Inc. (Cine Star), a nominee corporation controlled by J. Rubbo and several of his family members; Angela Rubbo (Sr.), J. Rubbos mother and a control person of MIR and Cine Star; Angela Rubbo (Jr.), J. Rubbos sister and the president of MIR; Pasquale Rubbo, J. Rubbos brother and the supervisor of a boiler room that sold unregistered MIR securities; and Nicholas Rubbo, J. Rubbos brother and a control person of Cine Star., The Commissions Amended Complaint alleges as follows: From at least January through February 2002, the Defendants sought to raise $90 million through a fraudulent unregistered offering of MIR securities. During this two-month period, MIR raised at least $80,500 from unsuspecting investors. MIR solicited investors by placing an Offering Memorandum on its Internet web-site and by running a boiler room operation that cold-called investors and touted MIR securities. The Offering Memorandum contained numerous false statements concerning, among other things, MIRs rights to a movie project entitled New Horizons purportedly starring Tom Cruise and Catherine Zeta-Jones. In fact, MIR never had any rights to New Horizons and neither Tom Cruise nor Catherine Zeta-Jones had made any commitments to the New Horizons project. The Offering Memorandum also falsely stated that only 15% of the proceeds raised by MIR would be used for expenses that were not related to MIRs purported media projects. In reality, at least 60% of the proceeds raised were used by the Rubbos to pay personal and other expenses related to the MIR boiler room. The Rubbos operated MIR together as a fraudulent family business. Each of the Rubbos participated in the drafting of the Offering Memorandum and they all played essential roles in the operation of the MIR boiler room. Investor proceeds were deposited into accounts in the name of Cine Star, which the Rubbos controlled., The Commissions Amended Complaint charges all of the defendants with violations of the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The Amended Complaint also seeks permanent injunctions prohibiting future violations of the securities laws, disgorgement, and civil penalties. On February 21, 2002, the Commission obtained emergency relief, which included an order temporarily restraining the Defendants from violating the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws and freezing the assets of MIR. (See <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17371.htm>Litigation Release No. 17371</a>). MIR, J.

Fife, a former Dreyfus fund independent director, Dennis Herula, a former Raymond James broker, Mary Lee Capalbo, a Rhode Island attorney, and others in connection with a fraudulent scheme that raised at least $52 million from investors between 1999 and 2001.  The court had previously entered <i>ex parte</i> temporary restraining orders and asset freezes on April 3, 2002 against the same defendants in connection with this conduct.  , The Commission alleged in its complaint, filed April 1, 2002, that British citizen Michael Clarke and others promised investors exorbitant returns (such as a nearly 300% return in twelve banking days) through a high yield trading program purportedly operated by Fife under various names, including Brite Business and Seaview Development and Holdings, Ltd.  According to the Commissions complaint, these representations were false because such high yield trading programs do not exist.  The complaint alleges that Fife, who until recently served as an independent director of several Dreyfus mutual funds, purportedly ran the Brite Business trading program, which he described as a credit enhancement or balance sheet enhancement program. The complaint further alleges that, between 1999 and 2001, Clarke and Fife misappropriated, transferred or lost approximately $13 million in investor funds.  The Commission does not allege that anyone at Dreyfus knew of or participated in the fraudulent scheme.  According to the Commissions complaint, most of the Brite Business investor funds were maintained in a brokerage account in Rhode Island at Raymond James Financial Services, Inc.  The complaint alleges that Dennis Herula, the registered representative for the Brite Business account, and his wife, Rhode Island attorney Mary Lee Capalbo, played integral roles in the fraudulent scheme and also misappropriated approximately $8 million in investor funds.  According to the complaint, Herula and Capalbo have both made false statements or provided forged account statements to investors within the past several months., The complaint alleges that several other individuals participated in the fraudulent scheme. The complaint further alleges that Charles Sullivan, a non-practicing New York lawyer whose family formerly owned the New England Patriots NFL franchise, incorporated Brite Business in the U.S. and made false statements to investors concerning their investments.  The complaint also alleges that Robert Wachtel, of California, and Johan Hertzog, of Florida, collectively helpedClarke solicit $20 million in investor funds, and that, in December 2001, Fifes associate, Farouk Khan, of New Jersey, attempted to solicit an additional investment in the trading program from a Brite Business investor.  , The Commission alleged in its complaint that (i) defendants Herula, Capalbo, Fife, Khan, Seaview, Clarke, Wachtel and Hertzog violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; (ii) Sullivan and Capalbo aided and abetted violations of the above provisions of the securities laws; and (iii) Fife violated Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  The Commission also named as a relief defendant David L. Ullom of Rhode Island, who served as Herulas supervisor at Raymond James and received approximately $190,000 in Brite Business investor funds.  , After a two-day preliminary injunction hearing concerning defendants Herula, Capalbo, Fife, Khan and Seaview that concluded on April 24, 2002, the court entered a Memorandum and Order on May 1, 2002, finding that the Commission is likely to succeed in proving that these defendants violated the securities laws, and there is a strong likelihood that violations may occur in the future if these defendants are not enjoined.  The court further found that there is a high risk that any remaining investor funds may be further depleted.

Lazorwitz and Tri-Star were ordered to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest and civil penalties in amounts to be resolved upon motion of the Commission at a later date.  Relief defendant Lazor, Ltd. was ordered to pay disgorgement in an amount to be resolved upon motion of the Commission at a later date.  Lazorwitz, Tri-Star and Lazor, Ltd. consented to the entry of the orders without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions complaint.  Defendant J. Charles Reives (Reives) was not affected by the entry of these orders.    , The Commissions complaint alleged a multimillion-dollar, nationwide, prime bank type and other securities fraud.  Lazorwitz, a Texas resident, and Reives, a North Carolina resident, were alleged to have promoted the fraudulent scheme as Tri-Stars general partners, in which they used the general partnership to offer and sell unregistered securities in Tri-Star to over 900 investors in at least 35 states, and raised over $15 million, and that Tri-Star, through Lazorwitz and Reives, initially represented that Tri-Star would invest in bank debentures and later claimed that it might invest in other international trade opportunities.  The complaint also alleged that Lazorwitz and Reives promoted Tri-Star directly and through independent agents around the United States known as Facilitators and led investors to expect profits of 20% per month in so-called 13-month trading programs, after an initial 90-day waiting period.  The complaint also charged that relief defendant Lazor, Ltd. received ill-gotten gains from the fraud without any legitimate claim to those assets.  Tri-Star, Lazorwitz, and Reives made material misrepresentations and omissions of fact to investors concerning, among other things, the use of investor funds, the expected returns, and investment risks.  The complaint further alleged that Lazorwitz and Reives misappropriated investor funds for their personal benefit.   , Judge Wards orders permanently enjoined Lazorwitz and Tri-Star from further violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and additionally enjoined Lazorwitz from further violations of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and from further violations of the broker-dealer registration provisions of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act.    , <u>See also</u>:  <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17317.htm>L.R. 17317</a> (January 16, 2002)]"

Lamberth of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, entered a Final Judgment of Permanent Injunction and imposed a civil penalty of $100,000 against Lewis J. McConnell, Jr. for engaging in a fraudulent offering of unregistered prime bank note securities.  The Final Judgment, entered by default, enjoins McConnell from violating the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws (Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder).  Judge Lamberth also entered final judgments against Ned L. Huggins and Gregory T. Wood on February 11, 2002, enjoining Huggins and Wood from the same violations of the federal securities laws.  Huggins and Wood consented to the entry of the final judgments without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint., The Commissions complaint, filed on January 16, 2002, alleged that the defendants raised over $7 million from at least 21 investors by promoting their Secure Private Placement Program, which purportedly generated risk-free returns of 20-25% per week.  In materials distributed to investors, the Secure Private Placement Program was described as a joint venture between the investor and Gold Stream Holdings, Inc., in which the investor would participate in a program of trading certain highly rated financial instruments.  However, according to the complaint, the Secure Private Placement Program was merely a ploy by McConnell to, among other things, obtain financing for Gold Stream Holdings, which was a company through which he was conducting or trying to conduct his entertainment business.  The complaint further alleged that McConnell hired Huggins and Wood to distribute certain materials to the investors, and that these materials contained numerous material misrepresentations and omissions concerning, among other things, the existence of such highly rated financial instruments, Gold Stream Holdings ability to participate in such a trading program, and the intended use of the investors funds.  All funds obtained by the defendants as a result of their illegal scheme have been returned to investors.  , This case is part of the SECs continuing effort to combat prime bank fraud and to alert the public to the risks posed by these phony instruments.

The false statement was made to the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission in response to the staffs questions regarding Kims trading in the securities of Meridian Data, Inc. (Meridian).  Kims trading took place in the context of a March 1999 Snowmass, Colorado retreat of the Young Presidents Organization (YPO), an international organization comprised of company presidents under the age of fifty whose members meet in small groups, or forums, to discuss confidential personal and business matters with their peers.  Meridians CEO at the time and Kim were both YPO members who belonged to the 1917 Forum and were both scheduled to attend the Snowmass retreat.  YPO members are expected to be present at all forum meetings.  While on board a private plane en route to the retreat, the YPO forums moderator announced that Meridians CEO could not attend the retreat because he was in merger negotiations with Quantum Corporation (Quantum).  Immediately upon his arrival in Snowmass, Kim began a series of purchases of Meridian common stock -- ultimately purchasing 187,300 shares between March 1 and March 4.  Kim made his purchases ahead of the May 11, 1999, public announcement that Quantum would acquire Meridian, and thereby made a profit of $832,877 on his March Meridian trades. , The indictment charging Kim with making false statements to the SEC alleged that Kim falsely told the SEC that he did not know the reason why the CEO of Meridian failed to attend the 1917 Forum retreat to Snowmass, Colorado, on March 1, 1999.  The jury found Kim guilty with regard to that allegation.  The indictment also alleged that Kim falsely told the SEC that he purchased Meridian shares in March 1999 on the basis of a March 1, 1999, Wall Street Journal article regarding Quantum.

According to the complaint, from December 1999 through October 2000 Anderson personally forged contracts, e-mails, purchase orders, letters, and an audit confirmation in order to boost Quintus financial results.  Anderson created three fake transactions that ranged in value from $2 million to $7 million, for a total of $13.7 million in nonexistent sales.  In addition, Anderson caused Quintus to recognize improperly $3 million in revenue on a barter transaction, which was contingent on Quintus agreement to purchase $4 million of product from its customer.  In each case, Anderson caused Quintus to recognize revenue in violation of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)., In one instance, Anderson altered a $1.5 million purchase order to make it appear that the customer had actually ordered $6 million worth of Quintus products and services.  In another, Anderson forged a contract and a purchase letter to make it appear that the a reseller had agreed to pay Quintus $7 million up-front, rather than the truth-that the reseller would pay Quintus only if the reseller was able to sell Quintus product to end users., As a result of Andersons fraud, Quintus overstated its revenue in three fiscal quarters in amounts ranging from 37% to 60% per quarter.

The Commissions complaint alleges fraud and other violations against former Unify CEO Gholamreza (Reza) Mikailli, 49, of Saratoga, Calif., and former CFO Gary L. Pado, 38, of Sacramento, Calif.  , The complaint alleges that from May 1999 through May 2000, Mikailli and Pado caused Unify to recognize revenue fraudulently on transactions that they knew were subject to contingencies (including rights of return or cancellation), or involved barter transactions.  Under generally accepted accounting principles (known as GAAP), it was improper for Unify to recognize revenue on contingent transactions so long as the contingencies existed and, thus, could nullify or impair the sale.  Also under GAAP, it was improper for Unify to recognize revenue on barter transactions because Unifys revenue was contingent on Unifys performance of its obligation to the customer., In several instances Mikailli and Pado engaged in roundtripping, by causing Unify to provide funds its customers needed to buy Unify products, with no reasonable expectation that the customers would ever repay the funds.  In some instances, Unify made an investment in another company, which then used most or all of the invested funds to purchase Unify product.  In others, Unify contracted for services from other companies through so-called Funded Development Agreements.  However, the companies provided no such services, and simply used funds from Unify to buy Unify product., As a result of the fraud, Unify overstated its revenue over four fiscal quarters in amounts ranging from 61% to 150% per quarter.  During the course of the fraud, Mikailli sold all of his shares of Unify stock and received gross proceeds of approximately $8.2 million.  Mikailli illegally failed to file any reports with the Commission disclosing his stock sales during this period., The complaint charges Mikailli and Pado with violating the antifraud, corporate reporting and books and records provisions of the federal securities laws and with lying to Unifys outside auditors (Sections 10(b), 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-13, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder).  It also charges Mikailli with insider trading and failing to file required reports relating to sales of shares by insiders (Sections 10(b) and 16(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 16a-3 thereunder).  The complaint seeks injunctions, monetary penalties and officer and director bars against Mikailli and Pado.  In addition, the complaint seeks disgorgement from Mikailli of all amounts he received as a result of the fraud, including losses avoided by his stock sales, sales commissions he received on fraudulent transactions, and bonuses., Also named in the complaint was Unify, for violations of the corporate reporting and bookkeeping provisions of the federal securities laws (Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13-a13 thereunder).

Thorn, et al.</i>, No. C2-01-290 (Judge Sargus)(S.D. Ohio), The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that a defendant in a pending Commission enforcement action has been held in civil contempt for violating a court-ordered asset freeze.  The defendant, Steven E. Thorn of the Cleveland suburb of Brecksville, Ohio, is charged with having fraudulently raised over $60 million from hundreds of victims purportedly to finance trading in notes issued by European banks.  The Commission has alleged that the supposed European bank trading venture does not exist and that Thorn in fact conducted a ponzi scheme.  The Commission sued Thorn and others on April 2, 2001 and obtained a temporary restraining order which included a provision freezing all Thorns assets.  , On April 29, 2002, after an evidentiary hearing on a contempt motion made by the Commission, the Honorable Edmund A. Sargus, Jr., United States District Judge for the Southern District of Ohio, ruled that Thorn, aided by an associate, had deliberately and purposefully thwarted the Courts freeze order and secretly moved and concealed funds frozen by that order.  The Court found Thorns conduct to have been most egregious and held Thorn in civil contempt., The Court based its findings on the Commissions evidence that Thorn secretly transferred $200,000 to his associate on April 2, 2001-the very day the Court entered its freeze order; and that Thorn, despite knowing of the freeze order at least by the afternoon of April 2, directed his associate to disburse much of the illegally transferred money to pay various bills for Thorn over the next several months.  The Court further found that the ultimate disposition of a substantial amount of the illegally transferred money remains unknown.  The Court ordered Thorn to submit to a deposition and to provide additional discovery to the Commission.  The Court postponed imposing sanctions against Thorn until after that discovery was completed. , The Court also found that although Thorns associate is not a defendant in the Commissions action she should have made every effort to comply with the freeze order after the Commission served her with a copy of the order on September 5, 2001.  The Court ruled that the associates actions after September 5 were contrary to the freeze order.  The Court ordered Thorns associate to provide additional discovery to the Commission and reserved ruling on whether she would be found in civil contempt.  , The Court also ordered that Thorn and his associate are prohibited from transferring any of Thorns funds that are in the control of Thorn or his associate.    , At a subsequent hearing on May 6, 2002, the Court stayed a final decision on the Commissions contempt motion until conclusion of the Commissions enforcement action.  In the meantime, the Commission is to further trace the disposition of all the funds transferred in violation of the asset freeze.  , , <!--<table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5><tr><td><IMG SRC=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=9 ALT=*  BORDER=0 ALIGN=absmiddle>&nbsp;</td><td><a href=/litigation/complaints/complr17523.htm>SEC Complaint</a> in this matter.</td></tr></table> <pre></pre>--><i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr17523.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

In its Complaint, the Commission alleges fraud violations by former Legato executive vice president of worldwide sales David Malmstedt, 46, of Manhattan Beach, Calif., and former vice president of North American sales Mark Huetteman, 39, of Hinsdale, Illinois.  The complaint alleges that from May 1999 through December 2000, Malmstedt and Huetteman caused Legato fraudulently to record millions of dollars in revenue on orders that were contingent on resellers ability to sell the product to an end customer, or on customers rights of exchange, return or cancellation.  As a result of the fraud, Legato overstated its revenue over three fiscal quarters in amounts ranging from 6% to 20% per quarter., In one instance, Malmstedt and Huetteman caused Legato to recognize revenue on a $7 million purchase order that was contingent on further successful negotiations between the parties.  Pursuant to this arrangement, if the negotiations broke down, the customer had the right to cancel the purchase order.  The cancellation right was set forth in a separate side letter, drafted by Huetteman, which stated in part:  This contingency may not be expressly stated in the order letter, because of the impact on revenue recognition.  However, you have my assurance that in the event that we can not [sic] reach terms we will not hold you to the commitment to pay referenced in the order letter., The complaint charges Malmstedt and Huetteman with violating the antifraud, corporate reporting and books and records provisions of the federal securities laws, and seeks injunctions, disgorgement of losses avoided on sales of Legato stock by Malmstedt and Huetteman during the course of the fraud, and monetary penalties.  In particular, the Commission asserts claims against defendants for violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-13 and 13b2-1 thereunder.  ,  In a related matter, the Commission issued an order instituting and simultaneously settling cease-and-desist proceedings against Legato and its former CFO, Steven Wise, 47, of Mountain View, Calif.

The order found that Legato violated the corporate reporting, books and records and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws.  (Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-13 thereunder.)  In addition, the order found that Wise caused Legatos violations of these provisions, and that Wise knowingly failed to implement adequate internal accounting controls at the company.

The Court also entered orders freezing the assets of Lents, Baginski, ECC, Yonadi and Southeast Capital, requiring Lents to repatriate assets, requiring the defendants to give an accounting, prohibiting document destruction and permitting expedited discovery. , In its Complaint, the Commission alleged that the defendants, from December 2001 through the filing of the Complaint, engaged in a scheme to manipulate the price of Investcos common stock.  Investcos stock was quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board until the Commission suspended trading on April 29, 2002.  The Complaint alleged that, in November 2001, Lents e-mailed Zapetis a blueprint of a scheme to manipulate the stock of public companies by obtaining shares pursuant to S-8 registration statements, then using Lents network and news releases about asset infusions by companies controlled by Zapetis to drive up the stock price of the public company.  The Complaint further alleged that Lents, with the knowing and substantial assistance of Zapetis and FIFC, followed this blueprint with Investco.  The Commission alleged that Lents obtained 500,000 shares of Investco stock subject to a Form S-8 registration and issued numerous press releases that made false and misleading statements about Investcos assets, operations and business combinations.  According to the Complaint, Investcos press releases concerning Investcos acquisition of $15 million worth of a NASDAQ stock, its acquisition of a Costa Rican insurance company with purportedly $100 million worth of assets and FIFCs $10 million cash tender offer for Investco stock, were all false.  The Complaint also alleged that Lents knew Investcos press releases were false and misleading, and yet actively sold into the demand for Investco stock created by the press releases.  Further, the Complaint alleged that Lents distributed Investco stock through others, including Baginski and ECC. The Commission alleged also that Baginski arranged with Yonadi to simulate demand for Investco stock by placing buy orders, through Southeast Capital, at prices above the quoted bid.  According to the Complaint, Lents, Baginski, ECC, Yonadi and Southeast Capital obtained ill-gotten gains from the manipulative scheme.  , The complaint alleged that, by the above conduct, Investco, Lents, Baginski, ECC, Yonadi, and Southeast Capital violated and are violating Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Investco and Lents, the Complaint alleged, have also violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act.  The complaint alleged FIFC and Zapetis aided and abetted the violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. ,  In its Complaint, apart from emergency relief, the Commission seeks preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement, civil penalties, and an order barring Lents from serving as officer or director of a public company.    , ]"

(May 16, 2002)  , SEC OBTAINS EMERGENCY ORDERS SHUTTING DOWN STARCASH AND AMERICASH, TWO FRAUDULENT PAYDAY ADVANCE SCHEMES   , The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC or Commission) announced that on May 16, 2002, it filed two separate emergency federal civil actions seeking to halt two fraudulent securities offerings.  The first action was filed against defendants Starcash, Inc., Infinity Consulting Services, Inc., Jean B. Leclercq, Kip Marsique and Frederick J. Shapiro (The Starcash defendants) and relief defendants Starcash Consulting, Inc., Starcash Industries, Inc. and Starcash Media, Inc.  The Starcash defendants are headquartered in Boca Raton and Ft. Lauderdale.  The second action was filed against defendants Americash-Inc.com, Inc., National Business Concepts, Inc. d/b/a Americash and Norman Benjamin (the Americash defendants) and relief defendant World Business Systems LLC, d/b/a  World Business Systems, Inc.  The Americash defendants are headquartered in Boca Raton.  The SEC alleged that the defendants in both schemes were conducting a fraudulent unregistered offering to raise investor funds for the purported purpose of funding payday advances in the form of short term loans.  , On May 16, 2002, the Honorable Daniel Hurley, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Florida, entered, among other things, a temporary restraining order, a freeze of the defendants assets and an appointment of a receiver in the Americash offering. <i>(SEC v. Americash-Inc.com, Inc., et al., Case No. 02-80457-CIV-HURLEY)</i>.  On May 17, 2002, the Honorable Donald Middlebrooks, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Florida entered identical relief against the defendants in Starcash. <i>(SEC v. Starcash, Inc., et al., Case No. 02-80456-CIV-MIDDLEBROOKS).</i>, The Commission alleged that the Americash defendants, through a boiler room, raised approximately $1.2 million from more than 45 investors to fund a purported business providing an instant short term cash advance (of up to $500) available up to two weeks before a persons payday.  In raising money for this enterprise from investors, the Americash defendants falsely represented that the investment was low risk, that a 36% return was guaranteed and that all monies were lent out to Americash customers.  According to the SEC complaint, Americash in fact operated as a Ponzi scheme, paying interest to existing investors with new investor monies, and spending investor funds on salaries, commissions, and expenses to operate its boiler room.  , With regard to Starcash, the Commission alleged that the Starcash defendants raised at least $6 million from investors through a network of boiler rooms to allegedly fund short-term payday loans.  According to the SECs complaint, the Starcash defendants falsely represented that investor funds would be used to fund advance payday loans, and that the investments were virtually risk free and were secured by the purported loans.  In fact, Starcash paid exorbitant commissions to the boiler rooms from investor monies, and the loans were unsafe and grossly undersecured.  In addition, Starcash has made baseless predictions to investors that its payday advance business could generate up to $80 million in revenue a year.  , The Commissions complaint charges both the Starcash and Americash defendants with violating the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws.  Specifically, the Commission alleges that the defendants in both Starcash and Americash violated Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.  The complaint against the Starcash defendants also alleges that they violated Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  In addition to the emergency relief described above, the complaint seeks permanent injunctions prohibiting future violations of the securities laws, disgorgement, and civil penalties.  , The SEC would like to extend its thanks to the FBI and the United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of Florida as well as the Broward County Sheriffs office for their assistance in this matter., ]"

According to the complaint, between November 1999 and May 2001, the defendants raised over $5 million by fraudulently offering and selling unregistered investment contracts in Phoenix Telecom, L.L.C. and Alpha Telcom, Inc., entities previously sued by the Commission for fraud.  The defendants targeted their sales efforts at their elderly insurance clients and from the sales of these investment contracts, the defendants received over $750,000 in undisclosed commissions., In its complaint, the Commission charged the following defendants:, , , The SECs complaint alleges that the defendants represented, among other things, that they offered safe, secure and risk free investments in pay telephone lease programs, that they had thoroughly investigated the companies offering the lease programs and that the companies were in good financial condition.  These representations were made even though defendants knew that there were no audited financials and that the unaudited financials for the companies demonstrated that the companies were in poor financial condition.  Additionally, while defendants were aware that several states had issued cease and desist orders against the issurers, they failed to disclose this information to their investors.  And, remarkably, defendants continued to offer and sell investment contracts in Alpha Telcom that were virtually identical to those offered by Phoenix Telecom, even though Phoenix Telecom had failed.  Despite the defendants assurances that the investments were safe and risk free, in reality, both Phoenix Telecom and Alpha Telcom were operating huge nationwide ponzi schemes.  The Commission previously filed suit against Phoenix Telecom and Alpha Telcom, obtaining emergency injunctive relief against each issuer to halt their fraudulent securities offerings., The Commissions complaint charged Watts and Grimes directly or indirectly sold unregistered securities, in violation of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 and committed securities fraud in violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In addition, the Commissions complaint charged each defendant with acting as an unregistered broker or dealer in violation of Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act. In its Complaint, the Commission requested that the defendants be enjoined from future securities violations and be ordered to disgorge their illegal profits and pay civil money penalties., The Commission would like to acknowledge the assistance of the Lubbock office of the Texas State Securities Board. , , , , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr17527.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The Commission alleges that Millennium has been running an ongoing international boiler room operation that has defrauded at least 150 investors from over 20 countries out of more than $2 million.  The Commission also sued Newpont Fiduciaries &amp; Nominees, S.A. as a relief defendant, because Newpont received investor funds at the direction of Millennium.  , The Commissions Complaint alleges that Millennium made a number of fraudulent statements to investors in connection with the offer and sale of the so-called pre-initial public offering (or pre-IPO) stocks of at least three U.S. companies  Key Card Communications, Inc., kNutek Holdings, Inc. and Sonic Garden, Inc.  The Complaint alleges that, through unsolicited telephone calls and mass mailings, Millennium made fraudulent statements concerning (i) whether and when a U.S. company was going to have an IPO; (ii) whether investors could profitably resell their pre-IPO shares before the IPO; (iii) the price at which the stock would be offered in the IPO itself; and (iv) the price at which the stock would trade shortly after the IPO.  , The Commissions Complaint specifically alleges, among other things, that: , Documents filed in support of the Commissions Complaint further allege that Millennium has solicited investors on a worldwide basis.  Investor funds have come from Australia, Belgium, Denmark, England, France, Germany, Greece, Guernsey, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malaysia, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, Saudi Arabia, Scotland, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Switzerland, the United States, and the United Arab Emirates.  The majority of the known investors are from the United Kingdom and Ireland., The Courts Order temporarily restrains Millennium from violating the antifraud provisions contained within Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Steven Hevell, 38, pleaded guilty to three counts of mail fraud derived from a Ponzi scheme that defrauded 350 victims out of nearly $8.7 million.  The Honorable Alicemarie H. Stotler of the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California imposed the sentence on Hevell, commenting that his companies were a fairly straightforward Ponzi scheme., Hevell defrauded his victims using three companies-MicroWest Industries, Inc., Advanced I.D. Technology and Consolidated Imaging Centers Radiology Network. During the period from 1994 to 1997, Hevell sold investments in these high-technology companies by falsely promising that the companies would have substantial revenues from selling software that electronically transmitted radiological images over telephone lines. Hevell promised his investors an annual interest return of 14 to 17.5 percent.  The companies actually had no revenues and Hevell used new investor dollars to pay interest owed to previous investors, a classic Ponzi scheme.  The interest payments led investors to believe that the companies were profitable and caused investors to make additional investments.  Eventually, Hevell stopped making the interest payments and converted the investors interests into worthless company stock., Hevell had earlier settled a civil action brought by the Commission by consenting to the entry of a permanent injunction and specified disgorgement.  In the Commissions case, the District Court enjoined Hevell from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The Court granted summary judgments against two individual defendants, Raphael Ray Levy of Lake Worth, Florida and Larry Schwartz of Boca Raton, Florida, for their involvement in a scheme that fraudulently induced more than 600 investors in 27 states to purchase at least $55 million in unregistered promissory notes.  The remaining two defendants, U.S. Capital Funding, Inc. and First Capital Services, Inc., consented to the entry of final judgments against them., The Court permanently enjoined all four defendants from future violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and from offering or selling unregistered securities.  In addition, the court permanently enjoined Levy and U.S. Capital from selling securities without registering with the Commission as broker-dealers or associating with registered broker-dealers., The judgments against Levy and Schwartz require that they disgorge their ill-gotten gains plus interest and pay civil penalties.

Martino, et al., 98 Civ. 3446 (S.D.N.Y.)</h2>]","[On May 21, 2002, U.S. District Judge Milton Pollack issued an order against defendant Carol C. Martino and her husband, relief defendant Gerard Haryman, freezing Martinos $2 million yacht, pending the outcome of the Commissions civil enforcement action against Martino.  The Court entered the order following a hearing on the matter held earlier that day., The Commission sued Martino and her stock brokerage firm in May 1998 for repeated violations of a 1992 Commission order that barred Martino from acting as a stock broker.  The Commission alleges that, from 1992 through 1995, Martino brokered millions of dollars in sales of stock by U.S. companies to foreign purchasers and, thus, accumulated millions of dollars in illegal brokerage commissions and fees.  The Commission seeks disgorgement of Martinos ill-gotten gains, as well as monetary penalties and other relief.  , The Commission recently learned that Martino used some of her illegal brokerage revenues to purchase a $2 million yacht, and that she and her husband have been attempting to sell the yacht to pay personal expenses (including a mortgage on their Palm Beach, Florida home).  Consequently, the Commission requested an emergency freeze from the Court.     , In the freeze order, Judge Pollack determined that (1) the Commission presented sufficient evidence for the Court to infer for present purposes that Martino and her brokerage company illegally brokered millions of dollars of stock sales, and that Martino thus accumulated millions of dollars in illegal brokerage fees and commissions; (2) in November 1997, Martino used at least $1.28 million of her illegal brokerage revenues to purchase a $2 million seventy-five foot motor yacht called Je Taime; (3) in December 1997, Martino and Haryman registered the yacht in the British Virgin Islands in the name of JTM Limited  an offshore corporation wholly owned and controlled by Haryman  to hide Martinos assets from her creditors and potential creditors, including the Commission; and (4) the Commission made an adequate showing that Martino owns the Yacht, seeks to maintain it beyond the courts jurisdiction, and seeks to sell the Yacht and dissipate the sale proceeds for her and Harymans personal benefit.  , The freeze order requires Martino and Haryman, pending final judgment in the case, to hold and retain the Yacht within their control and within the territorial waters of the United States and otherwise to maintain the present value of the yacht for the purpose of paying any judgment the Commission obtains against Martino and/or her brokerage firm., On January 7, 2002, in a separate criminal proceeding brought by the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Martino pled guilty to three counts of personal income tax evasion and three counts of falsely subscribing to corporate returns.  The indictment in the criminal action includes charges that Martino failed to disclose certain income, including brokerage revenue that is at issue in the Commissions civil enforcement action against her.  In April 2002, Martino received a twenty-eight month sentence, which she is currently serving in federal prison in Florida.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr17532.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Zollino, the former chairman of the board of InverWorld Securities, Inc., a broker-dealer registered with the Commission, and InverWorld, Inc., an investment adviser registered with the Commission, entered formal pleas to conspiring to commit fraud and conspiring to launder money., On August 4, 1999, the SEC charged Zollino and others with losing as much as $475 million of client funds in unauthorized, highly leveraged securities investments and practically worthless securities issued by foreign shell companies.  The companies used by Zollino and others to move client money offshore are in bankruptcy., On March 22, 2001, Zollino was indicted by a San Antonio grand jury on 13 counts of conspiracy, fraud, and money laundering.

Bentz (Bentz) in civil contempt and ordered him imprisoned for violating an asset freeze order.  Bentz, a resident of the Cincinnati area, violated the order by secretly spending up to $142,000 in funds frozen by the court., In February 2001, the Commission sued Bentz and others for operating a fraudulent Ponzi scheme that raised millions of dollars from investors in a prime bank trading program.  At the same time, Hon. David F. Hamilton of the U.S. District Court in Indianapolis issued a permanent injunction that prohibits Bentz and other defendants from engaging in fraud and other misconduct in violation of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b), 15(a), and 15(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rules 10b-5 and 15c1-2 thereunder.  The defendants consented to the injunction order without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint.  A court-appointed examiner later reported that Bentz and his co-defendants raised a total of $20.3 million from over 600 investors., The injunction order also froze the assets of Bentz and the other defendants.  In the contempt proceedings, the Commission alleged that shortly before the asset freeze, Bentz obtained approximately $142,000 by borrowing against his assets, and that after the freeze, he spent all or part of the borrowed funds in violation of the freeze.  The court ruled that Bentz violated the freeze and is in civil contempt, and ordered him imprisoned until he pays $142,000 into the courts custody or makes a credible showing that he is unable to do so.

The Court also ordered a freeze of up to $750,000 of Showalters assets including assets of a company under his control, International Financial Group dba IFG Goldstar Cement Company.  In addition, the Court restricted Showalters travel outside the U.S., and ordered him to surrender his passport to the Court immediately.  , Previously, in entering a default judgment, the Court ordered Showalter to pay $900,000 (including a $150,000 penalty) after the Court found that Showalter had orchestrated two fraudulent schemes to raise capital illegally.  In the first scheme, Showalters company materially overstated the value of the primary asset of a wholly-owned subsidiary, a portfolio of defaulted bank loans, in reports filed with the Commission and disseminated to the public. In the second scheme, Showalters company fraudulently raised millions of dollars by issuing stock to nominee consultants pursuant to Form S-8 registration statements.  Consequently, the Courts judgment also permanently enjoined Showalter from violating, among other things, the antifraud, registration, reporting, and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws, and barred him from serving as an officer or director of a public company.

Bartiromo previously disgorged to the Courts account more than $1,000,000 that he and Invest Better 2001 (IB2001) obtained from investors in connection with fraudulent unregistered offerings of securities which defrauded more than 1,000 investors.  , In its first amended complaint, filed January 7, 2002, the Commission alleged that Bartiromo raised more than $1 million from more than 1,000 investors through a scheme known as Invest Better 2001, which, from at least November 1, 2001, purportedly offered guaranteed and risk-free investment programs in which IB2001 pooled investors funds to bet on sporting events, and promised to repay investors between 125% and 2500% of their principal within specified periods ranging from three days to several weeks., In its second amended complaint, filed April 29, 2002, the Commission alleged that Bartiromo conducted an Internet pump-and-dump scheme in which he manipulated the stock price of fifteen publicly traded companies from approximately May 14, 2001 to July 5, 2001.  More specifically, Bartiromo disseminated numerous false and misleading messages concerning publicly traded companies on the Internet.

(PCN) and one former PCN customer with engaging in a broad-ranging accounting fraud.  The Commissions complaint alleges that the defendants violated or aided and abetted violations of the antifraud, periodic reporting, record-keeping, internal controls and lying to the auditors provisions of the federal securities laws.  In a related action today, the Commission instituted and simultaneously settled cease-and-desist proceedings against a former manager for his role in falsifying certain PCN accounting records.    , In its civil action, the Commission alleges that the defendants engaged in a scheme to manipulate PCNs reported financial results by materially understating its operating expenses and inflating its revenues and net income in fiscal year 1996 and the first three quarters of fiscal year 1997.  According to the Commissions complaint, the defendants carried out the scheme by, among other things, recognizing revenue from fictitious sales to the companys resellers, improperly capitalizing software development costs and operating expenses, manipulating depreciation expense, prematurely recognizing revenue for customer support and maintenance contracts, and recognizing revenue for out-of-period sales.  To avoid detection of their scheme, the defendants provided false documents and information to PCNs independent auditors.    , Prior to its assets being acquired by another company in March 2000, PCN was headquartered in Morris Plains, New Jersey and was a leading provider of practice management software for physicians.  The complaint alleges that the defendants engaged in the following conduct:  John F. Mortell, of Pleasantville, New York, PCNs former President and Chief Operating Officer, devised and orchestrated the fraudulent scheme.  Thomas F. Wraback, of Manalapan, New Jersey, PCNs former Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Gregory D. Norton, of New Providence, New Jersey, PCNs former Manager of Accounting and Reporting, assisted Mortell or acted at his direction.  To achieve the companys internal financial projections, each of these individuals either made, or directed others to make, improper accounting adjustments or false accounting entries that were not in conformity with generally accepted accounting principals.  Glenn P. Duffy, of Needham, Massachusetts, PCNs former Director of Accounting, knew of the fraudulent scheme, falsified certain accounting documents, and made false and misleading statements to PCNs auditors.  William S. Edwards, of Wrentham, Massachusetts, PCNs former Vice President of Operations, and Jerry W. Ross, of Huntington Beach, California, PCNs former Vice President for Systems Integration, directed improper shipping activities that resulted in PCN recognizing revenue from out-of-period shipments.  Gerald T. Barry, of Jamestown, Rhode Island, President of G. Barry &amp; Associates, Inc., a privately-held Rhode Island corporation that was a PCN customer, provided a false audit confirmation letter to PCNs auditors.  In the related administrative proceeding, the Commission found that John K. Bradley, of Shrewsbury, Massachusetts, PCNs former Manager of Credit and Collections, falsified two year-end deferred revenue reports that were provided by Wraback to PCNs auditors.  , As a result of the fraudulent accounting scheme, PCN overstated its 1996 net income by $31.2 million (205%), and overstated its quarterly 1997 net income by an estimated $7.8 million (173%) in the first quarter, $8.6 million (195%) in the second quarter, and $9.7 million (150%) in the third quarter.  According to the complaint, PCN included these materially false financial results in its 1996 annual report on Form 10-K and its 1997 quarterly reports on Form 10-Q that it filed with the Commission., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, the defendants consented to the following sanctions:  , <b><u>John F.

The Court also ordered Johnson and Dickman to pay jointly and severally disgorgement in the amount of their ill-gotten gains, which totaled $105,693.44, plus prejudgment interest.  The Court, however, waived the payment of disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and did not impose a civil penalty, based upon defendants representations in their respective Sworn Financial Statement and other documents submitted to the Commission., The Commissions complaint, filed on January 30, 2002, alleges that, as a sales manager for Tech Data, Johnson learned material, non-public information regarding a $6 billion contract that Tech Data entered into with GE Capital.  Tech Data and GE Capital publicly announced their contract prior to the opening of trading on May 20, 1999.  The complaint alleges that before the public announcement of this contract, Johnson tipped Dickman, his then housemate, with this information.  The complaint also alleges that Dickman and Johnson entered into a profit sharing agreement which resulted in Dickman purchasing 20,000 shares of Tech Data common stock one day before the public announcement of the Tech Data - GE Capital contract.  The complaint further alleges that a day after the announcement of the Tech Data - GE Capital contract, Dickman sold all 20,000 shares of Tech Data stock and realized an illegal profit of $105,693.44.  According to the complaint, Dickman shared the profits from his illegal trades with Johnson.  , For additional information, see <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17347.htm>Litigation Release No. 17347</a> (January 30, 2002).]"

The Commission decided not to seek a civil penalty against Cox, Sparkman, Covington, Hoyl, Post and Sides based upon their sworn representations regarding financial status in documents submitted to the Commission.  Johnson consented to pay a penalty of $10,000.  The Commission decided not to seek the imposition of a civil monetary penalty against Mayfield because of his significant cooperation with the Commission and his efforts to help his clients who were victimized by the ponzi scheme.  , In its civil action, the Commission alleged that defendants sold promissory notes issued by Chemical Trust, a purported business trust, as part of a nationwide ponzi scheme.  The promissory notes were claimed to be secured by surety bonds issued by United States Guarantee Corporation, an Arizona based surety company.  In reality, the control persons behind Chemical Trust were diverting investor funds to their own use and the surety company was being run by a convicted felon and held no assets with which to secure the promissory notes.  The Commission alleged that the defendants were in a position to learn of the issuers fraudulent scheme, but failed to conduct any meaningful due diligence before selling the securities to their insurance clients.

(June 10, 2002), <p align=CENTER><b>SEC CHARGES THREE WITH INSIDER TRADING </b>, The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed an injunctive action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, alleging that Jane M. Straub, a former employee of BetzDearborn Inc., John Wesley (Wes) Straub, her husband, and Anthony J. Campisi, engaged in illegal insider trading in advance of the July 30, 1998, public announcement that BetzDearborn Inc. and Hercules Inc. had agreed to merge. , The complaint alleges that Jane Straub, an executive assistant at BetzDearborn, learned of the impending merger around July 27, 1998, at which time she tipped her husband, Wes Straub.  On July 28, Wes Straub purchased 500 shares of BetzDearborn for a total cost of $17,163.  On July 30, 1998, BetzDearborn and Hercules announced that they agreed to merge and that Hercules would pay $72 per share for all outstanding BetzDearborn shares.  After the announcement, BetzDearborn common stock increased from the prior days closing stock price of $35.88 to $69.25 per share, and closed for the day at $67.69.  On October 15, 1998, the date the merger closed, Wes Straub exchanged his 500 shares for $72 per share and received an unlawful profit of $18,838., The complaint further alleges that Wes Straub tipped his long-time accountant, Anthony Campisi, concerning the merger.  Campisi purchased 500 BetzDearborn shares at a total cost of $17,875 on July 29, 1998 -- the day before the merger announcement.

In its action, the Commission is seeking permanent injunctions, disgorgement of the illegal trading profits, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  , Jane Straub, age 57, and Wes Straub, age 59, reside in Churchville, Pennsylvania.

Kurtzman and Bergeron consented, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, to pay civil penalties of $60,000 and $25,000, respectively.  , The Commission also announced the filing of a settled cease-and-desist order against Ashford.com, Inc., Kurtzman, Bergeron and Amazon.com, Inc.  The Commissions Order finds that, in March 2000, Kurtzman and Bergeron, on behalf of Ashford.com, improperly deferred $1.5 million in expenses under a contract with Amazon.com, causing Ashford.com to materially understate its marketing expenses and allowing the company to report a pro forma net loss of $0.30 per share, just beating analysts pro forma earnings estimates of a net loss of $0.31 per share for the quarter ended March 31, 2000.  Without the understatement, Ashford.com would have reported a pro forma loss of $0.32 per share.  The improper deferral resulted from the settlement of a dispute with Amazon.com using two separate documents which were prepared by Amazon.com at Ashford.coms request.  Ashford.com subsequently failed to disclose one of the two documents to its auditors.  , The Order also finds that in September 2000, Ashford.com misstated its pro forma results by changing the classification of expenses on its income statement.  In two previous quarters, Ashford.com had properly classified these expenses as marketing expenses.  But in September 2000, without disclosing that it had made a change, Ashford.com classified the expenses as depreciation and amortization, which improved the companys pro forma results (which did not take depreciation and amortization into account)., Additionally, during 2000, Ashford.com misclassified a portion of the expenses arising under its contracts with Amazon.com, causing Ashford.com to materially understate its reported marketing expenses and improve its pro forma results.  Under these agreements, Ashford.com issued common stock in exchange for advertising placements and an agreement not to compete.  Ashford.com, however, classified all of the expenses under this contract as depreciation and amortization.  This classification was not in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, because Ashford.com should have classified the portion attributable to advertising placements as marketing expenses. , The Commissions Order further finds that:, , , , , Ashford.com, Kurtzman, Bergeron and Amazon.com consented, without admitting or denying the findings in the Commissions Order, to cease-and-desist from committing or causing violations of the provisions of the federal securities laws cited above.

District Judge for the Western District of Virginia, entered a permanent injunction order against Terry L. Dowdell and two entities that he controls in connection with a massive international Ponzi scheme Dowdell orchestrated.  The scheme raised more than $70 million from investors in the U.S. and abroad through the sale of securities in a trading program purportedly being operated by Vavasseur Corp., a Bahamian company which is also a Defendant in the lawsuit.  In a Consent and Stipulation filed in conjunction with the entry of the permanent injunction order, Dowdell has now admitted to the fraud.  , As is alleged in the SECs Complaint, Dowdell offered and sold, through various promoters and marketers in the U.S. and abroad, fictitious prime bank securities purportedly involving the purchase and sale of foreign bank trading instruments such as medium term debentures.  Dowdell and his promoters represented that his trading program would provide virtually risk-free returns of 4 percent per week for 40 weeks per year - up to 160% per year.  As Dowdell admitted in his Consent and Stipulation, there was in fact no actual trading program.  Instead, Dowdell was operating a classic Ponzi scheme in which old investors were being paid with new investor money. , In its permanent injunction order, the Court entered findings in favor of the SEC with respect to its allegations against Dowdell and two of the entities that he controls, Dowdell Dutcher &amp; Associates, Inc. (DDA) and Emerged Market Securities, DE-LLC (EMS).  The Court incorporated into its order as additional findings of fact the representations contained in Dowdells Consent and Stipulation.  The Court further found that Dowdell, DDA and EMS have engaged in and are likely to continue to engage in violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Court permanently enjoined Dowdell, DDA and EMS from further violations of these provisions and ordered Dowdell, DDA and EMS to disgorge all investor funds and ill-gotten gains received by them through the Ponzi scheme., Prior to the entry of the permanent injunction order, the Court had entered orders freezing more than $21 million of investor funds diverted by Dowdell into various domestic accounts under his control.  Dowdell admitted in his Consent and Stipulation that even after these freeze orders, Dowdell continued his scheme by using various foreign bank accounts controlled directly or indirectly by U.K. nationals. These foreign accounts include accounts at the Bank of Butterfield in Guernsey, the Bank of Ireland in Ireland, Fortis Bank in Belgium and Banamex in Mexico.

The first scheme involved cherry picking short term foreign exchange trades, with profitable trades allocated by Gobora to favored clients, and losing trades given to unfavored clients.  The second scheme involved delaying the execution and allocation of foreign exchange trades that were prompted by client trades of foreign securities; if the market moved positively after a position was opened, Gobora allocated the trade to favored clients, with the original client trading the foreign exchange at the later, less favorable price.  The Merrill Lynch clients that were hurt by these schemes included several U.S. registered investment companies.  , Gobora will be permanently enjoined from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 204, 206(1), 206(2) and 207 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 204-2 thereunder, and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 31(a) and 34(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and Rule 31a-1 thereunder.

Daws, the former Chief Financial Officer of Cylink Corporation. , Without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, Daws consented to the entry of a final judgment that: permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions (Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder); from circumvention of Cylinks internal controls and falsification of records (Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder); from making misrepresentations or material omissions to accountants (Rule 13b2-2); and from aiding and abetting Cylinks violations of the periodic reporting and books and records provisions (Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder).  , In addition, the final judgment orders him to disgorge ill-gotten gains which he had received in the form of a performance bonus of $30,000, to pay prejudgment interest and to pay a civil penalty of $100,000., The Commissions complaint, filed on September 27, 2000, alleged that in order to meet Cylinks ambitious revenue goals, Daws, in conjunction with other former Cylink officers, led the Company to recognize revenue on numerous transactions that violated Cylinks own revenue recognition policy, generally accepted accounting principles, or both, for the fourth quarter of 1997 and the first two quarters of fiscal 1998., The complaint alleges that in the fourth quarter, Daws directed that Cylink improperly recognized revenue for Cylinks wireless division on a $3.7 million shipment to a warehouse in which the transaction was not final because Cylinks customer had failed to provide a letter of credit to support its order.  The complaint further alleges that Daws failed to disclose this material information about the transaction to the firms outside auditors, PriceWaterhouseCoopers, in connection with the 1997 audit.  Because Cylink sold its wireless division to another company in early 1998, the effect of this transaction appears in Cylinks restated financial statements in the line item for income from discontinued operations., In addition, the complaint alleges that, in the second quarter of fiscal 1998, Cylink recognized over $900,000 in revenue on a transaction that was not final because the customer still had up to 90 days to cancel the order.  In another instance alleged in the complaint, Cylink recognized revenue on orders from a distributor even though the defendants had reason to believe the distributor could not pay for the product.  The complaint also alleges that Cylink recognized revenue on software product orders that were contingent on the customers rights to exchange the software for Cylink hardware products.  Cylink overstated its quarterly revenue by as much as 97.5% during the period of the fraud, according to the Complaint., After the fraud was uncovered, Cylink issued restated financials that sharply reduced its results for the periods in question.  For the year-ended 1997, Cylink reported revenue of $49.3 million, income from discontinued operations of $4.5 million and a net loss of $58.8 million.  Cylinks restatement reduced revenue to $47.7 million, reduced income from discontinued operations to $3.2 million and widened the net loss to $61.7 million.  Originally reported revenue and earnings from discontinued operations were overstated 3.4% and 41.7%, respectively.  The originally reported net loss was understated by 4.8%., For the first quarter of fiscal 1998, the Company restated revenue from $15.8 million to $8 million (a 97.5% overstatement) and net income from continuing operations of $1.1 million to a net loss from continuing operations of $3.4 million.  For the second quarter of fiscal 1998, the Company restated revenue from $18 million to $12.4 million (a 45% overstatement) and net income of $1.7 million to a net loss of $1.7 million. , The other two defendants, Thomas Butler and Mark Folit, had previously settled with the Commission.]"

After the discovery of improper and unsubstantiated accounting transactions, in July and October 2000 Rite Aid restated cumulative pretax income by a massive $2.3 billion dollars and cumulative net income by $1.6 billion dollars.  Rite Aids restatement was, and to this day is, by far the largest financial restatement ever by a public company.  The Commissions subsequent investigation of the reasons for this massive restatement resulted in the current charges against the company and its former top managers.         , The Commission is seeking permanent injunctions prohibiting violations of the antifraud, reporting, books and records, internal controls, and other provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; civil money penalties; bars against acting as officers and directors of public companies; and disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, including performance-based bonuses.    , The Commissions Complaint alleges as follows:  , <i><u>Summary</u></i>, , , , , , , , <i><u>The Accounting Fraud</u></i>, , <i><u>Vendor-Related Accounting Irregularities</u></i>, , , , , <i><u>Other Major Areas of Accounting Irregularities</u></i>, , , , , , , , <i><u>Fraud Relating to Concealed Related Party Transactions Benefiting Grass</u></i>, , , <i><u>Fraud Relating to Stock Pledge and Grasss Fabrication of Minutes</u></i>, , Specifically, the Commission has charged all Defendants with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b) and<b> </b>13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 10b-5<b>, </b>13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder, and as controlling persons of Rite Aid pursuant to Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 thereunder; Bergonzi, as a controlling person, with violations of Rule 13a-13 under the Exchange Act; and Grass and Brown, as controlling persons, with violations of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 14a-9(a) and Rule 13a-11 thereunder.       , The Commission also instituted separate settled cease-and-desist proceedings against Rite Aid and its former president and COO Timothy J.

Bruce Hill, et al., (United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, Civil Action No. 02-CV-11244 (EFH), Filed June 21, 2002)</i>, <i>SEC v. Richard P. Vatcher,(United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, Civil Action No. 02-CV-11245 (REK), Filed June 21, 2002)</i>, The Commission today filed two civil injunctive actions in federal district court in Massachusetts alleging separate revenue recognition schemes perpetrated during 1998 by former officers and employees of Inso Corp., now known as eBT International, Inc., a software company formerly located in Boston, Massachusetts and now headquartered in Providence, Rhode Island. The Commissions first complaint alleges that Insos former general counsel, Bruce Hill of Belmont, Massachusetts, and a former vice president, Graham Marshall of Lexington, Massachusetts, engaged in fraud related to a phony $3 million sales transaction.  This complaint also charges Insos former chief executive officer, Steven Paxhia of Boston, Massachusetts, with being liable for certain violations as a controlling person of Inso.  The Commissions second complaint alleges that another former Inso vice president, Richard Vatcher of Framingham, Massachusetts, engaged in fraud related to several false sales totaling approximately $3.6 million. Paxhia and Vatcher have offered to settle with the Commission., <i><u>The Charges Against Hill and Marshall</u></i>, The Commissions first complaint alleges that, when an anticipated sales transaction with a major customer failed to close prior to the end of Insos third quarter on September 30, 1998, Bruce Hill and Graham Marshall arranged for a Malaysian distributor, who had no prior involvement in the transaction, to place a $3 million purchase order for the transaction that evening.  Because they promised the distributor that he would not have to pay Inso for the transaction, and that Inso, rather than the distributor, would resell the software to the intended end user, this transaction was a sham and should not have been included in Insos reported financial results.  However, Hill and Marshall concealed the oral terms of the sale from Insos finance department and, as a result, Inso improperly included the $3 million as revenue in its third quarter 1998 financial statements.  Thereafter, the sale of the software to the intended end user was never consummated, and Hill and Marshall took steps to cover up the fraudulent nature of the third quarter transaction.  Among other things, Hill orchestrated the providing of $4 million in letters of credit to the Malaysian distributor to finance his payment of the $3 million third quarter receivable and caused a false board resolution to be provided to Insos bank purporting to authorize the letters of credit.  , The complaint charges Hill and Marshall with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws [Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder]; circumvention of Insos internal accounting controls and falsification of records [Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1]; lying to accountants [Exchange Act Rule 13b2-2]; and aiding and abetting Insos uncharged violations of the periodic reporting and books and records provisions [Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-13 thereunder].  The complaint seeks permanent injunctions against Hill and Marshall, monetary penalties, disgorgement of losses avoided  from their sales of Inso stock during the period of the fraud, and an order barring them from serving as officers or directors of any public company.  , <i><u>The Charges Against Paxhia</u></i>, The Commissions first complaint also charges Insos former chief executive officer, Steven Paxhia, with liability, as a controlling person of Inso, for the companys uncharged violations of various provisions of the Exchange Act.  The complaint alleges that, after learning in the evening of the last day of the third quarter of 1998 that Inso had failed to conclude the $3 million transaction with a major customer, Paxhia authorized others at Inso to find a distributor for the deal before the end of the quarter.  Because of his position as CEO of Inso, Paxhia should have known that finding a distributor in so short a period risked having Inso enter a transaction that was not consistent with generally accepted accounting principles.  However, Paxhia did not take steps to learn about or prevent the side agreement with the Malaysian distributor and the fraudulent revenue recognition scheme carried out by Hill and Marshall.  He further did not inquire into certain factors concerning the transaction, such as that the Malaysian distributor engaged by Hill and Marshall had not previously been involved in the transaction and that, with little notice, the distributor purportedly accepted responsibility for a $3 million transaction on the last night of the quarter.   , The complaint charges Paxhia with being liable for certain of Insos uncharged violations of the Exchange Act as a controlling person of Inso under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Paxhia has consented to entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, and 13a-13 thereunder.  He has also agreed to pay disgorgement of his losses avoided from the sale of Inso stock during the relevant time period of $101,000, including pre-judgment interest., <i><u>The Charges Against Vatcher</u></i>, The Commissions second complaint charges Richard Vatcher, Insos former vice president of international sales, with a separate revenue recognition scheme that falsely boosted Insos revenue by approximately $3.6 million during the first three quarters of 1998.  According to the Commissions complaint, in at least six transactions, Vatcher obtained sales orders from foreign customers by grantingside agreements allowing the customers to cancel the sales.  Because the customers had the right to cancel the sales, the transactions should not have been included in Insos reported financial results. However, Vatcher failed to report the side agreements to Insos finance department.  In at least one of the transactions, Vatcher falsified documents provided to Insos finance department to conceal a side agreement that would have negated the recognition of revenue from the sale.  As a result of Vatchers fraud, Inso improperly included approximately $3.6 million of revenue in its financial statements for the first three quarters of 1998.  , Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Vatcher has consented to entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-13, and 13b2-1 thereunder.

Cummings and others of defrauding dozens of investors by conducting a Ponzi scheme through a purported Ohio-based hedge fund, Paramount Financial Partners, L.P.  The Commissions complaint alleges that Cummings and various marketers induced investors to pay at least $15 million into the hedge fund from at least May 2000 through March 2001, but that Cummings and others misappropriated or diverted those funds to pay earlier investors and pay personal and business expenses.  , The Commissions complaint names the following primary defendants: , , , , , , , The Commissions complaint alleges that Paramount, through Cummings, Ryan, Grandy and other marketers, falsely portrayed Paramount as a registered hedge fund that generated supposed investment returns of as much as 99 percent.  Victims were told that Paramount had access to certain discounted securities that they could purchase through Paramount and sell for large profits.  Victims were also told that they were required to maintain their principal and supposed profits with Paramount for a set period of time.  The complaint alleges that Paramount issued false trade confirmations and account statements to trick investors into believing that Paramount had purchased and sold certain securities for their accounts and generated large profits.  Paramount then raised new investor funds that it used to pay earlier investors and to pay personal and business expenses.  , The Commissions complaint charges that Cummings, Paramount Financial, Paramount Capital, Ryan, Grandy and Conley violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The Order found that the Commission was reasonably likely to prevail on the merits of the allegations in its complaint that Corriere had engaged in fraud and registration violations of the securities laws.  The Order also froze Corrieres assets, as well as those of two relief defendants, Quantum Equities, Inc. and The Kings Fellowship, Inc., which the Commission alleged are controlled by Corriere and received proceeds from the fraud., The Court had previously issued a temporary restraining order (TRO) on April 18, 2002, based on a complaint filed by the Commission.  The Commission has alleged that Corriere, a resident of Clearwater, Florida, raised almost $3 million from investors located across the country.  The complaint alleged that Corriere offered participation interests in fictitious prime bank trading programs involving medium term notes or MTNs.  Corriere allegedly promised investors a return of 100 percent per week, guaranteed investors that they could not lose their initial investment, and told investors that these trading programs were risk-free and safe.  According to the Commissions complaint, these trading programs do not exist, investors never received the returns promised, and most investors lost their initial investment.  In addition, the complaint alleged that Corriere diverted some investor funds for personal use.

The Commission alleged in its complaint that House and Moore controlled the Hedge Fund, which is located in Mt. Zion, Illinois.  The complaint alleged that the defendants solicited investors and potential investors to invest their retirement savings in the Hedge Fund by making false and misleading statements in offering materials and on the Hedge Funds website.  The Commissions complaint alleged that the defendants told investors that the Hedge Fund had generated cumulative returns of 148% since its inception because it used investor proceeds to engage in a sophisticated securities trading strategy.  The Commission alleged that the Hedge Fund had, in fact, suffered losses totaling at least $850,000 since its inception.  Further, the complaint alleged that from at least May 2001 to June 2002, House and Moore borrowed approximately $425,000 from the Hedge Fund to purchase their personal residences and the Advisers office building.  The complaint alleged that the defendants failed to disclose to investors that they had used investor proceeds in this manner and that House and Moore had each emerged from personal bankruptcy in the last two years.  The complaint also alleged that the defendants made false and misleading statements about Houses background in the offering materials.  The offering materials touted Houses six years of experience in the securities industry, but failed to disclose that House was terminated as a registered representative for unauthorized sales of Hedge Fund units and that he was barred by the NASD for making unauthorized sales of Hedge Fund units and for providing the NASD with false information.   , The complaint alleged that, by the above conduct, the Hedge Fund violated Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 7(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940.

Civil Action No. 3:98-CV2792-G [USDC/NDTX/Dallas Division], <p align=CENTER>DALLAS LAW FIRM AGREES TO PAY $1.2 MILLION FOR VIOLATING COURT ORDER IN SEC ENFORCEMENT ACTION, The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that the Dallas law firm, Gardere Wynne Sewell LLP, has agreed to pay $1.2 million for violating a court order in a pending SEC civil lawsuit against Sharp Capital Advisors, Inc., one of the law firms former clients.  For 18 months, Gardere failed to produce 27 boxes of Sharps records in its possession that the court had ordered produced.  The $1.2 million being paid will be used to compensate investors who lost money in the scheme underlying the SECs suit.  , Sharp is a former registered investment adviser that catered to Mexican and other Latin American investors.  The SEC lawsuit against Sharp alleged that the company and its principal, Mauricio Gutierrez, lost as much as $80 million of client funds in highly leveraged investments in speculative securities of Eastern European and South American companies without client knowledge or authorization.   , In November 1998, the SEC obtained emergency orders from the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas freezing the assets of Sharp and Gutierrez and appointing a Special Master to collect and maintain the assets for the benefit of Sharps advisory clients.  The orders directed Sharp, Gutierrez, and their agents immediately to provide to the Special Master all non-privileged books, records and documents relating to Sharps activities and cooperate with the Special Master by promptly and honestly responding to all requests for information.  , Sharp and Gutierrez agreed to the court orders.  As their attorney, Gardere represented Sharp and Gutierrez and negotiated the terms and language of the orders on their behalf.  But Gardere failed to turn over to the Special Master 27 boxes of Sharps records until 18 months after the entry of the orders.  The boxes contained relevant documents not previously produced to the Special Master.  , As a result of Garderes failure to timely deliver these records, the Special Masters efforts to administer the assets maintained for investors was significantly impaired.  The SEC and Special Master believe that the $1.2 million being paid is appropriate compensation for the damages caused by Garderes failure to comply with the court orders.  Garderes agreement to settle the claims of the SEC and Special Master for this amount is subject to court approval. , Previously in the Sharp litigation, the Special Master recovered more than $17 million, much of which already has been distributed to victims of the scheme.  In addition, Gutierrez has pled guilty to criminal fraud charges brought by a federal grand jury in conjunction with the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Northern District of Texas and is awaiting sentencing.

As alleged in the Commissions complaint filed on January 23, 2002, Znetix, HMC and Cascade raised more than $91 million from more than 5,000 investors nationwide with false promises of an imminent, lucrative initial public offering of Znetix., Znetix and HMC, without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, consented to the entry of a judgment, entered by the Federal District Court in Seattle, permanently enjoining them from future violations of the antifraud and securities registration provisions of the federal securities laws (Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder).  Cascade, without admitting or denying the Commissions findings, consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act.

WorldCom did so by capitalizing (and deferring) rather than expensing (and immediately recognizing) approximately $3.8 billion of its costs:  the company transferred these costs to capital accounts in violation of established generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).

Heinzelmann faces up to five years in prison and a substantial fine.    , The indictment against Heinzelmann alleges, and in the plea agreement Heinzelmann has admitted, that he agreed to divert money owed to certain customers of Fort Worth, Texas based Surety Bank, N.A. to other Surety Bank customers who were indebted to Surety Bank.  Surety Bank is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Surety Capital Corporation, a bank holding company whose securities are registered with the Commission.  During the relevant period, Surety Capitals common stock was traded on the American Stock Exchange.  The diversion allowed Surety Bank to avoid writing off bad loans, which caused Surety Banks profits to be overstated, and its losses to be understated.     , On April 25, 2002, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action against  Heinzelmann, of Fort Worth, Texas, seeking a permanent injunction, an officer and director bar, and a third-tier civil money penalty.  According to the Commissions complaint, from 1996 through September 1999, Heinzelmann, while president and director of Surety Capital, engaged in an elaborate scheme to hide loan losses experienced by Surety Bank.  The scheme had a material impact on financial statements included in Surety Capitals Forms 10-K and 10-Q.  Specifically, Surety Capital overstated its pre-tax income by 7% in 1996, and understated its pre-tax losses by 16% in 1997 and 97% in 1998.  Further, Surety Capital failed to file its Form 10-Q for the period ending September 30, 1999.  Because of the misstatements, Surety Capital failed to make and keep books, records and accounts that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflected its transactions and dispositions of assets.

On February 21, 2002, the Commission filed a Complaint charging Gruttadauria and two entities controlled by him with securities fraud.  Specifically, the Commission alleged that, over at least a six-year period, while he worked at Lehman Brothers and at SG Cowen Securities Corporation, Gruttadauria, 44, of Gates Mills, Ohio, stole at least $40 million in the course of defrauding more than 50 clients.  The Commission had also sought to recover assets from English as a relief defendant., In the Amended Complaint, the Commission alleges that English knowingly provided substantial assistance to Gruttadauria in implementing his scheme.  Specifically, the Commission alleges that English assisted in the preparation of false account statements and other documents, directly provided false information to certain clients regarding the values of their accounts and their purchases and sales of securities, processed withdrawal requests for clients whose accounts had been depleted, and assisted with or facilitated unauthorized transfers of funds.  The Amended Complaint further alleges that she received as much as $700,000 in cash and other items of value from Gruttadauria.

California), SEC CHARGES CALIFORNIA BROKER WITH FRAUD IN VARIABLE ANNUITY SALES, In only the second Securities and Exchange Commission action for fraudulent variable annuity switching, the SEC today announced the filing yesterday of civil fraud charges against Gregory P. Waldon of Redding, California. The suit alleges that Waldon defrauded scores of retired customers by recommending that they replace existing investments in variable annuities with new investments in similar variable annuities, knowing that the switches would be harmful to his customers but would enable him to receive significant commissions.  The complaint alleges that Waldon recommended approximately 57 such switches between January 1998 and November 2001.  Waldons customers either received no economic benefit or lost money in the switch transactions and together incurred more than $200,000 in needless transaction costs, while Waldon received approximately $275,000 in commissions for the unsuitable switches.  , Variable annuities are considered long-term investments that offer customers various investment options typically similar to mutual funds; however, variable annuities are taxed differently, have insurance-related features, and charge different costs.  Waldon is a former registered representative of Commission-registered broker-dealers through which he sold variable annuities, including FASCO International, Inc., formerly of Chico, California.  Most of Waldons customers live in Northern California or Oregon. , According to the filings, Waldon further defrauded his customers by misrepresenting the effects or the benefits of switching, and by failing to disclose to certain customers the costs and risks of switching.  The complaint alleges that Waldon told certain customers that they needed to switch to a new variable annuity from their original variable annuity in order to stem investment losses caused by declines in the stock market during 2000 and 2001, even though switching did not halt their losses and the customers could have achieved their objective, without incurring switching costs, by simply electing another investment option within their original variable annuity.  Waldon was aware that most of his customers did not have significant investment experience, particularly regarding variable annuities, and relied upon him when making the decision to switch., In the civil complaint filed in United States District Court for the Eastern District of California, in Sacramento, the Commission charges Waldon with securities fraud based upon the approximately 57 variable annuity switches, and based upon material misrepresentations and omissions regarding costs, benefits and risks of switching.  The complaint seeks an injunction against Waldon prohibiting future violations of the antifraud provisions of the securities laws (Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder), disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, plus interest, and a civil monetary penalty.  , Today the Commission also instituted and simultaneously settled public administrative proceedings yesterday against Donna N. Morehead, who was Waldons supervisor between September 1999 and May 2001 at FASCO International, Inc.  <u>In the Matter of Donna N. Morehead</u>, <a href=/litigation/admin/34-46121.htm>Exchange Act Rel. No. 46121</a>.  The Commissions Order Instituting Proceedings found that Morehead failed reasonably to supervise Waldon, as she did not investigate adequately red flags raised by certain switches when she reviewed the transactions for FASCO.  Morehead consented to the Order, without admitting or denying the findings.  The Commissions Order bars Morehead from association in a supervisory capacity with any broker-dealer, with the right to reapply for such association after one year, and imposes a $10,000 civil penalty.    ]"

The Commission instituted suit against the two brothers on December 4, 2001, alleging that they had engaged in insider trading. , The defendants are:, , , The case was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Sherman Division, and was assigned to United States Magistrate Judge Robert Faulkner., Specifically, the SEC alleged that George Matus had advance knowledge of Carrekers negative earnings news and participated in both the drafting of the press release announcing the negative news and the decision as to when to release the news.  However, rather than maintain the confidentiality of the news and abstain from trading in Carreker stock, George Matus conveyed the confidential negative information to his brother and transferred $50,000 to him in order to trade in Carreker securities and profit from the non-public information.  Pursuant to their plan, Peter Matus then used his brothers funds to purchase 750 Carreker put options, effectively betting that the price of Carreker shares would decline once the negative news was made public.  Predictably, upon release of the negative news, the price of Carreker stock declined.  When Peter Matus sold the options a week later, the price had declined more than 40%, netting the brothers a profit of $209,940.  , Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions Complaint, the defendants consented to a permanent injunction and an order of disgorgement.  The remaining issues were tried to the Court on April 23, 2002.  The trial court, after hearing the evidence and argument of counsel, granted the Commission all relief sought in its Complaint., In the final judgment, the Court permanently enjoined George and Peter Matus from further violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, ordered George and Peter Matus jointly and severally to disgorge $209,940 in illegal trading profits plus $9,941 prejudgment interest on that amount and assessed the maximum civil penalty of $629,820 against each defendant under the Insider Trading Sanctions Act.

According to the complaint, Saffer was one of a small number of senior officials whom Manugistics entrusted with unlimited access to material, nonpublic information about the company.

On July 2, 2002, Judge Charles P. Kocoras issued an order enjoining her from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, ordering her to disgorge $278,993.70 plus pre-judgment interest. All but $160,000 of the disgorgement was waived and penalties were not imposed, based on Loefs sworn representations in her statement of financial condition. Loef consented to the order, without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations,, The Complaint alleges that Mercury, a prominent sub-prime finance company, disclosed on January 29, 1997, that its reported net earnings for 1995 and 1996 had been overstated by more than $80 million. In reaction to that announcement, the price of Mercurys common stock plummeted by 89%. According to the Complaint, Loef sold a total of 20,799 shares of Mercury common stock on January 27 and 28, 1997, avoiding losses of $278,993.70. The Complaint further alleges that, at the time Loef sold her shares, she was generally aware that Mercurys headquarters were in a crisis atmosphere, that Mercurys Principal Accounting Officer was missing, and that Mercurys outside auditors were at Mercurys headquarters questioning personnel., The Commission thanks the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois for its cooperation in this matter.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr17599.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

(ABS) and Financial Federated Title &amp; Trust, Inc. (Federated), two now-defunct Florida corporations.  Paine acted as escrow agent for ABS and Federated.  The scheme involved the unregistered, fraudulent offer and sale of investment contracts in the form of fractional interests in the death benefits of life insurance policies, commonly known as viatical settlements.     , The Complaint alleged that the viatical investment scheme defrauded over 5000 investors nationwide of between $80 million to $130 million.  The Complaint specifically alleged that ABS employed a network of independent sales agents who sold the viatical investments on behalf of Federated, which purported to purchase the life insurance policies from terminally-ill viators at a discount.  As offered, the viatical investments were touted as fully secured, non-speculative financial investments which paid a 42% return on a 36-month investment.

Cushing was convicted of one count of securities fraud, one count of perjury, and one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, perjury, and obstruction of justice in relation to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigation of WAMEX.  Cushings conviction was based on his participation in a scheme to manipulate the public market for WAMEX stock by, among other things, issuing false and misleading press releases concerning WAMEXs funding and regulatory approvals to operate its proposed business, an Internet-based Alternative Trading System (ATS).  Cushing and his co-conspirators obtained approximately $24 million in profits by selling WAMEX stock to the public during the course of the scheme., The evidence at trial showed that, in the fall of 1999, Cushing entered into an illegal funding agreement with two New York-based stock promoters, Roger M. DeTrano and Edward A. Durante.  In exchange for 19.5 million WAMEX shares, DeTrano and Durante agreed to engage in manipulative trading designed to inflate artificially WAMEXs stock price, sell the shares to the public at the artificially inflated prices, and kick-back a portion of the proceeds to Cushing and WAMEX.  Cushing assisted DeTrano and Durante in their efforts to drive up WAMEXs stock price by providing a steady stream of phony press releases on behalf of WAMEX., The evidence also showed that Cushing caused WAMEX to make false and misleading public announcements concerning millions of dollars in funding that had been purportedly raised by WAMEX; WAMEXs attempts to obtain regulatory approval to operate its ATS prior to its announced July 4, 2000 launch date, which was publicly touted as Investor Independence Day; and Cushings supposed vast experience in the investment banking industry.  In fact, WAMEX had not raised millions of dollars in funding and virtually all of the financing it did receive was in the form of kickbacks from DeTrano and Durante; WAMEX was not involved in any ongoing efforts to obtain regulatory approval to operate an ATS; and Cushings investment banking experience consisted of his employment at several notorious boiler rooms that had been shut down by regulators in the United States and Austria., In early June 2000, Cushing and Russell A. Chimenti, Jr., WAMEXs Chief Administrative Officer, were subpoenaed to testify in connection with the SECs investigation of WAMEX.  The evidence at trial showed that Cushing and Chimenti lied at several points during their testimonies in an effort to conceal the true source of WAMEXs funding and their relationship with Durante.  On June 14, 2000, the SEC suspended trading in WAMEX stock and Cushing, Chimenti, and DeTrano were charged criminally by the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York (USAO).  DeTrano pled guilty to, among other things, securities fraud on January 25, 2002.  Chimenti pled guilty to perjury and conspiracy to commit perjury and obstruct justice on March 5, 2002, The SEC sued Cushing, along with Chimenti, DeTrano, and Durante, on October 11, 2001.

Save the World Air, Inc. et al.</u>, 01 CV 11586 (S.D.N.Y.), The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that on June 27, 2002, the Honorable George B. Daniels of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York permanently enjoined defendant Save the World Air, Inc. (STWA) from violating the antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws.  STWA, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions Complaint, consented to the entry of the final judgment against it.  STWA is a Nevada corporation headquartered in Australia with its principal offices in California, whose business involves the manufacture, licensing, and distribution of a device called the Zero Emission Fuel Saver (ZEFS) device.  , In its Complaint, filed December 19, 2001, the Commission alleged that from at least February 1999 through at least April 2001, STWA and its former president and CEO, Jeffrey Muller, carried out a fraudulent promotional campaign using press releases, Internet postings, an elaborate Internet website, and televised media events to disseminate false and materially misleading information about STWAs product and commercial prospects.  STWAs and Mullers actions led to the artificial inflation of the price and trading volume of STWA stock, causing its market capitalization to be as much as $218,728,062.  The promotional information distributed by STWA and Muller included:  (1) announcements of significant licensing agreements and other important business developments, and (2) announcements concerning public automotive demonstrations that purportedly proved or would prove that the ZEFS materially reduces emissions and improves fuel economy in motor vehicles.  In fact, the purported licensing agreements and other purported business events simply did not exist, and the ZEFS demonstrations did not prove that the ZEFS actually worked as represented.  At the same time he publicly promoted STWA, Muller privately sold millions of shares of restricted STWA stock that, if sold at then-prevailing market prices, would have provided him with over $9 million in personal profits.  He concealed these sales by failing to disclose in Commission filings, as required, any changes in his beneficial ownership in STWA.  Finally, STWA and Muller made at least nine SEC filings that contain false financials statements and disclosures.  For example, STWA reported $125,000 in revenue for the sale of a license that in fact it never sold, thus causing its revenues (which otherwise never were reported to be more than $10,000 throughout the entire relevant period) to be materially overstated.  , The complaint further alleged that Billy Blackwelder, STWAs former marketing consultant, engaged in at least part of the manipulative scheme.  He prepared and arranged to have issued at least one false press release announcing a major licensing deal, when in fact no such deal existed.  Blackwelder also posted positive messages on Raging Bull, an Internet message board, without making required disclosures about compensation he received from STWA for his promotional activities.  , The complaint charged STWA and Muller with violations of the antifraud and reporting provisions of the federal securities laws: Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act); Sections 10(b), 13(a), and 13(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act); and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13 and 13b2-1 thereunder.  The complaint also alleged that Muller violated Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 16a-2 and 16a-3 thereunder.  The complaint charged Blackwelder with violations of the antifraud and antitouting provisions, Section 17(b) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder., Under the terms of the settlement between the Commission and STWA, STWA consents to a permanent injunction prohibiting it from violating the antifraud and reporting provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

FRANKLIN, JR., FORMER IN-HOUSE ATTORNEY TO PROFESSIONAL SPORTS AGENT TANK BLACK, SENTENCED TO 54 MONTHS IN PRISON AND ORDERED TO PAY $12 MILLION IN RESTITUTION FOLLOWING PARALLEL CRIMINAL PROSECUTION</b>, The Commission announced that on July 8, 2002, James A. Franklin, Jr., a former South Carolina attorney and in-house counsel to sports agent William H. Tank Black, was sentenced to serve 54 months in prison and ordered to pay $12 million in restitution stemming from charges that he conspired with Black to defraud Blacks athlete-clients.  The Hon. Stephan P. Mickle imposed the sentence after a hearing in United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida (Gainesville Division)., Franklin previously pleaded guilty to:  (i) one count of conspiring to commit wire fraud and to obstruct the SECs parallel investigation and (ii) one count of conspiring to commit money laundering.  The United States Attorney for the Northern District of Florida prosecuted Franklin for the same conduct that underlies a civil enforcement action brought by the Commission in February 2000 against Franklin, Black and others in United States District Court in the Middle District of Florida.  The Commissions lawsuit, which has been stayed pending resolution of the criminal case, alleges that Black, Franklin, Professional Management, Inc. (Blacks sports agency business) and Professional Management Consulting, Inc. (Black and Franklins related consulting business) defrauded nearly two dozen client-athletes of millions of dollars they entrusted to them for investment purposes, including investments in Cash 4 Titles, a purported car title loan business that was, in fact, an offshore Ponzi scheme., Judge Mickle ordered that Franklin serve his 54-month sentence concurrently with an existing 32-month sentence handed down in May 2001 by a federal court in Detroit.  In the Detroit case, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan prosecuted Franklin for his role in helping launder $1.1 million of drug money through the Cash 4 Titles Ponzi scheme.  Franklin began serving the Detroit sentence in July 2001.  Franklins 54-month Gainesville sentence reflects a substantial downward departure from federal sentencing guidelines.  In making that departure - and in deciding that Franklin should serve the Gainesville sentence concurrently, not consecutively, with the Detroit sentence - Judge Mickle emphasized Franklins post-indictment cooperation with the United States Attorney and with the Commission. , For further information about the Commissions action against Black and Franklin, see <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr16455.htm>Litigation Release No. 16455</a> (February 25, 2000); <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17358.htm>Litigation Release No. 17358</a> (February 11, 2002); and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17511.htm>Litigation Release No. 17511</a> (May 8, 2002).]"

On July 8, 2002, a federal district court entered a judgment against Texon and a related company, Lonestar Petroleum Corp., pursuant to consent, enjoining each of them from committing further securities fraud and violating the securities registration provisions.  The judgment also ordered Texon and Lonestar to pay jointly and severally in disgorgement $1,268,253, the amount raised from investors plus prejudgment interest.  As part of the settlement, Texon and Lonestar did not admit or deny the SECs allegations. , The SECs complaint further alleged that Texon and Lonestar, which were controlled by Barry V. Reed and repeat securities-law violator James E. Hammonds, sold unregistered securities by fraudulently promising investors an annual 12% dividend derived from Texons oil and gas profits and misrepresenting that Texon was a profitable business and safe investment.  Instead, Texon paid investors the so-called dividend with money raised from other investors., Previously, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California appointed a Receiver to take control of Texon and Lonestar for the investors benefit.  The Receiver is in the process of collecting and liquidating Texons and Lonestars assets, the net proceeds of which will be distributed to investors pursuant to a plan approved at a later date by the district court.  The judgment provides that if the Receivers recovery and liquidation of Texons and Lonestars assets fail to satisfy the disgorgement and prejudgment interest amount of $1,268,253, then the unsatisfied amount shall be waived.

Specifically, Judge Gertner granted the Commissions motions for summary judgment against Defendant Terry V. Koontz, the architect of the fraud, and his company Zone Productions, Inc.

Mass., filed Sept. 17, 1998), that Terry Koontz orchestrated a scheme in which more than 80 individuals in 16 states were induced to invest over $19 million in a fictitious international bank debenture trading program called Private Pool, LLC.  The Commission further charged that several sales agents utilized by Terry Koontz (including Defendant Fox) made various false representations to potential investors about Private Pool, including representations that investors would earn a return of 1% per week for a 40-week trading period, that their funds would be secured by government bonds in a two-to-one ratio, and that investors would receive a security interest in the bonds evidenced by a UCC-1 financing statement filed with the State of New York.  The Commission further alleged that Koontz falsely represented himself to be affiliated with Barclays Bank and that he traded international bank debentures.  In fact, international bank debentures do not exist, and Koontz was not affiliated with Barclays.  Moreover, the Commission charged that Koontz used the invested funds to pay other investors and sales commissions and that he dissipated at least $9.9 million of investor funds for personal purposes. , In addition to the civil enforcement action, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Middle District of Florida (Tampa) filed criminal actions against Terry Koontz (charging him with conspiracy, securities fraud, and wire fraud) and four other individuals involved in this scheme: Stewart Koral (false statements), Joseph Papasidero (misprision of a felony), Richard J.

The judgment permanently enjoins Richmond from violating the antifraud, securities and broker-dealer registration provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders Richmond to disgorge his ill-gotten gains of $8.5 million plus prejudgment interest in the amount of $3 million for a total of $11.5 million.  The Court also froze Richmonds assets until the disgorgement order is satisfied.    , The Commissions action was filed in July 1998 alleging that Richmond operated a Ponzi scheme in which he used internet websites and a network of Liberty Network sales agents to convince unsophisticated investors, including many elderly persons and widows, to liquidate annuities and other investments in order to purchase fraudulent securities issued by Royal Meridian International Bank (RMIB).  The Commission charged that Richmond falsely claimed RMIB was a fully chartered private offshore bank with offices in Canada, the Bahamas, Guernsey and Turks &amp; Caicos when, in fact, RMIB was a shell with no offices and no apparent significant sources of revenue from which it could pay returns except through the sale of additional fraudulent securities to unwitting investors.  Additionally, the Commission charged that Richmond deposited investor funds into a series of money market and bank accounts he controlled and that he used the funds to repay other investors and for Richmonds and others personal expenses.

Lynn, Judge, United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas (Dallas), entered a partial summary judgment in a multi-million dollar offering fraud scheme against Richard T. Taylor (Spring, Texas).  The judgment enjoins Taylor from violating the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws (Sections 5(a) and (c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder), orders Taylor to disgorge $3,298,295.95, together with prejudgment interest, to a court-appointed receiver for the benefit of defrauded investors.  The issue of civil money penalties will be determined at a later time by the court.  , As alleged in the Commissions complaint, the Court found: that, between 1992 and late 2001, Taylor, individually and doing business as Transworld Bankers, sold 30-month, purported FDIC-insured certificates of deposit (CDs) to no less than 82 investors; that the CDs were not registered with the Commission; and that Taylor had represented that the CDs would pay higher-than-average rates and that there would be no charge to investors for Taylor and Transworld Bankers services.  The Court also found that Taylor used investor funds for his own use, for Ponzi payments and to pay sales commissions.  , After the Commission filed its original emergency action to shut down the scheme and freeze assets on December 20, 2001, the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Texas filed an information charging Taylor with securities fraud and mail fraud arising out of the scheme.  On March 20, 2002, Taylor entered a plea of guilty to one count of securities fraud in violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. §77q(a), and one count of mail fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. §1341.  Taylor is scheduled to be sentenced on August 2, 2002, and could receive a prison sentence of as much as 10 years.  Additionally, the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Texas filed an information charging Kevin M.

Judge Fitzwater also determined that the Hortons were responsible for failing to inform investors: that American Automation had no marketable software and no agreements with insurance companies by which to market insurance at kiosks; that American Automation paid its sales representatives a salary and a commission for selling American Automation shares; that American Automation transferred investor funds to other corporations owned by the Hortons; that the Hortons used investor funds for personal use; and that American Automation had taken no meaningful steps to effectuate an IPO.  , Earlier, the Commission obtained judgments enjoining two other participants in the scheme, Merle B.

Hinkson has entered into a settlement with the Commission by agreeing to pay nearly $675,000 in disgorgement and penalties., The Commissions complaint alleges that from December 1998 to May 2000, while he was a Merrill Lynch broker, Hinkson sold several of his clients Cash Management Account money fund securities and then forged their signatures on authorizations to transfer the proceeds into his own bank and securities accounts.  Hinkson was able to cover up his scheme because he also transferred funds to client accounts whose funds had been previously misappropriated.  If a client discovered an unauthorized transaction, Hinkson falsely told the client that a mistake had been made and that the funds had been, or would be, replaced with interest.

The Court ordered Berger to produce all responsive documents on or before July 21, 2002.  , In finding that the subpoena was enforceable as written, the Court held that Berger failed to demonstrate that the SECs subpoena was issued in bad faith, or was overbroad in scope. The Court also held that Berger did not have a privacy interest in his personal tax returns and that Berger failed to show any circumstances that warranted delaying the SECs investigation. , The SEC filed its Motion for Immediate Order Directing Compliance with Subponea Duces Tecum on April 24, 2002.

Church Extension of the Church of God, Inc., United Management Services, Inc., James Perry Grubbs and Shearon Louis Jackson</u>, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, Cause No. IP 02-1118 CH/S (S.D. Indiana 2002)., <b>SEC Charges Indiana-Based Religious Entity for Defrauding Church Members Nationwide in an $85 Million Financial and Offering Fraud</b>, On July 22, 2002, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) filed a civil enforcement action alleging that from at least 1996 though at least April 2002, Church Extension of the Church of God, Inc. (Church Extension), United Management Services, Inc. (United Management), a Church Extension affiliate, James Perry Grubbs (Grubbs), the president of Church Extension, and Shearon Louis Jackson (Jackson), the president of United Management (collectively, Defendants), fraudulently raised approximately $85 million from the sale of investment notes to thousands of investors nationwide.  Church Extension, the fundraising entity of a long-established church, was formed in 1921 for the primary purpose of raising funds to loan to churches for the construction of new churches and to fund renovations of existing churches of the Church of God., In its Complaint, the Commission alleges that, in connection with the offer and sale of the investment notes, the Defendants repeatedly made material misrepresentations and omitted to state material facts in Church Extensions solicitation materials and offering circulars, concerning, among others:  the financial condition of Church Extension and United Management, the primary use of investment note proceeds and the safety and risks associated with the investment notes.  Each of Church Extensions offering circulars included an unqualified, independent auditors report and a consolidated statement of financial condition. , Specifically, the Complaint alleges that Grubbs and Jackson, through Church Extension and United Management, embarked on a fraudulent scheme to cover up financial difficulties suffered by Church Extension and United Management from investors.  For example, the Defendants improperly used a provision of the Internal Revenue Code, afforded non-profit corporations, as a vehicle to generate non-existent income.  This income was recognized by Church Extension on its consolidated statement of financial condition and was used to offset Church Extensions losses.  As a result, from at least 1996 through at least April 2000, Church Extension improperly recognized at least $24,052,667 in non-existent income that was used to offset other losses and thereby avoided recording at least $26,066,879 in losses.  , The Complaint further alleges that, instead of using investment proceeds primarily to fund church loans, the Defendants used the proceeds to, among other things:  a) fund speculative real estate transactions; b) fund losses at these failing properties; and c) make interest and principal payments to prior investors.  Finally, the Complaint alleges that as a result of Church Extensions deteriorating financial condition, it was unable to maintain the promised reserves stated in its offering circulars, which were distributed to prospective and current investors nationwide., The Commission asked the Court to impose a permanent injunction against each defendant for violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Commission also asked the Court to order disgorgement of approximately $81 million in ill-gotten gains, plus prejudgment and post-judgment interest, from Church Extension and asked the Court to order disgorgement of any ill-gotten gains received by Grubbs and Jackson and civil penalties from Grubbs and Jackson., In addition, the Commission recommended that the Court appoint Jeff J.  Marwil, a partner at the law firm of Jenner &amp; Block in Chicago, Illinois, as a Conservator in this matter.  The proposed Conservators mandate is to protect the interests of the investors who invested or reinvested in Church Extensions investment note program.,  Church Extension and United Management have established a Joint Oversight Committee (Joint Committee) for the purpose of drafting a joint corporate restructuring plan (Restructuring Plan).  The Restructuring Plan will address, among other things, a manner in which to meet Church Extension and United Managements proposed $81 million disgorgement obligations.  During the time period when the Joint Committee is drafting the Restructuring Plan, the Commission and the proposed Conservator will aggressively monitor the activities of Church Extension and United Management.  Within 60 days, the Joint Committee will submit the Restructuring Plan to the Court, the Commission and the proposed Conservator.  After a limited period of review, the Restructuring Plan will be presented to the Court for its ultimate determination, including, its approval, modification or rejection of the plan.  At all times, the Commission and the proposed Conservator will reserve the right to petition the Court for immediate relief, including, the appointment of a federal receiver, if either deems any activity, transaction or expenditure contemplated by Church Extension and United Management is not in the best interests of investors.    , The Commission wishes to acknowledge and thank the Indiana Securities Division of the Secretary of State for their assistance in this matter., ]"

IBF Collateralized Finance Corporation, et al.  (S.D.N.Y. 02 Civ.  5713 (Martin)</h2>]","[The Commission announced today that it has brought securities fraud charges against Simon Hershon and three of his InterBank Companies in connection with the offer and sale of $189 million in debt securities between 1997 and 2002.  The corporate defendants are InterBank Funding Corporation (IBF), IBF Collateralized Finance Corporation (CFC) and IBF VI - Secured Lending Corporation (Fund VI).  In addition to fraud, the Complaint charges that defendants CFC and Fund VI are operating unlawfully as unregistered investment companies in violation of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ICA).  On June 7, 2002, in anticipation that the Commission would be filing this action, the three corporate defendants filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States Bankruptcy Court in New York.  The bankruptcy filings will not prevent the prosecution of the Commissions claims in federal district court., The Complaint alleges that: , Defendant Hershon owns all or the majority interest in several affiliated companies that together constitute the so-called InterBank Companies.  The InterBank Companies are engaged in an investment business, and IBF provides the capital for these investments through three (formerly seven) wholly owned special purpose corporations or funds (the IBF Funds), including CFC and Fund VI.  Between February 1996 and February 2002, the original seven IBF Funds raised nearly $195 million from about 3,100 investors in successive offerings, consisting primarily of unsecured subordinated high yielding notes in private placements.  Nearly half of this total was raised in 2001.  CFC is the largest IBF Fund with $182 million in notes on its books.  Fund VI has raised about $7.2 million through the public offering of unsecured, high yield bonds.,  The IBF Funds have been able to operate over the past six years only because IBF routinely moved offering proceeds between these entities in order to meet their cash flow needs - amounting to tens of millions of dollars of inter-fund transfers. These material related-party transfers were never disclosed to investors.   Nor did the defendants disclose the extent to which interest payments to investors were paid out of offering proceeds. , Moreover, the defendants failed to disclose millions of dollars in transfers between IBF and the IBF Funds that were designed to hide - and did hide from investors - millions of dollars in losses sustained by the investment loan portfolios of the IBF Funds.   As a result, the financial statements of the IBF Funds materially overstated net income, and return statistics that IBF regularly published about the IBF Funds were materially overstated, in some instances by as much as 50 percent., In addition, the defendants securities offerings to date have been unlawful because CFC and Fund VI are operating as unregistered investment companies and are not in compliance with any of the requirements of the ICA.  Indeed, noncompliance with two provisions of the ICA is vital to the operations of these two entities - the prohibition against extreme leverage and the prohibition on affiliated transactions., The IBF Funds depend entirely upon debt financing to provide the capital for the InterBank Companies investment program, which involves making high-risk loans and other risky investments.   Further, CFCs and Fund VIs respective business depends upon being able to invest in and through affiliated parties.  Most of their investments involve prohibited affiliated party transactions., The defendants are:, <b>Hershon,</b> age 54, who resides in Arlington, Virginia.  Hershon is the chief executive officer (CEO), president and director of CFC, and he is the CEO and a director of Fund VI.  He obtained a Masters and Doctorate in Business Administration from Harvard University in 1973 and 1975, respectively.  Hershon formed the first InterBank Company in 1977.  In 1996, Hershon formed IBF and the first IBF Fund.  , <b>IBF</b> is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Washington, D.C.  IBF is the parent of the IBF Funds.  It is wholly owned by Hershon., <b>CFC</b> is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Washington, D.C.  Formed in 1999, CFC was originally named IBF Special Purpose Corporation VII (Fund VII).  Fund VII initially sought to raise $25 million through the issuance of unsecured subordinated notes under a private placement memorandum dated May 10, 1999.  It increased the offering to $50 million under an amended private placement memorandum dated August 29, 2000, and it further increased the offering to $100 million under a supplemental private placement memorandum dated June 27, 2001.   In October 2001, Fund VII merged with two smaller IBF Funds and changed its name to CFC.  At that time, CFC increased the total offering amount to $200 million under a supplemental private placement memorandum dated October 1, 2001.  In January 2002, CFC merged with a fourth IBF Fund, which had itself issued about $50 million in subordinated notes in private placements.  As a consequence of the mergers, CFC now carries $182 million in investor notes on its books.  , <b>Fund VI</b> is a Delaware corporation formed in 1999, having its principal place of business in Washington, D.C.  In August 2000, it began offering $50 million in current and accretion subordinated bonds in a public offering.  The bonds mature on a rolling basis and bear interest at rates of between 8 and 10.75 percent per annum.  Fund VI has raised about $7.2 million through the public offering. , The Complaint charges that all defendants committed fraud in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, and Sections 17(a)(1), (2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933.  It also charges defendants CFC and Fund VI with violations of Section 7 of the ICA., The Complaint seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions against all defendants barring further violations of the securities laws; an order appointing a trustee to take possession of the assets of CFC and Fund VI; disgorgement of all offering proceeds obtained by CFC and Fund VI; and civil penalties against Hershon and IBF for their violations of the antifraud provisions of the securities laws., The action is pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr17625.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Cohen, et al.</i>, 99 Civ. 5822 (NRB) (S.D.N.Y.), <b>U.S. DISTRICT COURT ISSUES ORDER IMPOSING FULL DISGORGEMENT, INTEREST AND CIVIL PENALTY AGAINST DEFENDANT FOR  CONCEALING ASSETS IN SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS</b>, The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on July 15, 2002 the Honorable Naomi Reice Buchwald, United States District Judge for the Southern District of New York, issued an order imposing disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty against a defendant who had misled the Commission in earlier settlement negotiations.  After an evidentiary, hearing Judge Buchwald found that when the defendant negotiated his settlement with the Commission he concealed several material assets, including an option to buy a million-dollar piece of property in the Bahamas, a 41-foot sloop, a 1956 Ford Thunderbird, several Harley Davidson motorcycles, and a resort time-share.  Based on these findings, Judge Buchwald imposed full disgorgement of $797,530, prejudgment interest of $467,623.77, and a civil penalty of $250,000.  , The Commission originally sued the defendant, Robert E. Cohen of New York, New York, in July 1999. The Commission charged Cohen with fraud and evasion of the securities registration requirements for his part in a scheme to sell large blocks of unregistered penny stock into the United States from brokerage accounts purportedly held by foreign nationals.  The Commission charged that in fact the foreign nationals were merely nominees, and that Cohen was the real principal in the transactions.  , After the Commission filed its suit, Cohen entered into settlement negotiations with the Commission.  As part of those negotiations, Cohen submitted a sworn financial statement to the Commission in October 1999.  That financial statement showed Cohen to be insolvent.  In April 2000, the parties agreed to the entry of a Judgment against Cohen, which permanently enjoined him from future violations.  The Judgment further waived payment of all but $30,000 of the sought-after disgorgement and interest and did not impose a civil penalty, based on Cohens sworn financial statements.  The Judgment included a clause providing that if the Commission obtained information indicating that Cohens sworn financial statement was fraudulent, misleading, inaccurate, or incomplete in any material respect, the Commission could petition the Court for an Order imposing the full amount of disgorgement originally sought against Cohen, together with prejudgment interest and a civil penalty.  , Despite his settlement agreement, Cohen did not pay the $30,000 required of him under the Judgment.  In attempting to collect on the Judgment, the Commission discovered that Cohen was living in the Bahamas and that he had frequently traveled between the Bahamas and New York.  The Commission filed a motion for an order to show cause why Cohen should not be held in contempt for his failure to pay the $30,000 required of him under the Judgment.  At a hearing on the show cause motion, Cohen admitted that he controlled several previously undisclosed bank accounts in the Bahamas and that he held an undisclosed option to buy resort real estate in the Bahamas.  Cohen maintained, however, that his Bahamian accounts no longer held any funds and that he was in fact insolvent.  At the conclusion of the hearing, the Court ordered Cohen to cooperate with the Commission in further discovery into his finances.  Shortly after the hearing, Cohen filed for bankruptcy protection.,  The Commission nevertheless pursued discovery into Cohens finances and discovered that he had concealed numerous, material assets when he settled the Commissions suit against him, including an option to buy a million-dollar piece of property in the Bahamas, a 41-foot sloop, a 1956 Ford Thunderbird, several Harley Davidson motorcycles, and a resort time share.  Based on this information, on April 15, 2002 the Commission moved for an order to show cause why the Court should not impose full disgorgement and interest as well as a civil penalty against Cohen.  The Court held an evidentiary hearing on May 16, 2002.   , At the hearing, Cohen offered explanations for his failure to disclose these assets to the Commission.  Among other things, he claimed that one of his motorcycles had been stolen and that he had transferred his sloop, the Thunderbird, and two of the motorcycles to others in 1999.  The Court, however, did not find Cohens excuses credible.  The Court concluded that Cohens property transfers were sham transactions designed to hide assets from the SEC and the Bankruptcy Court.  , Accordingly, the Court reinstated the full disgorgement award of $797,530, along with prejudgment interest of $467,623.77, and imposed a civil penalty of $250,000.  ]"

Banning of Arlington, Virginia, with insider trading in advance of the public announcement on July 26, 1999, that Softworks, Inc., would post a loss of $0.02 per share for the second quarter of 1999.  The SECs complaint charges that by selling Softworks stock before the earnings announcement, the two men avoided losses totalling $67,141.  In addition, the complaint charges that Smith sold Softworks stock short before the announcement and made a profit of $19,575.  , Simultaneous with the filing of the complaint, both men settled with the Commission.  Without admitting or denying the allegations made by the Commission, Banning consented to the entry of an order enjoining him from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The order requires Banning to pay $60,507.17 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and pay a civil penalty of $48,500.31.  Without admitting or denying the allegations made by the Commission, Smith consented to the entry of an order enjoining him from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.  The order requires Smith to pay $38,215.63 in disgorgement, but waives payment and does not impose a civil penalty based on Smiths sworn representations regarding financial condition.  , The complaint alleges that Smith misappropriated confidential information regarding the second-quarter loss through his position or contacts as a security consultant for Softworks.  According to the complaint, after misappropriating the information, Smith placed two calls to Banning, a close family friend who is an owner of car dealerships in Maryland.  Within fifteen minutes after the calls, Banning called his broker and placed an order to sell all of his Softworks stock.  The complaint alleges that by selling his shares before Softworks publicly announced its second-quarter loss, Banning unlawfully avoided a loss of approximately $48,500.  The next day, Smith sold all of his shares of Softworks stock, unlawfully avoiding a loss of approximately $18,641.  One day after his sale, Smith placed his first-ever trade on margin, selling Softworks stock short.  Both Banning and Smith sold Softworks stock at prices above $10.00.  After Softworks publicly announced its second-quarter loss on July 26, 1999, its stock price dropped by over a third from its closing price on the previous trading day, closing at approximately $5.28 per share.  The complaint alleges that after the announcement, Smith covered his short sale, making an unlawful profit of approximately $19,575. , The Commission gratefully acknowledges the assistance provided by NASD Regulation, Inc., in the investigation of this matter.]"

Both Kapoor and his wife now live in India.  The Court found that, between September 1997 and January 1998, Kapoor and Sharma had engaged in insider trading in the securities of MCI Communications Corp., Brooks Fiber Properties, Inc., Carson Pirie Scott &amp; Co., Inc., and Southern New England Telecommunications Corp., in advance of five merger and acquisition announcements concerning these companies.  , Based on its findings, the Court permanently enjoined Kapoor from future violations of Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3, and ordered him to pay disgorgement of $294,418.94, to pay prejudgment interest of $115,838.21, and to pay civil penalties of $883,256.82.

Sekhri, the source of the inside information, was an investment banking associate at Salomon Smith Barney, Inc. in New York City.  The SEC later amended its complaint to add defendants Kapoor and Sharma.  The amended complaint alleges that, from September 1997 through January 1998, Sekhri, Kapoor, Sharma, Pratima Rajan, Amolak Sehgal, Fuad Dow, Gordon W. Cochrane, and Martin L. Thifault engaged in a highly profitable insider trading scheme by collectively purchasing call options and/or common stock shortly before six major corporate announcements.

Sharma, Kapoors friend Rajan, and eight of Kapoors Merrill Lynch clients collectively bought securities in all four companies.  , Sekhri, a fugitive for more than a year, was arrested on May 30, 1999, by the Australian Federal Police at the Sydney Airport.  He was extradited to the United States and pled guilty to criminal charges of insider trading.  Sekhri was incarcerated, and later deported to India after he had completed his criminal sentence.

Ullom, branch office manager of the Cranston, Rhode Island office of Raymond James Financial Services, Inc., in connection with an alleged fraudulent scheme that raised at least $52 million from investors between 1999 and 2001.  The Commission named Ullom as a relief defendant in its complaint and does not accuse Ullom of any wrongdoing; rather, the Commission alleges that Ullom received approximately $190,000 in investor funds to which he has no legitimate claim.  , The Commission alleges in its complaint, filed April 1, 2002, that individuals associated with an entity formerly known as Brite Business made fraudulent representations to investors, promising exorbitant returns through a high yield trading program.  According to the Commissions complaint, most of the Brite Business investor funds were maintained in a brokerage account at Raymond James Cranston, Rhode Island office.  The complaint alleges that Dennis Herula was a registered representative at the Cranston office of Raymond James and was the designated representative for the Brite Business account.  The complaint further alleges that, between 1999 and 2001, Herula and others associated with Brite Business misappropriated, transferred or lost approximately $20 million in investor funds.  According to the Commissions complaint, Ullom received $190,000 in Brite Business investor funds to which he was not entitled and for which he performed no services.  The Commission alleges that those funds should be returned to investors.  The Court held a hearing on May 10, 2002 concerning Ullom and his receipt of the investor funds.  On July 17, the Court issued a Memorandum and Order freezing $190,000 of Ulloms assets, based on its finding that the Commission is likely to succeed in proving that Ullom has no legitimate claim to those funds.  , For further information, please see, <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17514.htm>Litigation Release No. 17514</a> (May 13, 2002); <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17461.htm>Litigation Release No. 17461</a> (April 5, 2002); <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17334.htm>Litigation Release No. 17334</a> (January 24, 2002)[subpoena enforcement action against Defendant Capalbo]; and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17325.htm>Litigation Release No. 17325</a> (January 16, 2002)[subpoena enforcement action against Defendant Herula].]"

At the request of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the court-appointed Receiver, Judge Buchmeyer found that Stock and Lynds, participants in a prime bank fraud, were in civil contempt for willfully violating several prior orders entered by the Court., The Commission filed the <i>SEC v. RDI</i> matter on March 25, 2002, alleging that Stock and Lynds, together with several other defendants, violated the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws by participating in a Ponzi scheme involving the offer and sale of a non-existent prime bank trading program.  Resource Development International, its principals, James and David Edwards, and other defendants collected more than $98 million from more than 1300 investors nationwide through numerous misrepresentations and omissions, including false and misleading statements concerning the existence of the prime bank trading program, the safety of the investment, the purported participation of governmental and international organizations, and the use of investor funds. , James and David Edwards, a father and son who masterminded the RDI scheme from their headquarters in Tacoma, Washington, were fugitives for more than two months after Judge Buchmeyer issued bench warrants for their arrest on May 8, 2002.  Agents from the Tacoma office of the United States Marshals Service arrested the Edwards on July 21, 2002 in a remote area of Washington State.  The Edwards are currently being transported from Washington State to Texas., Lynds, Stock and the Edwards will each be incarcerated at the Seagoville Federal Correctional Center in Seagoville, Texas.  Lynds, Stock and the Edwards will join Ed Harris, the president of Jade Asset Management, another defendant in the <i>RDI</i> matter.  Harris has been incarcerated in Seagoville since April, after Judge Buchmeyer held him in civil contempt for refusing to comply with the Courts order that Jade repatriate and turn over to the Receiver all funds held by Jade in offshore bank accounts.  At that point, five individuals will be incarcerated at the Seagoville facility based on contempt motions brought by the Commission and Receiver in the <i>SEC v.

In addition to the Edwards, Santa Clara authorities brought criminal charges against William Whelan, another defendant in the Commissions lawsuit.  The Santa Clara County case involves eight local victims who were persuaded to transfer money from retirement funds or home equity loans to RDI or Dennel Finance Limited, the subject of another prior Commission action.

Based on its findings, the Court permanently enjoined Sekhri from future violations of Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3, and ordered him to disgorge $957,892.55 in insider trading profits of the individuals who traded based upon his tips.  The SEC has already recovered more than $1.6 million in disgorgement from other defendants, and the amount that Sekhri has been ordered to disgorge represents the remaining illegal profits that had not yet been recovered in this action.  Sekhri was also ordered to pay prejudgment interest of $376,879.66, and to pay the maximum civil penalty of $7,727,772.21, which is three times the total illegal profit of $2,575,924.07 made by Sekhris tippees., The Court found that, between September 1997 and January 1998, Sekhri, Amolak Sehgal, Pratima Rajan, Fuad Dow, Gordon W. Cochrane, Martin L.

Sekhris repeated tips of inside information to his tippees generated illegal profits of approximately $2.5 million.  , In January 1998, after learning that the SEC was investigating this trading, Sekhri quickly fled the United States and traveled to India to avoid prosecution.  On April 1, 1998, the SEC charged Sekhri and others with insider trading.  The U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York later filed criminal charges against Sekhri for illegal insider trading.  Sekhri remained a fugitive for more than a year until he was arrested in Australia and extradited to the United States.  On March 14, 2000, he pled guilty to criminal charges of insider trading and was sentenced to 24 months in jail.  Sekhri was deported to India after he had completed his criminal sentence., In imposing the maximum civil penalty allowable, the Court observed that Sekhri held one of the highest positions of trust and confidence at a major investment banking firm, and he betrayed that trust on repeated occasions., The SECs litigation in this case continues against the remaining defendants.

</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that Robert N. Rooks, former CEO of JDMC Global Corp., was found liable for securities fraud by a Los Angeles federal court.  On July 29, 2002, the United States District Court for the Central District of California entered a final judgment against Rooks, a resident of Malibu, California, age 57, permanently enjoining him from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering him to pay a $100,000 third tier civil penalty.  The Court found that in 1996 Rooks disseminated false and misleading information about JDMC Globals financial condition and a supposed South African housing project.  The Court found that Rooks false and misleading information caused JDMC Globals stock price to skyrocket from $.13 to $4, or more than 3,000%, during June through September 1996.  At the time of Rooks fraud, JDMC Global was a publicly-traded company based in Los Angeles, California that purportedly engaged in mining, construction, and entertainment.        , The Court also found that John W. Duffell, JDMC Globals stock promoter and a repeat securities law offender, violated the securities registration provisions of the federal securities laws, Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933.  Duffell, an American living in France, age 52, promoted JDMC Globals unregistered stock and directed the companys sales efforts in the United States.  The Court will decide in later proceedings the appropriate remedies against Duffell, including the amount of disgorgement and civil penalties and whether to issue an injunction for violating the federal securities registration provisions.      , In September 1996, the Commission suspended trading in the stock of JDMC Global, whose stock was traded on the Over-The-Counter Bulletin Board.  (See Lit. Release No. 34-37681, September 16, 1996.)  In May 2000, the SEC sued Rooks, Duffell and Charles E. Yost, another stock promoter, for fraudulently selling unregistered stock of JDMC Global.  (See Lit. Release No. 16550, May 12, 2000.)  The trial against Duffell and Yost for federal securities fraud is set for December 3, 2002.  , In 1979, in another SEC action, the United States District Court for the Central District of California issued a permanent injunction against Duffell for securities fraud and registration violations of the federal securities laws.  In 1982, Duffell was convicted and sentenced to prison for securities fraud arising out of the same conduct in the 1979 SEC action.    <!-- End text -->,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr17640.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

(CKK)</h2>, <h2>SEC Charges Steven Bolla with Fraud and Violating Prior Investment Adviser Bar Order.  Wife, Business Partner, and Bethesda-Based Washington Investment Network Also Charged.  </h2>]","[, , , The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged investment adviser Steven Bolla, 43, of Alpharetta, Georgia with securities fraud and with violating a June 2000 SEC order barring him from associating with any investment adviser.  In todays action, the Commission alleges that, for months after he was barred, Bolla continued to manage finances and business relationships for the Washington Investment Network (WIN), an investment adviser based in Bethesda, Maryland, as well as deal with WIN clients.  WIN is also charged with allowing Bolla to continue associating with the firm after the SEC had barred him from doing so.  Bollas wife, Susan Bolla, and his business partner, Robert Radano, are alleged to have aided and abetted the violations of the SECs bar order.  , The order barring Bolla from associating with any investment adviser was issued following a June 2000 enforcement action by the SEC in which Bolla was enjoined from violating the antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws.  <u>See</u> <u>SEC v. James L. Foster, Laurie F. Foster, Steven M. Bolla and William E. Busacker, Jr.</u>, Litigation Release No. 16567 (May 30, 2000); <u>In the Matter of James L. Foster et al.</u>, Securities Exchange Act Release No. 42963 (June 20, 2000).  In the June 2000 case, Bolla was ordered to pay a $10,000 penalty.  The courts order imposing the penalty noted that Bolla was not directed to pay a higher amount because he had demonstrated an inability to pay in sworn financial statements that he had submitted to the SEC., On May 9, 2002, in an action brought by the United States Attorney for the District of Columbia, Bolla pled guilty to federal criminal charges for making false statements in 1999 and 2000 to the SEC in violation of 18 U.S.C. Section 1001.  In pleading guilty, Bolla admitted that the financial statements he submitted to the SEC during its prior investigation against him underreported his income and assets, and contained other false information.  Bolla faces a maximum sentence in the criminal proceeding of five years imprisonment and a $250,000 fine.  <u>See</u> <u>United States v. Steven M. Bolla</u>, Litigation Release No. 17512 (May 9, 2002).  Sentencing in the criminal matter is scheduled for August 30, 2002., The SEC Complaint filed today charges that WIN committed fraud, assisted by the Bollas and by Radano, by failing to disclose Bollas bar and disciplinary history to the firms advisory clients while Bolla continued associating with the firm.  In addition, the Complaint charges that Bolla committed fraud by making material misrepresentations to one of his advisory clients regarding a private placement investment he was soliciting as an unregistered broker-dealer.  , The Complaint charges that Bolla continued to associate with WIN by managing the firms finances for nine months, acting as the investment adviser to firm clients for ten months and making business communications on behalf of the firm for three months following the SECs June 20, 2000 bar order against him.  Susan Bolla and Radano facilitated Bollas continued association with the firm.  The Complaint alleges that Susan Bolla, who had no previous investment advisory or other securities experience, was set up as the nominal co-owner of WIN in 1997 to conceal her husbands control of the firm.  The SEC charges Bolla and WIN with violating Section 203(f) of the Advisers Act (investment adviser bar), and charges Susan Bolla and Radano with aiding and abetting these violations., The Complaint further charges that while Bolla maintained his association with WIN subsequent to his bar, neither he, the firm, Susan Bolla nor Radano disclosed to the firms clients that Steven Bolla had been barred, or any other aspect of Steven Bollas disciplinary history.  The Complaint alleges that WINs failure to disclose Bollas bar and disciplinary history violated Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Advisers Act (investment adviser fraud).  By failing to make these disclosures on behalf of the firm, the Complaint charges Steven Bolla, Susan Bolla and Radano with aiding and abetting the firms violations of Sections 206(1) and (2)., The SECs Complaint also alleges that Steven Bolla violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act (securities fraud), Sections 10(b) (securities fraud) and 15(a) (broker-dealer registration) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Advisers Act by making material misrepresentations to one of his advisory clients regarding a private placement investment he was soliciting as an unregistered broker-dealer.  The Complaint charges Bolla with misrepresenting that his client would receive a discount for her investment and that he was not receiving compensation for selling her shares in the private placement., The SECs Complaint seeks injunctions against Steven Bolla from violating Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act and Section 203(f) of the Advisers Act.  The Complaint seeks injunctions against WIN from violating Sections 203(f) and 206(1) and (2) of the Advisers Act.  The Complaint also seeks injunctions against Susan Bolla and Radano from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 203(f) and 206(1) and (2) of the Advisers Act.

Durkin and John E. Orin, Jr. for a massive fraud that resulted in over $90 million in losses for their investment advisory clients.  The complaint alleges that the defendants violated their fiduciary duties as investment advisers and fraudulently purchased for their clients, including retirees, risky investments in an internet start up.  The clients lost virtually all their money.  Durkin, a resident of Westlake, Ohio, and Orin, a resident of Rocky River, Ohio, were president and vice president, respectively, of Cashel Management Co., Inc., a now-defunct investment adviser based in Cleveland.  , The Commission alleges that Durkin and Orin systematically invested most of their clients money in RxRemedy, Inc., a failing internet company, while making material misrepresentations to their clients about the safety and liquidity of their investments and, in many cases, made the investments against their clients express instructions.  RxRemedy later filed for bankruptcy resulting in an almost total loss for Durkin and Orins clients.  Further, the Complaint alleges that Durkin lost $7.5 million he took from his brothers Cashel account and his sister-in-laws Cashel account by making unauthorized options trades.  , Simultaneous with the filing of the complaint, Durkin and Orin have settled with the Commission.  Both consented, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, to the entry of Final Judgments and Orders of Permanent Injunction and Other Relief (Final Judgment) which will enjoin them from future violations of Section 206(1) and (2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The Final Judgments, however, waive payment of the disgorgement against Durkin and do not impose civil penalties against Durkin or Orin because of sworn representations they made to the Commission regarding their financial condition and because, in connection with their criminal convictions in June 2002, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio entered orders against them requiring them to make restitution to their injured clients.

FOR AUTHORIZING FOREIGN BRIBES, On July 30, 2002, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil injunctive action against two former officers of American Rice, Inc., Douglas A. Murphy and David G. Kay, alleging that they authorized over $500,000 in bribery payments to Haitian customs officials during 1998 and 1999, in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.  American Rice is a Houston, Texas based rice company.  The complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, alleges that Kay, with Murphys knowledge, authorized the bribes to illegally reduce American Rices import taxes by approximately $1.5 million.  , According to the complaint, in advance of certain rice shipments to Haiti between January 1998 and October 1999, Kay directed an American Rice employee to prepare false shipping records that underreported the tonnage of rice on the relevant vessels.  Haitian customs officials used the false records to clear the American Rice vessels through customs.  After the vessels cleared customs, Kay allegedly directed American Rice employees in Haiti pay cash bribes to certain customs officials.  To hide the payments, Kay then directed American Rices controller in Haiti to improperly record the bribery payments as routine business expenditures.  American Rice employees made at least 12 bribery payments totaling approximately $500,000.  In exchange, American Rice illegally avoided approximately $1.5 million in Haitian import taxes.  The complaint further alleges that Murphy was aware of the bribery scheme, but took no action to stop the payments.  A third individual, Lawrence H. Theriot, a former American Rice consultant, allegedly assisted  Kay and Murphy by monitoring the bribery scheme and exploring alternative arrangements., The complaint alleges that Kay violated Sections 30A and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act  of 1934 and Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1, and aided and abetted American Rices violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of the Exchange Act, that Murphy violated Section 30A of the Exchange Act and is liable, as a controlling person, for Kays violations of Sections 30A and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1, and that Theriot aided and abetted Kay and Murphys violations of Section 30A of the Exchange Act., In parallel criminal proceedings, the Department of Justice previously obtained indictments against Murphy and Kay.  On April 16, 2002, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas dismissed the indictments on the grounds that the payments at issue were not made to obtain or retain business in Haiti, as required by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.  A notice of appeal has been filed by the Department of Justice.  The Commission wishes to thank the United States Department of Justice for its assistance in this matter., ]"

The Commissions complaint, filed July 31 in San Francisco federal district court, alleges that Lefebvre, Herula and others participated in a fraudulent scheme that raised at least $40 million from investors within the past month.  One of the investors is an entity owned or controlled by members of the Coors family, founders of the Adolph Coors Company.  The courts order, issued August 1, froze at least $36 million held in various brokerage accounts controlled by the defendants., 	The Commission alleges in its complaint that Lefebvre falsely promised investors exorbitant returns, such as a 100% return per week, through a fraudulent prime bank trading program that purportedly invested in bank or other financial institution instruments rated AA or better.  Lefebvre also falsely claimed that he was federally licensed to trade such instruments.  According to the Commissions complaint, these representations were false because prime bank trading programs are wholly fictitious.  The Commissions complaint alleges that Lefebvre acted through two entities owned or controlled by him and/or Herula  RMO Assets Management and Watch Hill Capital Management -- and that Herula aided and abetted Lefebvres violations of the federal securities laws.  The complaint further alleges that, within the past several weeks, Lefebvre, Herula, and Herulas wife, Rhode Island attorney Mary Lee Capalbo, spent at least $4 million in investor funds on luxury items such as cars, jewelry, and large hotel bills.  They also used the money to pay personal expenses, such as doctors bills and Capalbos Rhode Island bar association fees., 	Herula and Capalbo are defendants in a prior action filed by the Commission in Rhode Island federal district court on April 1, 2002.  In that case, which involved a separate prime bank investment scheme, the court entered preliminary injunctions against Herula, Capalbo and others, restraining them from violating the antifraud provisions of the securities laws or accepting investor funds.  The Commission alleges that Herula and Capalbo engaged in the activity involving the new fraudulent scheme at a time when they were already subject to the prior orders. , 	The Commission alleged in its complaint that (i) defendants Lefebvre, RMO Assets Management, and Watch Hill Capital Management violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and (ii) Herula aided and abetted the above violations of the Exchange Act.  The Commission also named as a relief defendant Capalbo, who received at least $3 million of the above investor funds to which she has no legitimate claim.  The Commission obtained entry of an order temporarily restraining Lefebvre, RMO Assets Management, Watch Hill Capital Management, and Herula from directly or indirectly continuing to violate the federal securities laws, an asset freeze against all the defendants and the relief defendant, and other emergency relief.  The courts order freezes at least $36 million in funds held in various brokerage accounts controlled by the defendants.  The hearing on the Commissions motion for a preliminary injunction is scheduled for August 16 at 10:00 a.m. , 	Unscrupulous promoters continue to victimize the public with Prime Bank schemes.

Ardian Finance Group et al</u>.  C.A. No. CV 02 4386 (E.D.N.Y.), The Securities and Exchange Commission filed an emergency injunctive action today in the United States Court for the Eastern District of New York alleging that Ardian Finance Group (Ardian) conducted a fraudulent unregistered offering that raised over $1.2 million from at least 70 investors. Vladislav Tartakovsky, the President of Ardian, orchestrated this fraudulent offering, and he retained Michael Yeninas and Michael Green to solicit investors to purchase Ardian securities.  Ardian, Tartakovsky, Yeninas and Green all made material misrepresentations to investors to induce them to purchase Ardian securities.  The Commissions complaint names the following defendants:, , , , , , Specifically, the Complaint alleges the following:  From approximately October 2001 through the present, Tartakovsky orchestrated a fraudulent unregistered offering of Ardian securities through which Ardian raised approximately $1.2 million from at least 70 investors.   To facilitate this Offering, Ardian and Tartakovsky retained Yeninas and Green and other salespersons to offer and sell Ardian securities to investors., , In connection with its Offering, Ardian provided private offering memoranda (POM), which Tartakovsky helped prepare, to investors.  The POM contained material misrepresentations.  For instance, Ardian claimed that it had a matching fund commitment by an unrelated third party financing institution to provide funds to finance Ardians operations.   This representation was false.  Ardian had no such agreement.  In its POM, Ardian also claimed that William Marconi (Marconi) and Michael Rehzets (Rehzets) were currently serving as officers and/or directors of Ardian.  This representation too was false.  To date, neither Rehzets nor Marconi has performed any functions for Ardian., , In connection with their efforts to solicit investors, Yeninas and Green also concocted a variety of purported facts to persuade investors to purchase Ardian securities.  Among other things, Yeninas and Green told investors that (i) Ardian was planning an initial public offering (IPO) on a date certain (i.e. July 2002), and (ii) investors could sell their stock the first day Ardian stock was publicly traded at a specific price (i.e. $5-7 per share), which was a significant premium over the $2.00 to $2.50 per share that the investor was paying to purchase the stock in the Offering.  These representations were false.  In fact, Ardian had not taken any steps to conduct an IPO., Additionally, Yeninas told investors that Ardian was financing companies involved in the Ground Zero clean-up following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.  This representation was false.  Ardian provided no such financing., , The Commission alleges that through this conduct, Ardian, Tartakovsky, Yeninas and Green violated Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Additionally, Green violated Section 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act.  In addition to expedited relief, including a temporary restraining order, the Commission is seeking permanent injunctions, and disgorgement and prejudgment interest against all of the defendants.  The Commission is also seeking civil penalties against Tartakovsky, Yeninas and Green.  Additionally, the Complaint names JBS Investments, Inc., a New Jersey corporation with its principal place of business in Brooklyn, New York, as a relief defendant.  , For further information contact:  Mark Schonfeld, Associate Regional Director (646) 428-1650 or Kay Lackey, Assistant Regional Director (646) 428-1790., ]"

The Commission alleges that the four defendants participated in a scheme to sell stock to the public without registering with the Commission, thus allowing the defendants and other corporate insiders to sell millions of shares of stock into the public market without disclosing their control over the companies.  The defendants, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, consented to the entry of permanent injunctions against them and agreed to pay $271,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest and civil penalties., Named in the Commissions complaint are Gary Stephen Joiner of Boulder, Colorado; Grant W. Peck of Boulder, Colorado; Mark Allen DiSalvo of Shell Beach, California; and Dean Fredrick Sessions of Broomfield, Colorado., According to the Commissions complaint, the defendants were in the business of creating shell companies -- also known as blank check companies -- with no operations and no existence aside from publicly traded stock that the defendants controlled.  The defendants created the shell companies for the purpose of merging them with privately held companies in a process known as a reverse merger.  Through the reverse mergers, the privately held companies became publicly traded without registering with the Commission.  While such mergers are not illegal, stock held by insiders or affiliates after the merger generally cannot be resold absent registration.  Despite this, following each reverse merger, the defendants personally sold hundreds of thousands of shares of stock to the public in unregistered transactions.  They also sold several million shares to persons affiliated with the private companies, who then resold the stock to the public in unregistered transactions.  Investors bought stock in the newly merged companies, unaware that the vast majority of the stock was being sold by the defendants or other corporate insiders to whom the defendants had transferred their stock., The complaint alleges that the defendants scheme resulted in the creation of two publicly traded companies - M &amp; A West, Inc. (MAWI), a purported Internet incubator based in San Bruno, California; and Workfire.com, a related Internet business.  In September 2001, the Commission charged MAWI and various related individuals with fraud, alleging that the company was a sham and that its supposed revenue from operations in fact derived primarily from illegal stock sales by corporate insiders.  The Office of the United States Attorney indicted Frank Thomas Eck, III and Zahra R.

Based on the restitution orders, the final judgments in the Commissions case do not order Creevy or Hollandsworth to pay disgorgement of their illicit gains.  Moreover, based on the criminal sanctions imposed against Creevy, including a $250,000 fine, and on Hollandsworths sworn statement of financial disclosure, the final judgments in the Commissions case do not impose civil penalties against Creevy or Hollandsworth.    , The Commissions complaint in the case, which was filed in February 1999 and amended in September 2001, charged Creevy, Hollandsworth, and two other former Donnkenny executives with engaging in a wide-ranging financial fraud from at least early 1994 through August 1996, and with illegally selling Donnkenny stock before the fraud was disclosed to the public.  The complaint alleges that these individuals caused Donnkenny to improperly recognize revenue by:  holding open quarters to book out-of-period shipments; recording revenue on orders without shipping the goods to customers; recording fictitious sales from non-existent contract work and through false journal entries; and hiding inventory purportedly sold in fictitious sales from the detection of the auditors during the companys annual physical inventory count.  <i>See</i> Litigation Release No. 16051 (Feb. 2, 1999).   , One of the defendants, former Donnkenny assistant controller Kymberlee W.

Hammonds, and Barry V. Reed were charged by the Prosecuting Attorney of Boone County, Missouri, Kevin Crane, and the Missouri Commissioner of Securities with fraudulently offering and selling unregistered securities in Missouri and for employing a sales agent without registration.  The SEC cooperated with the investigation by the Securities Division of the office of the Missouri Secretary of State, Matt Blunt, of the allegedly unlawful conduct occurring in Missouri that led to the indictment of Hammonds and Reed., The SEC brought civil charges against Hammonds and Reed in November 2001.  In the SECs civil action, Hammonds and Reed, along with two Nevada corporations, Texon Energy Corp. and Lonestar Petroleum Corp., were charged with violating the registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  Texon purportedly was in the business of acquiring oil and natural gas wells.  Between 1998 and November 2001, when the SEC brought civil charges, $1.25 million was raised from about 65 investors nationwide.  Investors were sold preferred shares in the company and were promised a dividend of 12% per year on their investment.  Reed was Texons president, and the SEC alleged that Hammonds was Texons vice president., The SECs complaint charged that Hammonds, 61, formerly of Inglewood, CA and Reed, 57, of Las Vegas, NV, through Texon and Lonestar, operated a Ponzi-like scheme that made dividend payments to existing investors with money raised from new investors.  The SEC alleged that Texon solicited investors through a cold-call telemarketing campaign, falsely telling investors that its dividend-paying stock was a good way to increase income and that Texon was a profitable business and a safe investment.  The SEC alleged that Texon was secretly operated by Hammonds even though the public was told the company was based in Las Vegas and Reed was its president.  The SEC charged that Texon received mail and phone calls in Las Vegas that were simply routed to Hammonds in Inglewood.    , In 1994, Hammond was enjoined by the SEC for his part in a similar oil and gas fraud in which investors were also falsely promised a 12% return.  In 1996, Hammonds was barred by the SEC from the securities industry.  Hammonds involvement in Texon was not disclosed to investors., Through a court-appointed receiver, Texon and Lonestar, without admitting or denying the SECs allegations, consented to the entry of a judgment, entered on July 8, 2002 by the Federal District Court in Los Angeles, permanently enjoining them from future violations of the antifraud and securities registration provisions of the federal securities laws. , The SECs civil case against Hammonds and Reed is still pending. ]"

Horne, Chairman and CEO of Watts Industries of North Andover, Massachusetts, received a call in May 1999 from an investment banker inquiring whether Watts Industries would be interested in acquiring Central Sprinkler Corporation, indicating that an auction process was underway and Watts would need to move quickly if interested.  According to the complaint, Horne said that Watts might be interested in acquiring Central Sprinkler and agreed to receive the confidentiality agreement Watts would need to execute to receive more detailed information about Central Sprinkler.

According to the complaint, Horne never informed anyone at Watts of his trading, which violated a Watts written policy prohibiting trading in any companys securities on the basis of nonpublic information.  Shortly thereafter, when Tyco publicly announced its acquisition of Central Sprinkler, Horne sold his stock for a profit of $317,971.    , In its complaint, the SEC charges Horne with securities fraud in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, based on illegal insider trading.

Norville and Mabel R. Norville, all of Central City, Colorado, for violations of the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws.  American Prometheus Corp. is a company purportedly in the business of developing a Holiday Inn franchise hotel and casino in Central City, where limited stakes gaming is legal.  James Norville was the companys former president and director, and his wife, Mabel Norville, remains a director of the company and serves as its secretary.    , The Complaint alleges that between April 1997 and April 2000, the Norvilles offered more than $3.6 million in securities and raised approximately $1.1 million from 79 investors nationwide through a series of five American Prometheus offerings and through the Norvilles sale of their own shares of American Prometheus stock.  The Complaint claims that in American Prometheus offering materials and oral presentations to investors, the Norvilles failed to disclose criminal securities fraud charges pending against James Norville relating to one of the Norvilles previous companies, James Norvilles subsequent guilty plea to one count of securities fraud in the same matter, or the existence of an administrative order prohibiting James Norville from selling securities in Wisconsin.  In addition, the Complaint alleges that, contrary to the representations in the offering materials that proceeds would be used to develop the casino project, the Norvilles then misappropriated investor funds for their personal use.  Finally, the Complaint contends that American Prometheus securities offerings and the Norvilles sale of their own American Prometheus stock were not registered transactions with the Commission and were not exempt from registration.  , The Complaint alleges that American Prometheus violated Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Fla., filed August 15, 2002), On August 15, 2002, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed separate lawsuits in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida arising from four schemes.  According to the complaints, in three of the schemes, defendants made numerous materially false and misleading statements in reports filed with the Commission; the fourth scheme involves a pump-and-dump of a companys publicly traded stock.  Most of these charges arise from a two-year undercover FBI sting operation and, simultaneously in related criminal prosecutions, the United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of Florida (USAO) announced the indictments of fifty-eight defendants.   , THE FRAUDULENT FILING SCHEMES, In three schemes related to proposed fraudulent sales of stock to a purported European-based investment fund (the Fund), the Commission alleges that Rhino Ecosystems, Inc., COI Solutions, Inc., and Uncommon Media Group, Inc., violated the federal securities laws by filing materially false annual reports or false registration statements with the Commission.  Also named in these complaints were seven individuals:  Charles Cini, Mark Wiertzema, Gordon Novak, Robert Wilder, Lawrence Gallo, Douglas Rasberry, and Melvin Levine. , The Commission alleges that in each scheme the individual defendants, most of whom are officers or affiliates of the issuer defendants, conspired to sell securities to the Fund in exchange for millions of dollars in kickbacks to be secreted in offshore accounts.  The securities were to be issued either directly by the issuer defendant through bogus S-8 registration statements on file with the Commission or, in the Uncommon Media scheme, were to come from several offshore corporate nominees maintained by an undisclosed control person.  In reality, there was no Fund and its purported representative was an undercover FBI agent.  The sales of securities were never completed, but, in anticipation of the fraudulent sales, the issuer defendants made filings with the Commission that contained material misrepresentations and/or omissions in violation of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  Certain defendants in the Rhino Ecosystems and Uncommon Media schemes are also charged with violating various filing requirements of the federal securities laws.   , THE PUMP AND DUMP SCHEME, The Commission also filed suit against Jeffery R. Senger, Brad M. Nirenberg and Norman F. Piatti, alleging that they engaged in a scheme to pump-and-dump Lifekeepers International, Inc.s (Lifekeepers) common stock, which was publicly-traded until the Commission suspended its trading in February of 2000.  The Complaint alleges that defendants attempted to inflate artificially the price of Lifekeepers stock by issuing press releases and other public documents that contained materially false and misleading information concerning, among other things, Lifekeepers operations and expected financial results.  Defendants are charged by the Commission with violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws, and Senger has also been indicted by the USAO as part of the FBIs sting operation. , The Commissions complaints seek permanent injunctions and civil penalties against defendants alleging the following:  , , , , , , , These investigations are ongoing.

Morrison of West Hartford, Connecticut, the former executive vice president of American Commercial Financial Corporation (ACFC), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Boston-based HPSC, Inc.   The Complaint alleges that Morrison caused HPSC to materially overstate the results of its operations when he improperly diverted more than $4.7 million of corporate assets to Mildred K. Miller, a purported ACFC factoring customer.  The Complaint alleges that beginning in 1997 and continuing until May 22, 2002, Morrison concealed the diversion of funds to Miller by regularly providing fictitious financial reports regarding ACFC to ACFCs president, HPSC senior management, and HPSCs outside auditors.  Miller, who is named as a relief defendant in the Complaint, is last known to have resided in Hartford, Connecticut. , According to the Commissions Complaint, Morrison took advantage of his complete control over ACFCs factoring business to divert more than $4.7 million from ACFC to Miller during a five-year period.  The Complaint alleges that through purported factoring transactions directed by Morrison, ACFC received the right to collect accounts receivables owed to Miller.  In exchange, Morrison authorized payments to Miller.  The Complaint alleges, however, that invoices substantiating the accounts receivables sold by Miller to ACFC were either uncollectible, fictitious, or non-existent.  The Complaint also alleges that Morrison was able to cover up the fraud because he was in charge of ACFCs accounting department, had responsibility for ACFCs books and records, and had authority to disperse funds from ACFCs accounts.  Further, the Complaint alleges that fraudulent financial information provided by Morrison to HPSC was incorporated in the parent companys Forms 10-K and Forms 10-Q filed with the Commission for the periods ended December 31, 1997 through March 31, 2002 and, as a result, HPSC materially overstated its net income and earnings per share by between 4% and 112% during the affected filing periods. , The Commissions Complaint alleges that Morrison violated the antifraud, internal controls, and record-keeping provisions of the federal securities laws, including Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder.  The Commissions Complaint seeks a permanent injunction against Morrison preventing future violations of the federal securities laws, disgorgement of any ill-gotten gains plus pre-judgment interest, civil penalties and an officer and director bar.

Slocum, Jr. and Jeffrey L. Gordon, and their Newport, Rhode Island-based registered investment advisory firm, Slocum, Gordon &amp; Co. (SGC).  The Commissions complaint, filed in Rhode Island  federal district court, alleges that, beginning as early as 1988 and continuing through mid-2000, the defendants illegally diverted more than $1 million in short-term trading profits from SGCs advisory clients to SGCs own account for the benefit of SGC, Slocum and Gordon., The Commissions complaint alleges that Slocum and Gordon used accounts that improperly mixed their clients assets with SGCs assets.  According to the Commissions complaint, the improper mixing of assets enabled Slocum and Gordon to engage in a practice known as cherry-picking, where they allocated profitable trades to themselves and non-profitable trades to clients.  Specifically, Slocum and Gordon would often purchase stocks without identifying whether the stocks were bought for the firm or for clients.  They then waited to assign trades until just before the settlement date (usually three business days after purchase) so they could first determine whether the firm could make money for itself.  The Commissions complaint alleges that, in many cases when the stock price went up on or before the settlement date, Slocum and Gordon sold profitable stocks that had been intended for clients and credited the profits to SGC.  In other instances when the stock price had fallen before the settlement date, they assigned stocks originally intended for SGC to clients instead.  According to the Commissions complaint, as a result of these practices, Slocum and Gordon enjoyed extraordinary success in their trading for SGC.  For example, Slocum and Gordon realized a profit on nearly all of their trades for SGC from 1996 until 2000, generating more than $1 million in profits.  As principals of SGC, Slocum and Gordon personally benefited from the scheme.  The Commissions complaint alleges that defendants practice of appropriating short-term trading profits for SGC instead of clients and assigning non-profitable trades to clients instead of SGC constituted a breach of their fiduciary duty to the clients., The Commission alleged in its complaint that SGC, Slocum and Gordon violated the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) [Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder].

According to the Complaint, Scoggins stock picks were derived solely from his undisclosed financial and other contractual obligations to the companies whose stocks he touted, rather than from any independent analysis.  The Complaint further alleges that Scoggin failed to disclose that the issuers of the stocks he featured were the source of his compensation.  As a result, Scoggin purposefully misled investors.  The Complaint also alleges that Scoggin engaged in illegal scalping in two stocks featured in Stock Talk.  That is, he advised his readers to buy two different stocks he was independently analyzing, with the undisclosed intent to begin selling his own positions in those stocks., The Complaint alleges that Scoggin was the sole author and editor of all the content in all editions of the Stock Talk newsletter.

The Complaint alleges Scoggin willfully withheld material information that would have alerted a reasonable investor to Scoggins possible bias and the consequent need to discount Scoggins rosy predictions about the future of these companies., The Complaint further alleges that Scoggin engaged in scalping with two stocks featured in the Stock Talk newsletters.  Scoggin issued BUY and STRONG BUY recommendations, only to begin selling those stocks from his account shortly thereafter.

Without admitting or denying the allegations of the Complaint, Kopper has agreed to be enjoined permanently from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, and to be barred permanently from acting as an officer or director of a public company.  As part of the settlement agreement, which is subject to the approval of the U.S. District Court, Kopper will disgorge and forfeit a total of approximately $12 million.  The Commission brought this action in coordination with the Justice Departments Enron Task Force, which filed related criminal charges against Kopper.  Kopper agreed to enter a guilty plea in connection with those charges and to cooperate with the governments continuing investigation.  , As alleged in the Complaint, starting in at least early 1997, Kopper and others used complex structures, straw men, hidden payments, and secret loans to create the appearance that certain entities that Kopper and others at Enron funded and controlled were independent of Enron.  This allowed Enron to move its interests in these entities off its balance sheet when, in fact, those interests should have been consolidated into Enrons financial statements.  As a result, Enrons financial statements did not properly reflect Enrons interest in these entities, thereby enabling Enron to engage in various transactions with these entities that were designed to improve its apparent financial results.  In addition, Kopper and others exploited the fiction that these entities were independent of Enron to misappropriate millions of dollars representing undisclosed fees and other illegal profits.  , Specifically, the Commissions Complaint further alleges as follows:, , , , The Commissions investigation is continuing.,  , , <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp17692.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr17692.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Hughes, eConnects CEO -- and one of eConnects major shareholders.  The Honorable Nora M. Manella, United States District Judge for the Central District of California, issued the preliminary injunction order and continued an asset freeze against eConnect on its illegal profits obtained from violating the federal securities laws.  The Commissions complaint, filed on August 7, 2002, charged Hughes and eConnect in connection with a scheme to artificially inflate eConnects stock price using false press releases and false statements on its websites.  The Commission had previously sued both eConnect, based in San Pedro, CA (trading symbol: ECNT), and Hughes, age 54, of Rancho Palos Verdes, CA in 2000 for issuing false press releases.    , The Commissions recent complaint alleges that since July 10, 2002, Hughes and eConnect have issued false and misleading press releases and posted false statements on eConnects websites.  Among other things, the statements misrepresented a purported $20 million investment in AA rated bonds eConnect claimed to have received, a stock repurchase program it claimed to have initiated, and a purported $964,000 purchase order for its key product (the eCashPad) it claimed to have received.  The misrepresentations caused the price and trading volume of eConnects stock to increase by over 500 percent.  As a result of this conduct, the Commission suspended trading in eConnect stock on July 25, 2002.  , The Commissions complaint also charged that two major shareholders -- Richard Epstein of Tampa, Florida and his company, Alliance Equities, Inc., of Coral Springs, Florida -- failed to report their recent sales of over 74 million eConnect shares although they were required to do so by the federal securities laws.  Epstein and Alliance Equities obtained over $770,000 in profits from those trades, which the Court also froze in its preliminary injunction order., The Commission charged Hughes and eConnect with securities fraud pursuant to Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. § 78j(B), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5, and charged Hughes, Epstein and Alliance with failing to report to the Commission certain transactions in eConnects stock pursuant to Sections 13(d) and 16(a) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 78m(d) and 78p(a), and Rules 16a-3, 13d-1 and 13d-2, 17 C.F.R. § 240.16a-3, 13d-1 and 13d-2.

The Commissions complaint alleges that Buzzelli and Dutton fraudulently sold unregistered shares of NorthStar common stock to over 200 investors nationwide, raising approximately $1 million.  According to the complaint, Buzzelli and Dutton, directly and indirectly, falsely represented to investors that NorthStar had over $10 million in assets, that major defense contractors were interested in its purportedly patent pending computer cooling system, and that the company had multi-million dollar contracts with large, publicly traded telecommunications companies.  The complaint further alleges that Buzzelli and Dutton misappropriated investor funds to acquire personal property and to pay personal debts.  In addition, the complaint charges that NorthStar filed a registration statement with the Commission that contained false and misleading statements concerning the compensation paid to its officers and directors, and the existence of an ongoing unregistered securities offering.

Namer, a financial advisor based in Memphis, Tennessee, was found guilty by a federal jury of 93 counts of conspiracy, securities fraud, mail fraud, wire fraud, money laundering, and tax evasion.  The <a href=/litigation/complaints/indict17696.htm>indictment</a> charged that Namer, 55, masterminded a multi-faceted fraudulent scheme from 1994 through 1996 involving the sale of approximately $35 million of corporate notes to hundreds of investors located throughout the nation.  The jury also rendered a separate verdict requiring Namer to forfeit $34.6 million in cash, his house, and shares of stock that he acquired with ill-gotten gains.  He has been incarcerated since September 28, 2000.  Namer, who has a prior criminal fraud conviction, faces a potential sentence of up to 980 years.  Sentencing has been scheduled for November 14, 2002.  The case was prosecuted by the United States Attorneys Office for the Western District of Tennessee.  , Through its verdict, the jury found that Namer bribed two securities brokers and an insurance company executive; fraudulently sold approximately $23 million of corporate notes that he claimed were insured when there was in fact no insurance in place; diverted almost $2 million of note proceeds to purchase, for his own personal benefit, a fifty-percent interest in a securities brokerage firm; and evaded federal income taxes on approximately $600,000 in income over three years., More specifically, as charged in the indictment:, , , , , , , , Before the trial, six of Namers co-conspirators entered guilty pleas and agreed to cooperate with the prosecution:  Craig Colwell; Bruce Barbers; Richard Quackenbush; Michael Ploshnick, the former president of Meyers Pollock Robbins; Larry Baresel, Namers in-house attorney; and Frederick J. Smith, the owner of Associated Insurance Agency in Boston, Massachusetts.  All of these cooperating witnesses, except Smith, testified at trial against Namer.  Mr. Barbers was previously sentenced to a prison term of 68 months; sentencing of the others was delayed until the completion of the trial.  , To assist in the investigation and prosecution of the case, the Commission detailed two SEC trial attorneys to the U.S. Attorneys Office in Memphis.  In 1997, the Commission also filed a related civil enforcement action against Namer, Meyers Pollock Robbins, Inc., Michael Ploshnick, and others, which has been stayed pending the disposition of the criminal case.  In its civil case, the Commission obtained a court-ordered freeze of the $1,975,000 that Namer paid towards a purchase of a fifty percent interest in Meyers Pollock Robbins.

Boron LePore, formerly based in Fair Lawn, New Jersey, was a company that provided marketing and other services to the pharmaceutical industry.  (On June 25, 2002, Cardinal Health, Inc., acquired Boron LePore in a tender offer.)  The Commissions complaint alleges that Foti sold Boron LePore stock on February 2-3, 1999, while in possession of materially adverse non-public information about Boron LePores financial condition.  Foti agreed to settle the Commissions action without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations.  Foti agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, and to pay $533,686, including $288,700 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and $244,986 as a civil penalty.    , The Commissions complaint alleges the following:, , In October 1998, Boron LePore announced the loss of its largest client, Glaxo Welcome, Inc.  During January and into early February 1999, Foti learned that Boron LePore was having difficulty replacing the revenue lost from Glaxo.  During January and early February, Foti also learned negative information concerning Boron LePores earnings for the quarters ended December 31, 1998, and March 31, 1999.  For instance, at an Executive Committee meeting on January 27, 1999, Foti learned that Boron LePores two largest divisions projected revenue for the first quarter of 1999 that were significantly below prior projections.  , On February 2-3, 1999, Foti sold 20,900 shares of Boron LePore stock at prices between $30.00 and $31.00 per share.  On February 4, 1999, Boron LePore issued a press release stating, among other things, that: (1) its fourth quarter earnings were $0.01 short of analysts expectations; and (2) Boron LePore was uncertain about its future earnings.  After the press release was issued, the price of Boron LePores common stock fell $13.55 per share, from $28.75 per share, its February 3<sup>rd</sup> closing price, to $17.50 per share, its February 5<sup>th</sup> closing price.  As a result of his insider trading, Foti avoided losses of at least $244,985., In its complaint, the Commission charged that Foti engaged in insider trading and violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.

In a civil action filed today in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, the Commission charged three additional former Critical Path executives with fraudulently participating in the scheme to inflate the companys revenues and earnings for fiscal 2000.  Named in the new complaint are William H. Rinehart, 38, the former head of Critical Paths North and Latin America sales forces; Jonathan A. Beck, 33, a former vice president of sales at Critical Path; and Kevin P. Clark, 37, a former regional vice president of sales at the company.   The complaint also charges Beck and Clark with insider trading in Critical Path stock during the financial fraud.  Rinehart and Clark have reached settlements with the Commission.      , Also today, the United States Attorneys Office for the Northern District of California announced criminal charges against Beck and Clark.  , In April 2001, Critical Path restated its financial results for the third quarter 2000 and revised previously-announced results for the fourth quarter and full year 2000.   Earlier this year the Commission instituted and settled cease-and-desist proceedings against Critical Path (Exchange Act Release No. 34-45393) and filed a settled civil injunctive action against Critical Paths former president David A. Thatcher and a former vice president of sales, Timothy J. Ganley (Litigation Release No. 17353).  The Commission also suspended Thatcher from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant (Exchange Act Release No. 45683).    , The complaint filed today alleges that during 2000 and early 2001 William Rinehart directed his sales force to arrange certain transactions for which Critical Path improperly recorded revenue of approximately $6.3 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000.  Two of these transactions were fictitious.  Rinehart issued side letters that allowed a third customer, in its sole discretion, to terminate a transaction with Critical Path. <b> </b>In early 2001, Rinehart signed a letter to Critical Paths auditors that stated falsely that all of the companys sales were bona fide.  Jonathan Beck participated in one of the fraudulent transactions, for which Critical Path improperly recorded revenue of approximately $2.125 million.

(Case No. CV02-6695 RSWL (Ex)) (C.D. Cal.), <b><u>COMMISSION HALTS ONGOING $3.8 MILLION OIL AND GAS WELL TELEMARKETING SCHEME</u></b>, On August 27, 2002, the Securities and Exchange Commission obtained a temporary restraining order halting a $3.8 million securities fraud scheme run by Shoreline Development Company and four individuals.  , The Commissions complaint alleges that since 2000, the defendants have scammed over $3.8 million from investors, purportedly for investments in oil and gas wells.  The defendants include: Shoreline Development Co., a Delaware company, headquartered in Costa Mesa, California; Todd J. Taylor, 36; Derek K. Gradwell, 29; Paul A. Barrios III, 40; and Dennis P. OConnell, 47, all of Orange County, California.  Taylor and Barrios are repeat securities law violators.  In 1999, in a prior case brought by the Commission, Taylor was ordered by a federal district court not to sell securities without registering with the Commission as a broker-dealer.  In 2000, Barrios was the subject of a cease-and-desist order issued by the Commission suspending him for twelve months from association with any broker or dealer. , In its complaint, the Commission alleges that during the offering, Shoreline, Taylor and Gradwell made misrepresentations about the performance of Shorelines wells; a purported business relationship with El Paso Field Services; and their use of investor funds.  These defendants concealed their misappropriation of more than $1.2 million to pay for lavish vacations, a wedding and honeymoon, a vacation home, gambling debts, customized motorcycles and other luxury items., The United States District Court for the Central District of California: (1) granted the Commissions application for a temporary restraining order and appointment of a receiver; (2) froze the assets of the defendants; (3) prohibited the destruction of documents by the defendants; and (4) ordered accountings from the defendants.  A hearing on whether a preliminary injunction should be issued against the defendants is scheduled for September 6, 2002. , The Commission obtained an order temporarily restraining Shoreline, Taylor and Gradwell from committing securities fraud in violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act).  The Courts order also temporarily restrains Shoreline, Taylor, Gradwell, Barrios and OConnell from violating the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act.  The Courts order also temporarily restrains OConnell from committing violations of the broker-dealer registration provisions of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act.  , In addition to the interim relief granted on August 27, 2002, the Commission seeks a final judgment against all the defendants enjoining them from future violations of the securities and broker-dealer registration provisions, as well as the antifraud provisions, ordering the defendants to disgorge all ill-gotten gains, and assessing civil penalties against them. , Furthermore, the Commission also sought and obtained an order temporarily freezing the assets of relief defendants: Epic Consulting Services; Coastal Resources, Inc.; Northstar Acquisitions and Holdings, Inc.; Shoreline Holdings and Acquisitions, Inc.; and Spartan Consulting, Inc., who together received more than $1.3 million in cash from Shoreline during the scheme.  The Commission seeks a final judgment against these relief defendants, ordering them to return all related earnings.

Gaines, individually and d/b/a Wrigley Drive Partners and Morten Avenue Partners</u>, Civil Action No. CIV02-1685 PHX (PGR) (D. Ariz.)(complaint filed August 29, 2002)  , The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC or Commission) announced today that it filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona against Ira J. Gaines, a resident of Phoenix, Arizona, individually and d/b/a Wrigley Drive Partners and Morten Avenue Partners.  According to the SECs complaint, from September 1999 through March 2001, Gaines, through Wrigley and Morten, made fraudulent mini-tender offers to shareholders to purchase from them up to 1% of the outstanding stock of 287 public companies.  The SEC alleges that Gaines deceived the shareholders by falsely implying in his offers that he had the financial means to fund a maximum 1% tender, and by failing to disclose the following material facts: (1) Gaines offer price was below the prevailing market price; (2) Gaines reserved sole discretion to modify his offers, including the offer price and the offer period; and (3) Gaines could terminate his offers without notice, regardless of how many shareholders had tendered shares., According to the Commission, Gaines knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that the shareholders were not receiving this material information.   In the complaint, the Commission supports this allegation by pointing out that in 1999, Gaines agreed, in settled proceedings, to a Commission order against his company, IG Holdings, for virtually identical conduct.  <i>In the Matter of IG Holdings, Inc</i>., Exchange Act Release No. 41759 (August 19, 1999).  The Commission additionally alleges in its complaint that Gaines engaged in obstructionist tactics in connection with the Commission staffs investigation of the Wrigley/Morten matter., According to the Commission, the information that did not reach the shareholders would have alerted them to the unfair bargain Gaines was offering.  Illustrating this contention, the SEC alleges in its complaint that the shareholders tendered shares at a price that was, on average, 29% below the prevailing market price.  In further illustration of this contention, the SEC alleges that Gaines unilaterally extended offer periods to capitalize on rising trends in the market price of the targeted stock, and reduced his offer price or terminated offers to maintain his profit margin in the face of declining trends in the target stocks market price.  The SEC further alleges that Gaines unilateral actions harmed the tendering shareholders, while enriching Gaines in the approximate total amount of $275,000., The Commission alleges in its complaint that Gaines, through Wrigley and Morten, violated Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-1 thereunder.  In its complaint, the Commission requests that the court permanently enjoin Gaines from violating the antifraud and tender offer antifraud provisions of the Exchange Act, order Gaines to disgorge all monies derived from his fraudulent scheme, plus prejudgment interest, and impose against Gaines a civil money penalty.  ,  , , <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp17703.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr17703.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Carter settled the action without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint.  As part of the Final Judgment, the Court issued a permanent injunction prohibiting Carter from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.  The Court also ordered Carter to pay disgorgement of $12,816.47 plus prejudgment interest.  The Court, however, waived the payment of disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and did not impose a civil penalty, based upon Carters representations in his sworn financial statement and other documents submitted to the Commission., The Commissions complaint, filed on September 6, 2000, alleged that Carter disseminated tens of thousands of e-mails, identified as the Unity List e-mails, which contained materially false information regarding certain companies in which Carter had recently purchased stock.  The complaint further alleged that the false information concerned purported pending announcements by the profiled companies and information regarding the timing of Carters purchases and sales of the securities of the profiled companies.

Murphy is the former chief financial officer of Centennial Technologies, Inc. and was criminally convicted on June 1, 2000, in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts of multiple felonies involving a financial fraud at the company.  Murphys conviction resulted from his participation in a fraudulent scheme at Centennial to overstate the companys revenue, income, inventory, and fixed assets from the time of its initial public offering in April 1994 through the quarter ended December 31, 1996., The Commission also announced today that on April 29, 2002, the Honorable Patti B. Saris of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts entered a summary judgment in its civil action against Murphy and enjoined him from violating and from aiding and abetting violations of the antifraud, reporting, books and records, and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws.  Judge Saris also prohibited Murphy from acting as an officer or director of a public company for ten years and ordered him to pay a civil penalty of $150,000 for his violations. , The complaint alleged that between April 1994 and December 31, 1996, Murphy and Emanuel Pinez, Centennials former chief executive officer, with the assistance of others, orchestrated a massive fraud which made Centennial appear significantly more successful than it was.  Among other things, they caused Centennial to recognize revenue from invalid or nonexistent sales, to include fake items in inventory, and to make false additions to fixed assets.  As a result of these improper activities, Centennial overstated its earnings for this period by approximately $40 million.  Based upon the false statements about the companys profitability, the stock price increased significantly.  It rose 451% in 1996 alone, to $55.50 a share at the end of December, making it the best-performing issue on the NYSE for year.  On February 11, 1997, upon discovery of the financial irregularities at Centennial, the company announced that Pinez had been fired and Murphy relieved of his duties. Trading was halted in the companys stock; when it resumed on February 18, 1997, the price of Centennial stock had plunged to slightly over $3 a share.  The complaint charged Murphy with violations of § 17(a) of the Securities Act, §§ 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder, and aidingand abetting Centennials violations of §§ 13(a), 13 (b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder. , For further information, please <u>see</u> Litigation Release Nos. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr16725.htm>16725</a>, <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr16170.htm>16170</a>, <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr15818.txt>15818</a>, <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr15605.txt>15605</a>, <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr15548.txt>15548</a>, <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr15405.txt>15405</a>, <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr15399.txt>15399</a>, <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr15295.txt>15295</a>, and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr15258.txt>15258</a>.,  , <!--<P><IMG SRC=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=9 ALT= BORDER=0>  <A href=/litigation/complaints/comp17705.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</A></P>--><!-- End text -->,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr17705.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Fleming, Jr. (Fleming), in what the Commission alleges was the fraudulent, unregistered offering of shares of Fargo Holdings, Inc. (Fargo).  Fleming, age 29, resides in Staten Island, New York.  The amended complaint (Complaint) also names each of the defendants -- Michael I. Nnebe (Nnebe), Nelson C. Walker (Walker), Steven S. Bocchino, and Daniel M. Coyle, Jr. -- and the relief defendant -- Luis Colon, Jr. -- who were charged in the Commissions initial Complaint filed on June 12, 2001.  The defendants were charged with violations of the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws, and the relief defendant was charged with receiving proceeds of the fraud., According to the Complaint, Fargo, which purported to be a company providing financial services and blue jeans manufacturing, actually engaged in no legitimate operations at all.  The Complaint alleges that the defendants induced the investing public to buy shares of Fargo by making a series of false statements, including that Fargo would be conducting an initial public offering (IPO).  The Complaint alleges that the defendants defrauded at least 118 investors of at least $2 million.  , As to Fleming, the Complaint alleges that from November 1998 through November 1999, Fleming cold called investors using the alias Steve Wilson, and induced investors to purchase Fargo stock by making numerous false or misleading statements about Fargo, including that Fargo: (a) would be imminently conducting an IPO which would allow investors to resell their Fargo stock for a substantial profit; (b) would be listed on the New York Stock Exchange or the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation system; and (c) manufactured blue jeans at a plant in Honduras.

Judge Jackson also ordered Bolla to pay a $20,000 fine and restitution to the Commission of $90,000.  Following his incarceration, Bolla is to be placed on supervisory release for a period of three years.  , Bolla, the former president of Security Financial, Inc., an investment advisory firm, had pleaded guilty on May 9, 2002 to a one-count information charging him with violating 18 U.S.C.

In the final judgment in that case, United States District Judge Thomas A. Flannery specifically noted that Bolla was not directed to pay additional amounts as a civil penalty because of his demonstrated inability to pay a higher amount, as shown by sworn financial statements Bolla had furnished to the SEC.

Bolla improperly failed to report these assets to the SEC.  Bolla also failed to disclose to the SEC income of more than $50,000 per month during the relevant period.  In addition, in a February 5, 2000 declaration to the SEC, Bolla claimed that he had less than $4,000 in cash assets during the reporting period.  In fact, as of January 31, 2000 he had more than $816,000 in money fund shares and $98,000 worth of securities in the account in his wifes name, and on February 3, 2000, he deposited an additional $128,000 into the account.  Bolla also failed to disclose the existence of various securities and bank accounts, as well as more than 40 transfers of more than $1,000 that he was required to report., In a separate matter, on July 31, 2002, the Commission charged Bolla with securities fraud and with violating the June 2000 Commission order barring Bolla from associating with an investment adviser.  <i>SEC v.

Hughes was indicted by a grand jury impaneled by the United States Attorneys Office for the Central District of California on seven criminal charges, including three counts of fraud under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, three counts of wire fraud and one count of contempt. The indictment alleges that, since at least July 19, 2002, Hughes has engaged in a fraudulent scheme by issuing false and misleading public statements - specifically press releases and website content - that artificially inflated the price of eConnect, whose stock was then publicly quoted on the Over-The-Counter Bulletin Board.  The press releases and website content falsely claimed that eConnect had received a $20 million investment in AA asset-backed bonds, that eConnect had begun a stock repurchase program of its shares and that eConnect had received a $964,000 purchase order for its principal product, suggesting that a legitimate company had a relationship to the company that actually placed the order.  In reality, the indictment alleged:  (1) the bonds were not AA rated or registered so that they could be traded publicly; (2) there was no stock repurchase program; and (3) there was no relationship between the company that placed the $964,000 purchase order and the legitimate company identified in the press release.

Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, Dunlap and Kersh agreed to the entry of judgments: (1) permanently enjoining each of them from violating the antifraud, reporting, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws; (2) permanently barring each of them from serving as officers or directors of any public company, and (3) requiring Dunlap to pay a civil penalty of $500,000 and Kersh to pay a civil penalty of $200,000.  The Honorable Judge Donald Middlebrooks signed the  final judgments today., According to the Commissions Complaint, Dunlap and Kersh, together with others, employed improper accounting techniques and undisclosed non-recurring transactions to misrepresent Sunbeams results of operations.  As a result, Sunbeams financial statements and press releases reporting 1996 year-end results, quarterly and year-end 1997 results, and first-quarter 1998 results were materially false and mis-leading.  More specifically, the Commission alleged:  , The consent judgments permanently bar Dunlap and Kersh from serving as an officer or director of a public company, require them to pay civil monetary penalties of $500,000 and $200,000, respectively, and enjoin Dunlap and Kersh from violating or aiding and abetting violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws (Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder), the reporting provisions (Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder), and the books and records and internal controls provisions (Sections 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B) and (with respect to Kersh) 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder)., Dunlap paid $15,000,000 and Kersh $250,000 out of their own funds to settle a related class action.

The complaint alleges that from September 1991 to March 2001, Schluep took in excess of $5 million from 26 of his clients, without their consent or authority, by forging the clients signatures on checks and fund transfer documents.  The complaint also states that Schluep took money from two investors by telling them that he would invest their money in safe investments; instead, Schluep transferred these funds to other clients.  According to the complaint, Schluep lulled his clients into believing that the misappropriated funds would be repaid by giving them checks that were returned for insufficient funds, or by paying them with money from other clients accounts.  The complaint states that Schluep used the stolen client funds to invest primarily in local real estate and business ventures, and he used approximately $100,000 for personal expenses.  Schluep now resides in Red Bluff, California.  , In its complaint filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, the SEC charges Schluep with violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

In an earlier order, the Court permanently enjoined Dunbar from antifraud and registration violations of the federal securities laws and found that Dunbar, of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, owned the Ghost International website and used it to solicit investors in investment contracts by promises of inordinate amounts of guaranteed returns and promises of no-risk investing, and further found that investors have received little or no return despite several months of promises by Dunbar that returns would be paid.  In its recent order, the Court ordered Dunbar to pay disgorgement in the amount of $9,600, along with prejudgment interest thereon, and ordered Dunbar to pay a third tier statutory civil penalty in the amount of $120,000., The Commissions complaint alleged that between mid-2001 and March 2002, Dunbar obtained funds from investors by touting Ghost Internationals private contribution and investment program which allegedly paid, for example, $100,000 on a $200 investment over a few weeks.  Dunbar made various promises of returns, including ones up to 1000 percent.  Dunbar made various representations to fraudulently induce investors including that his company dealt in high yield investments and that funds were to be placed in offshore bank accounts, which would pay promised returns for five months of a supposed seven-month program.

The defendants include: Shoreline Development Co., a Delaware company, headquartered in Costa Mesa, California; Todd J. Taylor, 36; Derek K. Gradwell, 29; Paul A. Barrios III, 40; and Dennis P. OConnell, 47, all of Orange County, California.  Taylor and Barrios are repeat securities law violators.  In 1999, in a prior case brought by the Commission, Taylor was ordered by a federal district court not to sell securities without registering with the Commission as a broker-dealer.  In 2000, Barrios was the subject of a cease-and-desist order issued by the Commission suspending him for twelve months from association with any broker or dealer. , In its complaint, the Commission alleges that during the offering, Shoreline, Taylor and Gradwell made misrepresentations about the performance of Shorelines wells, a purported business relationship with El Paso Field Services, and their use of investor funds.  These defendants concealed their misappropriation from investors of more than $1.2 million to pay for lavish vacations, a wedding and honeymoon, a vacation home, gambling debts, customized motorcycles and other luxury items., The United States District Court for the Central District of California (1) granted the Commissions application for a preliminary injunction and appointment of a permanent receiver over Shoreline; (2) continued an asset freeze against the defendants; (3) prohibited the destruction of documents; and (4) ordered accountings.  , The Commission obtained an order preliminarily enjoining Shoreline, Taylor and Gradwell from committing securities fraud in violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Johnson for violating a 1996 federal court order (1996 Order).  The 1996 Order permanently barred Johnson from acting as an officer or director of any SEC reporting company and permanently enjoined him from future violations of certain provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SECs motion seeks to hold Johnson in contempt for his alleged violations of both provisions of the 1996 Order., The SEC alleges that, in violation of the officer-and-director bar, Johnson is currently acting as an officer and director of R&amp;RX Group, Inc., formerly known as Neoteric Group, Inc., an SEC reporting company based in Nevada.  Johnson became an officer and director of R&amp;RX Group on October 19, 2001.  Since then, the motion alleges that he has exercised control over R&amp;RX Group and has filed several SEC reports on behalf of the company.  Second, Johnson violated the injunction by omitting information about his 1996 officer-and-director bar from R&amp;RX Group reports filed with the SEC.  The SEC asked the court to issue an order holding Johnson in contempt of the 1996 order based upon this conduct.   The SEC also asked the court to order him incarcerated and to fine him up to $128,000 per day for each day he remains in violation of the courts order. , The SEC also filed a related motion against Johnson requesting that the court impose a civil money penalty of $120,000 against him for his recent violations of the anti-fraud and reporting provisions of the Exchange Act while acting as an officer and director of R&amp;RX Group., According to the SECs motions:, On August 7, 1996, the federal district court for the Northern District of Texas entered a final judgment against Johnson in an SEC case involving a fraudulent, market-manipulation scheme.  <i>SEC v.

The Division of Enforcement alleges that R&amp;RX Groups SEC reports were materially false and misleading because they failed to disclose Johnsons officer-and-director bar.  As a result, R&amp;RX Group failed to comply with Sections 10(b) and 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder, for which an order is sought revoking the registration of R&amp;RX Groups common stock.

According to the Commission, Lepejian ultimately created over $28 million in non-existent sales, causing the Company to overstate its revenue for fiscal 2002 by 328%.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Lepejian has agreed to the entry of an order enjoining him from future violations of these provisions, permanently barring him from acting as an officer or director of a publicly-held company, and requiring him to pay disgorgement and monetary penalties in an amount to be set by the court., The Commissions complaint alleges that Lepejian began his fraud in anticipation of HPLs July 2001 initial public offering.  Lepejian forged purchase orders from HPL customers and generated phony shipping documents showing that the software had been delivered to the customers.  HPL raised over $75 million from investors in its IPO based, according to the Commission, on financial results fraudulently inflated by Lepejian.  The Commissions complaint further alleges that Lepejians fraud escalated over the next year, with Lepejian repeatedly creating fake purchase orders at the end of each quarter in order to boost the Companys revenue; in one quarter, over 90% of HPLs reported revenue was wholly fictitious., The complaint also charges that Lepejian engaged in a massive cover-up to conceal his fraud.  According to the complaint, Lepejian doctored bank records to create the appearance of millions of dollars in non-existent customer payments.  Lepejian also borrowed millions of dollars from his brokerage accounts - secured by his personal HPL stock holdings - and funneled the money into the Company in the guise of customer payments.  The Commission further alleges that Lepejian repeatedly forged letters from HPL customers confirming the purchases, at one point arranging a conference call between the Companys auditors and a friend posing as an HPL customer., The complaint charges Lepejian with securities fraud (Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder), lying to accountants (Rule 13b2-2 under the Exchange Act), falsifying the companys books and records (Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder), causing HPL to report false financial information to the Commission (Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder), and causing HPLs failure to maintain accurate books and records and internal controls (Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act).  , <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp17718.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/lr17718.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

To facilitate the scheme, the defendants gained control of MDAN, set up two boiler room operations, and directed unlicensed brokers to sell unregistered stock at artificially inflated prices, using high-pressure sales tactics, in exchange for undisclosed kickbacks.

L. Dennis Kozlowski, the former chief executive officer and chairman of Tycos board of directors, and Mark H. Swartz, the former chief financial officer and a director, granted themselves hundreds of millions of dollars in secret low interest and interest-free loans from the company that they used for personal expenses.  They then covertly caused the company to forgive tens of millions of dollars of those outstanding loans, again without disclosure to investors as required by the federal securities laws.  In addition, they engaged in other undisclosed related party transactions that cost shareholders hundreds of thousands, if not millions of dollars.  Mark A. Belnick, the former chief legal officer, failed to disclose the receipt of more than $14 million of interest-free loans from the company to acquire two residences, an apartment in New York City and a $10 million home in Park City, Utah, where he already owned another home.  Kozlowski, Swartz and Belnick also sold their shares of Tyco stock valued at millions of dollars while their self-dealing remained undisclosed.  , The Commission seeks a final judgment ordering the defendants to disgorge all ill-gotten gains, imposing civil money penalties, and enjoining the defendants from future violations of the federal securities laws.  In the cases of Kozlowski and Swartz, this includes (i) disgorgement of all compensation they received subsequent to their fraudulent acts and omissions, including salary, bonuses, stock options and grants and any advances that have not been repaid; (ii) all loans not properly repaid by them to Tyco; (iii) interest imputed at market rates on all low interest or interest-free loans that they should have disclosed to investors; (iv) all losses avoided from their sales of Tyco securities subsequent to their fraudulent acts and omissions; (v) prejudgment interest on the amounts disgorged; (vi) civil money penalties; (vii) orders barring them from ever again serving as officers or directors of a publicly-held company; and (viii) an order enjoining them from violating the antifraud, proxy, reporting, books and records and lying to auditor provisions of the federal securities laws. , In the case of Belnick, the Commission seeks (i) disgorgement of all loans not properly repaid by him to Tyco; (ii) interest imputed on all low interest or interest-free loans that he should have disclosed to investors; (iii) all losses avoided from his sales of Tyco securities subsequent to his fraudulent acts and omissions at market rates; (iv) all rent payments that he received from Tyco for the home office he maintained in the Utah residence; (v) prejudgment interest on the amounts disgorged; (vi) civil money penalties; (vii) an order barring him from ever again serving as an officer or director of a publicly-held company; and (viii) an order enjoining him from violating the antifraud, proxy and reporting provisions of the federal securities laws., Specifically, the Commissions Complaint alleges, among other things:, The Commissions Complaint alleges that defendants violated or aided and abetted violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws (Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, the periodic reporting provisions (Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1), the proxy provisions (Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 14a-9) and (with respect to Kozlowski and Swartz only) the books and records, internal controls, and lying to auditors provisions (Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 13b2-1 and 13b2-2)., The Commissions investigation is continuing.

Voccola opened accounts at the Boston offices of eleven brokerage firms and bought millions of dollars of stock, which he paid for with worthless checks totaling more than $4.9 million. He then quickly sold the stock, often at a profit, to pay for the original purchases and buy additional stock. However, if the trades lost money, he did not cover the loss. Instead, according to the indictment, he defrauded the brokerage firms by shifting over $190,000 in losses to them.  The indictment further alleges that Voccolas free-riding scheme took place when he was under criminal indictment for tax evasion and continued even after a federal court ordered him to restrict his securities trading.  Voccola later pleaded guilty to the tax evasion charges and was sentenced to twelve months in prison.  If convicted on the current criminal charges, Voccola faces up to five years imprisonment, to be followed by three years of supervised release, and a $250,000 fine on each count., On August 6, 2001, the Commission filed a civil complaint against Voccola in connection with the scheme described above.

Shoob, United States District Judge for the Northern District of Georgia, entered a temporary restraining order, asset freeze and other relief against J. Scott Eskind (Eskind), Lorus Investments, Inc. (Lorus), and Capital Management Fund, Limited Partnership (Capital), all residing or with offices in of Atlanta, Georgia. The Commission filed a civil injunctive action against them on September 3, 2002.   , The Commissions complaint alleges that Eskind is a recidivist violator who was preliminarily enjoined in June 1997 and  permanently enjoined on January 12, 1998 from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. Eskind was subsequently barred by the Commission from association with any investment adviser. That case was based upon allegations of fraudulent conduct by Eskind which included misappropriating  investors funds, failing to disclose that Eskind had been suspended by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in 1991, and inducing at least five investors to invest at least $500,000 in what was falsely represented to the investors to be a specified limited partnership. In fact, Eskind had been previously terminated from that partnership. The complaint further alleges that subsequent to being enjoined, and continuing until the present, Eskind has raised at least $3 million through sales of limited partnership units in Capital. Capital purportedly does business by trading in securities through initial or secondary public offerings. The sales materials misrepresent to investors Eskinds broker-dealer experience, and do not disclose his 1991 NYSE suspension, the Commissions 1997 civil action or the Commissions 2000 order barring him from association with an investment adviser. The complaint alleges that investors were told that IRA accounts had been opened for them at a trust company which serves as an IRA custodian and have received statements from Lorus indicating their funds in those accounts. In fact, no such accounts have been opened.  The sales materials falsely state that a major law firm provides legal representation for Lorus. Finally, the complaint alleges that Lorus is an investment adviser and Eskinds continuing association with Lorus is a violation of the Commissions 2000 order.,  , <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp17725.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr17725.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Urbina, United States District Judge for the District of Columbia, entered an order of civil contempt and imposing sanctions against defendant Edward R. Showalter, of San Clemente, California, for not paying an outstanding judgment of over $750,000, entered against Showalter on May 15, 2001.  The Court ordered that Showalter be imprisoned until he purges himself of the contempt.  A hearing on these issues is scheduled for September 26, 2002.  Additionally, the Order requires that Showalter and his controlled company, International Financial Group dba IFG Goldstar Cement Company (IFG), provide a sworn accounting of their finances.  The Court also ordered that two banks holding funds of Showalter turn these monies over to the Court., Previously, in entering a default judgment, the Court ordered Showalter to pay $900,000 (including a $150,000 penalty) after the Court found that Showalter had orchestrated two fraudulent schemes to raise capital illegally.  In the first scheme, Showalters company, Hollywood Trenz, Inc., materially overstated the value of the primary asset of a wholly-owned subsidiary, a portfolio of defaulted bank loans, in reports filed with the Commission and disseminated to the public. In the second scheme, Hollywood Trenz, Inc. fraudulently raised millions of dollars by issuing stock to nominee consultants pursuant to Form S-8 registration statements.  Consequently, the Courts judgment also permanently enjoined Showalter from violating, among other things, the antifraud, registration, reporting, and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws, and barred him from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  The Court also found that Showalter had engaged in a pattern of repeated, willful violations of the courts orders, including failure to appear for court-scheduled depositions and hearings, violations of the Courts order to provide discovery, and failure to pay court-ordered expenses to the SEC. See <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17204.htm>Lit. Rel. No. 17204</a>., On May 22, 2002, Judge Urbina, entered an order to show cause (i) why defendant Showalter should not be held in contempt of court for not paying the outstanding judgment of over $750,000, and (ii) why Showalter should not provide a sworn accounting of his finances.  The Court also ordered a freeze of up to $750,000 of Showalters assets including assets of IFG.  In addition, the Court restricted Showalters travel outside the U.S., and ordered him to surrender his passport to the Court immediately.  A hearing on these issues was held on June 3-6, 2002., The SEC based its contempt action on new information showing that Showalter was now living and operating in California, and trying to raise money purportedly for a cement import business, IFG.  The SECs contempt action alleges that Showalter claimed to have invested about $1.7 million of his own money in the business, and that Showalter was paying himself a salary while he was trying to start-up this new business., Following the close of the Show Cause hearing, on June 6 and 18, 2002, the Court found Showalter was in civil contempt of the May 15, 2001 Order, and ordered Showalter to file sworn accountings for himself and IFG, and to submit to a deposition to answer questions about his assets and liabilities and his business affairs.  Showalter did submit the accountings and was deposed by the Commission staff.  In his opinion accompanying the September 12th Order, Judge Urbina found, among other things, that Showalter had failed to provide anything close to a full and complete sworn accounting for his and IFGs finances, in violation of the June 6 and 18, 2002 orders.  Further, the Court found that Mr. Showalter intentionally misrepresented the truth during his testimony at the show cause hearing and when he swore to the accuracy of the accounting documents., See Litigation Releases <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17204.htm>17204</a> (October 25, 2001) and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17539.htm>17539</a> (May 30, 2002),  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr17727.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

According to the criminal complaint, Lefebvre told investors he would generate the profits by trading financial institution instruments rated AA or better.  The criminal complaint alleges that Lefebvre made these representations in writing on behalf of himself and another entity, RMO Assets Management SA.  According to the criminal complaint, Lefebvre also told investors that he was federally licensed to trade bonds and that he would conduct some of his trading activities through another entity, Watch Hill Capital Management, LLC.  The criminal complaint alleges that, after raising money through this scheme, Lefebvre transferred a significant amount of those  funds to accounts in his control and in the control of his associates, Dennis Herula and Herulas wife, Mary Lee Capalbo.  According to the criminal complaint, millions of dollars in investor funds were transferred from those accounts to individuals, credit card companies and merchandise stores, such as Saks Fifth Avenue and Ben Jewelry., In the Commissions earlier, related enforcement action, the Commission named Lefebvre, Herula, RMO Assets Management and Watch Hill Capital Management as defendants, alleging that they violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws in connection with the scheme described above.  The Commission named Capalbo as a relief defendant in that action. On August 1, 2002, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California entered Temporary Restraining Orders against Lefebvre, Herula, RMO and Watch Hill, temporarily restraining them from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Court also froze the assets of all the defendants, including Capalbo.  The Court ordered the TROs and asset freezes to remain in effect until October 1, 2002, at which time a hearing on the Commissions Motion for Preliminary Injunction is scheduled. , Lefebvre currently remains in custody in Los Angeles and will be transferred to a facility in Colorado during the pendency of the criminal case., For further information, please see Litigation Release Numbers <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17652.htm>17652</a> (August 2, 2002), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17461.htm>17461</a> (April 5, 2002) and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17514.htm>17514</a> (May 13, 2002).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr17729.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

In addition, the Court ordered Randolph to pay $1,983,910.76 in restitution to the victims of the fraud and to surrender himself to the Federal Bureau of Prisons on September 16, 2002., Previously, in a related civil action, Judge Heartfield granted the Commissions request for a judgment by default against Randolph, individually and doing business as International Polymers Works (IPW).

Rice of Sugar Land, Texas who did business under the name Primex Capital.  The Court ordered Rice to repay his illegal trading profits totaling $900,367 which he obtained through his manipulation of the securities of four micro-cap companies, and prejudgment interest on those amounts of $184,755.20.  Rice is jointly and severally liable with two companies for a portion of the $900,367 and interest. The Court also ordered Rice to pay civil penalties of $440,000, which consists of four $110,000 penalties, one for each of the four companies whose stock he manipulated., The Commission alleged in its complaint filed on February 25, 2002 that between September 1999 and July 2000, Rice carried out pump and dump schemes to manipulate the stock of four micro-cap companies: Portalzone.com, Inc., which later changed its name to Status Wines of Tuscany, Inc. (Portalzone); Rockport Healthcare Group, Inc.; Global Connections, Inc.; and Pinnacle Business Management, Inc. The complaint alleged that Rice had issued unsolicited fraudulent spam e-mail messages, press releases and other promotional materials about the four companies and then engaged in manipulative trading in the stock of those companies when the price of the stocks increased because of the false statements. According to the Commissions complaint, Rice, and Portalzone in various press releases issued by the company, made false statements about the development of Portalzones product purportedly an advanced Internet search engine, the companys revenue sources and business relationships with third parties, as well as Rices stock-picking track record and trading intentions.  The Commissions complaint alleged that Rice used two companies, relief defendants Primex (USA), Inc. (Primex), a Nevada corporation, and Applegate Sentry, S.A. (Applegate) a Bahamian corporation, to hide his sales of unregistered stock of three of the four companies into the market inflated by his false statements.  Together, Rice and the two companies obtained illegal profits of $900,367.  , Previously on March 5, 2002, the Court permanently enjoined Rice, based on his consent, from future violations of the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a), and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), the anti-fraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the anti-manipulation provisions of Regulation M, Rule 101.

The Commissions complaint alleges that on March 22, 2000, the Dobrows violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, when Harvey Dobrow bought 2,000 shares of common stock in H.D.

Illinois, Civil Action No. 01-C-7463), The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) today announced that it had reached a settlement with Stephen L. Holden in connection with his role in a multi-million dollar accounting fraud involving Sabratek Corp, a now-bankrupt Skokie, Illinois manufacturer that developed and sold remote healthcare equipment, including infusion pumps and flush syringes and related equipment and software used in both hospital and home healthcare situations.  Holden had served as the companys Chief Financial Officer, Controller and Treasurer from August 1996 to July 1998 and its President and Treasurer from July 1998 to January 2000.  The Commissions lawsuit charged Holden and three other executives with fraudulently inflating the companys earnings during 1998 and 1999 in order to meet their previously announced quarterly projections.  In the second half of 1999, when news of Sabrateks inflated operating results began to emerge, its market capitalization declined by approximately 98%.  , Holden, a former resident of Deerfield, Illinois who now resides in Ohio, agreed to pay a civil penalty of $90,000.00 and also to pay disgorgement plus interest totaling $68,376, which reflect bonuses that he received during the period in which the Commission claims that Sabratek was cooking its books.  Holden also agreed to the entry of a permanent injunction barring him from future violations of anti-fraud, record-keeping, and reporting provisions of the federal securities laws, contained in from violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, 13b2-1, and 13b-2-2 thereunder.  The court order reflecting this settlement was entered on September 13, 2002.  , Two of the other defendants previously settled the Commissions claims against them.  Kulderhsan S. Padda, the founder and former CEO of Sabratek, agreed to pay $125,000 in civil penalties and Stephan C. Beal, the companys Vice President of Sales, agreed to disgorge bonuses and commissions totaling $29,237 (plus prejudgment interest of $6,193) that he received during the 1998-1998 period, and to pay a civil penalty of $60,000.  Beal and Padda also agreed to the entry of the same permanent injunctions as were entered against Holden.  The only remaining defendant is Scott Skooglund, the companys former Chief Accounting Officer. , In the lawsuit, the Commission alleged that the defendants engaged in a scheme to overstate Sabrateks sales and results of operation in its Form 10-K for the year 1998 and Forms 10-Q for the first three quarters of 1998 and the first quarter of 1999.  During those years, Padda was Sabrateks chief executive officer and chairman of the board; Holden was at first Sabrateks chief financial officer, controller, and treasurer and then later its president and treasurer; Beal was Sabrateks vice president of sales; and Skooglund was Sabrateks vice president of finance and chief accounting officer., According to the Commissions complaint, Sabrateks pump and flush syringe businesses were the companys two primary sources of sales.  Prior to 1998, Sabratek capitalized on strong demand for pumps from large institutional customers to increase its sales.  In 1998, however, Sabratek faced first slowing demand for its pumps and later an FDA demand that the company stop selling its flush syringes.  The Commission alleged that despite these adverse developments, Padda and Holden told analysts that Sabrateks sales would continue to grow in 1988.  Based on Padda and Holdens representations, analysts projected that Sabrateks net sales would grow by as much as $23 million in 1998., The Commission charged that to meet these forecasts, from the first quarter of 1998 through the first quarter of 1999 the defendants recognized numerous large, end-of-the-quarter transactions that did not qualify as sales under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).  In some instances, the defendants allegedly created fictitious sales of pumps that had not been ordered by customers, but instead were parked at third-party warehouses.  In other instances, they allegedly entered into sales agreements containing consignment or right-of-return provisions.  In still other instances, they allegedly agreed to significant sellers obligations, including promises that Sabrateks sales force would assist Sabrateks customers in the resale of these pumps to end-users., The Commission also alleged that throughout 1998 and the first quarter of 1999, the defendants inflated Sabrateks sales by billing another company a total of $4.5 million for consulting services that Sabratek executives in fact largely never provided.  , The Commission alleged that over the five quarters from the first quarter of 1998 through the first quarter of 1999, Sabratek, through the defendants actions, overstated net sales by $30.7 million, or more than 60%.  The Commission also alleges that through the defendants actions, Sabratek reported total operating income of $10.3 million, when in fact had experienced an operating loss of $8 million over the five quarters in question., The Commissions complaint also charged that in press releases and the MD&amp;A sections of Sabrateks periodic reports filed during 1998 and early 1999, Padda and Holden touted the companys sales growth without disclosing that the sales growth had been achieved through the fraudulent consulting services billings and through special inducements and concessions, including extended payment terms, consignment arrangements, rights of return, and other significant sellers obligations., According to the complaint, in the second half of 1999, when news of Sabrateks inflated operating results began to emerge, the companys market capitalization declined by $202.5 million, or 98%.  On December 17, 1999, Sabratek filed a petition to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code., In related proceedings, the Commission issued an administrative order against Paul Jurewicz, who had replaced Holden as Chief Financial Officer of Sabratek in 1998 after Holden was promoted to President.  That order directs Jurewicz to cease and desist from committing or causing any violation or any future violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder, and to pay disgorgement of $14,838 and prejudgment interest thereon of $2,718.

Eskind was subsequently barred by the Commission from association with any investment adviser. That case was based upon allegations of fraudulent conduct by Eskind which included misappropriating  investors funds.  , The complaint alleged that subsequent to being enjoined, and continuing until the present, Eskind had raised at least $3 million through sales of limited partnership units in Capital. Capital purportedly does business by trading in securities through initial or secondary public offerings.  The sales materials misrepresented to investors Eskinds broker-dealer experience, and did not disclose his 1991 NYSE suspension, the Commissions 1997 civil action or the Commissions 2000 order barring him from association with an investment adviser.,  The complaint alleged that investors were told that IRA accounts had been opened for them at a trust company which serves as an IRA custodian. Investors received statements from Lorus indicating their funds in those accounts.  In fact, no such accounts were opened.  The sales materials falsely stated that a major law firm provided legal representation for Lorus.

Motorcar settled the Commissions action without admitting or denying the complaints allegations., The Commissions complaint and the Justice Departments criminal charges allege that Bromberg engaged in fraudulent accounting practices and falsified Motorcars books and records, thereby causing Motorcar to issue false and misleading financial information to the investing public.  The Commissions complaint alleges that Motorcar and Bromberg overstated the companys pre-tax earnings for fiscal year 1997 by $3,391,000 (59.8%) and for fiscal year 1998 by $3,576,000 (49.6%), that the overstated earnings figures were reported to the public in Motorcars annual reports on Form 10-K filed with the Commission for the fiscal years ended March 31, 1997 and 1998, and that Motorcar included its false 1997 financial statements in a registration statement filed with the Commission in October 1997, for an offering that raised $19.8 million.  , In a criminal information filed today against Bromberg, the United States Attorneys Office alleges that Bromberg knowingly made false and misleading statements about Motorcars financial condition and performance in its 1997 and 1998 Forms 10-K.  Bromberg has agreed to plead guilty to these charges, which are based on fraudulent conduct similar to that described in the SECs civil complaint.  , The two defendants are:, , , The criminal and civil charges against Motorcar and Bromberg focus on how Motorcar accounted for and credited customers for returned parts.  Motorcars remanufacturing business starts when customers return used alternators and starters, called cores.  Motorcar gives its customers credit for the returned cores, but does not issue these credits to the customers until after Motorcar checks the cores in to its inventory.  Because there was a delay in checking returned product in to inventory and processing the related credits, Motorcars policy was to establish reserves for credits due to its customers.  The effect of this reserve on Motorcars financial statements was to reduce its earnings.  The Commission alleges that Motorcar and Bromberg committed financial fraud through two schemes relating to returned cores and customer credits: , , , , Finally, the Commissions complaint alleges that in April 1999, Bromberg improperly reversed $544,000 of accounts payable that Motorcar had properly recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1999.  Bromberg allegedly reversed the accounts payable to enhance the companys earnings.  Motorcar did not issue any financial statements that included these improperly reversed amounts.  In 1999, Motorcar notified the Commission of a report from its independent auditors indicating that an illegal act had or may have occurred.<b> </b>, The Commission charged Motorcar and Bromberg with violating or aiding and abetting violations of numerous provisions of the federal securities laws, including the antifraud provisions (Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder), reporting provisions (Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 thereunder), record-keeping provisions (Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act, and additionally as to Bromberg, Rule 13b2-1 thereunder), internal controls provisions (Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and additionally as to Bromberg, Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act), and that Bromberg also violated the lying-to- the-auditors provisions (Rule 13b2-2 under the Exchange Act)., Simultaneously with the filing of the complaint in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, Motorcar settled the Commissions action without admitting or denying the complaints allegations.  Motorcar agreed not to commit future violations of the charged federal securities laws.  As to Bromberg, the Commission seeks a permanent injunction, an order barring him from serving as an officer or director of a public company, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, and civil penalties., In the related criminal case, Bromberg has agreed to plead guilty to a two-count information charging him with making false statements in two Form 10-K reports that were filed with the Commission.  In a plea agreement filed this morning, Bromberg admitted that he directed Motorcar employees to engage in fraudulent accounting practices and to falsify Motorcars books and records, thereby causing false and misleading statements to be made to the investing public about Motorcars revenues and income.  Brombergs plea results from conduct similar to that alleged in the Commissions complaint., This case is the product of an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the United States Attorneys Office in Los Angeles, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service.

On May 8, the court issued a written order imposing preliminary injunctions and asset freezes against Herula, his wife - Mary Lee Capalbo - and others, and also ordered them to provide the Commission with information concerning, among other things, their bank accounts and money they raised from investors., The Commission filed a motion on July 23 seeking a final judgment against Herula and Capalbo based on their failures to respond to the Commissions complaint.  On August 8, the Commission also filed a contempt motion against Herula and Capalbo based on their failures to provide the information required by the courts order, and their acceptance and dissipation of additional investor funds in direct violation of the preliminary injunction order.   The court issued an order on September 9 requiring both Herula and Capalbo to appear on September 16 for a hearing on these issues.  , Capalbo did not appear in court for the September 16 hearing; however, Capalbos attorney submitted an affidavit from her doctor stating Capalbo was under his care and was unable to travel or appear in court.  The judge subsequently ordered the Commission to retain an independent doctor to examine Capalbo and provide the court with a diagnosis of Capalbos condition.  The court also rescheduled the hearing as to Capalbo for October 10, 2002, and ordered Capalbo to appear at that time unless the independent doctor determines that she is unable to appear for medical reasons., The court took the motion for a final judgment against Herula under advisement and, with regard to the contempt motion, ordered Herula to provide certain information to the Commission staff by 4:00 p.m. on September 23, and to appear on October 10.  Herula is also a defendant and Capalbo is a relief defendant in a separate action filed by the Commission on July 31, 2002.  In that action, the Commission alleges that investors were defrauded $40 million in another prime bank scheme in which investors were promised exorbitant returns., For further information, please see Litigation Release Numbers <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17652.htm>17652</a> (August 2, 2002), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17461.htm>17461</a> (April 5, 2002) and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17514.htm>17514</a> (May 13, 2002).<!--<P>&nbsp;</P><P><IMG SRC=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=9 ALT= BORDER=0>  <A href=/litigation/complaints/comp17737.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</A></P>--><!-- End text -->,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr17737.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Lemcke (Lemcke). Lemcke is a defendant in a civil fraud case the Commission filed in November 2001 alleging that Lemcke, an unregistered investment adviser, defrauded his clients of approximately $1 million. , The court entered a temporary restraining order and asset freeze against Lemcke on November 16, 2001, and subsequently entered a preliminary injunction against Lemcke and continued the asset freeze on December 6.  On April 15, 2002, the Court entered an order modifying the asset freeze to allow the sale of the Lemcke home, which was jointly owned by Lemcke and Grogan-Lemcke, on the condition that the proceeds from the sale be deposited with the registry of court., According to a motion filed by the Commission on August 20, 2002, although the house was sold on June 14, 2002, Grogan-Lemcke has refused to comply with the courts order and the sale proceeds - totalling $245,560 - are being held by her attorney.  The Commission named Grogan-Lemcke as a relief defendant in the civil action and also sought a ruling from the court holding Grogan-Lemcke in contempt unless she deposits the proceeds with the court.  , The courts September 4 order requires Grogan-Lemcke to deposit the proceeds from the sale with the registry of court.

Involving SPEs and Round-Trip Energy Trades</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it filed a settled enforcement action against Dynegy Inc., in connection with alleged accounting improprieties and misleading statements by the Houston-based energy production, distribution and trading company.  The Commissions case arises from (i) Dynegys improper accounting for and misleading disclosures relating to a $300 million financing transaction, known as Project Alpha, involving special-purpose entities (SPEs), and (ii) Dynegys overstatement of its energy-trading activity resulting from round-trip or wash trades  simultaneous, pre-arranged buy-sell trades of energy with the same counter-party, at the same price and volume, and over the same term, resulting in neither profit nor loss to either transacting party., The Commission issued a settled cease-and-desist Order against Dynegy and filed a settled civil suit in the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division, seeking a $3 million penalty.  The Commission made findings in the cease-and-desist order (and alleged in the civil complaint) that Dynegy engaged in securities fraud in connection with its disclosures and accounting for Project Alpha, and negligently included materially misleading information about the round-trip energy trades in two press releases it issued in early 2002. In settlement of the Commissions enforcement action, Dynegy, without admitting or denying the Commissions findings, has agreed to the entry of the cease-and-desist order and to pay a $3 million penalty in a related civil suit filed in U.S. district court in Houston., The Commissions investigation is continuing as to others., More specifically, with respect to the action against Dynegy, the Commissions Order finds (and civil complaint alleges) as follows: , By 2000, some energy analysts following Dynegy had noticed a widening gap between Dynegys net income and operating cash flow.  The gap resulted from Dynegys recognition of net income in the form of unrealized gains from net forward positions, and the fact that the net forward positions generate no current cash flow.  This treatment of unrealized gains as net income was required under mark-to-market accounting principles. In April of 2001, Dynegy closed on Project Alpha, a complex web of transactions involving SPEs, to boost its 2001 operating cash flow by $300 million, or 37%, and thereby reduce the gap between its net income and operating cash flow, as well as to achieve a $79 million tax benefit., Dynegy defrauded the investing public by failing to disclose in its 2001 Form 10-K the true financing, as opposed to operating, nature of the $300 million.  In reality, the $300 million was a loan masquerading as operating cash flow on Dynegys 2001 Statement of Cash Flows.  This is particularly significant for two reasons: first, analysts view operating cash flow as a key indicator of the financial health of energy trading firms such as Dynegy; and second, historically, the Statement of Cash Flows has been considered immune from cosmetic tampering.  , In addition, Dynegys accounting in its financial statements for the $300 million failed to conform to GAAP in at least two respects. Under Financial Accounting Standard 95, Dynegy should have accounted for the Alpha-related cash flow as financing, rather than operating, cash flow. Moreover, Dynegy failed to comply with the 3% at-risk requirement for SPEs.  Consequently, Dynegy overstated net income in 2001 by 12%  the amount of the purported $79 million Alpha-linked tax benefit., The Commissions Order emphasizes that public companies using off-balance sheet, special purpose entities must ensure not only that their accounting treatment complies with GAAP, but also, that they have accurately portrayed the economic realities of the transactions.  In this case, Dynegy portrayed as operating cash flow what was essentially a loan.  As a result, Dynegy investors were deceived. , Dynegy issued materially misleading information to the investing public about the amount of trading on its electronic trading platform, Dynegy<i>direct</i>.  On November 15, 2001, Dynegy entered into two massive round-trip electricity transactions.  In a January 2002 press release, Dynegy included the notional trading value (multiple of volume, price and term) from one of these trades in a discussion of an increase in trading traffic on Dynegy<i>direct</i>.  In an April 2002 press release, Dynegy included the results of these trades in its reported energy trading volume and in its first quarter 2002 revenues and cost of sales.  , In both releases, Dynegy negligently failed to disclose that the resulting increases in energy trading volume, revenue and notional trading value were materially attributable to the round-trip trades.  The contents of the press releases were also used in the offer and sale of securities.  Because the round-trip trades lacked economic substance, Dynegys statements were materially misleading to the investing public. This case is the first enforcement action resulting from an energy trading companys misleading disclosures regarding use of round-trip or wash trades., Dynegy disclosed Alphas impact on its financial performance in a Form 8-K that the company filed with the Commission on April 25, 2002, only after the Commission staff expressed to Dynegy concerns about Alpha.  After those concerns were first raised, but before the filing of the Form 8-K, Dynegys former Chief Financial Officer falsely stated to the public that Alphas primary purpose was to secure a long-term natural gas supply, and Dynegy continued to assert that its obtaining a long-term gas supply was a principal purpose of Alpha. Dynegy officials did not, prior to Dynegys filing of the Form 8-K, acknowledge that Alphas principal purposes were, in fact, to minimize the gap between Dynegys reported net income and reported operating cash flow and to realize an associated tax benefit., <p class=center>**********, The $3 million penalty imposed directly against Dynegy in this case reflects the Commissions dissatisfaction with Dynegys lack of full cooperation in the early stages of the Commissions investigation, as discussed in the Commissions Order., In assessing a penalty directly against Dynegy, the Commission was mindful of the impact that a penalty on a corporate entity can have on the entitys innocent shareholders.  The amount of the penalty here reflects the commitment of the companys present board of directors to cooperate with the Commission and certain remedial actions undertaken by the company, as well as a careful balancing by the Commission between the need to encourage full cooperation and the desire to avoid imposing the economic consequences of a penalty on shareholders.  As the Commissions investigation continues, it will consider the responsibility of and take appropriate actions against others with respect to the penalty that the company has agreed to pay., The cease-and-desist order finds (and civil complaint alleges) that Dynegy, with regard to Project Alpha, violated, committed or caused violations of Sections 17(a)(1), (2) and (3) of the Securities Act, and Sections 10(b), 13(a) and 13(b)(2) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13 and 13b2-1, thereunder, and with regard to round-trip trading, Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act and Section 13(b)(2) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1, thereunder., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp17744.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  ]"

(formerly Homestore.com Inc.), based in Westlake Village, Calif., for perpetrating an extensive scheme to fraudulently inflate Homestores on-line advertising revenues in 2001.  <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp17745.htm>The complaint</a>, filed today in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, charges that John Giesecke Jr., Homestores former chief operating officer; Joseph J. Shew, its former chief financial officer; and John DeSimone, its former vice president of transactions, caused Homestore to overstate its advertising revenues by $46 million (64%) for the first three quarters of 2001.  This action was brought in coordination with the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Central District of California, which simultaneously announced related criminal charges against the three defendants.  Giesecke, Shew, and DeSimone have each agreed to settle the Commissions lawsuit, to plead guilty to the criminal charges, and to cooperate with the government in its continuing investigation.  At the time of the violations, Homestore was one of the top Internet portals for real estate and related services., The Commissions complaint charges Giesecke, Shew, and DeSimone with arranging fraudulent round-trip transactions for the sole purpose of artificially inflating Homestores revenues in order to exceed Wall Street analysts expectations.  The defendants circumvented applicable accounting principles and lied to Homestores independent auditors about these transactions.  While the fraud was ongoing, the defendants exercised stock options at prices ranging between approximately $21 and $32 per share, reaping profits ranging from approximately $169,000 to approximately $3.2 million. , The Commissions complaint alleges as follows:, <b>Bogus Barter Transactions.</b> Throughout 2000 and 2001, Homestores sale of on-line advertisements was one of its primary revenue sources.  Homestore engaged in a series of complex round-trip barter transactions to inflate revenues and meet Wall Street estimates.  The essence of these transactions was a circular flow of money by which Homestore recognized its own cash as revenue.  Specifically, Homestore paid inflated sums to various vendors for services or products; in turn, the vendors used these funds to buy advertising from two media companies.  The media companies then bought advertising from Homestore either on their own behalf or as agents for other advertisers.  Homestore recorded the funds it received from the media companies as revenue in its financial statements, in violation of applicable accounting principles., As a result of a significant revenue shortfall in the first quarter of 2001, the company devised a plan to use a major media company as an intermediary in some round-trip transactions.  The overall scheme required Homestore to refer vendors to the media company, and the vendors to purchase on-line advertisements from that company.  In return, the major media company purchased on-line advertising from Homestore for which the media company acted as a media buyer., Using this structure, Homestore paid a total of $49.8 million to various vendors in the first two quarters of 2001.  These vendors then paid $45.1 million to a major media company to purchase on-line advertisements.  Homestore, in turn, recorded $36.7 million in revenue from the major media companys related purchase of Homestore on-line advertisements.  In short, Homestore recycled its own money to generate revenues.  Homestore used this same general plan with another media company in the second and third quarters of 2001 to fraudulently recognize an additional $9.7 million in revenue., <b>Charges Against the Defendants</b>.  In connection with these round-trip transactions, the Commissions complaint charges Giesecke, Shew, and DeSimone with securities fraud, lying to the auditors, falsifying Homestores books and records, and aiding and abetting Homestores reporting and record-keeping violations.  The complaint alleges that Giesecke, Shew and DeSimone knew that the round-trip transactions had no economic substance and that Homestore paid cash to numerous intermediaries for the primary purpose of selling advertising and recognizing revenue from these or related transactions.  Nevertheless, Giesecke, Shew and DeSimone carried out the fraudulent plan and recorded, or caused the company to record, revenue on these bogus deals.  All three defendants lied to the companys independent auditors about the round-trip transactions and withheld business records from the auditors during their 2001 quarterly reviews.  Shew and Giesecke also misrepresented Homestores revenues to securities analysts covering the company, while Giesecke approved press releases containing inflated revenue numbers., The individuals charged and the terms of their settlements are:, The returned ill-gotten gains of approximately $4.6 million will be paid to the benefit of Homestore shareholders.  In addition, the Commission is seeking the permission of the court to have Gieseckes civil monetary penalty of $360,000 paid to the benefit of shareholders under the Fair Funds provision of the recently enacted Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002., In related proceedings filed today by the U.S. Attorneys Office in Los Angeles, Giesecke  has agreed to plead guilty to one count of conspiracy and one count of wire fraud, Shew has agreed to plead guilty to one count of conspiracy, and DeSimone has agreed to plead guilty to one count of securities fraud.  Giesecke and DeSimone each face a maximum possible penalty of 10 years in prison, while Shew faces up to 5 years in prison.  Their pleas are based on fraudulent conduct similar to that described in the Commissions complaint.  As part of their plea agreements, all three defendants have agreed to cooperate with the Commission and the criminal authorities. , The Commission also announced today that it would not bring any enforcement action against Homestore because of its swift, extensive and extraordinary cooperation in the Commissions investigation.  This cooperation included reporting its discovery of possible misconduct to the Commission immediately upon the audit committees learning of it, conducting a thorough and independent internal investigation, sharing the results of that investigation with the government (including not asserting any applicable privileges and protections with respect to written materials furnished to the Commission staff), terminating responsible wrongdoers, and implementing remedial actions designed to prevent the recurrence of fraudulent conduct.  These actions, among others, significantly facilitated the Commissions expeditious investigation of this matter., This case is the product of an investigation by the Commission, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Central District of California., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp17745.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr17745.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The Application alleged that Hatfield, in direct contravention of a March 26, 2002 Order, transferred assets of GDF to an investor in GDF.    , On March 26, 2002, the SEC filed its first motion for contempt and for other emergency relief against Hatfield and GDF for violating the Final Judgment of Permanent Injunction and Other Relief entered on September 8, 1995, in <i>SEC v. Marada Global Corporation, et al.</i>, Case No. 94-CV-1504-CIV-T-26MAP (M.D. Fla.).  The <u>Marada</u> final judgment prohibited Hatfield from violating the penny stock, registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws in the future.    , The SEC alleged that from at least September 2001 through the filing of the first contempt motion, Hatfield and GDF (a private Florida corporation founded and operated by Hatfield in St. Petersburg, Florida) violated Sections 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and the <u>Marada</u> final judgment by fraudulently offering unregistered securities in the form of nine-month 24% APR high yield secured notes.  On April 25, 2002, the SEC amended its motion to also allege that Hatfield and GDF were in contempt of the <u>Marada</u> final judgment by violating Section 5(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  , On March 26, 2002, the Court entered an order freezing Hatfield and GDFs assets.  Hatfield, in direct contravention of the Order, transferred assets (diamonds) of GDF to an investor in GDF.    , On April 26, 2002, the Court held a hearing to decide the SECs request for an order holding Hatfield in civil contempt and other relief.  The Court made findings of fact and conclusions of law on the record during the contempt hearing.  Those findings were adopted and incorporated in a May 6, 2002 Order.  The Court found that Hatfield and GDF were in contempt and ordered the investor to turn over the diamonds so they may be appraised, at Hatfields expense. Upon receipt of the appraisal, the investor would have three business days to elect to keep the diamonds or request reimbursement of the monies he invested in GDF from Hatfield.  The Court also imposed a penalty of $5,000 on Hatfield and GDF each for any future violations and awarded the SEC reasonable attorneys fees and costs. ,  ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr17748.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Hays, Marlen V. Johnson, and James M. Nilsson, </i>USDC/NDTX [Dallas Division], Civil Action No. 3:02-CV-0250-G)  The final judgment, entered in a matter charging Johnson with masterminding a stock-manipulation scheme, barred Johnson from acting as an officer or director of any issuer that has a class of securities registered pursuant to Section 12 or that is required to file reports pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. §§78<i>l</i> and 78o(d)).  The judgment also permanently enjoined Johnson from, among other things, future violations of the antifraud and reporting provisions of the Exchange Act, specifically Sections 10(b) and 13(a) and Rules 10b-5, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder (15 U.S.C. §§ 78j(b), 78m(a) and 17 C.F.R. §§ 240.10b-5, 240.13a-1 and 240.13a-13)., Judge Fish found that Johnson violated the final judgment from at least October 19, 2001, to the present by acting as an officer and director of a company having securities registered pursuant to Section 12 or that are required to file reports pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, including, but not limited to, Voyager Group, Inc., Neoteric, Inc., and R&amp;RX Group, Inc.  Judge Fish further found that Johnson violated the antifraud and reporting provisions of the final judgment by causing reports to be filed with the Commission that omitted to disclose material information.  Specifically, Forms 10-K and 10-Q that Johnson signed and filed on behalf of Voyager and Neoteric failed to disclose that Johnson, while acting as president, secretary and a director of these companies, was nonetheless subject to the final judgment barring him from acting as an officer or director.  Moreover, Johnson failed to disclose any portion of the 1996 final judgment against him., At the request of the Commission, the Court ordered coercive sanctions against Johnson to compel him to comply with the terms of the final judgment.  Specifically, Judge Fish issued a bench warrant requiring the arrest and incarceration of Johnson and ordered the assessment of daily fines beginning at $4,000 and doubling each day, with a maximum daily fine of $128,000, until Johnson is in compliance with the final judgment.   The Court also ordered that Johnson would be liable for an additional $100,000 fine if he signed, as a purported officer or director, any future documents filed with the Commission.  Finally, the Court required Johnson to pay the Commission attorneys fees for the time expended in seeking to enforce Johnsons compliance with the final judgment., In addition to awarding sanctions for contempt, the Court found that Johnsons failure to disclose the officer-and-director bar or any information about the 1996 final judgment in 10-Ks and 10-Qs filed with the Commission constituted fresh violations of the antifraud and reporting provisions of the Exchange Act.  In connection with these new violations, the Court imposed on Johnson a third-tier civil penalty of $120,000 pursuant to Section 21(d)(3) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. § 78t(d)(3)).,  Johnson, age 54, is a resident of Salt Lake City, Utah., For further information regarding Marlen V.

(Ambassador), a now defunct eyeglass frame distributor whose stock was traded on the Chicago Stock Exchange.  Green is the former treasurer and principal financial accounting officer of Ambassador.  The Commissions complaint alleges that, from at least 1997 through at least December 1998, Budilov and Green engaged in a fraudulent scheme to artificially inflate Ambassadors assets, income and retained earnings.  As a result of the scheme, Ambassador falsely claimed, in a registration statement, annual and quarterly reports filed with the Commission and in press releases, that it was profitable when, in fact, the company had incurred substantial losses.  In addition, Ambassador overstated its assets by as much as 35 percent., The Commissions complaint alleges that, as part of the scheme, Budilov and Green falsified Ambassadors books and records related to income, expense, accounts receivable, retained earnings, and inventory, and lied to Ambassadors auditors.  The complaint further alleges that, after others began suspecting the fraud, Budilov attempted to conceal his involvement by destroying evidence, causing others to destroy evidence, and persuading others to accept responsibility for the fraud., The complaint charges Budilov and Green with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder.

Myers, formerly the Controller and a Senior Vice President of WorldCom, Inc., and a CPA.  The Commission charges that Myers participated in a massive fraud that inflated the companys earnings at the direction and with the knowledge of WorldComs senior management.  Also today, in connection the same conduct, Myers pled guilty to criminal charges filed by the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York., The Commissions action against Myers is its second civil enforcement action related to the WorldCom fraud.  The first was filed against WorldCom, Inc. on June 27 of this year. (Litigation Release No. 17588.)  Since then, WorldCom has admitted that beginning in 1999, as a result of undisclosed and improper accounting, it materially overstated the income it reported in its financial statements by approximately $7.2 billion.  It has also filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.  , The Commissions complaint filed today against former Controller Myers alleges that in the second half of 2000, by improperly decreasing certain reserves to reduce line costs (expenses for accessing the networks of other telecommunications companies), Myers and others caused WorldCom to overstate pre-tax earnings by at least $1.2 billion.  Thereafter, from the first quarter 2001 through the first quarter 2002, Myers and others improperly capitalized certain line costs, which resulted in an overstatement of WorldComs pre-tax earnings by approximately $3.8 billion.  During the same period, Myers and others, including members of senior management, made materially false or misleading statements or omissions to WorldComs independent auditors in connection with audits and the preparation of filings with the Commission.  , For this misconduct, the complaint charges Myers with violating numerous provisions of the federal securities laws, including the antifraud, books and records, internal controls, and lying-to-auditors provisions (Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder).

The SECs complaint also alleges that AFG misled investors by failing to disclose in its offering materials and website that Siegel had a long history of securities laws violations, including an injunction entered against him in 1987 for participating in a stock manipulation scheme.

The Complaint further alleged that the broker relations executives at Norstarr made hundreds of thousands of telephone calls to registered representatives of registered broker-dealers, and sent faxes of bullet sheets -- prepared by Heredia and Parra - making false and misleading material misrepresentations and omissions about the public companies touted.  The Complaint also alleged that while touting the stock of the public companies, Norrstars principals, Heredia and Parra, reaped illegal profits of more than $3.4 million by engaging in the practice of scalping -- selling the stock of the public companies they were simultaneously recommending to others to purchase.

Utah 2002)., On September 30, 2002, the U.S. Securities and Exhange Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the District of Utah charging 13 individuals and a Dallas broker-dealer with securities fraud in a scheme to manipulate the stock of Freedom Surf, Inc. from July 2000 through November 2000.  Freedom Surf, a Nevada corporation then headquartered in Huntington Beach, California is now known as Freestar Technologies, Inc., and is under new management.  At the time of the manipulation, Freedom Surf was a start-up company that purported to manufacture wetsuits and other surf-related apparel.  Freedom Surfs stock was traded on the NASDs Over-The-Counter Bulletin Board (OTC-BB)., Charged in the SECs Complaint are:, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , The SECs Complaint alleges that Phelan Sr. originated the scheme to manipulate Freedom Surf stock, and enlisted Allen Wolfson to carry it out.  In July and August 2000, Phelan, his son, Phelan, Jr. and Brown, transferred 345,000 Freedom Surf shares at no cost to Wolfson.  Wolfson then deposited the shares in accounts he controlled at Olsen Payne.  Then, Allen Wolfson and his son, David Wolfson, directed Kirkpatrick, a stock trader at Olsen Payne, to bid up the price of Freedom Surf by posting artificially high quotations for the stock.  Pozner, a trader at Glenn Michael Financial, bid up the stock price in concert with Kirkpatrick and on Allen Wolfsons instructions.  Through these manipulative activities, Wolfson and the other defendants caused the Freedom Surf stock price to increase from $5 to $40 in approximately two months, before the stock was split 4 for 1 on October 11, 2000.     , The Complaint also alleges that Salomon Grey, Koupas and Rowe had a pre-existing arrangement with Phelan Sr. and Allen Wolfson to obtain free and deeply discounted blocks of Freedom Surf stock for retail sales to the public at manipulated prices. On October 24, 2000, Tippetts directed Kirkpatrick to deliver 25,000 Freedom Surf shares from the Wolfson-controlled accounts at Olsen Payne to Salomon Grey for $153,125, or $6.125 per share.  Salomon Grey sold over 27,000 shares of Freedom Surf to retail customer accounts, including over 17,000 shares at excessive markups of over 100 percent.    , The Complaint further alleges that the defendants shut down the manipulation after the Commission staff began investigating in early November 2000.  Thereafter, the price of Freedom Surf stock dropped to a low of approximately $.19 per share by the end of December 2000.  In the spring of 2001, the defendants sold over 1.1 million shares of Freedom Surf stock in unregistered transactions from an escrow brokerage account controlled by Brown and Bo Phelan, and from the Chapman-controlled Canadian accounts., The Commissions complaint seeks permanent injunctions against Wolfson, Phelan, David Wolfson, Kirkpatrick, Pozner, Chapman, three Wolfson-controlled entities holding brokerage accounts that were involved in the manipulation  (Feng Shui Consultants, Inc., A-Z Professional Consultants Retirement Trust, Inc., and AZW Irrevocable Trust), Salomon Grey, Koupas and Rowe for violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Complaint also seeks a permanent injunction against Bo Phelan, Craig Brown, John Cruickshank, Tippetts and Roundtree, for aiding and abetting the foregoing violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5.  The Commission asks the Court to impose a permanent injunction against Salomon Grey from violating, and against Koupas, Rowe and Roundtree for aiding and abetting the violation of, the antifraud provisions for broker-dealers, Section 15(c)(1) of the Exchange Act and Rule 15c1-2 thereunder.  The Commission asks the Court to impose a permanent injunction against Wolfson, Phelan, Bo Phelan, Brown, Tippetts, Chapman, Kirkpatrick, the three Wolfson-controlled entities, Salomon Grey, Koupas and Rowe from violating Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933.  , The Commission also asks the Court to order an accounting, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, civil money penalties, and an order prohibiting Phelan, Brown and Cruickshank from serving as an officer or director of any public company.  The Commission also seeks to prohibit Wolfson, Phelan, Bo Phelan, Brown, Tippetts, Chapman, and the three Wolfson-controlled entities from participating in any offering of penny stock.  , This is the Commissions second action relating to Freedom Surf.  On March 6, 2002, the Commission brought securities fraud and related charges against Freedom Surfs former officers and others arising out of the recording of $5 million in fictitious assets on the companys books.

Utah)  , On September 26, 2002, United States District Court Judge Dee Benson entered a Final Judgment of Permanent Injunction against defendant Pete J. Buffo in the above case.  The judgment prohibits future violations of the registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In its amended complaint in the case, the Commission alleged that Buffo engaged in fraudulent schemes by selling high-yield promissory notes to investors throughout the United States.  The notes were issued by Laser Leasing, Inc. and Capital Acquisitions, Inc., which were allegedly controlled by Buffo, but investors were not told that Buffo had been indicted for another fraudulent scheme at the time of the sales.  Investors were also not told, among other things, that the businesses of Laser Leasing and Capital Acquisitions did not produce income sufficient to repay investors; that investors were instead being repaid from the proceeds of investments made by new investors; and that extremely high commissions were being paid to sales personnel.  Buffo consented to entry of the injunction without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions complaint.  Previously, Buffo has pleaded guilty to criminal charges deriving from the same schemes, and has been ordered to pay $8,162,743 in restitution to investors in the schemes., On the same day, Judge Benson entered an order dismissing, on the Commissions motion, several entities controlled by Buffo and defendant Clealon B.

Whalen</i>, (United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts) (Civil Action No. 02 CV 11913 JLT)</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on September 30, 2002 it filed a civil injunctive action for financial fraud against three former officers of Interspeed, Inc., a North Andover, Massachusetts Internet hardware developer.  In the suit, filed in federal court in the District of Massachusetts, the Commission alleged that the three defendants participated in fraudulent revenue recognition, causing Interspeed to engage in a $9 million fraud which inflated its reported sales between 25% and 93% from January to September 2000.  One defendant, Christopher P. Whalen, has agreed to settle the matter by agreeing to a permanent injunction and payment of disgorgement and a civil monetary penalty., The Commissions complaint names Arthur A. Goodwin of Plano, Texas (formerly of Boxford, Massachusetts), William J. Burke of Andover, Massachusetts and Christopher P. Whalen of Bolton, Massachusetts.  According to the complaint, Goodwin, the companys senior vice president of world-wide sales, orchestrated the scheme to inflate revenue in order to meet analysts revenue expectations and to boost his own bonus.  The Commission alleges that Goodwin, with Whalens assistance, arranged improper transactions with customers in which secret side letters relieved them of any obligation to pay until the goods were sold to an end-user.  Accounting rules prohibit recognizing revenue on such contingent sales.  The Commission also alleges that Goodwin arranged round-trip transactions in which funds were funneled to a customer for it to use in paying for Interspeed product.  In addition, Goodwin allegedly forged a signature and falsified the terms of a contract, thereby causing a non-existent transaction to be recognized improperly on Interspeeds books for the 3rd quarter of 2000.  This $6.4 million transaction constituted 92% of Interspeeds reported income for the quarter. , The Commissions complaint alleges that Burke, the companys chief financial officer, recorded the contingent sales as revenue even though he was aware of the side terms which made revenue recognition improper.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Burke altered accounting records to keep Interspeeds outside auditors from discovering that the sales were shams.  Through the alteration, the complaint alleges, Burke and Goodwin made it appear that Interspeed was receiving payment for the round-tripping sales in which Interspeed provided the funds to the customer., According to the complaint, Interspeeds directors uncovered the fraudulent scheme in late September 2000, and the company restated its financial results for the first three quarters of its fiscal year ended September 30, 2000, reducing its originally reported revenue of $14 million to $5 million.  Goodwin and Whalen were terminated in October 2000.  Burke resigned in August 2000.  Interspeed has since ceased operations., In its complaint, the Commission requests that the court issue a final judgment permanently enjoining Goodwin, Burke and Whalen from violating or aiding and abetting violations of the antifraud, periodic reporting, record keeping and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-13 and 13b2-1, and additionally as to Goodwin and Burke, Rule 13b2-2, which prohibits officers of a company from lying to auditors as well as, for Burke, Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, which requires maintenance of internal accounting controls.  The Commission also seeks disgorgement of the bonuses and sales commissions the defendants received based on the fraudulent sales.  According to the complaint, Goodwin received over $70,000, Burke received $41,000 and Whalen received $1,361.  In addition, the Commissions complaint asks the court to impose civil monetary penalties.  The Commission is also seeking an order permanently barring Goodwin and Burke from acting as officers or directors of any public company., Whalen, without admitting or denying the allegations against him, has agreed to settle the matter by consenting to an injunction, to pay disgorgement of his entire revenue-based bonus of $1,361 and to payment of a civil monetary penalty of $15,000.  In accepting Whalens offer of settlement, the Commission considered Whalens cooperation during the Commissions investigation., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp17758.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr17758.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Friedman of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia issued an Order of Preliminary Injunction against David Chen Yu and Quest Capital Strategies, Inc.

The Preliminary Injunction  arose out of Yus alleged violation of a supervisory bar the Commission imposed on him last October, <u>Quest Capital Strategies, Inc. and David Chen Yu</u>, Exchange Act Release No. 44935 (October 15, 2001).     , In a memorandum opinion issued the same day, Judge Friedman found that the Commission had made the required strong <u>prima facie</u> case that Yu had violated the supervisory bar by retaining a significant degree of supervisory control of Quest, a registered broker-dealer with which he is associated.  The opinion cited evidence that Yu remained involved in decisions regarding hiring and firing of key personnel at the broker-dealer, including brokers and compliance personnel, and retained at least secondary responsibility for advising on the termination of brokers and the hiring and supervision of compliance personnel.  Judge Friedman also found that Yu and Quest had violated Section 15(b)(6)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in that Yu had associated with a broker-dealer (Quest) in violation of a Commission bar and Quest had permitted him to do so although aware of the bar.

FASTOW, FORMER CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER OF ENRON, WITH FRAUD, The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil enforcement action today against Andrew S. Fastow, the former chief financial officer of Enron Corp., alleging violations of the anti-fraud, periodic reporting, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws.  The Commission is seeking disgorgement of all ill-gotten gains, including all compensation received subsequent to the commencement of the alleged fraud, civil money penalties, a permanent bar from acting as a director or officer of a publicly held company, and an injunction from future violations of the federal securities laws.  The Commission brought this action in coordination with the Justice Departments Enron Task Force, which filed a related criminal complaint against Fastow., The complaint allegations stem from Fastows conduct relating to six transactions.  Three of the transactions, RADR, Chewco, and Southampton, were the subject of the Commissions earlier settled action against Michael Kopper.  Those transactions were part of an alleged scheme to hide Fastows and Koppers interest in and control of certain entities in order to keep those entities off Enrons balance sheet.  This was done, according to the complaint, for self-enrichment and to mislead analysts, rating agencies, and others about Enrons true financial condition.  As to Fastows role in RADR, Chewco, and Southampton, the complaint alleges that Fastow secretly nominated certain of the owners of these entities, funded certain of their investments through undisclosed loans, collected undisclosed fees, and demanded and received under-the-table payments, including payments to himself and his family members disguised as yearly $10,000 non-taxable gifts.  , Two of the remaining three transactions, the Nigerian barges and the Cuiaba transaction, are alleged to have been sham sales - best described as secret asset-parking arrangements.  In one of these sales, a sale of an interest in certain Nigerian barges to a financial institution, Fastow is alleged to have personally promised that the financial institution would be taken out of its so-called investment and later arranged for an entity he controlled to buy the financial institutions interest at a pre-arranged rate of return on a pre-arranged time table.  , In the second sale, Enron entered into a transaction with an off-balance-sheet entity controlled by Fastow to sell an interest in a severely troubled power plant in Cuiaba, Brazil, in order to avoid consolidation of project debt and recognize earnings.  In connection with this transaction, Fastow allegedly entered into an unwritten side agreement with Enron requiring Enron to buy back the interest it just sold to Fastow at a guaranteed profit.   , The last set of allegations included in the complaint relate to an alleged instance of backdating documents to avoid diminution in Enrons investment in the stock of a technology company.  Specifically, according to the complaint, in September 2000, Fastow and others created documents that purported to lock in the value of Enrons investment in that company back in August of 2000, when that companys stock was trading at its all-time high price.  , Throughout the period of his alleged fraudulent conduct, Fastow sold millions of dollars worth of Enron securities., Specifically, the Commissions complaint further alleges as follows:, , , , , , , The complaint alleges that by engaging in the above-described conduct, Fastow violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act); violated and aided and abetted the violation of Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2; aiding and abetting the violation of Sections 13(a), and 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13; and acted as a controlling person of Enron Corp. and certain of its executives and employees within the meaning of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, and by virtue of that control, violated and aided and abetted the violation of the above-enumerated Exchange Act provisions and rules., The Commissions investigation is continuing.

Rollert, United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, Cr. No. 01-10031-RWZ (D. Mass.)</i>, The Commission announced that, on September 26, 2002, Gordon J. Rollert, of Wellesley, Massachusetts, pled guilty to two counts of wire fraud and one count of mail fraud.  Rollert, formerly the principal of registered investment advisers Sage Advisory Services LLC (Sage) and Standard Group Holdings LLC (Standard) of Wellesley, Massachusetts, was indicted on these counts by the U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts in January 2001. The indictment alleged that Rollert made false statements to a registered broker-dealer in connection with a fraudulent soft dollar scheme., On February 8, 2001, the Commission filed a Complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts in connection with the same fraudulent scheme.  The Commissions Complaint alleged that, between 1990 and April 1997, Rollert defrauded an advisory client, the Pakachoag Church, of more than $1.1 million.  In its complaint, the Commission alleged that Rollert misappropriated the assets of the small Auburn, Massachusetts church through fraudulent soft dollar practices and by fraudulently offering investments in his own advisory business to the church., According to the Complaint, Rollert misappropriated soft dollar credits generated by trades effected for the Churchs endowment fund, for which he served as investment adviser.  The Complaint alleged that between August 1994 and April 1997, Rollert fraudulently submitted invoices to a Boston area broker-dealer for soft dollar services that FA Partners purportedly provided.  In fact, FA Partners was a shell that Rollert controlled.  After receiving soft dollar checks payable to FA Partners, Rollert deposited the checks into an account that he controlled.  Rollert then withdrew the majority of the funds for his personal use., In addition, the Complaint alleged that Rollert, without disclosure to its clients, improperly used soft dollar credits to pay for over $180,000 in business and in undocumented expenses.  The Commission also alleged that Rollert set the commissions paid by the Church at a rate five times the average commission rate paid by other investment advisers for soft dollar trades and that Rollert churned the Churchs endowment account.  Further, the Complaint alleged that between 1990 and 1996 Rollert fraudulently induced the Church to invest $250,000 in Rollerts advisory entities.  Finally, according to the Complaint, the Forms ADV filed with the Commission by Sage and Standard were false because they failed to disclose that Rollerts entities received economic benefits from non-clients, including soft dollars., Soft dollar arrangements are arrangements under which products or services other than execution of securities transactions are obtained by an adviser from or through a broker-dealer in exchange for the direction by the adviser of client brokerage transactions to the broker-dealer.

Soft dollar arrangements are permissible under the securities laws if there is appropriate disclosure to the client about the products and services for which the soft dollars will be used, as well as disclosure that the client may pay higher commission rates as a result of the soft dollar arrangement.   , As a result of the conduct described in the Complaint, the Commission charged Rollert with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 207 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and aiding and abetting Sages violations of Sections 206(1), and 206(2) of the Advisers Act.  The Commissions Complaint sought injunctive relief, disgorgement of $1.1 million in improperly-obtained benefits, plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties, In addition, on July 27, 2001, the Commission announced the institution, and simultaneous settlement, of administrative proceedings against Sage and Standard for their role in the fraudulent soft dollar scheme.  The Order required Sage and Standard, jointly and severally, to pay disgorgement of $1.2 million, provided, however, that all but $304,852 shall be waived based on the Respondents demonstrated financial inability to pay, and imposed other relief.

The Complaint alleges that, between December 1996 and March 1999, Alvieri fraudulently induced at least three of his advisory clients to purchase at least $555,800 worth of shares of either the Diversified Financial Fund or the Diversified Equity Fund, both of which Alvieri knew did not exist.  To induce additional investments in the Funds and conceal the fraud, Alvieri and Diversified engaged in further wrongdoing, including providing the clients with falsified monthly account statements that baselessly reported that the Funds were generating steady returns and telling at least one client that his investment was on deposit in a Financial Fund account at a broker-dealer that did not exist.    The Complaint further alleges that Alvieri misrepresented to his clients that he was the adviser to the Funds and that, through the Funds, he would invest his clients assets in publicly traded securities.

According to the complaint, Thomas Gibson tipped Harry Krause concerning the pending disclosure.  Armed with the information, Harry Krause sold all 22,000 shares of his Cell Pathways stock and avoided losses of over $400,000., The Commissions complaint alleges that on September 20, 2000, Thomas Gibson, a former director of Cell Pathways, learned that the FDA had denied Cell Pathways New Drug Application.  According to the complaint, within minutes of learning the news, Thomas Gibson called his longtime friend Harry Krause, who is now deceased, and tipped him.

Mallory, a resident of Boston, Massachusetts and Anamars former chief executive officer.  In its complaint, filed on March 15, 2002, the Commission alleged that Mallory defrauded at least 14 investors of approximately $130,000 by promising them that they could double their money within 90 days if they purchased Anamar stock at five cents per share. According to the complaint, Mallory fraudulently induced investments in Anamar by, among other things, misrepresenting to potential investors that:  (i) Verizon Communications, Inc., had agreed to purchase Anamar stock at ten cents per share; (ii) investing in Anamar was essentially risk-free because, even if the Verizon deal fell through, Verizon had agreed to pay an opt-out fee that would allow investors to sell their shares back to Anamar; (iii) Anamar was pursuing other lucrative deals that could potentially cause Anamars stock price to increase one hundredfold, and (iv) Mallory had scheduled a meeting with Bill Gates of Microsoft.   , On April 24, 2002, the United States Attorneys Office filed a criminal complaint against Mallory in connection with the scheme described in the Commissions complaint. Mallory pled guilty to two counts of mail fraud on May 28, 2002.

September 14, 2000) , The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) announced today that on September 20, 2002, a panel of the British Columbia Securities Commission (BCSC) ordered Jesse Hogan, a Canadian citizen who resides in British Columbia, to pay an administrative penalty of $25,000 and banned him from trading in or purchasing any security and engaging in investor relations for 10 years.  The Order was based on the previous findings of the panel that Hogan violated Canadian securities laws through five Internet pump and dump stock price manipulations in July and August of 2000.  <u>See</u> <u>Re Jesse J. Hogan</u> 2002 BCSECCOM 811; <u>Re Jesse J. Hogan</u> 2002 BCSECCCOM 537.  The panel also authorized the staff of the BCSC to apply to the British Columbia Supreme Court for an order disgorging $41,752 (U.S.) in total profits Hogan derived from the scheme.  Previously, on January 15, 2002, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois had permanently enjoined Hogan from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder as a result of his conduct in the stock price manipulations., According to the Commissions complaint, Hogan used the same technique for each stock manipulation.  First, Hogan accumulated a substantial position in the stock of a company quoted on the NASDAQ OTC Bulletin Board.  Hogan then, after the close of the market and through the opening of the market the following trading day, used alias screen names to post hundreds of messages about the targeted Bulletin Board company on Internet message boards and sent numerous e-mails with the identical message.  The spam postings and e-mails falsely claimed that a well-known blue chip company would soon acquire the outstanding stock of the targeted company at a substantial premium over its current market price.  The spam postings and e-mails prompted a surge in the price and volume of the targeted companys stock.  Hogan then liquidated his position, selling into the buying surge he created.  , Based on this conduct, the BCSC panel found that: (1) Hogan, with the intention of effecting trades in the companies shares, made statements that he knew were misrepresentations, contrary to section 50(1)(d) of the <i>Securities Act</i>, RSBC 1996, c. 418; (2) Hogan manipulated the market by engaging in a series of transactions relating to trades in and acquisition of the companies shares that he knew would result in artificial prices for the shares, contrary to section 57.1(a) of the <i>Securities Act</i>, RSBC 1996, c. 418; and (3) Hogans misrepresentations and market manipulations seriously impaired the integrity of the capital markets and were contrary to the public interest.  , For tips on how to avoid Internet pump-and-dump stock manipulation schemes, visit <a href=/investor/online/pump.htm target=_top>http://www.sec.gov/investor/online/pump.htm</a>.

The Commission has agreed to waive disgorgement and to not seek a civil penalty from Skadra based on representations Skadra made in his sworn financial statement.    , According to the Commissions complaint, Covey and Skadra caused SSA to misstate its financial results during its fiscal years 1994 through 1996 by improperly reporting revenue on sales of a UNIX-language software product before the product was developed sufficiently to support revenue recognition under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).  The complaint alleged that Covey and Skadra knew or were reckless in not knowing that the software did not function properly and that there were significant uncertainties about customer acceptance of that software.  The complaint also alleged that, during SSAs fiscal years 1995 and 1996, SSA improperly recognized an additional $52 million in revenue from sales of UNIX software to middlemen, which sales were subject to material conditions or otherwise did not satisfy GAAP.  According to the complaint, the conduct of Covey, Skadra, and SSA resulted in substantial losses to those public investors who purchased SSA stock during the period when the companys financial statements were misstated.    , The consent judgments enjoin Covey from violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder.

The SECs Complaint, filed June 1, 2000, alleged that the Defendants offered and sold securities in the form of nine-month promissory notes without registering them with the SEC. In furtherance of the scheme, the Complaint alleged that the Defendants, directly and indirectly, through a nationwide sales network, made numerous false and misleading statements to investors about the World Vision notes.  The Defendants misrepresented that the notes were unconditionally guaranteed and insured and that all of the proceeds of the offering would be used to develop World Visions products. In reality, the Defendants allegedly used the proceeds of the note offering to pay for the personal and business expenses of company officers and directors, to cover interest and principal payments to investors and to pay large, undisclosed commissions to the sales network.

The complaint alleges that, from 1998 through the third quarter of 2001, ACLN was the vehicle for an exceptionally bold and elaborate financial fraud that resulted in losses of hundreds of millions of dollars to investors in the U.S. and abroad.  Defendants Abderrazak Aldo Labiad, Joseph J.H. Bisschops and Alex de Ridder, who controlled the Company, are alleged by the Commission to have constructed a fraudulent scheme to represent ACLN as a substantial business entity with escalating profits when it was, in fact, little more than a shell company.   From 1998 through 2001, specifically, they caused ACLN to grossly misrepresent its revenues and income, fabricate an entire line of business, and claim ownership of assets that did not exist or it did not own.  The Commission alleges that Labiad, Bisschops and de Ridder exploited their financial fraud by selling over $80 million in ACLN stock at inflated prices., The common stock of ACLN was traded on the Nasdaq National Market System and, additionally, on the New York Stock Exchange until March 18, 2002, when it was de-listed immediately following a Commission trading suspension.

Robles, a certified public accountant based in Dallas, Texas, guilty on charges of participating in a massive insider-trading scheme that yielded illegal profits of more than $1.3 million in 31 different stocks.

In violation of NationsBanks policies, Svoboda misappropriated confidential information about yet-to-be-announced tender offers and financial results involving NationsBanks clients, and disclosed it to Robles, who traded in advance of the public announcements of tender offers or financial results.

GOLDBERG</i>, Civil Action No. CV 02-7852-JFW (FMOx) (C.D. Cal.), <u>SEC CHARGES GAMING COMPANY WITH FINANCIAL FRAUD </u>, The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed and settled charges against Las Vegas Entertainment Network, Inc. and its CEO and CFO for fraudulently overstating its assets.  The Commissions complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, alleges that the Los Angeles-based company, and two executives -- CEO Joseph A. Corazzi, 52, of Albuquerque, New Mexico, and CFO Carl A. Sambus, 51, of Garden City, New York -- made false statements about certain assets in its 1999 filings with the Commission.  For instance, the company stated that it had a $3 million gold certificate, when in fact the certificate was counterfeit.  Additionally, the Commission filed and settled anti-touting charges against Las Vegas Entertainments investor relations consultant Jay I. Goldberg, 71, of Las Vegas, Nevada.  The complaint alleges that Goldberg hyped or touted Las Vegas Entertainments stock on the Internet in September and October 1999 without disclosing that he had previously received 85,000 company shares as compensation.  , In a related administrative proceeding, the Commission revoked the registration of Las Vegas Entertainments common stock, finding that the company had fraudulently overstated its assets and had failed to file reports with the Commission since the quarterly report filed on September 24, 1999.  The company consented to the entry of the Commission order without admitting or denying its findings.    , Las Vegas Entertainment trades on the over-the-counter market (symbol: LVEN.PK) and claims to be in the gaming industry.  Previously, the Commission suspended the trading of Las Vegas Entertainments stock in October 1999.  In addition to the counterfeit gold certificate listed on its balance sheet, the complaint alleges that Las Vegas Entertainment falsely reported that it had $3.5 million worth of  marketing rights for the El Rancho Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada when in fact those rights had expired.  The expired rights and counterfeit gold comprised virtually all of the companys assets in 1999.  Also, the company stated that it had received a $190 million cash investment and then made a tender offer in October 1999 for an NYSE-listed gaming company.  The cash investment, however, was based on counterfeit Indonesian bank guarantees and the tender offer was therefore fraudulent and subsequently withdrawn.    , The complaint charges Las Vegas Entertainment, Corazzi and Sambus with violating the antifraud provisions (Sections 10(b) and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 14a-9 thereunder) and reporting provisions (Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-13 thereunder), and Goldberg with violating the anti-touting provision (Section 17(b) of the Securities Act of 1933), of the federal securities laws.<b><i> </i></b> Simultaneously, all of the defendants settled the Commissions action without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  All agreed not to commit future violations of the charged federal securities laws.  In addition, Corazzi and Sambus agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  Finally, Corazzi, Sambus and Goldberg agreed to pay civil penalties in the amounts of $75,000, $25,000, and $10,000, respectively.,  , , <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp17779.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr17779.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Dowdell, in which Dowdell, utilizing various marketers, raised more than $70 million from investors in the U.S. and abroad for a fictitious trading program purportedly involving the purchase and sale of foreign bank instruments and purportedly being operated by Vavasseur Corporation, a Bahamian corporation that is also named as a defendant in this action.   Dowdell previously admitted the fraud, and consented to the disgorgement of all of his assets. According to the SECs complaint, Mason and Mechlenburg were marketers for the program, and received hundreds of thousands of dollars in commissions in connection with their introduction of investors into the program., The contempt motion against Mason, filed on June 20, 2002, arose from his omission of a bank account containing approximately $27,000 from an accounting he submitted to the Court in November, in violation of accounting requirements contained in the TRO, and for his dissipation of those funds without the knowledge or permission of the court, in violation of the asset freeze requirements of the TRO.  The ruling came after an evidentiary hearing was held on the matter.  This is the second time that the Court has held Mason in contempt.  The Court previously found Mason in contempt on March 14, 2002, following the SECs filing of the motion on February 6, 2002, for transferring $5,000 out of one of his accounts on the day that he learned of the TRO. , The contempt motion against Mechlenburg, filed on August 16, 2002, arose from her transfer of all of her assets overseas in violations of the asset freeze and repatriation provisions of the TRO.  The SEC learned of this transfer from a neighbor of Mechlenburg, who reported in July 2002 that two gentleman were loading the contents of Ms. Mechlenburgs rented home into a large industrial shipping container.   The shipping container was shipped our of the country before the SEC could obtain an order preventing its removal.  Mechlenburg had previously moved to an undisclosed location in Europe shortly after the Court entered a permanent injunction against Dowdell.

Thotam of Lockport, Illinois for illegally trading on misappropriated information about fifty-one companies featured in the Inside Wall Street column of <i>Business Week</i> magazine.  The Commission alleged that Thotam, then a New York City rent examiner, illicitly obtained the information from a postal worker friend who read the relevant portions of the magazine to him before public release, in violation of postal regulations.  Thotam traded in the Inside Wall Street stocks for nearly two and a half years, reaping profits of $77,213.38., The Commission also announced that it has reached a settlement with Thotam.  Thotam has consented, without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions Complaint, to the entry of a final judgment that (1) permanently enjoins Thotam from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and (2) orders Thotam to disgorge the $77,213.38 in profits and to pay prejudgment interest in the sum of $22,337.20 (subject to a credit for amounts he pays toward any restitution ordered in connection with parallel criminal charges to which he pled guilty today).   The Commission has submitted the proposed final consent judgment to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York., The Commissions Complaint alleges as follows:, From August 1996 through January 1999, Thotam used information misappropriated from <i>Business Week</i> magazine before its public release to execute in excess of sixty-four trades in the securities of fifty-one companies featured in forty-three IWS columns.  Thotam improperly obtained this information from a friend employed by the United State Postal Service, who, at Thotams request, read the column when the magazine passed through a Mount Vernon, New York postal sorting facility on its way to subscribers and news stands.  The postal worker tipped the information to Thotam in violation of Postal Service confidentiality requirements.  Thotam paid the postal worker $10,000 for the information.  Thotam placed all of his purchase orders shortly before the close of the market on Thursday afternoons, before the magazines release later that evening, and Thotam generally sold the shares the next day for total profits of  $77,213.38.   By these actions, Thotam violated the antifraud provisions of the Exchange Act. , The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the American Stock Exchange and the United States Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp17784.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr17784.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

(filed October 15, 2002), <p align=CENTER>FORMER KEYSTONE BANK EMPLOYEES<br/>SETTLE SEC CHARGES OF INSIDER TRADING  , On October 15, 2002, the Commission filed a settled Complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia alleging that Lorene Ellen Turpin, a former Vice-President of First National Bank of Keystone (Keystone Bank), and Lora K. McKinney, a former proof machine operator at Keystone Bank, sold Keystone Bank stock while in possession of material nonpublic information about the adverse financial condition of Keystone Bank and improper activities conducted at the bank.  According to the Complaint, between June 18, 1999 and July 8, 1999, Turpin and McKinney each sold 1,050 Keystone Bank shares at $220 per share and thus each avoided losses of $231,000.  Both defendants also tried to sell additional Keystone Bank stock but were unsuccessful., The Commissions Complaint specifically alleges that at the time Turpin and McKinney sold their stock they knew that Keystone Bank had accepted millions of dollars in brokered deposits in violation of a directive from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) that prohibited Keystone Bank from accepting brokered deposits.  Brokered deposits are deposits of money obtained by Keystone Bank through a broker for which the bank pays the broker a fee.  Turpin and McKinney also believed that a senior Keystone Bank executive was stealing money from the bank and falsifying bank records to hide the transactions.  By June 1999, based on the adverse material nonpublic information that Turpin and McKinney had about Keystone Bank, each knew that the bank was at risk of collapsing., On September 1, 1999, the OCC declared Keystone Bank to be insolvent, and appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as receiver for the bank.  The insolvency determination followed the OCCs discovery that the assets of Keystone Bank had been overstated by as much as $515 million., Simultaneously with the filing of the Commissions Complaint, Turpin and McKinney, without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, each consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining them from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Uselton, the former CEO of Mountain Energy, Inc., in a case filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission in September 2001.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, Uselton agreed to be permanently restrained and enjoined from violating the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws (Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder).  Uselton also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of any public company.  In settlement of its claims against Uselton, the Commission did not seek a civil penalty based on Useltons submission of sworn financial statements to the Commission.  , According to the allegations in the Commissions complaint, Uselton participated in an illegal pump-and-dump scheme in the securities of Mountain Energy, Inc., a start-up energy company headquartered in Houston, Texas.  During the spring and summer of 1998, Uselton and others published six fraudulent press releases that misrepresented the ownership, nature and value of Mountain Energys assets.

Matthias Heinzelmann, III, the former executive vice president of Surety Bank of Fort Worth, Texas (Surety Bank), to a term of 36 months probation with six months of home confinement, in connection with an elaborate scheme through which Heinzelmann used bank customers money to conceal bad loans and inflate bank revenues.  In addition, the Court ordered Heinzelmann to pay a $10,000 fine., Previously, Heinzelmann entered into a plea agreement with the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Texas, Dallas Division, pursuant to which he pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to make false entries in the books and records of a bank.  By conducting the scheme, Heinzelmann also violated the federal securities laws.  These violations are the subject of the Commissions pending civil action against Heinzelmann, filed in the Northern District of Texas, Ft. Worth Division, on April 25, 2002.  In its action, the Commission is seeking a permanent injunction, an officer and director bar, and a civil money penalty.  , According to the Commissions complaint, from 1996 through September 1999, Heinzelmann, while president and director of Surety Capital Corporation (Surety Capital), a Fort Worth based reporting company whose sole asset is Surety Bank, a wholly-owned subsidiary, engaged in an elaborate scheme to conceal loan losses incurred by Surety Bank.  The scheme had a material impact on financial statements included in Surety Capitals Forms 10-K and 10-Q.  Specifically, Surety Capital overstated its pre-tax income by 7% in 1996, and understated its pre-tax losses by 16% in 1997 and 97% in 1998.  Further, Surety Capital failed to file its Form 10-Q for the period ending September 30, 1999.  Because of the scheme, Surety Capital failed to make and keep books, records and accounts that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflected its transactions and dispositions of assets.  Surety Capital also failed to maintain an adequate system of internal financial controls.  , At the time the Commission filed its complaint against Heinzelmann, it simultaneously instituted settled administrative cease-and-desist proceedings against Surety Capital for violations of the reporting, internal controls, and books and records provisions of the Exchange Act.,  , <!--<P><IMG SRC=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=9 ALT= BORDER=0>  <A href=/litigation/complaints/comp17788.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</A></P>--><!-- End text -->,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr17788.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The Commission filed its action on July 31, 2002, and a California federal court entered temporary restraining orders and asset freezes against the defendants on August 1.  The court orally entered preliminary injunctions and asset freezes against Lefebvre and RMO Assets Management during an October 1 hearing, and issued a written preliminary injunction and asset freeze order against Herula, Capalbo and Watch Hill Capital Management on October 15.  , The Commission alleged in its complaint that Lefebvre, acting through RMO Assets Management and Watch Hill Capital Management, falsely promised investors exorbitant returns, such as a 100% return per week, through a fraudulent prime bank trading program.  The Commissions complaint alleged that Herula aided and abetted Lefebvres violations of the federal securities laws, and named Capalbo as a relief defendant on the grounds that she received at least $3 million of investor funds to which she had no legitimate claim.  The complaint further alleged that, in the span of several weeks in July 2002, Lefebvre, Herula, and Capalbo spent at least $4 million in investor funds on personal and luxury items such as cars, jewelry, and large hotel bills.  , The court entered preliminary injunctions against Lefebvre, RMO Assets Management, Herula, Capalbo and Watch Hill Capital Management, prohibiting them from committing further violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws [Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder].

(Lorus) and Capital Management Fund, Limited Partnership (Capital) (collectively, the defendants) should not be held in civil contempt was filed by the Commission on October 8, 2002, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, based on the defendants failure to provide an accounting, as required by the Courts September 12, 2002 preliminary injunction order.  That order enjoined Eskind, Lorus and Capital from violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Eskind and Lorus from violations of Section 206 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  On October 11, 2002, the Honorable Marvin H. Shoob, United States District Judge for the Northern District of Georgia, entered an Order requiring Eskind, Lorus and Capital to show cause why they should not be held in civil contempt for their violation of the Courts September 12, 2002 order.     , The Commissions complaint, filed on September 3, 2002, alleged that Eskind is a recidivist violator who was preliminarily enjoined in June 1997 and permanently enjoined on January 12, 1998 from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. Eskind was subsequently barred by the Commission from association with any investment adviser. That case was based upon allegations of fraudulent conduct by Eskind which included misappropriating investors funds, failing to disclose that Eskind had been suspended by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in 1991, and inducing at least five investors to invest at least $500,000 in what was falsely represented to the investors to be a specified limited partnership. In fact, Eskind had been previously terminated from that partnership. The complaint further alleged that subsequent to being enjoined, and continuing until the filing of the complaint, Eskind raised at least $3 million through sales of limited partnership units in Capital.  Capital purportedly does business by trading in securities through initial or secondary public offerings. The sales materials misrepresented to investors Eskinds broker-dealer experience, and did not disclose his 1991 NYSE suspension, the Commissions 1997 civil action or the Commissions 2000 order barring him from association with an investment adviser. The complaint alleged that investors were told that IRA accounts had been opened for them at a trust company which serves as an IRA custodian and had received statements from Lorus indicating their funds in those accounts. In fact, no such accounts have been opened. The sales materials falsely stated that a major law firm provided legal representation for Lorus.

The Commission alleges that, to date, defendants have fraudulently obtained over $7 million from approximately 100 investors in the offering of unregistered Holdings securities. The complaint alleges that, since January 2000, defendants have misled investors through a host of patently false representations about Holdings  including a repeated misrepresentation that Holdings would conduct an initial public offering (IPO) in the near future., The Commission has moved for a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction and other interim relief to preserve the status quo.  Pending the outcome of that motion, on the Commissions application, the court has temporarily restrained the defendants from violating antifraud, registration, and books and records provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and from participating in any penny stock offerings.

Smith had previously entered a guilty plea on May 16, 2002, to one count of securities fraud and one count of mail fraud., The criminal information to which Smith pled guilty charged that from October, 1997 through July, 1999, Smith raised over $4.3 million from the fraudulent sale of unregistered shares in Great White Marine and Recreation, Inc. (f/k/a Tiger Shark of Texas, Inc.), a Waco-based corporation.  As part of his fraudulent scheme, Smith, among other things, falsely represented Great Whites business prospects, overstated its earnings and revenues and caused the corporation to pay an unwarranted stock dividend.  The information also alleged that Smith fraudulently obtained a $310,000 home equity loan from San Antonio Federal Credit Union.  Smith was previously convicted of bank fraud in 1987 and served five years on probation., The criminal case arose, in part, from an earlier Commission lawsuit filed on June 29, 1999 against Smith and Great White.  In the Commission action, Judge Smith permanently enjoined Smith from further violating the federal securities laws and ordered that he surrender seven vehicles, three Lake Corsicana lots, his interest in a townhouse, all securities that he owned, a $100,000 appearance bond, certain Mexican assets and $3 million in cash.  When Smith failed to make the required disgorgement, Judge Smith cited him for contempt on October 11, 2001, and ordered him incarcerated until he complied with the Courts order.  Smith has been incarcerated since October 11th.  The Commission and a court-appointed agent have seized and liquidated assets, recovering more than $1.8 million for the benefit of investors.,  , <!--<P><IMG SRC=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=9 ALT= BORDER=0>  <A href=/litigation/complaints/comp17814.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</A></P>--><i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr17814.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

WITH </b><br/><b>RECORDING FICTITIOUS REVENUE ON THE COMPANYS BOOKS</b>, The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) today filed a settled civil action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that Stephen R. Becker (Becker) violated the antifraud, periodic reporting, and corporate record keeping provisions of the federal securities laws by concealing project contract losses at EA Engineering, Science, and Technology, Inc. (EA Engineering) during the companys fiscal year ended August 31, 1999.  EA Engineering, which has its principal executive offices in Hunt Valley, Maryland, is primarily engaged in the business of energy, environmental, and health and safety consulting.  In September 2001, the company was taken private pursuant to a management-led tender offer. , The Commissions Complaint alleges that Becker, a Regional Controller at EA Engineering at the time, hid the project contract losses by intentionally recording fictitious revenue (in the form of unbilled accounts receivable) on the companys books, thereby concealing the losses from EA Engineering managers who had emphasized the importance of the company making its projected earnings.  The Commission alleged that, as a result of Beckers actions, the company overstated its unbilled accounts receivable at the end of its quarter ended May 31, 1999, by $1,408,800 and at the end of its fiscal year ended August 31, 1999, by $1,469,000 and understated its loss before income taxes by $93,000 for that fiscal year.  Becker, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violations of Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1, and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 and ordering him to pay a civil money penalty of $20,000. , Becker also agreed, without admitting or denying the Commissions substantive findings therein, to settle a proposed administrative proceeding pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the Commissions Rules of Practice.  The settled proceeding, to be based on, and instituted upon, entry of the injunction in the Commissions civil action, suspends Becker from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant, with the right to apply for reinstatement after three years.  ,  , , <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp17815.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>]"

TX)(Dallas Division), <b><u>SEC CHARGES FORMER OFFICER OF PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANY WITH FINANCIAL FRAUD </u></b>, On October 29, 2002, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a securities fraud case in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas (Dallas Division) against Larry Ohms, the former treasurer of Dallas-based United States Lime &amp; Minerals, Inc. (Nasdaq: USLM) (U.S. Lime or the company).  The SEC charged Ohms with financial fraud and other securities law violations related to his embezzlement of nearly $2.2 million from the company during a four-year period.  Ohms, age 40, resides in Carrollton, Texas, According to the complaint, Ohms held a number of positions at U.S. Lime between January 1998 and December 2001, including corporate controller, secretary, treasurer, and vice president of finance.  During that period, Ohms forged the signatures of other company officers on dozens of checks, and falsified the companys check register to create the appearance that the amounts that he personally received or gave to his creditors went to vendors for U.S. Limes legitimate business expenses.  Initially, Ohms embezzled relatively small amounts, but over time, his thefts escalated.  By January 2002, his thefts were too large to conceal, and Ohms abruptly resigned., The SEC further alleges that Ohms acted alone, and without the knowledge of other U.S. Lime employees.  Throughout the relevant period, Ohms supervised U.S. Limes internal accounting controls and financial reporting, and he used his position to escape detection by falsifying the companys books and records, lying to its outside auditors, and preparing false financial statements that he then caused the company to file with the SEC., The companys management, with the help of its outside auditors, discovered the fraud shortly after Ohms resigned.  The company immediately reported Ohms misconduct to the SEC, the criminal authorities, and the Nasdaq.  U.S. Lime also hired expert securities counsel to conduct an internal investigation, and cooperated fully with the SECs investigation of the matter., The specific charges against Ohms include securities fraud, circumventing internal controls, falsifying books and records, lying to auditors, violations of periodic reporting and books and records requirements, in violation of, or aiding and abetting violations of, Sections 10(b), 13(a)(2), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder.  In its Complaint, the Commission requested that Ohms be enjoined from future securities violations, that he be barred from serving in the future as an officer or director of a public company, and that he be ordered to disgorge the full amount that he stole from U.S. Lime, with prejudgment interest.,  , , <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp17816.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>]"

Parr, age 56 of Houston, Texas, a former independent insurance agent, to a term of 27 months in prison, in connection with a $14 million prime bank scheme through which Parr used investors money to pay living expenses and other promoters.  In addition, Judge Lake ordered Parr to pay $3 million in restitution.  Previously, on May 16, 2002, Parr, pursuant to a plea agreement, pled guilty to one count of mail fraud., The conduct underlying Parrs guilty plea was the subject of an earlier Commission civil action against Parr and others filed in the Northern District of Texas, Dallas Division, on November 13, 1998.  According to the Commissions complaint, from September 1996 through November 1998, Parr and others engaged in a scheme to offer and sell unregistered prime bank securities and raised more than $14 million from unwitting investors.  In fact, the prime bank programs were nothing more than a Ponzi scheme.

Belden</i>, Civil Action No. 02-CV-830-E (N.D.Okla.), SEC CHARGES SOUTHMARK ADVISORY, INC., SOUTHMARK, INC., AND WENDELL D. BELDEN WITH SECURITIES FRAUD, BASED ON DECEPTIVE SALES PRACTICES THAT ENRICHED BELDEN AT HIS CLIENTS EXPENSE, The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it filed a securities fraud action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma, against Southmark Advisory, Inc., an SEC-registered investment adviser, Southmark, Inc., an SEC-registered broker-dealer, and Wendell D. Belden, the owner of both firms, all located in Tulsa, Oklahoma.  According to the SECs complaint, from 1996 and through the present, Belden has used Southmark Advisory and Southmark, Inc. to defraud his predominantly elderly clients, by misleading them about their investment options and the security of their invested principal, and by investing their money in a manner calculated to enrich himself at their expense.  , The SEC alleges that Belden attracts seniors who want safe investments by advertising certificates of deposit (CDs) in local periodicals and the yellow pages, and then, in a classic bait and switch maneuver, aggressively pitches to the prospective investors, in lieu of CDs, a purportedly personalized, managed mutual fund investment program.  The SEC alleges that Belden defrauded his clients by lying about the safety of the managed mutual fund program; by failing to tell the clients about other investment options that were more advantageous; by failing to tell the clients that his brokerage firm, Southmark, Inc., would earn a 4% sales commission if the clients invested in the managed mutual fund program; and by failing to tell the clients about disciplinary sanctions that the State of Oklahoma and the NASD had imposed against Belden.  According to the SEC, since 1996 Belden and his Southmark entities have, by way of this fraudulent scheme, sold mutual fund shares worth at least $82,801,550, victimized at least 400 predominantly elderly or retired investors, and fraudulently earned at least $5,000,000, including $3,312,062 in brokerage commissions.  Contrary to Beldens fraudulent assurances that the managed mutual fund investments were as safe as or safer than CDs, many investors have seen the value of their investment in the mutual fund program diminish significantly during the recent bear market., The SEC alleges in its complaint that Southmark Advisory, Southmark, Inc., and Belden violated, and aided and abetted violations of, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933; Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 15b3-1 thereunder; and Sections 204, 206(1), 206(2), 206(4) and 207 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rules 204-1(a)(2), 206(4)-4(a)(2), and 206(4)-4(c) thereunder.  In its action, the SEC asks the court to restrain the defendants temporarily from further violations of the foregoing securities laws, to appoint a receiver to take control of Southmark Advisory and Southmark, Inc. and assist the clients with retaining a legitimate adviser for their accounts, and to freeze the defendants assets, so that the proceeds of the fraud can be preserved and ultimately returned to the investors.  The SEC also requests in its action that the court permanently enjoin Southmark Advisory, Inc., Southmark, Inc., and Belden from violating the federal securities laws, and order them to disgorge all illicit profits from their fraudulent conduct, with prejudgment interest, and pay civil money penalties.  , The SEC staff acknowledges the assistance of the Oklahoma Department of Securities, and District No. 5 of the National Association of Securities Dealers - Regulation, Inc. in the investigation of the facts leading to this action.,  , , <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp17818.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>]"

Becker of Marietta, Georgia, all of whom have been previously enjoined by the Court.  , The Commissions amended complaint alleged a wide-range of securities law violations committed by Johns during 1995 and 1996.  The allegations included Johns: (1) failure to conform with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) resulting in the overstatement in various filings made with the Commission of Vistas revenues, income, earnings per share, and assets during 1995 and 1996 (the misstated amounts ranged up to 83,592% and in most periods, resulted in Vista reporting income when it was, in fact, experiencing losses), (2) failure to disclose the misappropriation of $481,000 in 1996 by Vistas chairman of the board, and (3) engaging in illegal insider selling of Vista common stock during 1996. The Commission alleged in its amended complaint that the misstatements contained in Vistas financial statements, during Johns tenure, were material and caused numerous reports on Forms 10-QSB and 8-K to be false and misleading.  , <u>See also</u>: <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17566.htm>L.R. 17566</a> (June 17, 2002); <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17211.htm>L.R. 17211</a> (October 30, 2001); <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17175.htm>L.R. 17175</a> (October 5, 2001); <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17044.htm>L.R. 17044</a> (June 21, 2001).,  , <!--<P><IMG SRC=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=9 ALT= BORDER=0>  <A href=/litigation/complaints/comp17824.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</A></P>--><i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr17824.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

(Noce, J.)</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) today announced that it had filed a civil action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri against Jawsh Corporation (Jawsh) for offering unregistered securities and acting as an unregistered investment company., The Commissions Complaint alleges that in about 1984 Jawsh was formed as a Missouri corporation by William L. Bates (Bates) of St. Louis, Missouri, who was, at all times, the Companys sole shareholder, officer and director.  The Complaint also alleges that, from about 1987 through about September 2000, Jawsh, through Bates, publicly offered and sold $16 million in unregistered securities to 250 investors in at least 11 states through the means and instruments of interstate commerce and the mails.  The Commissions Complaint also alleges that Jawsh pooled money obtained from investors and invested it, reinvested it and traded in securities without a registration statement being in effect with the Commission as to Jawsh.  The Commissions Complaint also alleges that Jawsh thereby violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 7(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (Investment Company Act).  Simultaneously with the filing of the civil action, Jawsh consented to an order, without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, except as to jurisdiction, which is admitted: (1) enjoining Jawsh from further violations of the registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Investment Company Act; (2) for the Court to immediately take exclusive jurisdiction and possession of Jawsh and its books, records and assets, and to appoint a trustee, pursuant to Section 42(d) of the Investment Company Act, to operate Jawsh and dispose of any or all of Jawshs assets in the best interests of investors, in compliance with the federal securities laws and subject to such terms and conditions as the Court may prescribe; and (3) freezing the Companys assets and preserving its books and records, until the trustee has been appointed. , The Commission also instituted public administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings against Bates based on findings that: from about 1987 through about September 2000, Bates publicly offered and sold $16 million in unregistered securities to 250 investors in at least 11 states to invest and trade in securities, solely at Bates discretion, and caused and willfully aided and abetted Jawsh to act as an unregistered investment company in violation of the registration provisions of the federal securities laws.  Simultaneously with the institution of administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings, Bates consented, without admitting or denying the Commissions findings, except as to jurisdiction, which is admitted, to issuance of a Commission order (Order) ordering Bates to: (1) cease and desist from committing or causing any violation, and any future violation, of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act and Section 7(a) of the Investment Company Act; and (2) comply with his undertakings to: (a) pay the costs of the trustee appointed in the civil action up to $20,000; and (b) cooperate fully, truthfully and without compensation, with the Commission and the trustee, by: transferring Jawshs assets, producing any documents in his possession, custody or control, providing truthful testimony in any depositions and hearings in which his testimony may be relevant, and providing whatever other assistance is requested of him., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp17826.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr17826.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Network International Investment Corporation, et al.</i> Civil Action No. 02-8294 (E.D. Pa.)</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) announced today that it filed an emergency civil action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, alleging an ongoing nationwide affinity fraud, primarily targeting African-American churches, conducted by defendant Abraham L. Kennard, of Wildwood, Georgia, and defendants Network International Investment Corporation (NIIC) and Church Kingdom Investments, Ltd. (Church Kingdom), two companies controlled by him.  The Complaint also names as relief defendants R. Scott Cunningham, of Dalton, Georgia, an attorney, his law firm R. Scott Cunningham, P.C., Carl Grigsby, NIICs Director of Security Services, and Grigsby &amp; Grigsby, LLC, a company owned or controlled by him.  The Honorable John P. Fullam, upon motion of the Commission, entered emergency relief, including a temporary restraining order and asset freezes, against the defendants and relief defendants, and scheduled a hearing on the Commissions motion for a preliminary injunction for November 18, 2002., The Commissions complaint alleges that, from at least January 2001 through the present, NIIC and Kennard have engaged in a deliberate scheme to defraud investors by making false and misleading statements in connection with the unregistered offer and sale of securities, in the form of investment contracts, relating to NIICs so-called Church Funding Project.  NIIC, acting through Kennard, has raised at least $3 million from over 1000 investing churches located throughout the United States.  At least 38 of the defrauded churches are located in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.  Church Kingdom is a vehicle for Kennards fraud and a means through which he has conducted his fraudulent activities., The complaint further alleges that, through various promotional means -- including NIICs website, Kennards presentations at group meetings and religious conferences, telephone solicitations, mailings and a commissioned sales force -- Kennard solicits churches to become members of NIIC by falsely promising huge financial returns.  Specifically, for each investment of $3,000, Kennard promises to pay a return of $500,000.  Kennard tells investors that NIIC will fund the promised returns from a pool of money that NIIC receives for this purpose from four sources:  profit-making corporations; federal government grants; other Christian institutions; and profits from a series of world-wide Christian-based resorts to be built and run by NIICs sister corporation, Church Kingdom.  In fact, NIIC does not have any commitments from profit-making corporations or other institutions to fund this project, and Church Kingdom has built no resorts. As a result of this offering, NIIC has outstanding commitments to investors of at least $500 million., The complaint also alleges that Kennard deposited investor funds into the escrow account of R. Scott Cunningham.  According to Cunningham, although earlier this year the escrow account contained as much as $2 million of investor funds, at present only $160,000 of those funds remain in his account.  In addition, some funds raised by Kennard were wired directly from an investor to Grigsby &amp; Grigsby, LLC., The complaint charges the defendants with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933; Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and NIIC and Kennard with violations of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act.  The complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement, prejudgment interest and the imposition of civil penalties.  The staff moved separately for emergency relief against NIIC, Kennard and Church Kingdom, including a temporary restraining order, a preliminary injunction, an asset freeze, accounting, expedited discovery, and an order preventing the destruction of documents.  Finally, the Commission seeks asset freezes, an accounting and disgorgement from the relief defendants., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp17827.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr17827.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Minn. 2002)</h2>]","[On October 31, 2002, the Commission filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota against Thomas E. Hall (Hall) and Michael J. Rivers (Rivers) alleging that Hall and Rivers perpetrated a fraudulent scheme to artificially increase the closing price of First Federal Capital Corporation (First Federal) common stock.  Hall, of Sioux Falls, South Dakota, was employed as a registered representative and branch manager for U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray Inc. (Piper Jaffray).  Rivers, of Winona, Minnesota, was a customer of Hall at Piper Jaffray.  The Commissions complaint alleges that the purpose of this scheme was to prevent or reduce numerous margin calls Rivers received on his trading accounts at Piper Jaffray.  The complaint also alleges that Hall and Rivers scheme artificially increased the closing price of First Federal common stock, which constituted violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder., Hall consented, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, to the entry of an order of permanent injunction enjoining him from violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and imposing a civil penalty of $50,000.  The litigation against Rivers is pending., Separately, on November 5, 2002, the Commission entered an Order Instituting Proceedings Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (Order) against U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray Inc. (Piper Jaffray).  Piper Jaffray, while neither admitting nor denying the Orders findings, consented to the entry of the Order and the imposition of sanctions against it. , The Commissions Order found that from January 1998 through September 2001, Rivers and Hall engaged in a marking the close scheme.   The Commissions Order found that Rivers and Hall placed day-end trades at artificially higher prices in this stock thereby increasing improperly the stocks closing price so as to satisfy or reduce margin calls on his brokerage accounts at Piper Jaffray., The Commissions Order found that Piper Jaffray failed to supervise Hall and failed to have adequate systems in place to detect or prevent this marking the close scheme.  Because of deficiencies with Piper Jaffrays surveillance procedures and with its structure for supervising producing branch managers, i.e., managers who also act as registered representatives for customers, the firm failed to detect and prevent Halls misconduct. The Order found that there was one supervisor primarily responsible for the supervision of more than 70 producing branch managers.  In addition, Piper Jaffray did not provide this supervisor with information regarding the time the trades were executed and thus was unable to detect marking the close violations.  The Commissions Order also found that Piper Jaffray did not have an exception report capable of identifying end-of-the-day trades in its customer accounts; it instead relied on order ticket approval and/or review to detect possible marking the close violations., The Order censures Piper Jaffray and requires it to maintain the following undertakings: creating a marking the close exception report, and the creation of at least eight District Sales Supervisors to replace the single position previously responsible for supervising producing branch managers.  The Order also requires Piper Jaffray to pay a civil monetary penalty of $100,000., The Commission would like to thank the National Association of Securities Dealers Regulation, Inc. (NASDR) for its assistance in this matter., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp17828.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  ]"

The amended complaint broadens the Commissions charges to allege that WorldCom misled investors from at least as early as 1999 through the first quarter of 2002, and further states that the company has acknowledged that during that period, as a result of undisclosed and improper accounting, WorldCom materially overstated the income it reported on its financial statements by approximately $9 billion., The Commission filed its initial complaint against WorldCom on June 26, 2002, the day after WorldCom announced that it intended to restate its financial results for five quarters-all quarters in 2001 and the first quarter of 2002.

(800America), an Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board company and purported internet retailer; David Elie Rabi (Rabi), chief executive officer, chief financial officer, and a director of 800America; and Tillie Ruth Steeples (Steeples), an undisclosed control person of 800America.  The Commission alleges that the defendants falsified financial results for 800America since at least 2000, unlawfully sold unregistered stock through nominee accounts, failed to disclose the criminal histories of Rabi and Steeples, and made other misrepresentations., The Commission has moved for a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction and other interim relief to preserve the status quo.  Pending the outcome of that motion, on the Commissions application, the court has temporarily restrained the defendants from violating antifraud, registration, and books and records provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act).  The courts order also provides that, pending the outcome of the preliminary injunction motion:  (a) defendants assets and certain nominee brokerage accounts are frozen; (b) the defendants are required to submit accountings; (c) a temporary receiver has been appointed over 800America; (d) Rabi and Steeples are temporarily enjoined from acting as officers or directors of public companies and from participating in the offering of penny stocks; (e) the defendants must repatriate assets held abroad; (f) the parties may engage in expedited discovery; (g) the defendants are prohibited from destroying documents and other evidence; and (h) the defendants are prohibited from tampering with witnesses, suborning perjury or otherwise impeding this case. , Specifically, the complaint alleges that:, As to the three defendants, the complaint alleges that:, 1. <b>800America</b> is a Nevada corporation, has an executive office in New York, and has operations at 1301 North Mount Juliet Road, Mount Juliet, Tennessee.  800America purports to own and operate several Internet websites that retail various products, particularly clothing, or that provide links to websites of other retailers.  , 2. <b>Rabi</b>, age approximately 62, is the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, a Director, and the majority shareholder of 800America.  Rabi also served as 800Americas President for most of the period from July 9, 1999 through January 2002.  On January 3, 1997, Rabi pleaded guilty in McCracken County, Kentucky, to state felony charges of securities fraud, acting as an unregistered broker-dealer, and selling unregistered securities.  Rabi was sentenced to four years imprisonment, which was commuted, based on the four years Rabi had already served in Tennessee state prison fighting extradition to Kentucky on these charges.  , 3. <b>Steeples</b>, age 55, is not disclosed as having any affiliation with 800America in 800Americas public filings, but is acting as an undisclosed control person of the company.  Among other things, she controls some of 800Americas bank accounts, and represents that she is 800Americas Secretary, both in her own name and under the alias Ruth Walley.  On November 14, 1996, in Nashville, Tennessee, Steeples pleaded guilty to delivering cocaine into a prison.  Steeples was sentenced to six years imprisonment for this conduct, and was incarcerated from January 1, 1997 to November 24, 1999., The complaint charges violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b), 13(a), and 13(b)(2), 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, Rules 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder.

Burns (Burns) and Michael F. Hollendoner (Hollendoner), for perpetrating a secret, fraudulent cash-for-business scheme when Santos was City Treasurer. , The Commissions Complaint alleges that from 1995 to 1999, while employed as registered representatives associated with registered broker-dealers approved to do business with the City, Burns and Hollendoner secretly made thousands of dollars in cash payments to Santos.  The Complaint also alleges that, in connection with, and as a result of their cash payments to Santos, Burns and Hollendoner received thousands of dollars in compensation from City business they otherwise would not have earned.  Burns and Hollendoner were and had been, for years, among the Citys top brokers, and had been earning substantial compensation from City business. Santos knew these facts.

In October 2000, Hightower introduced Deyak and Vogt, two New York stockbrokers, to Von Cummings and pitched Paramount as an investment opportunity, and as an opportunity for the brokers to enrich themselves with large fees or commissions.  Deyak informed Louis about the opportunity, and Vogt notified Hawley and Benaouda.  Deyak and Louis made material misrepresentations to clients, including that they invested their own funds with Paramount, in the course of soliciting at least nine investors.  Vogt, Hawley and Benaouda referred the names of at least five investors to Cummings.  Hightower and his downline were ultimately responsible for bringing approximately $6.4 million into the Paramount scheme.  Later, Hightower accepted $720,000 of investor funds from Paramount into his business account, approximately $583,000 of which he distributed to the brokers and Benaouda as commissions.  Hightower kept the remaining funds, approximately $137,000, as his own fee., The amended complaint further alleges that the licensed stockbrokers  Deyak, Louis, Vogt and Hawley  acted as unregistered broker-dealers in selling away from their firms and accepting compensation from Paramount.  , The Commissions amended complaint charges that Deyak and Louis violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b), 15(a) and 15(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and Rule 15c1-2 thereunder., The Commissions amended complaint charges that Hightower aided and abetted Cummings and Paramounts violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In addition, Hightower aided and abetted violations of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act by Deyak, Louis, Vogt, Hawley and Benaouda., The Commissions amended complaint further alleges that Vogt and Hawley violated Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act by accepting compensation from Paramount and selling away from their employer, a brokerage firm.

The Commission sought permanent injunctions, disgorgement of any ill-gotten gains, civil money penalties, and orders barring each defendant from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  (Litigation Release Nos. 17753 and 17771), The judgment entered against David F.

Myers was licensed as a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) from the time he joined WorldCom until December 31, 2001.  Yates was licensed as a CPA from 1988 until January 1, 1999., The judgments entered by the District Court relate to two of the four civil actions the Commission has filed thus far in connection with the financial fraud at WorldCom.  The Commission filed its initial complaint against WorldCom, Inc. on June 26, 2002, the day after WorldCom announced that it intended to restate its financial results for five quarters-all quarters in 2001 and the first quarter of 2002.  (Litigation Release No. 17588.)  That complaint charged WorldCom with violating various antifraud and reporting provisions of the federal securities laws, including Sections 10(b) and 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 13a-1, 13a-13 and 12b-20, during those five quarters.  The Commission also sought the appointment of a corporate monitor, and on July 3, Judge Rakoff appointed former SEC Chairman Richard Breeden to that position., The Commission filed an amended complaint against WorldCom on November 5, adding claims that WorldCom violated the antifraud provision of the Securities Act (Section 17(a)), in connection with several securities offerings during the fraud, and also violated the internal controls and books and records provisions of the Exchange Act (Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B)).  The amended complaint broadened the Commissions charges to allege that WorldCom misled investors from at least as early as 1999 through the first quarter of 2002, and further stated that the company had acknowledged that during that period, as a result of undisclosed and improper accounting, WorldCom materially overstated the income it reported on its financial statements by approximately $9 billion., The Commission has also brought a civil action against Betty L. Vinson and Troy M. Normand, former accountants in WorldComs General Accounting Department (<a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17783.htm>Litigation Release No. 17783</a>)., The Commission acknowledges the assistance and cooperation of the U.S. Attorneys Offices for the Southern District of New York and Southern District of Mississippi, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

(Nasdaq: USLM) (U.S. Lime or the company), from future violations of the federal securities laws and from serving as an officer or director of a public reporting company.  Ohms consented to the order.  The SEC charged Ohms with financial fraud and other securities law violations related to his embezzlement of nearly $2.2 million from the company during a four-year period.  Ohms, age 40, resides in Carrollton, Texas.  , According to the Commissions complaint, Ohms held a number of positions at U.S. Lime between January 1998 and December 2001, including corporate controller, secretary, treasurer, and vice president of finance.  The Commissions complaint further alleged that Ohms forged the signatures of other company officers on dozens of checks, and falsified the companys check register to create the appearance that the amounts that he personally received or gave to his creditors went to vendors for U.S. Limes legitimate business expenses.  Additionally, the complaint alleged that while Ohms initially embezzled relatively small amounts, his thefts escalated to the point that they were too large to conceal, at which point he abruptly resigned., Without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions complaint, Ohms consented to an order permanently enjoining him from further violating, or aiding and abetting violations of, Sections 10(b), 13(a)(2), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder.  In addition, Ohms consented to an order permanently enjoining him from serving as an officer or director of a public reporting company.  Ohms, on October 21, 2002, entered into a plea agreement admitting to one count of wire fraud and one count of making a false statement to a government agency in connection with the scheme alleged in the Commissions complaint.  He is expected to enter a formal plea of guilty in late November 2002 and upon sentencing, the Court will likely order him to pay $2.2 million in restitution.,  , <!--<P><IMG SRC=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=9 ALT= BORDER=0>  <A href=/litigation/complaints/comp17843.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</A></P>--><i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr17843.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

SIGAL (Case No. ED-CV-02-1229 VAP (SGLx)) (C.D. Cal), On November 14, 2002, the U.S. District Court in Riverside, California granted the Securities and Exchange Commissions application for a temporary restraining order regarding a telemarketing scheme run by a repeat securities law violator, Joseph Sanfellipo, 53, of Laguna Beach, California.  The Commissions complaint alleges that Sanfellipo seeks to raise $9 million through the sale of stock in an auto repair company he controls, known as California Autocare Corporation of Carlsbad, California.  The defendants have raised at least $500,000 in a two-month period.  The complaint alleges that Sanfellipo falsely told investors over the phone, on the company website and in the company prospectus that (1) California Autocare Corporation and another Sanfellipo-controlled auto repair company, Autocare Americorp, had significant business relationships with Shell Oil Company, NAPA Auto Parts, Monroe, and Interstate Batteries, when in fact they did not; (2) there were 20 Autocare retail locations throughout California, when in fact there were actually only 5; and (3) the companies were negotiating sponsorship deals with Starbucks and Krispy Kreme Doughnuts, when in fact they were not., In addition to Sanfellipo and his companies, the other defendants are: James E. Gasper, 64, of Solana Beach, California; Kimball R. Vance, Jr., 49, of La Quinta, California; and Elihu M. Sigal, 55, of Palm Desert, California.  The Commissions complaint alleges that Gasper, Vance and Sigal sold California Autocare and Autocare Americorp stock through telemarketing at a sales office in Palm Desert, California., The court granted the Commissions application for a temporary restraining order; appointed a receiver over the companies; and froze the assets of, prohibited the destruction of documents by, and ordered accountings from the defendants.  The temporary restraining order bars California Autocare Corporation, Autocare Americorp and Sanfellipo from committing securities fraud in violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act).  The Courts order also temporarily restrains California Autocare Corporation, Autocare Americorp, Sanfellipo, Gasper, Vance and Sigal from violating the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act.  The Courts order also temporarily restrains Gasper, Vance and Sigal from committing violations of the broker-dealer registration provisions of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act.  A hearing on whether a preliminary injunction should be issued against the defendants is scheduled for November 25, 2002. , In April 1998, Sanfellipo was ordered by the Commission to cease and desist from future securities fraud violations.  In that matter, the Commission found that the company Sanfellipo controlled, a publicly traded parcel packaging and shipping corporation, fraudulently overstated its assets, revenue, and income in 1990 and 1991.  , In addition to the interim relief granted on November 14, 2002, the Commission seeks a final judgment against all the defendants enjoining them from future violations of the securities and broker-dealer registration provisions, as well as the antifraud provisions, ordering the defendants to disgorge all ill-gotten gains, and assessing civil penalties against them. ,  , <!--<P><IMG SRC=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=9 ALT= BORDER=0>  <A href=/litigation/complaints/comp17844.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</A></P>--><i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr17844.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

OKEEFFE</i> (United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, C.A. No.  6:01-CV-364-ORL-31-KRS)  , The Commission announced today the entry of separate judgments against two defendants in a prime bank securities fraud case.  First, on October 30, 2002, the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida granted the Commissions motion for summary judgment against Kenneth C. Nunn (Nunn) of Kent, England, the schemes central figure. According to the Commissions complaint, Nunn solicited U.S. promoters and falsely told them that his prime bank trading program would pay 15% a month for twelve months and that investor funds were fully collateralized by U.S. Treasury Bills.  Nunn also allegedly told U.S. promoters that for years he had successfully operated high-yield prime bank programs, buying and selling newly-issued bonds in 45-minute intervals and earning 20% per week with no risk.  U.S. citizens invested $3.55 million in the scheme.  The investors funds were sent to an off-shore bank account controlled by Nunn.  None of the funds were used to buy securities and investors did not receive their promised return or return of all principal.  Nunn allegedly used over $400,000 of the funds for his personal benefit.  , The Courts judgment enjoins Nunn from future violations of the securities and broker-dealer registration provisions as well as the general antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. The  judgment orders Nunn to pay disgorgement of $401,000 plus prejudgment interest of $126,421. Further, the Court ordered Nunn to pay a civil penalty of $200,000.  , The Commission also announced that on November 8, 2002, a judgment by consent was entered against Earl A. Abbott of Titusville, Florida in the same matter.  The Commissions complaint alleged that Abbott recruited others to sell the $3.55 million of non-existent prime bank securities to investors in five different states.  Abbott, without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, agreed to settle the matter by agreeing to the entry of an injunction against future violations of the securities and broker-dealer registration provisions and the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and the payment of a $25,000 civil penalty.    , The Commissions complaint alleged that, in connection with this scheme, Nunn and Abbott engaged in transactions, acts, practices and courses of business which constituted violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Section 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act and Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act.     , For further information on the action, see Litigation Release Nos. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr16940.htm>16940</a>, <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17198.htm>17198</a> and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17289.htm>17289</a>.   ,  , <!--<P><IMG SRC=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=9 ALT= BORDER=0>  <A href=/litigation/complaints/comp17844.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</A></P>--><i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr17844.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Improper Professional Conduct</h2>]","[On November 18, 2002, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey alleging that MERL Holdings, Inc.com (MERL), a New Jersey-based company, and Ed Johnson (Johnson), its chairman, president and CEO, violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws by engaging in a multi-faceted fraud designed to raise money in the public markets.  The Commissions Complaint alleges that MERL inflated its assets and financial results in two of the companys registration statements filed with the Commission and disseminated to investors., The Complaint alleges that Johnson orchestrated the fraudulent scheme in four ways.  First, MERL and Johnson artificially inflated the value of assets that MERL had acquired from Hanold School Stores, Inc. (Hanold), in exchange for shares of MERLs preferred stock.  The Complaint alleges that MERLs treatment of the Hanold assets was improper and violated Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)., Second, the Complaint alleges that MERL and Johnson improperly consolidated Essex Industries, Inc. (Essex) in MERLs 1997 and 1998 financial statements.  Essex was the only <i>bona fide</i> operating entity in MERLs financial statements and accounted for all of the companys revenue recorded in its 1997 and 1998 income statements.  Essex also comprised virtually all of MERLs assets in 1997 and most of 1998.  The Complaint alleges that MERLs consolidation of Essex was improper because, among other reasons, MERL had been specifically enjoined by a Virginia state court from exerting any control over Essex.  The companys consolidation of Essexs results in its financial statements therefore violated GAAP., Third, the Complaint alleges that the Managements Discussion and Analysis (MD&amp;A) sections of both registration statements materially mischaracterized the financial health of MERL.  The Complaint alleges that an objective view of the company was that it was in dire financial straits because of severe liquidity issues, drastically declining sales, disappearing customers and numerous legal problems.  The Complaint alleges that as chairman, president and CEO, Johnson had a clear view of MERLs bleak position, yet improperly painted a prosperous and optimistic picture of the company and neglected to disclose any of the liquidity problems or negative sales trends in the MD&amp;A sections of the registration statements., Fourth, the Complaint alleges that MERL amplified its financial irregularities by issuing false press releases, which materially misrepresented the financial condition of MERL., Finally, the Complaint alleges that Johnson benefited from his fraudulent scheme by avoiding losses or becoming unjustly enriched by selling MERL stock while in possession of material nonpublic information concerning these accounting irregularities., The Commissions Complaint seeks to enjoin MERL and Johnson permanently from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks civil monetary penalties against Johnson.  The Complaint further seeks to bar Johnson permanently from serving as an officer or director of any public company and also seeks under Section 603 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 to bar him permanently from any future participation in the offering of any penny stock.  Finally, the Complaint seeks disgorgement, prejudgment interest and penalties from Johnson for insider trading., Simultaneously with the filing of the Complaint, the Commission entered a settled administrative order related to certain of the conduct described in the Complaint.  Without admitting or denying the Commissions findings, three of MERLs independent auditors, Michael G. Horsey, CPA, the engagement partner, Michael D. Watson, CPA, the concurring review partner, and Sallie D. Feldman, CPA, the audit manager, consented to an order pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the Commissions Rules of Practice, finding that each engaged in improper professional conduct.  The order denies Horsey, Watson and Feldman the privilege of appearing or practicing before the Commission as accountants for periods of two years, ten months and six months, respectively.  <i>See</i> SEC Administrative Proceeding <a href=/litigation/admin/34-46845.htm>File No. 3-10937</a>, dated November 18, 2002., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp17846.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr17846.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

On May 1, 2002, after a two-day hearing in April, the district court issued an order finding that the Commission is likely to succeed in proving that Fife, Khan, and certain other defendants violated the securities laws, and that there is a strong likelihood that violations may occur in the future if these defendants are not enjoined. The order further stated that there is a high risk that any remaining investor funds may be further depleted.  On May 8, 2002, the court issued written preliminary injunctions and asset freezes against Fife, Khan and certain other defendants, based on its findings in the May 1 order. Defendants Fife and Khan appealed the district courts decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit., After a hearing on September 13, 2002, the First Circuit issued a written opinion on November 6, 2002 affirming the entry of preliminary injunctions and asset freezes against Fife and Khan.  The First Circuit found that the Commission made a sufficient showing that Fife and Khan made material misrepresentations in connection with the purchase or sale of securities in violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that it was reasonably likely they may commit such violations again.  The First Circuit further upheld the district courts finding that the Commission had established a substantial likelihood that Fife violated Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Among other things, the First Circuit found that Fife repeatedly made false representations to one investor concerning the management of its funds, and that Fife and Khan had both misrepresented to investors the risk of loss associated with a purported balance sheet enhancement program., For further information, please see Litigation Release Numbers <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17461.htm>17461</a> (April 5, 2002) and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17514.htm>17514</a> (May 13, 2002).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr17848.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The Courts Order, which was entered with the defendants consent, preliminarily enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws and continues an asset freeze implemented by the Judge in the temporary restraining order issued on November 4, 2002., In its complaint, originally filed November 4, 2002, the Commission alleges that, from at least January 2001 through the present, NIIC and Kennard have engaged in a deliberate scheme to defraud investors, primarily African-American churches, by making false and misleading statements in connection with the unregistered offer and sale of securities, in the form of investment contracts, relating to NIICs so-called Church Funding Project.  NIIC, acting through Kennard, has raised at least $3 million from over 1000 investing churches located throughout the United States.  Specifically, for each investment of $3,000, Kennard promised to pay a return of $500,000.  Kennard told investors that NIIC would fund the promised returns from a pool of money that NIIC purportedly receives for this purpose from four sources:  profit-making corporations; federal government grants; other Christian institutions; and profits from a series of world-wide Christian-based resorts to be built and run by NIICs sister corporation, Church Kingdom.

The defendant was ordered to pay a $100,000 penalty in a Commission action that charged him with insider trading in the securities of BetzDearborn Inc.  Luzardo settled the action without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint.  , The Commissions complaint in this matter, filed in October 2001, alleged that Rodolfo Luzardo, a former analyst in the mergers and acquisitions unit of J.P. Morgan Securities, Inc., Alain D. Kodsi, a co-owner of a venture capital firm, and Elias I. Kodsi, a retired jewelry distributor, engaged in illegal insider trading in advance of the July 30, 1998 announcement that BetzDearborn Inc. and Hercules Inc. had agreed to merge.  The complaint alleged that Luzardo misappropriated confidential information regarding the pending merger from his then-employer, J.P. Morgan Securities, Inc., which was the adviser to BetzDearborn.  According to the complaint, Luzardo tipped his friend and new employer, Alain Kodsi, who in turn tipped his father, Elias Kodsi.  The complaint further alleged that Elias Kodsi purchased 30,000 shares of BetzDearborn common stock through two numbered Swiss accounts the day before the merger was announced at a cost of over $1 million, and that after the announcement on July 30, Elias Kodsi sold the shares for unlawful profits of $963,750.

In its complaint, the Commission alleges that TenFold, Gary D. Kennedy (TenFolds former president and CEO), Robert P. Hughes (TenFolds former CFO), Stanley G. Hanks (TenFolds former controller), and Wynn K. Clayton (the former controller of TenFolds insurance subsidiary) fraudulently misrepresented or failed to disclose important information about TenFolds contracts, operations, and earnings in certain of TenFolds 1999 and 2000 filings with the Commission.  According to the complaint, each of the individual defendants also sold TenFold stock in February 2000, collectively reaping significant unjust profits.  TenFold has consented to the entry of an injunction against it., Specifically, the Commission alleges that TenFold, Kennedy, and Hughes fraudulently failed to disclose the nature of two unusual transactions in TenFolds registration statement for its May 1999 initial public offering (IPO).  For one of these transactions, TenFold allegedly manipulated the terms of a contract to recognize a significant portion of revenue earlier than it otherwise would have.  Because of this acceleration of revenue, TenFold showed a profit rather than a loss in 1998, the year preceding its IPO.  For the second transaction, TenFold agreed to allot an unusually large number of shares in its IPO to a significant customer in return for the customers agreement to delete contractual language that restricted TenFolds ability to recognize revenue.  As a result, TenFold was again able to accelerate its revenue recognition and show a profit rather than a loss, this time for the first quarter of 1999, the period immediately preceding its IPO., The Commission also alleges that TenFold, Kennedy, Hughes, and Hanks fraudulently failed to disclose in TenFolds 1999 annual report and first quarter 2000 quarterly report the ongoing and pervasive problems TenFold was experiencing with completing its large software development contracts.  Among other things, TenFold allegedly misled investors by listing in these filings numerous risks as possible outcomes, rather than disclosing that many of these outcomes were actually occurring at the time of the filing.  The Commission further claims that TenFold, Kennedy, and Hughes made false or misleading statements in a February 2000 telephone conference with analysts when they discussed TenFolds operations and financial results for the fourth quarter of 1999 and the 1999 fiscal year., According to the complaint, TenFold, through Kennedy, Hughes, Hanks, and Clayton, also materially overstated TenFolds earnings in press releases and filings related to TenFolds fourth quarter of 1999, 1999 fiscal year, and first quarter of 2000.  These overstatements resulted from TenFolds use of incorrect data to calculate revenue recognized on three large projects.  The Commission alleges that each of the individual defendants knew that this data was wrong and is responsible for the fraudulent financial reporting.  The Commission further alleges that Hughes provided misleading information to TenFolds independent auditor when the firm audited TenFolds 1999 financial statements., In addition to fraud charges under Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, the Commission has charged TenFold with violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13 and 13b2-1 thereunder.  The Commission has charged Kennedy and Hughes with violations or aiding and abetting violations of the same provisions, except that Kennedy is not charged with violations of Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, and Hughes is charged with violating Rule 13b2-2 under the Exchange Act.  Hanks and Clayton are also charged with violating or aiding and abetting violations of the same provisions alleged to have been violated by TenFold, except that they are not charged with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act.  The Commission seeks a final judgment enjoining the individual defendants from future violations of the provisions alleged to have been violated by each, ordering them to disgorge ill-gotten gains, and imposing civil monetary penalties.  The Commission also seeks an order barring Kennedy and Hughes from serving as an officer or director of a public company., Simultaneously with the filing of the complaint, TenFold consented to the entry of a permanent injunction against future violations of the provisions it is alleged to have violated, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13 and 13b2-1 thereunder. ,  , , <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp17852.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>]"

Western District of Oklahoma, Civil Action No. CIV-01-999-W)   , On November 18, 2002, Judge Lee R. West, United States District Judge for the Western District of Oklahoma, held John Collins in civil contempt and ordered him to pay $187,000 to the Court appointed receiver in the case.  The Court found that Collins had directly violated and aided and abetted Garry W. Stroud in violating the Courts orders.  , Previously, Judge West issued emergency orders, including a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, asset freeze and the appointment of a temporary receiver against Garry W. Stroud, an alleged Internet investment swindler operating from British Columbia, Canada, and Lynden, Washington.  The Commissions complaint charged Stroud with conducting an ongoing Internet investment scheme that fleeced over 2,200 investors worldwide of approximately $1 million since 1998.  , During the course of pursuing its claims against Stroud, the Commission learned that Stroud, prior to suit, had caused in excess of $200,000 of investor funds to be diverted to Collins for the purpose of promoting a professional wrestling enterprise named Main Event Championship Wrestling.  Immediately after the Court issued its preliminary injunction, Collins was served with a copy of the Courts orders, which, among other things, continued to freeze Strouds assets.  The Court found that after Collins became aware of the Courts orders, Collins accepted $162,000 in wire transfers from Stroud and then spent the money in violation of the asset freeze order.  The Court also found that Collins had refused to turnover receivership property in his possession, worth approximately $25,000, despite the receivers repeated demands for possession of the property., Collins has thirty days to remit the money to the receiver or face further coercive sanctions.,  , <!--<P><IMG SRC=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=9 ALT= BORDER=0>  <A href=/litigation/complaints/comp17853.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</A></P>--><i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr17853.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Lynch, United States District Court Judge for the Southern District of New York, the Commissions action in <i>SEC V. Inorganic Recycling Corp., et al.</i> (S.D.N.Y.) 99 Civ. 10159 (GEL), alleging securities fraud and other violations, has now been concluded., On November 19, 2002, Judge Lynch granted the Commissions motion for an order requiring defendant Edward Halloran (Halloran), following his default earlier in the case, to disgorge his ill-gotten gains and pay a civil penalty for his violations.  The court found Halloran jointly and severally liable with another defendant, Michelle Caridi (Caridi), for $1,042,292 in disgorgement, plus $487,535 in prejudgment interest, and imposed a $1 million civil penalty against Halloran.  The court previously entered a partial final judgment on default against Halloran permanently enjoining him from violating the relevant registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, and barring him from serving as an officer or director of a public company., On November 19, 2002, the Commission also withdrew its claims for disgorgement and a civil penalty against defendant Richard Furman (Furman).  Newly obtained evidence showed that Furman did not retain or make use of any investor funds, but rather acted solely as a conduit for transferring funds to Halloran and Caridi.  The funds that the Commission had previously sought to have Furman disgorge were included in the disgorgement amount that the Court ordered Halloran to pay.  In a parallel criminal case brought by the New York County District Attorneys Office (NYDA), Furman was sentenced to twelve months in prison and paid $20,000 in restitution.  The court previously entered a partial final consent judgment against Furman permanently enjoining him from violating the relevant registration and antifraud provisions., The Commissions complaint was filed on September 30, 1999, alleging that from August 1995 to October 1997, defendants Halloran, Caridi, Daniel J. Moore (Moore), and Furman conducted a fraudulent offering of securities issued by defendant Inorganic Recycling Corp. (Inorganic), a hazardous waste recycling company based in Coral Springs, Florida.  The complaint alleges that Caridi, Moore, Halloran and Furman made a series of material misrepresentations to investors, including, among other things, that the offering proceeds would be used for working capital when, in truth, the lions share of the offering proceeds -- at least $1.6 million of $2.5 million raised from investors -- were misappropriated for the personal benefit of Halloran, Caridi, and Moore.  The Commission has now obtained final judgments or otherwise resolved its claims against all the defendants., On August 23, 2002, the court granted the Commissions motion for summary judgment against Caridi and Moore on the issues of disgorgement and civil penalties.  The court ordered that Caridi pay $1,010,764 in disgorgement, plus $487,535 in prejudgment interest, and imposed a $100,000 civil penalty against Caridi.  The court ordered Moore to pay $177,000 in disgorgement and $115,769 in prejudgment interest.  The court previously entered partial final consent judgments against Caridi and Moore permanently enjoining them from violating the relevant registration and antifraud provisions, and barring them from serving as officers or directors of a public company., On September 20, 2002, the Commission voluntarily dismissed its claims against defendant Inorganic, which has filed a petition under Chapter 7 of the United States Bankruptcy Code and is being liquidated.  In the parallel criminal case brought by the NYDA, Inorganic contributed $450,000 to a restitution fund for victims of the fraud., There are no other claims pending.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr17854.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

White</i>, Civil Action No. C 02-5538 JL (N.D. Cal. Filed November 21, 2001)</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) today filed a civil action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against Phillip E. White (White), formerly President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chairman of the Board of Directors of Informix Corporation (Informix or Company).<a name=footbody_1></a><sup><a href=#footnote_1>1</a></sup> In its Complaint, the Commission alleges that White concealed secret side agreements that rendered revenue recognition improper on certain transactions that Informix had included in its financial statements for its fiscal year ended December 31, 1996.  To further his scheme, White made false statements and representations concerning the existence of these secret side agreements to members of Informixs financial staff and to Informixs independent auditors.  White did this to avoid triggering a restatement of Informixs 1996 financial statements.  Informixs 1996 financial statements, and the independent auditors unqualified report thereon, were included in Informixs 1996 Annual Report, Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K (Form 10-K), which Informix had filed with the Commission on March 31, 1997.  The same financial statements and unqualified audit report were incorporated by reference in Form S-8 registration statements (Form S-8), which Informix filed on July 16, 1997.  (The Forms S-8 registered twelve million shares of Informix stock for sale to employees.)  White signed the Form 10-K and Forms S-8.  According to the Complaint, White violated, or aided and abetted violations of, antifraud, reporting, and record-keeping provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act)., According to the Complaint, in early July 1997 (after Informix had filed its Form 10-K) White entered into and concealed a secret side agreement in connection with a software license sales contract with a Japanese company that made revenue recognition on that contract in 1996 improper.  At the same time, White was also concealing a second secret side letter agreement that made revenue recognition improper on a software license sales contract with the European subsidiary of a United States company.  White knew that the discovery of one or both of these side agreements by Informixs independent auditors would lead them to insist that Informix restate its financial statements.  The Complaint further alleges that, while concealing the secret side agreements, White signed a letter on July 11, 1997, to Informixs independent auditors in connection with Informixs filing of the Forms S-8.  In that letter, White falsely represented that no material events concerning Informixs financial results had occurred since their filing on March 31, 1997., The Complaint alleges that, at the end of July 1997, Informixs financial staff and independent auditors discovered the secret side agreements White was concealing.  Informixs Board of Directors immediately forced White to resign from the Company.  Informix ultimately restated its 1996 financial statements to reflect substantial decreases in its earnings and income caused by, among other things, discovery of the two side agreements White concealed and various other side agreements.  Informixs amended 1996 Form 10-K revealed that, instead of earning net income of $97.8 million as Informix originally reported, Informix suffered a net <i>loss</i> of $73.6 million in 1996., The Commission seeks a Final Judgment permanently enjoining White from violating, or aiding and abetting violations of, Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act; Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2; and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act; barring White from acting as an officer or director of any public company; and requiring White to pay civil money penalties., Separately today, the Office of the United States Attorney for the Northern District of California (USAO) announced that it had indicted White for federal criminal securities, mail, and wire fraud.  Todays civil and criminal actions are the result of investigations by the Commission, the USAO, and the San Francisco office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation., Previously, the Commission instituted and simultaneously settled an administrative proceeding against Informix.

Inc. (Thomas Fletcher) conducted a fraudulent unregistered offering that raised over $2.5 million from at least 32 investors. Sergei Voronchenko, the President and Director of Thomas Fletcher and Roman Thaker, the Secretary and Treasurer of Thomas Fletcher, were responsible for a false and misleading private offering memorandum.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, an affiliated broker-dealer, Thomas Fletcher &amp; Company Inc. (TFC), and its registered representatives, Alex Berg, John Donadio, and Padraig McGlynn made oral misrepresentations to investors to induce them to purchase Thomas Fletcher securities., The Commissions complaint names the following defendants:, Specifically, the Complaint alleges the following:  From approximately March 2002 through the present, Voronchenko and Thaker effectuated a fraudulent unregistered offering of Thomas Fletcher securities through which Thomas Fletcher raised approximately $2.5 million from at least 32 investors.   To facilitate this Offering, Voronchenko and Thaker retained Berg, Donadio, and McGlynn and other salespersons to offer and sell Thomas Flectcher securities to investors., In connection with the Offering, Thomas Fletcher distributed a private offering memoranda (Offering Memorandum), prepared by Voronchenko, Thaker, and company counsel, to investors in order to induce them to purchase preferred shares.  The Offering Memorandum failed to note that Thomas Fletchers certificate of incorporation did not permit it to issue such preferred shares.  Additionally, one of the primary purposes of the Offering was to enable Thomas Fletcher to make a subordinated loan to TFC so that TFC would be able to increase its operating and net capital and expand its operations. Contrary to the express representations contained in the Offering Memorandum, however, Thomas Fletcher has made no subordinated loan to TFC., In connection with their efforts to solicit investors, Berg, Donadio, and McGlynn also concocted a variety of purported facts to persuade investors to purchase Thomas Fletcher securities.  Among other things, Berg, Donadio, and McGlynn told investors that (i) Thomas Fletcher was planning an initial public offering (IPO) which was imminent (i.e. within two to three months), and (ii) investors could sell their stock the first day Thomas Fletcher stock was publicly traded at a specific price (i.e. $20-25 per share), which was a significant premium over the $10.00 per share that investors were paying to purchase the stock in the Offering.  These representations were false.  In fact, Thomas Fletcher had not taken any steps to conduct an IPO.  Additionally, Berg, Donadio, and McGlynn told investors that Thomas Fletcher securities were a risk-free investment and that in the worst case scenario, investors would have their funds returned to them with 10% interest., The Commission alleges that through this conduct, Thomas Fletcher, TFC, Voronchenko, Thaker, Berg, Donadio, and McGlynn violated 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

The final judgment enjoined him from further violations of the antifraud and securities and broker-dealer registration provisions of the federal securities laws.  In its complaint, filed on April 16, 2001, the Commission alleged that, between 1997 and 2000, Harbur and others participated in a fraudulent trading scheme that raised approximately $22 million from at least 50 investors, many of whom were members of the Christian Science Church.  According to the complaint, Harbur helped promote the trading scheme under the names Swiss Asset Management and Resource F, and solicited investors using misrepresentations typical of Prime Bank-type investment frauds, including that the investment involved high-quality debt instruments of very large international banks, that the investors principal was never at risk and could be returned after one year, and that investors would receive profits of approximately 4-5% every month (or 48-60% annually)., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, Harbur consented to the judgment entered by the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts (Saris, J.), which permanently enjoins him from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the  Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The company consented, without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, to pay a $250,000 civil penalty.  The Commission also announced the filing of a settled cease-and-desist order against the company.  The Commissions Order finds that the company violated Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Regulation FD and orders the company to cease and desist from committing or causing violations of these provisions., Regulation FD prohibits issuers from selectively disclosing material, nonpublic information to certain persons  securities analysts, broker-dealers, investment advisers and institutional investors  before disclosing the same information to the public. The Commissions Order finds that, on November 5, 2001, the companys Chief Executive Officer disclosed material, nonpublic information to the attendees of an invitation-only technology conference in California.  At the conference, the companys CEO made positive comments about the companys business that were based on material, nonpublic information and that contrasted with negative statements that he had made about the companys business in a public conference call three weeks earlier. The public did not have access to the technology conference and was unable to benefit from the information that was disclosed at the conference., Immediately following the disclosures, certain attendees at the conference purchased the companys stock or communicated the disclosures to others who purchased the stock.  On the day of the conference, the companys stock price closed approximately 20% higher than the prior days close and the trading volume was more than twice the average daily volume.  The Order finds that the companys CEO was aware that his comments at the conference were based on material, nonpublic information.  The Order further finds that the companys Director of Investor Relations knew that the technology conference would not be simultaneously broadcast to the public, but did not advise the companys CEO of this fact.  As a result, the company intentionally disclosed material, nonpublic information and violated Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Regulation FD.

The Order provides that ICN may apply for early termination of the undertakings after a period of eighteen months upon a showing that the interests of public investors no longer require the continued imposition of the undertakings.  , Panic consented, without admitting or denying the allegations, to the entry of a Final Judgment and Order permanently enjoining him from violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; requiring him to comply with undertakings for a period of five years; and ordering him to pay $500,000 in civil penalties.  The Commission is dismissing the claims pending against defendants Johannesson and Watt in the civil injunctive action., The Commission filed its civil complaint in this matter on August 11, 1999.  The complaint alleged that, between December 5, 1994 and February 17, 1995, the defendants made misleading public statements concerning the status of ICNs 1994 new drug application, then pending before the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  The new drug application sought approval of ICNs drug, ribavirin, as a stand alone treatment for chronic hepatitis C.  The Commissions complaint alleged that ICNs December 5, 1994 press release misled the public concerning the status of ICNs 1994 new drug application and that the company did not disclose the FDAs rejection of the application until February 17, 1995.  Following the February 17 press release, the price of ICNs stock dropped approximately 34% or $7.25 per share from $22.63 to $15.38, over two days of trading.  In December 2001, ICN pled guilty to a single count of criminal securities fraud in connection with one of the events alleged in the Commissions civil complaint.  In connection with that matter, ICN paid $5.6 million in criminal fines. , The Commission also announced today that it simultaneously instituted and settled two cease-and-desist proceedings against Johannesson and Watt, respectively.  Johannesson and Watt each consented to the entry of an Order, pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, finding that he was a cause of ICNs misleading disclosure in its December 5, 1994 press release and ordering that he cease and desist from committing or causing any violation of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  <i>See</i> Securities Exchange Act <a href=/litigation/admin/34-46900.htm>Release No. 34-46900</a> (Johannesson) and Securities Exchange Act <a href=/litigation/admin/34-46899.htm>Release No. 34-46899</a> (Watt)., For information about earlier developments in this matter, <i>see</i> Litigation <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr16383.htm>Release No. 16383</a> (December 9, 1999) and Litigation <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr16249.htm>Release No. 16249</a> (August 11, 1999).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr17861.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Roys Poyiadjis, Lycourgos Kyprianou and AremisSoft Corp., et al.,</i> Civil Action No. 01-CV-8903 (CSH) (S.D.N.Y.)</h2>]","[On November 22, 2002, an Isle of Man appellate tribunal entered a judgment holding that the Commission is entitled to participate directly in proceedings commenced by the Isle of Man Attorney General in October 2001 at the request of the Attorney General of the United States.  In those proceedings, the High Court of the Isle of Man has issued restraint orders freezing approximately $175 million deposited in two Isle of Man banks.  These funds are alleged to constitute proceeds of fraudulent insider trading in the stock of AremisSoft Corporation.  The Commission, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York and the Attorney General for the Isle of Man are pursuing the repatriation of the frozen funds to the United States to be used to compensate defrauded AremisSoft investors., The Commission also has obtained a U.S. asset freeze in a preliminary injunction entered on October 19, 2001 by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.  In its complaint in the U.S. enforcement action, the Commission alleged, among other things, that AremisSoft and two of its former officers, Roys Poyiadjis and Lycourgos Kyprianou, overstated the Companys revenues in its annual report for 2000 and inflated the value of acquisitions made in 1999 and 2000 and that the two former officers engaged in massive insider trading during the period of the reporting fraud.  The SECs civil enforcement action remains pending against Poyiadjis, Kyprianou and two relief defendants that nominally hold the funds in the Isle of Man bank accounts, Olympus Capital Investment, Inc. (Olympus) and Oracle Capital, Inc. (Oracle).  Poyiadjis, Kyprianou and the relief defendants have not answered the Commissions complaint., The U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York obtained an indictment of Poyiadjis on December 19, 2001.  Poyiadjis has fled to the Republic of Cyprus where he remains to date.  On March 22, 2002, the U.S. Attorneys Office filed a civil complaint <i>in rem</i> in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York seeking civil forfeiture of the funds in the Isle of Man banks, and on June 3, 2002 the court entered a default judgment ordering forfeiture of the funds to the United States.  On June 24, 2002 a superseding indictment was returned against Poyiadjis, Kyprianou (who resides in Cyprus) and another AremisSoft officer, M.C. Mathews (who resides in India) on counts of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, mail fraud, and wire fraud, substantive counts of securities fraud (both on the market and insider trading), conspiracy to commit money laundering, and substantive counts of money laundering.  On July 16, 2002, the Isle of Man Attorney General filed a petition in the High Court seeking to register the civil <i>in rem</i> forfeiture judgment as an external confiscation order under the applicable Isle of Man statute.  The Commission has supported and assisted the U.S. Attorneys Office and the Isle of Man Attorney General in the pending Isle of Man restraint order litigation, but it was not previously able to participate directly in those proceedings.  , On June 4, 2002, the Commission filed a petition seeking an order of the Isle of Man High Court permitting the Commission to participate directly in the restraint order proceedings.  In particular, the Commission argued that under the applicable Isle of Man law, it was a person affected by the proceedings and as such it should be made a noticed party.  Although the petition initially was denied in a judgment dated July 16, 2002, the Commission successfully appealed that ruling.  The appellate judgment found that the SEC is a person affected by the restraint order and concluded that the overall circumstances in this case justify our exercising discretion in favour of the SEC becoming a Noticed Party.  The Commission would like to acknowledge the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Office of the Attorney General for the Isle of Man, and the Isle of Man Constabulary Financial Crime Unit for the assistance they have provided in this matter., <i>See also</i> Litigation Release Nos. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17172.htm>17172</a> (October 4, 2001) and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17641.htm>17641</a> (July 31, 2002) and Exchange Act <a href=/litigation/admin/34-46285.htm>Release No. 34-46285</a> (July 31, 2002).  ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr17862.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Fontaine and his related company, Simpleton Holdings Corporation a/k/a Signature Investments Hedge Fund, with fraud., The Complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that from at least July 2002 through at least October 22, 2002, Signature, an unregistered investment company created and controlled by Fontaine, conducted an unregistered offering of Signatures shares over the Internet and made numerous false claims to investors and prospective investors.  Specifically, the SECs Complaint charges that Fontaine and Signature deceived investors into investing in Signature by making false and misleading claims about Signatures track record, the amount of assets under management, and Signatures purported affiliation with several well-known financial institutions and professionals. , The Complaint names as defendants:, According to the Complaint, beginning at least as early as July 2002 and continuing through at least October 22, 2002, Fontaine and Signature deceived investors into investing in Signature by fraudulently claiming, among other things, that:  (a) Signature averaged over a 39.5% annual return over its 13-year history, including returns during the bear market of the past 2 years [of ] over 21% per year; (b) Signature had approximately $250 million under management; (c) Salomon Smith Barney was the sub-adviser to Signature; and (d) KPMG, LLP performed certain auditing services for Signature.  The defendants also made false and misleading statements about various investment advisory services purportedly offered by Signature, such as a Roth IRA program and a 401(k) program., All of these representations were false.  Signature and Fontaine had no track record, much less the long and extraordinary one they claimed.  Fontaine simply made up the performance returns  in Signatures marketing materials.  Signature never had anywhere near $250 million under management.  Salomon Smith Barney was not advising Signature, and KPMG did not provide  auditing or any other services to Signature.  A purported KPMG audit report Fontaine sent to prospective investors was a forgery.  The 401(k), IRA and other managed accounts described in Signatures marketing materials did not exist., The Complaint charges Fontaine and Signature with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940; and charges Signature with violating Section 7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940.

The defendants are Ari Parnes; Parnes company ADAR Equities, LLC; two ADAR employees, Shauel Seitler and Jacob Herman; former Datek Securities broker Yezhak Dov Knoll; and lawyer Myron Raisman.  U.S. District Court Judge Louis L. Stanton entered final judgments against the defendants on November 7, 2002., The Commissions complaint alleged two different schemes-an illegal offering scheme and a bank stock fraud scheme.  The first scheme took illegal advantage of Regulation S, which permits U.S. issuers to offer and sell securities without registration to offshore investors under certain circumstances.  The Commissions complaint alleged that Parnes, aided by employees at his company ADAR Equities, including Herman and Seitler, and by Datek Securities broker Knoll, used Reg S offerings to reap illegal profits for himself and others, in violation of the securities registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act).  The complaint also alleged that without registering as brokers or dealers, Parnes, Herman, and Seitler, on behalf of ADAR, participated in private placements of the securities of twelve issuers in violation of the broker-dealer registration provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act)., The Court, in connection with the allegations related to the first scheme, permanently enjoined Parnes, Seitler, and Herman from violating Sections 7(f) and 15(a) of the Exchange Act and Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act, permanently enjoined ADAR from violating Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act and Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act, and permanently enjoined Knoll from violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act.  The defendants consented, without admitting or denying the allegations, to the entry of the final judgments., In a related administrative action, Knoll, without admitting or denying the Commissions findings, consented to the entry of a Commission order barring him from association with any broker or dealer with the right to reapply after three years., With respect to the second scheme, involving bank stock fraud, the Commissions complaint alleged that Parnes, aided by Raisman, profited by illegally buying subscription rights from depositors of banks converting from mutual to stock form.  The Court, in connection with the allegations related to the second scheme, permanently enjoined Parnes and Raisman from violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The defendants consented, without admitting or denying the allegations, to the entry of the final judgments., In addition to the permanent injunctions, the Court ordered Parnes to pay a total of $650,000, including disgorgement, prejudgment interest and a civil penalty, ordered ADAR, Seitler, Herman and Raisman each to pay a $50,000 civil penalty and ordered Knoll to pay a $40,000 civil penalty., These judgments conclude the Commissions civil litigation in this matter.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr17865.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The action was filed against defendants Virtual Cash, its CEO and president, Eric L. Turner (Turner), its vice-president, Kenneth M. May (May), Omni Advertising, Inc. (Omni) and Omnis president, Anthony Joseph Pinone (Pinone).  On the same day, the Honorable Kenneth A. Marra, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Florida, entered, among other things, a temporary restraining order and an order freezing the defendants assets. , According to the Commissions complaint, Virtual Cash, Turner and May, through  Omni, a boiler room operated by Pinone, have been offering unregistered securities to investors nationwide.  The SEC alleged that Virtual Cash and its principals have raised more than $1 million from more than 70 investors to purportedly fund short-term cash advances for its purported payday advance business.  The complaint alleges that in raising money from investors for this enterprise, Virtual Cash, Turner and May represented to investors that, among other things, their funds would be used to purchase accounts receivable loan contracts and that their funds would be fully collateralized by accounts receivable.  Instead, the SEC alleged that of the money taken in from investors, only $156,000 was used to purchase accounts receivable.  Further, according to the SECs complaint, Virtual Cash, Turner and May failed to tell investors that 15% of their funds would be used to pay excessive sales commissions to Omni and that an additional 3% of their funds would be used to pay commissions to May., As a result, the Commission charges Virtual Cash, Turner, May, Omni and Pinone with violations of registration provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act).  The Commission further charges Virtual Cash, Turner and May with violations of anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws, including Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Mitchell</i>, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, Civil Action No. C 02-05613 RS</h2>, <h2>SEC Charges Current Director of and Former Officers of First Virtual Communications, Inc. with Overstating Revenues and Earnings</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced the filing of a complaint on November 26, 2002, against three former senior executives (including the founder and current Chairman of the Board) of First Virtual Communications, Inc. (FVC) for causing FVC to announce overstated revenues and earnings and then selling FVC shares before issuance of the correct financial information.  The former executives charged today are:  FVCs current Chairman of the Board and former President and CEO, Ralph K. Ungermann; its former CFO, James O. Mitchell; and its former Vice President of Sales, Alan J. McMillan.  Ungermann, Mitchell, and McMillan settled the Commissions action without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  They agreed to repay a total of about $1.3 million in illegal trading profits, interest, and civil money penalties., Since 1993, FVC, a Silicon Valley technology company, headquartered in Santa Clara, California, has engineered and manufactured video-conferencing products and, through independent distributors, marketed and sold these products to the ultimate customer.  FVCs common stock traded on Nasdaqs National Market from April 1998 through August 8, 2002, when it started trading on Nasdaqs small cap market.  , The Commissions complaint, filed in United States District Court for the Northern District of California, alleges that Ungermann, Mitchell, and McMillan caused FVC to announce overstated revenues and earnings figures in a January 28, 1999 press release.  The complaint alleges that, in order to meet revenue goals for the fourth quarter and year end 1998, FVC entered into an agreement with its largest distributor in which the distributor agreed to buy $3 million of FVC product in exchange for FVCs agreement to grant the distributor various return rights on the $3 million of FVC product and on product FVC had previously sold to the distributor.  , FVC improperly recognized as revenue approximately $5.9 million in sales that were subject to the return rights, in violation of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.  The complaint alleges that, as a result of the defendants actions, in its January 28, 1999 earnings release, FVC overstated its fourth quarter revenue by 114% and annual revenue by 16% and announced annual earnings of $1.1 million instead of a loss of $2 million.  The complaint also alleges that Ungermann, Mitchell, and McMillan failed to disclose this agreement to FVCs auditors, even when specifically asked., The complaint further alleges that, in February 1999, after the earnings release, the defendants sold a total of 330,000 shares of FVC stock, reaping illegal trading profits.  In April 1999, after the auditors learned of the return rights that FVC had granted, FVC filed an annual report on Form 10-K that correctly reported FVCs fourth quarter and annual revenue and earnings.  After the announcement of FVCs correct financial results, FVCs stock price dropped 60%., The defendants are:, The Commission charged Ungermann, McMillan, and Mitchell with antifraud violations (Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder) and lying to the auditors (Rule 13b2-2 under the Exchange Act).  Further, the Commission charged Ungermann and Mitchell with violating, and aiding and abetting violations of the record keeping provisions of the federal securities laws (Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder).  , In a related enforcement action, the Commission ordered FVC to cease and desist from violating the antifraud (Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder) and record-keeping provisions (Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act) of the federal securities laws.  The Commissions order found that FVC materially overstated its revenues and earnings for the fourth quarter and year end December 1998 in the January 28, 1999 press release by improperly recognizing revenue from sales with various return rights.  FVC, without admitting or denying the Commissions findings, consented to the order to cease and desist.  ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr17869.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

IBF COLLATERALIZED FINANCE CORP., et al.</i>, Case No. 02-CV-5713 (S.D.N.Y.), On November 26, 2002, the Honorable John S. Martin, Jr. of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York granted the Commissions application for partial summary judgment in <i>SEC v. IBF Collateralized Finance Corp., et al.</i>, Case No. 02-CV-5713-JSM (S.D.N.Y.), and denied a motion by one of the defendants to dismiss fraud claims against him.  The Commission filed a Complaint in July 2002 charging Simon Hershon (Hershon) and three of his InterBank Companies in connection with the offer and sale of $189 million in debt securities between 1997 and 2002.  The corporate defendants are InterBank Funding Corporation (IBF), IBF Collateralized Finance Corporation (CFC) and IBF VI - Secured Lending Corporation (Fund VI).  The Complaint charges securities fraud and that defendants CFC and Fund VI are operating unlawfully as unregistered investment companies in violation of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ICA). , The Court granted summary judgment on the Commissions ICA claim against CFC and Fund VI.  The Court ruled that these defendants are investment companies not exempt from registration under Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Act for issuers primarily engaged in the business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interest in real estate.  Defendants argued that they satisfied this mortgage exclusion by acquiring, for a nominal sum, a residual interest in two trusts that had issued mortgaged backed bonds to the public.  By structuring the transactions in a particular way, defendants were able to put on their own books all of the mortgages in the trusts, amounting to $674 million, even though defendants did not own the mortgages.  The Court rejected this argument, held that defendants were unregistered investment companies and appointed a trustee to take over the management of the defendants business.,    The Court also rejected defendant Simon Hershons motion to dismiss the claims of securities fraud.  The Complaint charges that Hershons companies have been able to operate over the past six years only because the companies were constantly raising new offering proceeds, which IBF routinely moved between companies in order to meet their cash flow needs - amounting to tens of millions of dollars of inter-fund transfers.  The Complaint also alleges that defendants failed to disclose millions of dollars in transfers between IBF and the IBF Funds that were designed to hide - and did hide from investors - millions of dollars in losses sustained by the investment loan portfolios of the IBF Funds.  As a result, the financial statements of the IBF Funds materially overstated net income, and return statistics that IBF regularly published about the IBF Funds were materially overstated.,  , <!--<P><IMG SRC=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=9 ALT= BORDER=0>  <A href=/litigation/complaints/comp17870.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</A></P>--><i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr17870.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

According to the Commissions complaint, on September 21, Marks liquidated all of his Vertex stock despite having previously acknowledged in writing that the impending release would not be viewed favorably by Wall Street and that he should not sell his Vertex shares.   The Commissions complaint alleges that, by selling his holdings prior to the companys public announcement on September 24, Marks avoided a loss of $105,999.   , According to the Commissions complaint, at the time he traded, Marks was the designated attorney for employees to consult regarding compliance with Vertexs employee securities trading policy.

According to the Commissions complaint, Vertex announced its decision to terminate clinical trials at approximately 7:10 a.m. on September 24.  Vertexs shares closed that day at $17.74, down $5.33 from the previous close on volume of 9.8 million shares, more than eight times average daily volume. , The Complaint alleges that Marks traded in breach of a fiduciary duty to Vertex and its shareholders not to trade in the Companys stock while in possession of material, nonpublic information about the Company.

The Judgments against Chandler and Jordan, entered by their consent, without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions Complaint, enjoin them from violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

(eComprar), raised $5 million for eComprar in an unregistered offering. eComprar claimed that it was raising the money in a purported attempt to develop a television home shopping network operating in Latin America.   The complaint alleged that as part of the offering, Chandler and Jordan made numerous misrepresentations and omissions to investors concerning, among other things, eComprars operations, expected financial results, use of proceeds, and Chandlers background and experience.  The Complaint also alleged that Chandler and Jordan misappropriated investors proceeds, and spent a significant portion of the $5 million raised on automobiles, home furnishings, jewelry, travel, a boat, other entertainment, and to settle prior legal disputes that were unrelated to eComprar.  , See also, <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17674.htm>Litigation Release No. 17674</a> (August 9, 2002).,  , <!--<P><IMG SRC=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=9 ALT= BORDER=0>  <A href=/litigation/complaints/comp17879.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</A></P>--><i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr17879.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

SETTLE SEC FINANCIAL FRAUD CHARGES  , <p align=center> SEC SUSPENDS FORMER REGAL CFO AND IN-HOUSE LEGAL COUNSEL FROM PRACTICING BEFORE THE COMMISSION  ,  SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION V. ARTHUR L. TOLL, BRUCE B. EDMONDSON, GERALD LEVINSON AND ELLIOT S. FISHER, 98-CV-2325 (HH)   (E.D. Pa.)   ,  The Commission announced today that four former officers and directors of Regal Communications Corp. (Regal), a Philadelphia area company, agreed without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commision complaint to the entry of final judgments, in <u>Securities and Exchange Commission</u> v. <u>Arthur L. Toll, Bruce B. Edmondson, Gerald Levinson and Elliot S. Fisher</u>, 98-CV-2325 (HH) (E.D. Pa.). The court enjoined all four defendants, barred Toll and Edmondson from serving as officers and directors of public companies and ordered disgorgement.  The Commission filed its complaint on May 4, 1998, and the action was subsequently stayed pending the conclusion of related criminal proceedings, <u>United States</u> v. <u>Arthur L. Toll, et al</u>., Cr. No. 98-606-01 (E.D. Pa.) (the Criminal Action)   ,  The Commissions Complaint alleged that from March 1992 through December 1993, Arthur L. Toll, Regals former chief executive officer, chairman of the board of directors, and majority shareholder, Bruce B. Edmondson, Regals former chief financial officer and member of the board of directors and its audit committee, Gerald Levinson, former member of Regals board of directors and its audit committee and Elliot S. Fisher, former member of Regals board of directors and its audit committee, in-house legal counsel, and corporate secretary, each knowingly or recklessly made materially false and misleading statements, and omitted to state material information, in numerous periodic reports and registration statements that they signed and that Regal filed with the Commission.  Regal, now defunct, was a public company based in Fort Washington, Pennsylvania, where it engaged in telephone 900 services and television infomercial marketing.  During the time that these reports and registration statements were publicly available, Regals stock traded over the NASDAQ.  In addition, Regal used the false reports and registration statements in connection with a July 1993 $35 million debenture offering, the March 1993 acquisition of two companies from celebrity Joan Rivers, and the September 1993 acquisition of Inphomation, Inc., an infomercial production and marketing company responsible for Dionne Warwicks Psychic Friends Network.   ,  The Complaint alleged that the Defendants engaged in a massive financial fraud.  Edmondson caused Regal to record fictitious business revenues and receivables.  Edmondson and Toll supported these fictitious items with fictitious or misleading sales documents and bank records. To lend credibility to the false information and to deceive Regals independent auditors, Edmondson and Toll paid off many of the fake receivables with Regals own money, including funds that they obtained through concealed sales of Regals stock and warrants.  They circulated over $23 million from Regals checking accounts into the accounts of companies privately-owned by them. They then caused the private companies to funnel a substantial portion of the money back to Regal in amounts equal to the amounts of the fictitious revenues and receivables.  The Defendants fraud inflated Regals revenues and receivables, causing Regals recorded income and assets to be materially overstated in reports and registration statements filed with the Commission from July 9, 1992 through August 10, 1993.  As a result of the fraud, the Defendants received ill-gotten gains (mostly profits from selling Regal stock) totaling over $2.2 million.   ,  On November 1, 2002, the Court barred Toll and Edmondson from serving as officers or directors of any public company.  In addition, the Court permanently enjoined all four defendants from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder.  The Court also ordered Toll, Edmondson and Fisher to disgorge their ill-gotten gains: $811,706.50 from Toll, $1,265,613.48 from Edmondson, and $131,000.00 from Fisher.  Edmondsons disgorgement was deemed partially satisfied based on his payment of restitution in the Criminal Action and the remainder was waived based on his financial condition. Similarly, Tolls and Fishers disgorgement were satisfied by their restitution obligations.    ,  The Commission also announced two related administrative proceedings.  In Administrative Proceeding File No. 3-10961, <a href=/litigation/admin/34-46953.htm>Securities Exchange Rel. No.46953</a>, AAE Rel.

Bentz (Bentz) of criminal contempt and sentenced him to three months of imprisonment for violating an asset freeze order.  Bentz, a resident of the Cincinnati area, violated the order by secretly spending funds frozen by the court., In February 2001, the Commission sued Bentz and others for operating a fraudulent Ponzi scheme that raised $20.3 million from over 600 investors in a prime bank trading program.  At the same time, Hon. David F. Hamilton of the U.S. District Court in Indianapolis issued a permanent injunction that prohibits Bentz and other defendants from engaging in fraud and other misconduct in violation of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b), 15(a), and 15(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rules 10b-5 and 15c1-2 thereunder.  The defendants consented to the injunction order without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint.  , The injunction order also froze the assets of Bentz and the other defendants.  In previous civil contempt proceedings, the Commission alleged that shortly before the asset freeze, Bentz obtained approximately $142,000 by borrowing against his assets, and that after the freeze, he spent all or part of the borrowed funds in violation of the freeze.  The court ruled that Bentz violated the freeze, held him in civil contempt, and referred the matter to the United States Attorney, who then initiated the criminal contempt prosecution.

According to the SECs Complaint, the affinity fraud targeted African Americans, and has been ongoing since at least 1998.  Also on December 6, 2002, Judge Ursula Ungaro-Benages, U.S. District Judge for the Southern District of Florida, issued various emergency orders against the defendants, including temporary restraining orders, asset freezes, and orders that they repatriate investor assets that have been sent overseas., The SECs Complaint alleges that A. B. Financing and Blissett falsely guarantee to investors and potential investors that A. B. Financing will generate a 30%, risk- and tax-free annual return on their investment.  According to the SECs Complaint, Blissett entices potential investors to invest with A. B. Finance by claiming that he can offer them an opportunity to make the type of investments, and corresponding profits, that have thus far been offered only to whites or select African Americans.  The defendants also falsely represent that A. B. Financing has over $36 million in assets, when, according to the SECs Complaint, its financials and its federal income tax return for 2001 actually reflect a negative net worth of over $27 million., The SECs complaint also alleges that, although A. B. Financing and Blissett claim to generate returns for investors by making investments in, among other things, real property and securities that are insured, in reality the speculative stock and real estate purchases that A. B. Financing and Blissett have made with investor proceeds have lost millions of dollars and do not provide safe or guaranteed returns.   According to the SECs Complaint, investor losses from A. B. Financings securities trading alone were nearly $2.5 million as of 2001.  Moreover, the real estate assets purchased using investor funds are illiquid and most are encumbered by mortgages.  As a result, the SEC alleges, the defendants have conducted a typical Ponzi scheme by using proceeds that are coming in from new investors to make interest payments to existing investors. , The SECs complaint charges A. B. Financing and Blissett with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

The defendants also distributed sales materials that misrepresented that their commissions would be 15%.  In fact, defendants received commissions ranging between 20% and 22%.  Defendants further represented that LinkTel was a safe investment because the investment was fully insured.

Without admitting or denying the Commissions charges, Syncor consented to the entry of a final judgment in the federal lawsuit requiring it to pay a $500,000 civil penalty and consented to the Commissions issuance of its administrative order., In both its federal court complaint and its administrative order, the Commission charged that, from at least the mid-1980s through at least September 2002, Syncors foreign subsidiaries in Taiwan, Mexico, Belgium, Luxembourg, and France made a total of at least $600,000 in illicit payments to doctors employed by hospitals controlled by foreign authorities.  According to the Commission, these illicit payments were made with the purpose and effect of influencing the doctors decisions so that Syncor could obtain or retain business with them and the hospitals that employed them.  The Commission charged, moreover, that the payments were made with the knowledge and approval of senior officers of the relevant Syncor subsidiaries, and in some cases with the knowledge and approval of Syncors founder and chairman of the board., According to the Commission, by making these payments through its subsidiaries, Syncor violated the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA (Section 30A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934).  The Commission further charged that, by improperly recording these payments - and similar payments made to foreign persons not affiliated with government-owned facilities - Syncor violated the books-and-records provisions of the FCPA (Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934).  Finally, the Commission charged that, by failing to devise or maintain an effective system of internal controls to prevent or detect these violations of the FCPA, Syncor violated the internal accounting controls provisions of the FCPA (Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934)., In determining to accept Syncors settlement offer, the Commission considered the full cooperation that Syncor provided to the Commission staff during its investigation.  The Commission also considered the fact that Syncor - after being alerted to the relevant conduct by another company that was conducting due diligence relating to a previously announced merger with Syncor - promptly brought this matter to the attention of the Commissions staff and the U.S. Department of Justice., In a related proceeding, the United States Department of Justice filed criminal FCPA charges against Syncor Taiwan, Inc., a subsidiary of Syncor.  (U.S. v. Syncor Taiwan, Inc. No. 02-CR-1244-ALL (C.D. Cal.)).  In that proceeding, Syncor Taiwan has agreed to plead guilty to one count of violating the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA and to pay a $2 million fine., The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Department of Justice in its investigation, which is continuing., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp17887.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr17887.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Securities were sold through a group of unlicensed sales agents affiliated with a boiler-room, Franchise Direct. Using scripts and employing hard pressure sales tactics, the sales agents - given bogus vice president titles by the issuer <i>de jour</i> (Nutrition Superstores or Advanced Wound Care) - made egregious misrepresentations and omissions concerning, among other things, the companies holdings and business operations, projected revenues, their impending hot Initial Public Offerings (IPO), use of investor proceeds, and expected profits.  In addition, Advanced Wound Care made misrepresentations regarding purported celebrity endorsements.   Defendants also did not disclose that Franchise Direct and its sales agents received up to 25% of all investor proceeds as commissions.  , Based on the foregoing, the Commission seeks permanent injunctions against Nutrition Superstores, Advanced Wound Care, Franchise Direct, Musso, Gill, Santini, and Doney, based on their violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and as against Franchise Direct and Doney based on their violations of Section 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act.

(Burges Asset) ordering, among other things, that defendants pay approximately $265,000 in disgorgement and $60,000 in civil penalties.  The judgment - which permanently enjoins defendants from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder - was entered by default, the defendants having failed to respond to the Commissions complaint.  , The Commissions complaint, filed on February 19, 2002 in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleged that Burges and Burges Asset sold interests in two limited partnerships, Burges Capital Partners, L.P. and Burges Investment Partners, L.P. (the Burges Funds).  Specifically, the complaint alleged that from at least March 2001 until at least June 2001, Burges raised money for the Burges Funds by means of material misrepresentations and omissions about the use of proceeds and their past performance.  Burges represented that the Burges Funds would invest and trade in foreign currency, such as Euro and Yen.  He also induced investors to invest in the Burges Funds by telling them that he had been very successful investing in foreign currency in the past.  Contrary to these representations, Burges never invested the assets of the Burges Funds in foreign currency but rather misappropriated investor funds.     , In its application for default judgment, the Commission noted that it had identified at least fifty investors from whom Burges fraudulently obtained a total of $266,126 and had obtained evidence showing that Burges spent investors money on hotels, meals, clothes, and other personal amenities, among other things.    , The final judgment permanently enjoins Burges and Burges Asset from, directly or indirectly, violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

(December 12, 2002), <i>In the Matter of Susan Moore</i>, Administrative Proceeding File No. 3-10970 and Securities Exchange Act Release No. 46988, SEC SUES FORMER CEO, CFO AND OTHER TOP EXECUTIVES OF SAFETY-KLEEN CORP. FOR ACCOUNTING FRAUD; COMPANY CONSENTS TO PERMANENT INJUNCTION; CRIMINAL CHARGES FILED AGAINST TWO FORMER OFFICERS  , The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York charging Safety-Kleen Corp. and four of its former senior executives with perpetrating a massive accounting fraud from at least November 1998 through March 2000.  The Commission alleged that these individuals materially overstated the companys revenue and earnings in periodic reports filed with the Commission and in press releases issued by the company.  According to the complaint, the defendants carried out the scheme primarily by making inappropriate quarterly accounting adjustments for the purpose of meeting Wall Street pro forma earnings expectations.  They are also charged with fraudulently recording approximately $38 million of cash that was generated by entering into speculative derivatives transactions. , The complaint alleges that the fraudulent scheme was orchestrated by Paul R. Humphreys, the former Chief Financial Officer.  William D. Ridings, the former Controller, and Thomas W. Ritter, Jr., the former Vice President of Accounting, assisted Humphreys.  As set forth in the complaint, these executives engaged in the illegal conduct to create the illusion that predicted cost savings and business synergies from two large acquisitions were being achieved.  In fact, the expected savings had not materialized, the companys business was declining rapidly, and the company was facing a severe cash flow problem.  , To make up for the earnings shortfall, Humphreys, Ridings and Ritter recorded, or directed others to record, numerous adjustments that were not in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.  The adjustments were made to multiple accounts and generally can be categorized as follows:  (i) improper revenue recognition; (ii) improper capitalization and deferral of operating expenses; (iii) improper treatment of reserves and accruals; and (iv) improper recording of derivatives transactions.  The complaint alleges that Kenneth W. Winger, the former Chief Executive Officer, signed Safety-Kleens periodic reports and knew or was reckless in not knowing that the financial statements contained in those reports were materially false and misleading.  The complaint also alleges that all of the defendants knew or were reckless in not knowing that the companys quarterly earnings press releases were materially false and misleading., After the fraudulent scheme was discovered in late February 2000, the company began an internal investigation, which was conducted by a special committee of the Board of Directors.  On July 9, 2001, Safety-Kleen filed restated financial statements for fiscal years 1997, 1998 and 1999.  The companys restatement reduced net income over the three-year period by $534 million.  Approximately $312 million, or 58%, of the restated net income was in fiscal 1999.  Also on July 9, 2001, the company filed financial statements for fiscal year 2000 reflecting a net loss of $833 million.  , According to the complaint, through this conduct, (i) Safety-Kleen violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder, (ii) Winger violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-2 thereunder, and (iii) Humphreys, Ridings and Ritter violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder.  Humphreys and Ridings also violated Exchange Act Rule 13b2-2.  As relief, the Commission is seeking permanent injunctions, disgorgement of defendants ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and the imposition of civil penalties against Winger, Humphreys, Ridings and Ritter.  The Commission is also seeking officer and director bars against Winger, Humphreys and Ridings., The United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York has filed related criminal charges against Humphreys and Ridings.  Ridings has entered a guilty plea and is waiting to be sentenced.  Ridings also consented, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder.  He also agreed to be permanently barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to pay $28,476.14 of disgorgement and prejudgment interest., Simultaneous with the filing of the complaint, and without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, Safety-Kleen consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.  Ritter consented, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, and 13b2-1 thereunder.  A civil penalty was not imposed against Ritter, and disgorgement and prejudgment interest were waived, based on his sworn statement of financial condition., In a related matter, the Commission instituted a settled cease-and-desist proceeding against Susan Moore, Safety-Kleens former financial reporting manager.  Moore consented to the entry of the order instituting proceedings without admitting or denying the findings therein, including findings that, as directed by her superiors, she participated in the preparation of financial statements that, in the exercise of reasonable care, she should have known<b> </b>were not in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.  Moore was ordered to cease and desist from causing violations and any future violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1, 13a-13 and 12b-20 thereunder. , The Commission acknowledges the cooperation of the United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter. ,  , , <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp17891.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>]"

The SEC alleged that Belden attracted seniors desiring safe investments by advertising certificates of deposit (CDs), and then aggressively pitched to the prospective investors, in lieu of CDs, a purportedly personalized, managed mutual fund investment program.  The SEC alleged that Belden defrauded his clients in a number of ways: by lying about the safety of the managed mutual fund program; by failing to tell the clients about other investment options that were more advantageous; by failing to tell the clients that Southmark Broker would earn a 4% sales commission if the clients invested in the managed mutual fund program; and by failing to tell the clients about disciplinary sanctions that the State of Oklahoma and the NASD had imposed against Belden.  , Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, all defendants consented to the judgment, entered November 21, 2002, by U.

Simultaneously with the filing of the complaint, and without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of Final Judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

A hearing on the show cause order has been scheduled for December 18, 2002.  In an earlier order, the Court permanently enjoined Dunbar from antifraud and registration violations of the federal securities laws and found that Dunbar, of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, owned the Ghost International Website and used it to solicit investors in investment contracts by promises of inordinate amounts of guaranteed returns and promises of no-risk investing, and further found that investors received little or no return despite several months of promises by Dunbar that returns would be paid.  The Court previously ordered Dunbar to pay disgorgement in the amount of $9,600, along with prejudgment interest thereon, and ordered Dunbar to pay a third tier statutory civil penalty in the amount of $120,000., The Commissions motion seeking the order to show cause alleged that Dunbar, after the entry of the injunction against him, obtained funds from at least one investor who purchased the securities by touting Ghost Internationals private contribution and investment program which allegedly paid, for example, $100,000 on a $200 investment over a few weeks.  As with the earlier sales, Dunbar made various promises of exorbitant returns.  Dunbar made various representations to fraudulently induce at least one investor, including that his company dealt in high yield investments and that funds were to be placed in offshore bank accounts, which would pay promised returns for five months of a supposed seven-month program., The permanent injunction enjoined Dunbar from, violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder., <i>See also</i>:  <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17715.htm>L.

These overseas accounts were in the names of companies that Carriere and Eberhart had created when they created Yes Entertainment and commenced their fraudulent scheme in February 1999., The indictment charges the defendants with mail fraud.  Carriere, Eberhart and Hines are also charged with promotional money laundering, and Carriere and Eberhart are charged with international money laundering as well., In its civil action arising from the same set of facts, the Commission charged Yes Entertainment, Carriere and others with violations of the registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The Commission froze more than $602,000 of investor monies in the accounts of Yes Entertainment.  Richard Weissman was appointed Distribution Agent over the frozen monies.  A hearing on Mr. Weissmans proposed plan for distribution of those monies is scheduled for January 6, 2003.<!--<IMG SRC=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=9 ALT= BORDER=0>  <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp17895.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>--><!-- End text -->,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr17895.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

CHARGED WITH MATERIALLY MISLEADING CITS AND TYCOS SHAREHOLDERS BY COLLECTING SECRET $20 MILLION FINDERS FEE IN CONNECTION WITH TYCOS 2001 ACQUISITION OF THE CIT GROUP, INC.</b>, <i>Securities and Exchange Commission v. Frank E. Walsh, Jr.</i>, Civil Action No. 02-CV-9921 , The Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission) today filed a settled civil action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that Frank E. Walsh, Jr. (Walsh) violated the federal securities laws by signing a Tyco International Ltd. (Tyco) registration statement which Walsh knew contained materially misleading statements concerning fees or commissions payable in connection with Tycos June 2001 $9.2 billion acquisition of The CIT Group, Inc. (CIT).  , The Complaint filed in the Commissions civil action alleges the following:  , In late 2000, Walsh, a director of Tyco from 1992 through February of 2002 who served as Chairman of the Tyco Board of Directors (the Board) Compensation Committee, a member of the Boards Corporate Governance Committee, and most recently, Tycos Lead Director, recommended that Tyco consider acquiring CIT.  L. Dennis Kozlowski (Kozlowski), Tycos then and now former Chief Executive Officer, asked Walsh to set up a meeting between Kozlowski and CITs Chief Executive Officer.  After that meeting, Kozlowski proposed to pay Walsh a finders fee for his services if the transaction was consummated.  When the transaction was submitted to the Board, Walsh voted in favor of the transaction but intentionally did not disclose to the Board that he would receive a substantial fee in connection with the transaction.  , The terms and conditions of the Tyco/CIT merger were set forth in the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated March 12, 2001 (the Agreement and Plan of Merger).  The Agreement and Plan of Merger contained a representation by Tyco that, other than Tycos investment bankers for the transaction, no other investment banking or finders fees were to be paid in connection with the transaction.  The Agreement and Plan of Merger was incorporated by reference in, and attached to, a registration statement (the Registration Statement) filed by Tyco with the Commission for the securities related to the contemplated merger between Tyco and CIT.  As a director of Tyco, Walsh signed the Registration Statement.  At the time that he signed, Walsh knew that the Registration Statement contained a material misrepresentation regarding the payment of a finders fee because he knew that he stood to obtain a substantial fee if the transaction was consummated.  , After the transaction was consummated, pursuant to Walshs prior agreement with Kozlowski to receive a fee, Kozlowski caused Tyco to pay him a $20 million finders fee in the form of $10 million in cash and a $10 million charitable contribution to a foundation chosen by Walsh.  The $20 million finders fee was paid by Tyco, and, accordingly, operated as a deceit on CITs and Tycos shareholders., Walsh, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violations of the federal securities laws (Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5), permanently barring him from acting as an officer or director of a publicly-held company, and ordering him to pay restitution of $20,000,000.00; provided, however, that restitution shall be offset, in part or in whole, by any restitution paid by Walsh in the case of <i>People of the State of New York v.

The Commissions Complaint, filed on May 8, 2001, alleges that Juan Pablo Ballesteros was tipped by Jose Luis Ballesteros, his father and a director of Nalco Chemical Company (Nalco) who has since died.  The Complaint alleges that Jose Luis Ballesteros told his sons that Nalco was going to be acquired, and that Juan Pablo Ballesteros then purchased Nalco stock, making illegal profits of $106,403.75.  , The Commissions Complaint specifically alleges that on June 25, 1999, Juan Pablo Ballesteros purchased 12,500 Nalco shares at a price of $44.4877 per share, through an account in the name of Casford Limited, an entity he controlled.  On June 28, 1999, Nalco and Suez Lyonnaise des Eaux, S.A., (Suez) jointly announced that they had signed a definitive merger agreement, calling for Suez to pay $53.00 per Nalco share.  The Complaint alleges that on November 15, 1999, Juan Pablo Ballesteros tendered the Nalco shares in his Casford account and realized profits of $106,403.75., Without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions Complaint, Juan Pablo Ballesteros consented to the entry of the Courts final judgment.  The judgment orders Juan Pablo Ballesteros to pay a penalty of $106,403.75.

(Mercator), a Wilton, Connecticut-based software company.  The Commissions complaint alleges that Ira A. Gerard (Gerard) of Ridgefield, Connecticut, the former Chief Financial Officer of Mercator Software, Inc., and Karen S. Harris (Harris), of Riverside, Connecticut, Mercators former Controller, engaged in improper accounting practices in the first two quarters of 2000 by intentionally failing to record known expenses in an attempt to meet analysts earnings expectations during those two quarters.  The Complaint alleges that because of Gerard and Harris conduct, Mercator materially understated its expenses in publicly released financial statements for the first two quarters of 2000.  Gerard agreed, without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, to pay a civil penalty of $35,000.  Harris agreed, without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, to pay a civil penalty of $25,000., The Commission also instituted and simultaneously settled administrative cease-and-desist proceedings against Mercator, Gerard, and Harris.  The Commission found that Gerard and Harris violated the antifraud provisions and caused Mercators violations of the periodic reporting, record-keeping and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the Commissions findings, Gerard and Harris consented to an order requiring them to cease and desist from committing or causing any violation and any future violation of those federal securities laws, including Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-13 and 13b2-1 thereunder.

According to the evidence at trial, Dr. Lin reaped approximately $1,500,000 in ill-gotten gains from manipulating the common stock of Surgilight, Inc., a publicly traded company headquartered in Orlando, Florida.  Dr. Lin artificially inflated the market price of Surgilight stock tenfold (from approximately $2.50 to over $25 per share) through a series of false and misleading press releases detailing the companys purported ability to cure age-induced vision deterioration known as Presbyopia.  Dr. Lin simultaneously dumped a substantial amount of Surgilight stock on an unsuspecting public through two nominee accounts and then wired the proceeds overseas., At the time of his indictment, the Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) filed a civil action against Dr. Lin and others in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida.  The Commissions complaint alleges that Dr. Lin violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Sections 10(b), 13(d), and 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 13d-1, 13d-2, 16a-2, and 16a-3 thereunder.

No. 01-10031-RWZ (D. Mass.)</h2>]","[The Commission announced that, on December 10, 2002, a federal judge sentenced Gordon J. Rollert to six months of home confinement and two years of probation, and ordered him to pay a $15,000 fine and $100,000 in restitution to a former investment advisory client, in connection with charges brought by the Massachusetts U.S. Attorneys office.  In January 2001, Rollert, formerly the principal of registered investment advisers Sage Advisory Services LLC (Sage) and Standard Group Holdings LLC (Standard) of Wellesley, Massachusetts, was indicted on two counts of wire fraud and one count of mail fraud by a grand jury sitting in the District of Massachusetts.  On September 26, 2002, Rollert, of Wellesley, Massachusetts, pled guilty to each of the three counts., The indictment alleged that Rollert made false statements to a registered broker-dealer in connection with a fraudulent soft dollar scheme.  According to the indictment, Rollert effected trades for a churchs account at an agent broker, then directed the broker to use a portion of those commissions to make soft dollar payments to, among other entities, FA Partners.  The indictment alleged that Rollert falsely assured the broker that the payments were authorized by the church and were made to legitimate service providers.  In fact, the indictment alleged, Rollert took approximately $264,000 of these payments for his personal benefit without the permission of the church., On February 8, 2001, the Commission filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts in connection with the same fraudulent scheme discussed in the indictment.  The Commissions complaint alleged, among other things, that between 1990 and April 1997, Rollert defrauded the church and other clients of more than $1.1 million.  In its complaint, the Commission alleged that Rollert misappropriated soft dollar credits generated by trades effected for the churchs endowment fund.  The Commissions complaint also alleged that Rollert fraudulently offered investments in his own advisory businesses to the church., Soft dollar credits are created when an investment adviser and a broker-dealer enter into an arrangement in which a percentage of commissions are used to pay for products and services, such as research, that help the adviser in making investment decisions.  Because soft dollar credits are generated by commissions paid by the advisory client, they are assets of the client. Soft dollar arrangements are permissible under the securities laws if there is appropriate disclosure to the client about the products and services for which the soft dollars will be used, as well as disclosure that the client may pay higher commission rates as a result of the soft dollar arrangement., As a result of the conduct described in the complaint, the Commission charged Rollert with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 207 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and aiding and abetting Sages violations of Sections 206(1), and 206(2) of the Advisers Act.

The Commissions complaint alleged that Luers represented to subscribers that the recommendations were produced by a staff of multiple professional traders, when in fact Luers alone produced them and was not a professional trader.

Brooks of Winthrop, Maine, permanently enjoining him from securities law violations and ordering disgorgement of his trading profits from alleged insider trading.  The judgment was entered with the consent of the defendant, who neither admitted nor denied the allegations of the Commissions complaint.  The courts action concludes the Commissions lawsuit against  Brooks for illegal insider trading in the common stock of CMP Group, Inc. based on information he received about an upcoming merger while employed by CMP., The Commissions complaint alleged that Brooks, then a financial analyst for Central Maine Power Company, a subsidiary of CMP, invested more than $80,000 in the CMP stock fund through his 401(k) plan on June 14, 1999, the day before CMP publicly announced its plan to merge with Energy East Corporation.  According to the complaint, on the day before his purchase Brooks received a highly unusual call at home from his supervisor requesting him to come into the office immediately to provide certain financial information to Central Maines Coordinator of Financial Communications.  When he arrived at the office that Sunday, Brooks allegedly noted a number of senior executives there and discussed with his supervisor his view that CMP must be planning to make a public announcement.  The following day, Brooks discussed the financial information he had gathered with Central Maines Corporate Treasurer.  Immediately afterward, the complaint alleges, he ordered the move of his assets to the CMP stock fund.  According to the complaint, Brooks transfer of funds was an abrupt reversal of an investment order he had made late on Friday.  Before his Sunday visit to the office, Brooks had ordered that all his 401(k) assets be transferred to a money market fund so that none would be in the CMP stock fund.  After his discussions on Sunday and Monday, Brooks canceled that order and instead transferred half his assets into the CMP stock fund.  The following day, June 15, Energy East and CMP publicly announced that their companies had signed a merger agreement and the price of CMP stock rose approximately 28%.  Brooks allegedly made a profit of $21,117 through his illegal insider trading. , The Courts final order in this case permanently enjoins Brooks from violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, provisions of the federal securities laws which prohibit fraudulent conduct.  In addition, the order requires Brooks to disgorge $21,117, representing his total profits from his CMP trading, plus prejudgment interest of $5,270.  Based on Brooks sworn financial statements, all but $10,852 of the total amount was waived., This is the final settlement in two insider trading actions brought against Central Maine employees arising from CMPs merger with Energy East.  <i>See SEC v.

The Commission is asking the Court to enjoin both defendants from violating the federal securities laws, to order Earls to disgorge his ill-gotten gains and pay a civil penalty, and to bar Earls from serving as an officer or director of any public company.   , The Commissions complaint alleges that from June 1998 through August 2002, Earls misappropriated approximately $13.8 million from investors who believed they were giving Earls money to purchase preferred stock and warrants from UST.  According to the complaint, Earls carried out this scam through a limited liability company he created called USV Partners LLC.  The complaint charges that Earls falsely told investors in USV Partners that the entity was created solely to purchase and hold UST stock and warrants, and that he would not take any management fees.  According to the complaint, Earls lured more than one hundred investors into giving him more than $20 million to purchase UST stock and warrants through USV Partners.  Although UST badly needed the capital infusion, according to the complaint, Earls bought only a small portion of the stock he promised investors.  He then allegedly misappropriated $13.8 million of their money by paying himself $4.7 million in management fees and $9.1 million that he falsely classified as Legal and Accounting expenses.  As alleged in the complaint, neither UST nor Earls has ever publicly disclosed Earls diversion of these investor funds. , The complaint further charges that Earls and UST made numerous materially misleading statements and omissions to cover up Earls misdeeds.  For example, the complaint alleges that while touting Earls supposed business experience and acumen, Earls and UST failed to disclose that he had previously been accused of misappropriating investor funds in connection with several other companies.  Earls and UST are also charged with failing to reveal the material weaknesses noted by its independent auditor concerning its internal accounting controls.   Most recently, according to the complaint, Earls and UST failed to disclose that half of its board of directors resigned in or about April 2002., The Commissions complaint charges UST with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the Securities Act), Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act), and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13.  It charges Earls with violating Securities Act Section 17(a), Exchange Act Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5), and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1.  The complaint also charges Earls with aiding and abetting USTs violations of Exchange Act Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(b), and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13.  , In a related criminal proceeding, Earls was charged with securities fraud, mail fraud, and wire fraud. <i>United States v.

Michael, Jr.), TERRY DOWDELL PLEADS GUILTY TO CRIMINAL CHARGES IN CONNECTION WITH MULTI-MILLION INVESTMENT FRAUD, The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that Terry L. Dowdell pled guilty today to 20 felony charges, including Securities Fraud, Money Laundering and Wire Fraud, in connection with a multi-million fraudulent trading program Dowdell operated since 1998.  The plea was entered before the Honorable Judge James H. Michael, Senior U.S. District Court Judge for the Western District of Virginia, Charlottesville Division.  The prosecution of this case is being conducted jointly by the United States Attorney for the Western District of Virginia and the Criminal Fraud Section of the United States Department of Justice., The charges arise out of a fictitious investment program that Dowdell operated through Vavasseur Corporation, a Bahamian company controlled by Dowdell.  According to the 20 Count Information filed in the District Court, investors in this program (the Vavasseur Program) were required to sign an investment contract with Vavasseur Corp., termed a Discretionary Investment Management Agreement (Agreement).  The agreement falsely represented that investor funds would be maintained in a bank account registered as Vavasseur Corp. for the benefit of (Client name), and committed Vavasseur:  , to use its best efforts to achieve anticipated profits. . . in an amount equal to or exceeding Four Percent (4%) of the Clients funds under management for each week in which trading occurs.  [Vavasseur] shall use its best efforts basis to cause trading of Clients funds in a minimum of forty weeks during each fifty-two week Agreement term., This would result in annualized gross return of 160%., As Dowdell now admits, there were no trades or investments made by Vavasseur, but rather investors were paid profits in a typical Ponzi scheme fashion from new investor funds diverted to Dowdells AmSouth accounts., The criminal charges come approximately one year after the SEC filed a civil lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia against Dowdell, Vavasseur and others in connection with the same fraudulent investment scheme.  On the day that the SEC filed its lawsuit, November 19, 2001, the Court entered a Temporary Restraining Order prohibiting Dowdell and his associates from raising any additional funds for the Vavasseur Program, ordering frozen all of Dowdells assets, and requiring the repatriation of all Vavasseur assets located outside of the United States.  In connection with this order, more than $23 million of funds directly traced to Vavasseur investors has been frozen in various U.S. banks, including the AmSouth Bank, the Bank of America and The Chase Manhattan Bank.  , On June 4, 2002, Dowdell admitted to the fraud in the SECs action in a Consent and Stipulation, and the Court entered an order the same day permanently enjoining Dowdell from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The judgment provides that the amount of disgorgement and civil penalties that Dowdell will have to pay will be determined later.  On July 12, 2002, the Court appointed Roy M. Terry, Esq. and the law firm of DurretteBradshaw, PLC as Receiver over Dowdells assets and to develop a plan of distribution for the return of funds to injured investors.  , In his Consent and Stipulation, Dowdell admitted that other foreign nationals, including Shinder Gangar and Alan White, citizens and residents of the United Kingdom, have continued to raise investor funds in connection with the Vavasseur program even after November 19, 2001, and further admitted that various foreign banks have been used in furtherance of the fraud, including Overseas Development Bank &amp; Trust and Investors Bank &amp; Trust in Dominica, the Bank of Ireland in Ireland, Banamex Bank in Mexico, Butterfield Bank in the Commonwealth of Guernsey, Investec Bank in Israel, Fortis Bank in Belgium and Cathay Bank in Belize. , The SEC and Department of Justice have been coordinating their enforcement efforts with law enforcement authorities in the United Kingdom and other countries, including the U.K. Serious Fraud Office (SFO), the Leicestershire Constabulary, the U.K. Financial Services Authority (FSA), the Antwerp Police, and Irelands Criminal Asset Bureau.  In related enforcement actions in October 2002, the SFO and the Leicestershire Constabulary arrested Gangar, White and two others suspected of involvement of the Vavasseur Program and other fraudulent investment programs, and the FSA filed civil charges and obtained a worldwide asset freeze against White, Gangar and their accounting firms Dobb White &amp; Co a and Morris White &amp; Co., accusing them of running an unlawful investment scheme.  , Additional information concerning the SECs lawsuit against Dowdell can be found in <a href=http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr17242.htm target=_top>Litigation Release No. 17242</a>, November 19, 2001, <a href=http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr17454.htm target=_top>Release No. 17454</a>, April 2, 2002, <a href=http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr17553.htm>Release No. 17553</a>, June 10, 2002, <a href=http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr17880.htm>Release No. 17880</a>, October 10, 2002, and <a href=http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr17881.htm>Release No. 17881</a>, October 10, 2002., Additional information on how prime bank and other banking-related investment schemes work can be found at the SECs Prime Bank Fraud Information Center (<a href=http://www.sec.gov/divisions/enforce/primebank.shtml target=_top>http://www.sec.gov/divisions/enforce/primebank.shtml</a>) in the enforcement section of the SECs Web site. ,  , <!--<P><IMG SRC=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=9 ALT= BORDER=0>  <A href=/litigation/complaints/comp17905.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</A></P>--><i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr17905.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

(eWealth), a registered broker-dealer; eWealth Holdings, Inc. (Holdings), eWealths parent company; Neil Formisano (N. Formisano), Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Holdings; Donald Cunningham (Cunningham), President of Holdings; and eWealth registered representatives, Jonathan Aronica (Aronica) and Steven Mastrosimone (Mastrosimone).  The court issued the preliminary injunction after a hearing and finding that the Commission had shown that it is likely to succeed in establishing the allegations contained in its complaint.  The Commissions complaint, filed on October 29, 2002, alleges that defendants have fraudulently obtained over $7 million from approximately 100 investors in the offering of unregistered Holdings securities. The complaint further alleges that, since January 2000, defendants have misled investors through a host of patently false representations about Holdings - including a repeated misrepresentation that Holdings would conduct an initial public offering (IPO) in the near future., The preliminary injunction order follows a temporary restraining order entered on October 29, 2002 and enjoins the defendants until final resolution of the action from violating antifraud, registration, and books and records provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and from participating in any penny stock offerings.  Pending resolution of the action, the preliminary injunction order also freezes defendants assets; requires the defendants to submit accountings; prohibits defendants from destroying documents and other evidence; prohibits defendants from witness tampering, suborning perjury or otherwise impeding this case; and appoints a receiver for Holdings and eWealth. , The Commission alleges that the defendants have deceived actual and prospective investors since January 2000 by claiming that Holdings is on the verge of launching an IPO.  According to the complaint, Holdings has never filed any registration statement with the Commission or otherwise taken any steps toward an IPO.  The Commission also alleges that the defendants have made baseless projections that Holdings stock would trade at 4 to 5 times its offering price on the secondary market.  The defendants are also alleged to have misrepresented, among other things, key facts concerning Holdings management, use of investor proceeds, and business activities, including that Holdings had entered into contract to purchase a bank and developed a provider of online financial solutions to banks and other financial institutions., The complaint names the following defendants:, , The complaint seeks, as final relief against all defendants, permanent injunctions against future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act, and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. In addition, the complaint seeks to enjoin eWealth from future violations of Sections 15(g), 17(a) and 17(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 17a-4(j) and 15g-9 thereunder, and seeks to enjoin N. Formisano from future violations or aiding and abetting future violations of Sections 17(a) and 17(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 17a-4(j) thereunder. The Commission also seeks against all defendants, disgorgement of all ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.

Nolan &amp; Co., Inc., and its president and majority shareholder, William J. Nolan, should not be held in contempt of court for failing to pay $192,028.29 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest ordered by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia on June 11, 2002.  The Commission is asking the Court to enter an order finding W.J. Nolan and William Nolan in civil contempt and requiring W.J. Nolan and William Nolan to pay the previously-ordered disgorgement and prejudgment interest, plus post-judgment interest, immediately.,  In its Motion, the Commission alleged that on September 24, 2001, the Commission entered an order against W.J. Nolan finding that registered representatives at W.J. Nolans offices in Chicago, Illinois and on Park Avenue in New York engaged in a pattern of sales practice abuses, including churning customer accounts and making unsuitable and unauthorized trades in microcap and penny stocks.  As a result of this conduct, the Commission found that W.J. Nolan failed to reasonably supervise those registered representatives in violation of Section 15(b)(4) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, allowed unregistered individuals to effect transactions in securities in violation of Section 15(b)(7) of the Exchange Act and Rule 15b7-1 thereunder and willfully failed to comply with the Commissions requirements for penny stock transactions in violation of Section 15(g) of the Exchange Act and Rules 15g-2, 15g-3 and 15g-6 thereunder.  Among other things, the Commissions order required W.J. Nolan to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest totaling $192,028.29 within thirty days of the entry of the order.  William Nolan, on behalf of W.J. Nolan, consented to the entry of the Commissions September 24, 2001 order.  Yet, W.J. Nolan failed to pay the disgorgement and prejudgment interest as ordered.  William Nolan owned and made all decisions on behalf of W.J. Nolan throughout the relevant time period before and after the judgment.  In October and November 2001, William Nolan caused W.J. Nolan to file a Form BDW with the Commission seeking to withdraw its registration as a broker-dealer with the Commission, sold assets belonging to W.J. Nolan for $750,000 and deposited the funds into his personal bank accounts in order to avoid paying the Commissions judgment.  As a result, the Commission seeks to hold William Nolan personally in contempt of court for W.J. Nolans failure to pay and is asking the Court to require William Nolan to pay the judgment., For further information, see <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17324.htm>LR-17324</a> (January 16, 2002) and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17595.htm>LR-17595</a> (July 1, 2002).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr17907.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The defendants are William R. Kerr of Los Angeles, California and China Investment Group, Ltd., a British Virgin Islands corporation headquartered in Los Angeles., The Commissions complaint alleges a massive securities fraud orchestrated by William R. Kerr and his company, the China Investment Group, Ltd. (CIG).  According to the complaint, Kerr induced more than sixty investors throughout the United States, as well as in Canada, to invest over $12 million in his fraudulent investment program that he falsely promised would yield exorbitant returns within a matter of weeks or months.  The complaint further alleges that, in furtherance of this scheme, Kerr posed as a wealthy, politically connected businessman and made numerous false and materially misleading representations to his investor victims and to various intermediaries who he knew would echo his false claims to other investor victims.  These false and materially misleading representations, according to the complaint, included claims (i) that Kerr had control of a $200 million trust; (ii) that Kerr could use the trust as leverage to trade in medium term bank notes (MTNs); (iii) that this MTN trading would yield profits of more than 13,000% of the amount invested; (iv) that Kerrs company, CIG, conducted the MTN trading; (v) that the World Bank supported Kerrs trading program; and (vi) that Kerrs investment program was safe and was backed by Kerrs personal guarantee.  Further, the complaint alleges that, instead of investing his victims funds as he had represented, Kerr misappropriated it, and failed to return either profits or principal to his investor victims., The Commissions complaint charges both defendants with securities fraud, sale of unregistered securities, and acting as an unregistered broker-dealer, in violation of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act), and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5.

The defendants are Russell W. Jones of Logan, Utah and R&amp;D Marketing, Inc., a Utah corporation., The Commissions complaint alleges that the defendants acted as the primary broker and wholesaler of a fraudulent bank-instrument trading program through which they defrauded investors throughout the United States of at least $1.9 million, including at least $240,000 from Virginia investor-victims.  According to the complaint, Jones, acting through R&amp;D Marketing, dispatched a network of local agents around the country, including Lytle E. Foglesong in Virginia, to solicit investors for the program.  Jones supplied these agents, according to the complaint, with fraudulent representations that were echoed to investors: (1) that investors funds would be used to trade in European bank instruments; (2) that this activity would yield returns in excess of 200% within forty-five days; and (3) that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) sponsored the program.  The complaint further alleges that, rather than investing the investors funds in such a bank-instrument trading program, Jones unilaterally decided to wire the funds to an altogether different fraudulent program, supposedly involving the purchase and re-sale-at rapid and exorbitant profits-of assets from estate auctions in Europe.  The complaint further alleges that Jones failed to inform the investors or obtain their consent, and that the funds disappeared shortly after Jones wired them in June 1997.  Finally, the complaint alleges that thereafter, and continuing into 2002, Jones lulled investors by (among other things) assuring them that they would still realize the promised returns by sharing in the proceeds of yet another fraudulent program., The Commissions complaint charges each of the defendants with securities fraud, sale of unregistered securities, and acting as an unregistered broker-dealer, in violation of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act), and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5.

Mabie, Jr., and two other company employees, alleging that they made materially false or misleading statements about the company and its sole product, a purported safety syringe, and obtained more than $1.5 million in ill-gotten gains from stock they sold at fraudulently inflated prices.  , The Complaint alleges that from at least 1997 through 1999, Maxxon and Mabie made materially false or misleading statements on television, in press releases, on the Internet, and in other media.  Among other things, the Complaint alleges, Maxxon and Mabie falsely or misleadingly stated that the companys syringe could be produced for the same cost as a standard syringe, that the companys syringe met federal government safety standards, that Maxxon was conducting clinical trials with its syringe, that Maxxon had begun manufacturing its syringe, and that Maxxon had received orders for the syringe.  In addition, the Complaint alleges, Maxxon and Mabie falsely or misleadingly stated that major health-care companies had determined that Maxxon had the best safety syringe device in the world, that a major health-care company had expressed an interest in acquiring Maxxon, and that representatives of the Swedish government were negotiating with Maxxon to build a plant, which would be paid for by the Swedish government.    , The Complaint alleges that while Maxxon and Mabie made these materially false or misleading statements, Mabie sold more than 1 million Maxxon shares at fraudulently inflated prices and made profits of at least $1,541,817.59.  , The Complaint alleges further that from February 20, 2002, through July 15, 2002, Maxxon, Mabie, and Thomas R. Coughlin, Jr., Maxxons Medical Advisor, issued materially false or misleading statements in press releases concerning the status of Maxxons 510(k) application with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), in which Maxxon sought to have the FDA approve a new version of its syringe.  Among other things, the Complaint alleges, Maxxon stated in an April 8, 2002, press release, Maxxon anticipates the 510(k) application will be approved upon receipt of answers to questions raised by the FDA.  According to the Complaint, this statement was materially false or misleading because at the time, there was no reasonable basis for the statement and Mabie and Coughlin were aware of undisclosed facts undermining the accuracy of the statement.  For example, the FDA in a December 19, 2001 letter, had informed Maxxon that its application was administratively incomplete, that the application had been placed on hold, and that the FDA wanted additional information from Maxxon before a substantive review of the application could begin.  , Also, during this same period, the Complaint alleges, Mabie and Rhonda R. Vincent, Maxxons Financial Reporting Manager, caused Maxxon to submit filings to the Commission that contained materially false or misleading statements regarding the status of FDA approval of the syringe.    , While these materially false or misleading statements were in the market, the Complaint alleges, Mabie, Coughlin, and Vincent each sold Maxxon shares at fraudulently inflated prices, and Mabie made profits of at least $60,356; Coughlin made profits of at least $50,290; and Vincent made profits of at least $29,526.93.   , The Complaint charges all of the defendants with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, which prohibit the making of materially false or misleading statements in connection with the purchase or sale of securities.  The Complaint also charges Mabie with violations of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), which prohibits unregistered sales of securities, and charges Maxxon, Mabie, and Vincent with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, which prohibits the making of materially false or misleading statements and failing to disclose material facts in the offer or sale of securities.  The Complaint also charges Maxxon with violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 13a-1, 13a-13, and 12b-20, which prohibit the making of materially false or misleading statements in filings with the Commission, and charges Mabie and Vincent with aiding and abetting Maxxons violations.    , The Commission seeks permanent injunctions against all the defendants and disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties against all the individual defendants.  The Commission also seeks against Mabie a statutory and equitable permanent bar from acting as an officer or director of any public company, a permanent bar from participating in an offering of penny stock, and an accounting by Mabie of all stock sales and trading profits that he received from the sale of Maxxon stock during the time of the alleged fraud.    , <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/comp17911.htm>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>, For tips on how to avoid Internet pump-and-dump stock manipulation schemes, visit <a href=/investor/online/pump.htm target=_top>http://www.sec.gov/investor/online/pump.htm</a>.  , For more information about Internet fraud, visit <a href=/divisions/enforce/internetenforce.htm target=_top>http://www.sec.gov/divisions/enforce/internetenforce.htm</a>.   , To report suspicious activity involving possible Internet fraud, visit <a href=/complaint.shtml target=_top>http://www.sec.gov/complaint.shtml</a>. <!-- End text -->,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr17911.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"
