The final judgment permanently enjoins Thomas from violating the antifraud, books and records, internal accounting controls, and securities ownership reporting provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay civil money penalties totaling $540,000., The judgment against Thomas arises out of an April 21, 2005 civil action filed by the Commission against Exotics.com, Inc., a Nevada corporation based in Vancouver, British Columbia, and 12 other principal defendants and a relief defendant. The Commission alleges in its complaint that, between at least 1999 and 2002, Exotics.com, which was then an Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board company in the business of operating adult Web sites, was the subject of a stock manipulation and accounting fraud perpetrated by, among others, its officers, attorneys and outside auditors. The Commission alleges that Thomas, a founder and former CEO and director of Exotics.coms sole operating subsidiary, played a role in the scheme by, among other things, providing false and misleading financial data that was incorporated into a press release issued by Exotics.com. The Commission also alleges that Thomas, as CEO and a director of the subsidiary, failed to implement a system of internal accounting controls and to ensure that the company maintained accurate books and records. In addition, the Commission alleges that Thomas, who beneficially owned more than 15% of the total Exotics.com shares outstanding, failed to file any required beneficial ownership reports with the Commission., The final judgment enjoins Thomas from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, the books and records and internal accounting controls provisions, Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and the securities ownership reporting provisions, Sections 13(d) and 16(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13d-1 and 16a-3 thereunder.

In the suit, filed in United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, the Commission alleged that former CEO David L. McQuillin of Sudbury, Massachusetts, former CFO Lisa W. Zappala of Needham, Massachusetts, and Lawrence B. Evans of Cambridge, Massachusetts, Aspens founder and former Chairman of the Board of Directors, engaged in a fraudulent revenue recognition scheme, causing Aspen to report inflated revenue on at least six software transactions during fiscal years 1999 through 2002., According to the Commissions Complaint, the three defendants engaged in a scheme to inflate revenue reported in Aspens publicly-filed financial statements and in press releases. The Complaint alleges that the three defendants caused Aspen to recognize revenue during the relevant period despite knowing that Aspen was prohibited from doing so under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (also known as GAAP) because contracts were not signed within the appropriate quarter and/or the earnings process was incomplete due to contingency arrangements which changed the terms of the customers payment commitments under the contracts. On November 24, 2004, Aspen announced that it would file a restatement of its financial statements for the periods involved and that its board of directors had requested and obtained McQuillins resignation. Thereafter, on March 15, 2005, Aspen filed with the Commission a restated Form 10-K for its fiscal years ended June 30, 2000 through June 30, 2004. The Complaint alleges that, as a result of the fraudulent scheme, Aspen overstated license revenue for its fiscal year ended June 30, 2000 by 5.5% and for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2001 by 9.3%. The Complaint further alleges that, as a result of prematurely recognized revenue from those earlier periods, license revenue for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2002, 2003, and 2004 was understated by 1.8%, 13.9%, and 4.0% respectively., The Complaint alleges that the defendants violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The Complaint also alleges that the defendants violated Exchange Act Section 13(b)(5) and Exchange Act Rules 13b2-1 and 13b2-2. The Complaint further alleges that the defendants aided and abetted Aspens violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

(Ahold), engaged in a large-scale fraud that, for fiscal years 2001 and 2002, materially overstated income by approximately $700 million in Commission filings and other public announcements. Browns illegal acts and failures to act occurred when Brown was USFs Corporate Controller., The Commissions complaint alleges that, at the instruction of USF executives who supervised her, Brown directed that materially overstated promotional allowance entries be recorded in the books and records of USF. The complaint alleges that these entries did not reflect the companys actual operating performance; instead, they were determined solely by what USF required to make its budgeted earnings. The complaint also alleges that Brown knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that the entries improperly inflated operating income reported on USFs financial statements, which were consolidated into Aholds Commission filings and other public statements., According to the complaint, Brown made or directed others to make entries in USFs books and records that she knew, or was reckless in not knowing, were false, without basis in fact, and did not comply with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. The complaint alleges that these entries included releases of reserves and accruals to make up for earnings shortfalls. Finally, the complaint alleges that Brown provided Aholds independent auditors with false and/or misleading information in connection with their reviews and audit of USFs financial statements., Brown has agreed to settle the Commissions action, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining her from violating Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder and from aiding and abetting any violation of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder.

In August 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) originally filed an emergency action alleging insider trading in advance of the August 3, 2005, announcement by Reebok International Ltd. (Reebok) that it had agreed to be acquired by adidas-Salomon AG (Adidas). The Commission subsequently brought charges against Shpigelman in an amended complaint filed on March 11, 2006. Through subsequent amendments, the Commission has charged a total of 17 individual defendants, located in the United States and Europe, as participants in the insider trading ring, involving trading in at least 27 different stocks., The Commissions complaint alleges that Shpigelman, a former mergers and acquisitions analyst at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., Inc. (Merrill Lynch), leaked confidential information to defendants Eugene Plotkin and David Pajcin concerning at least six mergers or acquisitions that Merrill Lynch was working on, prior to the time the deals became public, including deals between (i) The Proctor &amp; Gamble Company and The Gillette Company; (ii) Novartis AG and Eon Labs, Inc.; (iii) Duke Energy and Cinergy Corp.; (iv) Quest Diagnostics, Inc. and LabOne, Inc.; (v) Celgene Corp. and a company considering acquiring Celgene; and (vi) Reebok and adidas. Plotkin and Pajcin traded on the insider information and passed the insider information on to individuals in the United States and Europe who also traded on it. The Commissions complaint also charges Plotkin and Pajcin with orchestrating two separate insider trading schemes, involving trading based on non-public information obtained from: (i) advance stolen copies of Business Week magazine; and (ii) a federal grand jury in the District of New Jersey that was convened to investigate, among other things, potential accounting fraud at Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., On December 4, 2006, the Honorable Chief Judge Kimba M.

Clarion Capital was a Chicago hedge fund formed to market time international mutual funds available through variable annuities.

After the purchase of each contract, Fife and Clarion Management engaged in market timing until their activity was detected and restricted by Lincoln. The complaint also alleges that when Lincoln imposed certain trading restrictions, Fife and Clarion Management caused the trusts to surrender the contracts, and then used deceptive means to disguise the purchase of more variable annuity contracts, including using previously unused trusts and limited liability companies.

All of the individuals charged, Carl Allen, Gary Bell, Donald Childers, John Crowder, Joseph Grendys, Anthony Holohan, Chris Jakubek, John King, Steve LeBarron, Patrick Penderghast, Frank Riggio, Michael Smith, and Richard Vecchia, were employees of or agents for vendors that supplied U.S. Foodservice., The Commissions complaints allege that U.S. Foodservice personnel contacted vendors and urged them to sign and return the false confirmation letters.

The Court also entered a final judgment resolving the Commissions claims against the relief defendant, Jaime Elliott., The Commissions complaint alleged that from late 2001 to September 2005, Massimi, the Funds manager, and Grebow, the Funds trader, conducted a fraudulent offering of investments in HMC and misappropriated assets of the Fund. The Commission alleged that Massimi and Grebow materially misrepresented the Fund as a pooled investment vehicle that engaged in low risk day trading, and that Massimi falsely assured investors that he was a hands-on manager, who maintained diligent oversight of the Funds assets and trading. In fact, Massimi and Grebow were sending investors false monthly account statements that portrayed their investments as profitable when, in reality, Grebow was systematically looting the Funds trading account and Massimi was using new investor money to redeem investments and pay profit distributions in order to conceal the fraud. Throughout the period the Fund was operating, Massimi and Grebow benefited from lucrative profit distributions based on fictitious brokerage account statements. The Commission further alleged that as Massimi faced increasing investor concerns about the Funds legitimacy and government inquiries into his misconduct, he diverted assets to Elliott to shield them from investors and government authorities., Without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, the defendants have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining defendants HMC, Massimi and Grebow from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and defendants Massimi and Grebow from future violations of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940; Massimi has consented to pay $1,266,168 in disgorgement, $69,984 in prejudgment interest and a $120,000 civil penalty; and Grebow has consented to pay $2,467,472 in disgorgement, $517,595.77 in prejudgment interest and a $120,000 civil penalty.

MBIA Inc.</i>, 07 Civ. 658 (JGK) (SDNY), January 29, 2007</h2>, <h2>MBIA to Pay $50 Million to Settle Securities Fraud Charges for Misuse of Reinsurance Contracts</h2>]","[On January 29, 2007, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it filed a settled civil action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging securities fraud charges against MBIA Inc., one of the nations largest insurers of municipal bonds, arising out of a sham reinsurance transaction that was restated in 2005, which the Company had previously entered into to avoid having to recognize a $170 million loss. MBIA suffered the loss when, in 1998, the Allegheny Health, Education and Research Foundation (AHERF) defaulted on bonds guaranteed by MBIA and MBIA was forced to make good on its guarantee. MBIA addressed analyst concerns about its expected losses on the AHERF bonds by representing that it had obtained reinsurance to cover them. In fact, MBIA had agreed through concessions on other reinsurance agreements to compensate the reinsurers for the losses they were certain to incur on the AHERF contracts. The improper use of the reinsurance contracts enabled MBIA to convert what would otherwise have been the companys first-ever quarterly loss into a profit and reverse the decline in MBIAs stock price., Under the settlement, MBIA consents to the entry of a final judgment directing it to pay a $50 million penalty plus $1 in disgorgement and, in a related administrative proceeding, consents to a cease-and-desist order and to retain an independent consultant to examine a number of other specified transactions to which MBIA was a party., The Commissions complaint, filed today, alleges that MBIA learned in 1998 that AHERF would default on $256 million of municipal bonds that MBIA had guaranteed, which would have resulted in MBIAs first-ever quarterly loss. To mask the financial effect of this loss, MBIAs then-senior management devised a scheme to obtain reinsurance that would cover the entire net present value of the anticipated loss, or about $170 million, for a nominal premium. The effect was to offset the entire $170 million loss MBIA recorded in the third quarter with a roughly equivalent reinsurance recovery, thus converting a loss in the quarter to an apparent gain., The AHERF reinsurance consisted of three contracts under which the reinsurers agreed to provide coverage of up to $170 million for the AHERF loss. In order to pass scrutiny with MBIAs accountants and obtain their approval for the desired accounting treatment, these contracts were written as if it was unclear whether the reinsurers would have to pay out under them. In fact, however, MBIA and the reinsurers knew that the reinsurers would be called upon to pay, making the $170 million received by MBIA from the reinsurance companies ineligible for reinsurance accounting., MBIA reimbursed the reinsurers for the $170 million they paid to MBIA by entering into other reinsurance agreements on hundreds of millions of dollars of future MBIA business. Although the reinsurers undertook some risk under these other agreements, they were nevertheless reimbursed for their payments to MBIA on the AHERF contracts because the other agreements entailed so much premium and so little risk to the reinsurers., In addition, MBIA secretly entered a side agreement with one of the reinsurers whereby it orally agreed to re-assume virtually all of the risk given to the reinsurer on the future business, leaving the reinsurer with all the premiums and virtually no risk., In March 2005, MBIA restated $70 million related to these agreements, after an internal investigation concluded that it appeared likely that the oral side agreement existed. In November 2005, MBIA restated the remaining $100 million., In connection with the settlement, MBIA has agreed, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, to pay a $50 million penalty, plus $1 in disgorgement. In a related administrative proceeding, MBIA has agreed, without admitting or denying the Commissions findings, to the issuance of a cease-and-desist order that requires MBIA to cease and desist from further violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11,13a-13, and 13b2-1 thereunder, and to comply with various undertakings, including an undertaking to retain an independent consultant to examine a number of specified transactions. The corporate penalty in this case was negotiated before the Commission issued its Statement Concerning Financial Penalties (<a href=/news/press/2006-4.htm>http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2006-4.htm</a>).

In the latter, Enterasys agreed to take a debt or equity interest in its customer, in return for that companys agreement to use those funds to purchase product from Enterasys., In a related criminal case, Hurley pled guilty to one count of wire fraud and cooperated with the U.S. Attorneys Office for the District of New Hampshire in the prosecution of U.S. v.

Vanderkam as a defendant.  Vanderkam is the former securities counsel to Allixon.  The SEC filed the original lawsuit in November 2005 against Allixon and other defendants to halt an ongoing unregistered distribution of 1.3 million shares of Allixons common stock., The amended complaint alleges that Vanderkam participated in the illegal distribution of the 1.3 million Allixon shares, which represented 94% of the companys float.  The 1.3 million shares were issued to two offshore entities without a restrictive legend based on Vanderkams opinion letter that the Allixon stock offering complied with Section (sic) 504 of Regulation D and the laws of the State of Texas.  In fact, the offering failed to comply with the requirements of Rule 504 under Regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933, and the offering was never registered in, and had no connection to, the State of Texas.  The two offshore entities, defendants Silver Lake Investments, Inc. and Crescendo Investments Inc., were control persons of Allixon who allegedly sold over 900,000 of the Allixon shares in the Pink Sheets for approximately $4.3 million., In settlement of the SECs lawsuit against him and without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Vanderkam has consented to the entry of an agreed final judgment, permanently enjoining him from future violations of the securities-registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act, ordering $26,964 in disgorgement and interest, and ordering a $25,000 civil penalty. In addition, the consent order bars Vanderkam from issuing opinion letters under Rule 504 of Regulation D., In a related administrative enforcement action, the SEC, on February 1, 2007, instituted settled administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings against Temple Securities Ltd., a Turks and Cacios brokerage firm, and Gregory Greatrex, a Temple Securities employee.  The Commissions order finds that Temple Securities, which had previously been named as defendant in the SECs injunctive action against Allixon, and Greatrex, participated in the unregistered distribution of Allixon shares on behalf of brokerage customers, Silver Lake Investments and Crescendo Investments.  The SECs order directs Temple Securities and Greatrex to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Temple Securities to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations of Section 15(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

RenaissanceRe Holdings Ltd.</i>, 07 CV 865 (S.D.N.Y.)</h2>, <h2>Reinsurer Settles Accounting Fraud Case Involving Sham Reinsurance Transaction</h2>]","[Washington, D.C., February 6, 2007 - The Securities and Exchange Commission filed settled securities fraud charges in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against RenaissanceRe Holdings Ltd. (RenRe), a property catastrophe reinsurance company. In its complaint, the Commission alleges that RenRe created a sham reinsurance transaction that had no economic substance and no purpose other than to smooth and defer over $26 million of its earnings from 2001 to 2002 and 2003. In effect, the transaction enabled RenRe to create a cookie jar into which it put excess revenue in one good year, to be pulled out in a future year to increase income., In settling the Commissions charges, RenRe agreed to an injunction, to retain an independent consultant, and to pay a $15 million civil penalty, among other things., In September 2006, the Commission charged RenRes former chairman and chief executive officer, James N. Stanard, RenRes former controller, Martin J. Merritt, and a former senior vice president of RenRes principal reinsurance subsidiary, Michael W. Cash. Those charges remain pending in federal court in Manhattan., According to the Commissions complaint, RenRe concocted a sham transaction to smooth its earnings. RenRe used two seemingly unrelated contracts that were, in fact, intertwined to conceal what was in reality simply a round trip of cash. In the first contract, RenRe purported to assign $50 million of receivables at a discount to Inter-Ocean Reinsurance Company, Ltd. in exchange for $30 million in cash, for a net transfer to Inter-Ocean of $20 million. RenRe recorded income of $30 million upon executing the assignment agreement. The remaining $20 million of its $50 million assignment became part of a bank or cookie jar that RenRe used in later periods to bolster income., The second contract was a purported reinsurance agreement with Inter-Ocean that was, in fact, a vehicle to refund to RenRe the $20 million transferred under the assignment agreement plus the purported insurance premium paid under the reinsurance agreement. This reinsurance agreement was also a sham. Not only was RenRe certain to meet the conditions for coverage; it also would receive back all of the money paid to Inter-Ocean under the agreements plus investment income earned on the money in the interim, less transactional fees and costs., RenRe accounted for the sham transaction as if it involved a real reinsurance contract that transferred risk from RenRe to Inter-Ocean when in fact, the complaint alleges, certain of RenRes senior officers knew that this was not true. RenRes former controller and former chief executive officer also misrepresented or omitted certain key facts about the transaction to RenRes auditors. As a result of RenRes accounting treatment for this transaction, RenRe materially understated income in 2001 and materially overstated income in 2002, at which time it made a claim under the reinsurance agreement. It then received as apparent reinsurance proceeds the funds it had paid to Inter-Ocean and that Inter-Ocean had held in a trust for RenRes benefit., In a Feb. 22, 2005 press release, RenRe announced that it would restate its financial statements for the years ended Dec. 31, 2001, 2002 and 2003. On March 31, 2005, RenRe filed its Form 10-K for the year ended Dec. 31, 2004, which contained restated financial statements for those years. RenRes former chief executive officer signed and certified the 2004 Form 10-K. However, both the press release and the Form 10-K attributed the restatement of the Inter-Ocean transaction to accounting errors due to the timing of the recognition of Inter-Ocean reinsurance recoverables. These statements were misleading. In fact, the transaction contained no real reinsurance and the companys restated financial statements accounted for the transaction as if it had never occurred. In short, the entire transaction was a sham, and the company both failed to disclose that fact and misrepresented the reasons for the restatement., The Commissions complaint charges RenRe with securities fraud in violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5(a), (b), and (c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and with violating the reporting, books-and-records, and internal controls provisions of Exchange Act Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2) and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, and 13b2-1. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, RenRe has consented to a judgment requiring it to pay a civil penalty of $15 million and nominal disgorgement of $1 and permanently enjoining it from future violations of the federal securities laws. RenRe has also consented to undertakings that, among other things, require it to retain an independent consultant to review the design and implementation of the prior review conducted by independent counsel and the additional procedures performed by the companys auditors and make recommendations concerning the adequacy of RenRes internal controls, audit department, and compliance function., The corporate penalty in this case was negotiated before the Commission issued its statement Concerning Financial Penalties (<a href=/news/press/2006-4.htm>http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2006-4.htm</a>). The Commission has therefore elected not to apply that Statement to this corporate penalty., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2007/comp19989.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr19989.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Relating to Options Backdating Scheme; Former Controller Consents to Permanent Injunction, Officer-and-Director Bar, and Payment of $886,557</h2>]","[On February 6, 2007, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed civil injunctive actions against Gary C. Gerhardt, the former Chief Financial Officer of Engineered Support Systems, Inc., and Steven J. Landmann, the companys former Controller, alleging that they participated in a six-year fraudulent options backdating scheme in which they granted undisclosed, in-the-money stock options to themselves and to other Engineered Support officers, employees, and directors. According to the complaints, Engineered Support employees and directors received approximately $20 million in unauthorized compensation as a result of the backdating, $15 million of which was received by top executives and directors. Gerhardt and Landmann personally profited by $1,906,300 and $518,972 respectively. Landmann has consented to settle the action., The complaints allege that, from 1997 through 2002, Gerhardt instructed Landmann to backdate company stock option grants to coincide with historically low closing prices of Engineered Supports common stock. The companys stock options vested at the time of grant, allowing the option recipients to obtain immediate cash profits. In addition, the complaints allege that, on at least two occasions, Gerhardt ordered Landmann to cancel previously issued Engineered Support stock options that had fallen out-of-the-money and to reissue them with new backdated grant dates and exercise prices, to bring them back in-the-money. The complaints also allege that Gerhardt directed Landmann to issue additional Engineered Support stock options to nonemployee directors in excess of authorized amounts, from which these directors received a total gain of approximately $6 million., As part of the scheme, Gerhardt and Landmann allegedly caused Engineered Support to misrepresent in its Forms 10-K and proxy statements filed with the Commission that all stock options were granted at the fair market value of the stock on the date of the award. Engineered Support also failed to report the additional compensation its executives had received through in-the-money option grants. In addition, the company failed to disclose the repricing of options that had fallen out-of-the-money, or the granting of stock options to nonemployee directors in excess of authorized amounts., The complaints also allege that Gerhardt and Landmann caused Engineered Support to file materially misstated financial statements with the Commission in its Forms 10-K and 10-Q that did not recognize compensation expense for the companys stock option grants, as required by generally accepted accounting principles. As a result, Engineered Support overstated its aggregate pretax operating income by approximately $26 million, or 21%, for fiscal years 1997 through 2002., The Commissions complaint against Gerhardt alleges that he violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Sections 10(b), 13(b)(5), and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, 13b2-1, 13b2-2, and 14a-9 thereunder, and aided and abetted violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1, 13a-13, and 12b-20 thereunder. The Commission is seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, including prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and a bar from serving as an officer or director of any public company against Gerhardt., Without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, Landmann has consented to a permanent injunction from violating and/or aiding and abetting violations of the antifraud, proxy statement, reporting, record-keeping, and the false statements to auditors provisions of the federal securities laws. Specifically, Landmann has consented to be enjoined from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b), 13(b)(5), and 14(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, 13b2-2, and 14a-9 thereunder, and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1, 13a-13, and 12b-20 thereunder. Landmann has also consented to pay disgorgement of $518,972, prejudgment interest of $108,099, and a civil penalty of $259,486, and to be permanently barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company. The settlement is subject to approval by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri., As part of the settlement, Landmann has also consented to be permanently suspended from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant, pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3) of the Commissions Rules of Practice, based on the anticipated entry of a permanent injunction against him., The Commissions investigation in this matter is continuing., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> SEC Complaints in this matter:<br/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2007/comp19990gcg.pdf>Gary C.

Oil for Food Program - - Company Agrees to Pay $7.7 Million</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed Foreign Corrupt Practices Act books and records and internal controls charges against El Paso Corporation (El Paso), a Texas-based energy company, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.  The Commissions complaint alleges that from approximately June 2001 through June 2002, El Paso, and its predecessor in-interest The Coastal Corporation, indirectly made approximately $5.5 million in illegal surcharge payments to Iraq in connection with its purchases of crude oil from third parties under the U.N. Oil for Food Program.  The Program was intended to provide humanitarian relief for the Iraqi population, which faced severe hardship under international trade sanctions.  However, beginning in August 2000, officials of Iraqs State Oil Marketing Organization (SOMO), began demanding illegal kickbacks.  The kickbacks were made in the form of surcharges, and were sent to Iraqi-controlled accounts at banks in Jordan and Lebanon., According to the Commissions Complaint:, In September 2000, The Coastal Corporation  which merged with an El Paso subsidiary in January 2001 - received its first surcharge demand from a SOMO official.  An El Paso consultant and former Coastal official arranged a $201,877 surcharge payment on the companys behalf, which was made to an Iraqi-controlled account at Ahli Bank in Jordan.  After receiving notice from SOMO that all oil contracts would include surcharges, El Paso ceased direct purchases from SOMO.  Instead, it continued its purchases through third parties.  Beginning in June 2001, El Paso entered into fourteen additional third-party transactions involving fifteen contracts to purchase some 21.4 million barrels of oil.  Approximately 25 to 30 cents of every barrel was illegally kicked back to Iraq by third parties.  El Pasos oil traders had to factor the surcharge into their oil price, and there are recorded conversations of the companys officials and traders discussing the surcharges.  El Paso knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that $5.5 million in illegal surcharges were made on those contracts, and passed back to El Paso in premiums., El Paso failed to maintain an adequate system of internal controls to detect and prevent the payments.  Although El Paso inserted a provision in some contracts requiring the third party to represent that it had not paid surcharges, El Paso failed to conduct due diligence to ensure that surcharges were not paid.  Recorded conversations reveal El Pasos knowledge that the provision was entirely ineffective.  In one conversation, a third party that indicated he was willing to pay illegal surcharges to Iraq indicated that he would be equally willing to sign a false certification denying the payment.  El Pasos accounting for its Oil for Food transactions failed properly to record the nature of the companys payments.  In at least fifteen transactions, a portion of the companys price for oil constituted kickbacks to Iraq.  The company failed to so designate those payments, characterizing them instead simply as part of the cost of goods sold.  El Paso ceased its oil trading and refinery business entirely by March 2004., El Paso, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, ordering it to disgorge $5,482,363 in profits, and to pay a civil penalty of $2,250,000.  El Paso will satisfy its disgorgement obligation by forfeiting $5,482,363 pursuant to a non-prosecution agreement with the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York., Since being approached by the Commissions staff, El Paso has cooperated with the Commissions investigation, which is continuing.

Erickson, while serving as audit committee chairman and a director of MHR, purchased MHR call options during the time MHR was exploring a possible merger or sale of the company.  The complaint alleges that Erickson was briefed regularly on the status of negotiations and participated in key decisions regarding the Cimarex deal.

According to the Commission, Erickson purchased and exercised the options based on material, nonpublic information about MHRs merger negotiations and, ultimately, the Cimarex deal., Further, the Commission alleges that Erickson failed to report to the Commission his purchases of MHR call options, a requirement for corporate insiders.  In addition, the Commission alleges that Erickson was late in disclosing to the Commission the exercise of his options, and further alleges that his ultimate disclosure was materially falseindicating, incorrectly, that he had exercised the options after the merger announcement., The Commission alleges in its complaint that Erickson violated Sections 10(b) and 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 16a-3(a), and 16a-3(g)(1) thereunder.

On the morning of February 7, 2005, in breach of his duty of trust and confidence owed to SINA, Chiang, with the assistance of Chen, positioned himself to profit from a drop in SINAs stock price by placing eight separate orders to sell short 200,000 shares of SINA securities in Chens mothers account. Due to the limited buying power in the account, ultimately, four orders totaling 70,000 shares of SINA were sold short in the account. After the close of the market on February 7, SINA announced that it was expecting a revenue shortfall, and its stock price dropped approximately 26%. As a result of his unlawful insider trading, Chiang realized $257,833 in ill-gotten gains., Simultaneously with the filing of the complaint, Chiang has consented, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, to the entry of an order that permanently enjoins him from violating, directly or indirectly, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The complaint charges that defendants committed fraud by misappropriating client assets for use in Kothares Players Choice venture, among other things, without disclosing the risks of the investment or Kothares conflict of interest. In many instances, Kothare did not inform the client that he had made the investment in Players Choice., The Commission obtained an order temporarily restraining all of the Defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, and Kothare and Sterling from violating the custody, books and records and registration provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers Act). The Court froze the assets of all of the defendants and appointed a temporary receiver for Sterling and Players Choice. The Court also ordered the defendants to promptly provide sworn accountings, ordered that discovery be accelerated and that the defendants be prohibited from destroying documents, and ordered that a hearing be held on March 8, 2007 to determine if the interim relief should be continued., The Commissions complaint charges the following individuals and entities:, The complaint charges that the defendants misappropriated at least $1.75 million from 18 Sterling investment advisory clients and invested the money in Players Choice, a now apparently insolvent entity that Kothare controls. In breach of his fiduciary duty, Kothare transferred Sterling clients funds to Players Choice without obtaining the clients written consent and without disclosing significant conflicts of interest. At some point, Kothare disclosed the investments in Players Choice on the clients Sterling account statements, but he failed to disclose that he controlled Players Choice. The account statements also reflected a market value for the Players Choice investment, even though the investment was illiquid and had no market value. The market value that Kothare disclosed in the account statements was set by Kothare with no reasonable basis and falsely portrayed the investment as having maintained or even increased in value, when, in fact, Players Choice had become essentially worthless. The Commissions complaint alleges that Kothare failed to disclose to investors that Players Choice lost its most significant asset  a two-year license from the Major League Baseball Players Association that was critical to its business. Having lost its license, Players Choice has no saleable assets or revenues., In addition to the Players Choice scheme, the Commissions complaint alleges that Kothare breached his fiduciary duty to at least one other investment advisory client by transferring assets from the clients custodial brokerage account to Kothare related entities after the clients death., The Commissions Complaint charges all Defendants with fraud in violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the Securities Act) and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) and Kothare and Sterling with violations of Sections 204, 206(1), 206(2), 206(4) and 207 of the Advisers Act.

(Take-Two), alleging that during a seven year period, Brant enriched himself and others by granting undisclosed, in the money stock options to himself and to other Take-Two officers and employees., The Complaint alleges that from 1997 through September 2003, Brant, with the participation and knowledge of senior executives and others at Take-Two, looked back and picked grant dates for the Companys incentive stock options that coincided with dates of historically low annual and quarterly closing prices for Take-Twos common stock, resulting in grants of in-the-money options. Brant and others at Take-Two referred to this practice as pick-a-date option granting. According to the Complaint, Brant granted options to himself and others at Take-Two without complying with Take Twos stock option plans and, in virtually all instances, without the Board or a Committee thereof approving the grant dates or exercise prices. The Complaint alleges that at Brants direction, Take-Two officers and employees prepared documents falsely indicating that the option grants had been made on earlier dates when Take-Twos stock price had closed lower. From 1997 to September 2003, Brant awarded himself ten backdated option grants, representing a total of approximately 2.1 million shares of Take Two common stock. Brant exercised all those options before resigning from Take Two on October 16, 2006., The Complaint alleges that because of the undisclosed backdating scheme, Take Two filed with the Commission quarterly and annual reports, proxy statements and registration statements that Brant knew, or was reckless in not knowing, contained materially false and misleading statements concerning the true grant dates and proper exercise prices of stock options, and which misled investors to believe that stock options were granted in accordance with the terms of the applicable stock option plans. According to the Complaint, Take-Two materially understated its compensation expenses and materially overstated its quarterly and annual pre-tax earnings and earnings per share in its financial statements. Take-Two has announced that it must restate historical financial results for multiple years in order to record additional non-cash charges for option-related compensation expenses., Without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions Complaint, Brant consented to the entry of an order: (1) permanently enjoining him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b), 13(b)(5), 14(a), and 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, 14a-9, and 16a-3, and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a 1, and 13a 13; (2) permanently barring him from acting as an officer or director; and (3) requiring him to disgorge ill-gotten gains of $4,118,093 with $1,143,513 in prejudgment interest thereon, and to pay a $1,000,000 civil penalty. The settlement is subject to the approval of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York., Brant previously settled with the Commission for his alleged role in a massive financial fraud at Take Two in 2000 and 2001.

The Commission charged Olesnyckyj with securities fraud for participating in a multi-year scheme to secretly backdate stock options granted to thousands of Monster officers, directors and employees., The complaint alleges that, from 1997 through 2003, Olesnyckyj backdated stock options grants to coincide with the dates of low closing prices for the Companys common stock, resulting in grants of in-the-money options to numerous individuals. When making grants of options, certain officers and employees at Monster would select a low closing stock price at which they wanted to grant stock options. Olesnyckyj, or others acting at his direction, then prepared backdated documentation for Monsters Compensation Committee containing the grant date that reflected the low closing price for Monsters common stock. Olesnyckyj then caused Monster to misrepresent in its periodic filings and proxy statements that all stock options were granted at the fair market value of the stock on the date of the award, when that was simply not the case. In fact, by backdating the options, Monster granted undisclosed compensation to its employees, failed to recognize compensation expenses, and overstated its net income by $340 million from 1997 through 2005. Olesnyckyj, 45 and a resident of New Providence, New Jersey, personally profited by receiving backdated options., The complaint further alleges that Olesnyckyj misled Monsters outside auditors in an attempt to hide the backdating scheme by providing documentation to them that misrepresented the grant date of the stock option awards., The complaint charges Olesnyckyj with violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and with violating or aiding and abetting the violation of reporting requirements. The Commission is seeking permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, civil monetary penalties, and an officer and director bar., The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York and the United States Postal Inspection Service, which conducted their own separate, parallel investigation resulting in distinct criminal charges., The Commissions investigation in this matter is continuing., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2007/comp20004.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20004.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Brady, the former chief executive officer of Dallas-based i2 Technologies, Inc. and a defendant in the Commissions July 2005 enforcement action against three former i2 officers arising from an alleged scheme to overstate i2s revenues. Without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, Brady has consented to the entry of a final judgment enjoining him from violating or aiding and abetting violations of the antifraud, record-keeping, reporting, internal-controls and false-statements-to-auditors provisions of the federal securities laws. He also has consented to an order barring him from serving as a public company officer or director for a period of five years, and to pay a civil penalty and disgorgement, with prejudgment interest, totaling approximately $8.3 million. The settlement is subject to approval by United States District Judge Sidney A. Fitzwater., The Commissions Complaint alleges that, over the four years ended December 31, 2001 and the first three quarters of 2002, i2 misstated approximately $1 billion of software license revenue, including over $125 million of revenue it never should have recognized. The Complaint further alleges that Brady participated and assisted others in a fraudulent revenue-recognition scheme by, among other things, signing i2 public filings containing the misstated financial statements, providing representation letters to i2s external auditors certifying the misstated financial statements and the quality of i2s internal controls, and approving earnings releases and participating in public conference calls at which materially false and misleading financial information was provided. The Commissions complaint also alleges that Brady profited by trading i2 securities on the basis of material nonpublic information., The proposed Judgment to which Brady has consented, without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, enjoins him from violating or aiding and abetting violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder. The proposed Judgment also prohibits Brady from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $7,800,344 and a third-tier civil penalty of $500,000.

The complaint further alleges that for these reasons, Cornerstones fiscal year 2000 and 2001 Form 10-K and fiscal year 2001 10-Qs improperly represented that Cornerstones financial statements complied with GAAP.

Mueger (Mueger).  On February 2, 2007, the Honorable Berle M.

Mueger, et al.</u>, Civil Action No. 93-5200 (E.D. Pa.).  Mueger consented to the entry of the Final Judgment, without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions complaint, except as to jurisdiction.  , In the civil injunctive action filed by the Commission in 1993, the Commissions Complaint alleged that, from January 1988 through June 1989, Mueger participated in an ongoing scheme to sell the worthless securities of Amglo Industries, Inc. (Amglo) and Amglobal Corporation (Amglobal) through manipulative activities, and through false and misleading representations about the companies.  The Complaint further alleged that many of the securities were not registered with the Commission and originated from stock certificates that were either fabricated or improperly issued by the companies or their transfer agents.  According to the Complaint, Mueger and others utilized a fraudulent broker-dealer network to distribute more than $3.4 million in these worthless securities in the over-the-counter market, and that this fraudulent network channeled the securities from undisclosed brokerage accounts controlled by Mueger and/or others to bona fide public investors.  The Commissions Complaint alleged that, ultimately, the scheme to defraud collapsed in the summer of 1989, after the distribution of approximately $3.4 million of worthless securities to unwitting investors through the over-the-counter market.  In January 1994, the Commissions civil action was stayed upon the request of the office of the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania., The Final Judgment permanently enjoins Mueger from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Rules 101 and 102 of Regulation M of the Exchange Act.  The Final Judgment orders Mueger to pay disgorgement together with prejudgment interest in the amount of $1,057,543, but waives payment of the same based on Muegers inability to pay.  The Commission did not seek a civil penalty from Mueger because the alleged wrongdoing preceded the effective date of the Securities Enforcement Remedies and Penny Stock Reform Act of 1990.  (Pub. L. No. 101-429, 104 Stat. 931 (1990)). , The Commission also announced today that it issued an Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions barring Mueger from association with any broker or dealer (the Order). The Order is based on the permanent injunction contained in the Final Judgment and its entry completes the Commissions litigation in connection with the described scheme to defraud.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20007.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The final judgment against Moore, age 56, of Philadelphia, entered on February 12, 2007, permanently enjoins Moore from violating antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a $120,000 civil penalty., The Commissions Complaint, filed September 14, 2005, alleges that, beginning in April 2003, Biopure received negative information from the FDA regarding its efforts to obtain FDA approval of its synthetic blood product Hemopure but failed to disclose the information, or falsely described it as positive developments.  Specifically, the Complaint alleges that in April 2003, the FDA placed a clinical hold barring Biopure from conducting clinical trials of Hemopure in trauma settings such as emergency rooms, because of safety concerns about Hemopure.  The Complaint further alleges that, during the next eight months, Moore and other Biopure employees concealed the imposition of the clinical hold while making public statements about Biopures plans to obtain approval for trauma uses of Hemopure.  In addition, according to the Complaint, in July 2003 the FDA informed Biopure that it had not approved Biopures application for use of Hemopure in orthopedic surgery, and instead conveyed serious concerns about whether the materials Biopure had submitted in support of its application were reliable and questioning the safety of Hemopure.  According to the Complaint, Biopure, however, issued public statements beginning on August 1, 2003 describing the FDAs communication as good news, causing its stock price to increase by over 20%.  The Complaint alleges that Moore and other Biopure employees continued to make misleading statements until December 2003.  During this period, Biopure raised over $35 million from investors.  The Complaint further alleges that as the true status of Biopures efforts to obtain FDA approval gradually became public, through a series of incomplete and misleading disclosures between late October and the end of December 2003, the companys stock price plummeted almost 66% from its August 1 price., To settle the Commissions charges, Moore consented, without admitting or denying the allegations of the Complaint, to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from committing future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b 5 and 13a-14 thereunder and from aiding and abetting future violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-11 and 13a-13 thereunder.

According to the Commissions complaint, from at least 2000 through 2006, Graham and Braintree made numerous oral and written misrepresentations to more than 200 investors nationwide and in foreign countries regarding the expected rate of return, level of profits and risks associated with the investment.  Moreover, the Commission alleges, Graham and others failed to disclose that Graham intended to and did take approximately 30% of investors funds for himself.  The Commission alleges that Graham and Braintree, through their fraud, obtained at least $9 million of investor funds and diverted approximately $3 million for Grahams personal use., The Commission alleges that Braintree and Graham solicited potential investors through, among other means, Braintrees website and cold calls.  According to the complaint, Braintree, both through its offering documents and oral representations by Graham and others, told potential investors that they could expect the return of their principal within months to a year.  The Commission alleges that Braintrees offering documents also exaggerated projected profits, touting expected total returns on investment ranging from 500% to 900%.  The Commission alleges that Graham and others at his direction also told investors that the wells would provide them with profits for years to come.  The Commission alleges that these projections lacked any basis in fact.  The Commission also alleges that Graham and others at his direction led investors to believe that investing in their offerings was not risky, falsely assuring some investors that Braintree had never offered interests in wells that did not produce, and that investors monies were safer than if they had invested in certificates of deposit.  The complaint alleges that, in fact, most investors have received no profits and most have not even recovered their initial investments.  Finally, the Commission alleges that contracts between Braintree and the investors outlined the purported costs of drilling and completing the wells.  However, the Commission alleges, defendants failed to disclose that Graham intended to take approximately 30% of their money for personal expenses such as for the purchase or lease of cars and other personal expenditures, and for other non-business payments to friends and family members., The Commissions complaint charges Braintree and Graham with violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws (Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)] and Rule 10b-5 thereunder [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5], and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)]); with the unregistered offer and sale of securities (Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77e]); and with failure to register as a broker-dealer (Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78o(a)]).

According to the complaint, Azevedo subsequently purchased 14,000 ADSs of Perdigão on June 20, 2006, on the basis of material, nonpublic information concerning the proposed acquisition, and in breach of a duty of trust and confidence he owed to ABN AMRO. Azevedo sold 10,500 ADSs on July 17, 2006, one day after Sadia had publicly announced its tender offer for Perdigão.

The Amended Complaint alleged, in pertinent part, that: (1) Ehrlich personally solicited funds from GetAnswers investors while using the alias John Lloyd. Ehrlich used the alias to mask his identity because he is a convicted felon; (2) Ehrlich told numerous untruths to lure investors to invest in GetAnswers. Among other things, Ehrlich told investors they were purchasing the GetAnswers stock at $3.00 per share but that it was worth $5.00. Ehrlich also told over fourteen investors that GetAnswers was seeking SEC approval to go public and/or that GetAnswers was about to be acquired by a Fortune 500 company. Ehrlich misled investors by stating that their investment was safe with little or no risk and that he did not receive commissions; and (3) Ehrlich was GetAnswers top sales agent and earned over $500,000 in transaction-based commissions for selling GetAnswers stock., For further information, see Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17933.htm>17933</a> (January 15, 2003).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20014.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Registered direct offerings generally are characterized as privately negotiated sales of securities by public companies pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement. Crestview and Flink made false representations in the offering documentation for the two registered direct offerings that Crestview funds had not shorted the respective issuers stock in the ten trading days preceding the signing of the documentation. Without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, Crestview and Flink have agreed to a civil injunction for violations of the federal securities laws.

The Honorable Charles S. Haight, Jr., United States District Judge, Southern District of New York, also ordered a freeze of Blue Bottles and Stokess assets, as well as an order requiring them to repatriate funds transferred to overseas accounts. In addition, the Court ordered the defendants to appear on March 7, 2007, to show cause why the Court should not enter a preliminary injunction extending the asset freeze and other ancillary relief entered in the Temporary Restraining Order pending a final determination of the case., The Commissions complaint alleges that Blue Bottle and Stokes, immediately prior to the publication of news releases by 12 different U.S. public companies, repeatedly traded in the securities of those companies, including options and equities trading. The Commission alleges that the defendants fraudulently gained access to material nonpublic information through fraudulent devices, schemes, or artifices, which may include, but are not limited to, hacking into computer networks or otherwise improperly obtaining electronic access to systems that contain information about imminent news releases. The complaint alleges that, with the material nonpublic information in hand, defendants traded ahead of the public dissemination of that information, realizing profits of $2,707,177. The Commission further alleges that Blue Bottle and Stokes provided false information and used fake documents to open an account at the U.S. broker-dealer through which they executed the illegal trades., The Commission alleges that the illegal trading, which began in early January 2007, was in the securities of the following 12 U.S. companies: AllianceBernstein Holding L.P., Allscripts Healthcare Solutions Inc., Achillion Pharmaceuticals Inc., BJs Wholesale Club Inc., Brady Corporation, CACI International, Inc., Hornbeck Offshore Services, Inc., LeCroy Corporation, Millipore Corporation, Odyssey Healthcare Inc., Symantec Corporation, and RealNetworks, Inc. For instance, with respect to the defendants trading in Symantec, the complaint alleges that on January 12, 2007 at approximately 1:03 p.m. EST, the defendants began buying 10,000 SYMC Jan07 20 put contracts, which represented 20 percent of the total trading in that security for the day. Those contracts were out-of-the money when purchased. Later that same day, at approximately 1:37 p.m. EST, the defendants began buying 500 SYMC Jan07 22.5 put contracts, which represented 41 percent of the total trading in that security for the day. All of the put contracts were to expire on January 20, 2007. Essentially, buying the put options was a bet by the defendants that the price of Symantec stock would decrease. The Commission further alleges that on the next trading day, January 16, 2007, at 7:48 a.m. EST, Symantec issued a downward revision of its third quarter 2007 earnings and revenue forecast. Shortly following Symantecs announcement, the defendants began selling the put contracts, amassing a profit of $1,030,471., As a result of the illegal trading in the 12 companies, the Commission alleges that Blue Bottle and Stokes violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5.

According to the complaint, in each of its first three quarterly earnings announcements of 2003, the Engineered Support Systems announced earnings that beat analysts estimates and raised its earnings guidance above analysts estimates, resulting in more than a 10% increase in the stock price on the day of each announcement. The complaint alleges that Davis tipped Kopsky before each announcement. Kopsky purchased Engineered Support securities for himself, family members, and/or his clients.

Roberts, the former General Counsel and Corporate Secretary of McAfee, Inc., with securities fraud for wrongfully re-pricing McAfee stock option grants awarded to him and others in an effort to secretly increase the value of the grants.

Roberts concealed his fraudulent re-pricing by filing false stock ownership reports with the Commission, and by failing to properly disclose in a McAfee proxy statement, which he signed, that the grant had been illicitly re-priced to confer a potential benefit of approximately $197,500 on Roberts., The complaint also alleges that in 2002, Roberts, in his capacity as secretary of the compensation committee of McAfees board of directors, falsified the minutes of a compensation committee meeting, and directed the company to issue a 420,000 share option grant to McAfees chief executive a day later than the committee had directed. By re-dating the grant to a day after the committees intended grant date, Roberts gave the chief executive a potential benefit of approximately $739,200, due to an intervening decline in McAfees stock price. Roberts later signed a company proxy statement that misleadingly described the chief executives option grants, and failed to disclose that the CEO had received an extra $739,200 of potential value due to the unauthorized re-pricing., Roberts was terminated from his positions at McAfee, Inc. in May 2006, after he confessed his option re-pricing to members of McAfees board of directors. Roberts did so as McAfee was conducting an internal investigation into option granting practices., Roberts is charged with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, the antifraud provisions; with violating Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder, for circumventing internal controls; and with violating Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 16a-3 thereunder, regarding disclosures of stock ownership by public company officers.

Zehil is a resident of Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida and worked at the firms offices in New York, New York, and Jacksonville, Florida., The Complaint alleges that between January 2006 and February 2007, Zehil represented seven public companies in issuing their stock in PIPE transactions (private investments in public equity). The seven public companies were Gran Tierra Energy, Inc., Foothills Resources, Inc., MMC Energy, Inc., Alternative Energy Sources, Inc., Ethanex Energy, Inc., GoFish Corp., and Kreido BioFuels, Inc. At all relevant times, their common stock was registered with the Commission and quoted on the OTC-BB. In these PIPE transactions (as in PIPEs generally), the investors purchased restricted stock at a discount to market price., The Complaint also alleges that Zehil personally invested in the issuers PIPE transactions through Strong and Chestnut. In the subscription agreements for each PIPE transaction, the Defendants agreed (as all the PIPE subscribers did) that the shares they received would be issued with restrictive legends until such time as the issuers filed registration statements with the Commission and the Commission declared them effective. As counsel for the issuers, Zehil then sent letters to the issuers transfer agents directing the issuance of shares to the PIPE subscribers. Zehils letters instructed that all the shares should bear restrictive legends except the shares issued to his entities, Strong and Chestnut. Zehils letters stated, falsely, that the shares issued to Strong and Chestnut satisfied legal criteria to be issued without restrictive legend.

The complaint alleges that in the second scheme, several securities industry professionals and a hedge fund made dozens of illegal trades and hundreds of thousands of dollars in illicit profits using inside information misappropriated by an attorney at Morgan Stanley to trade ahead of corporate acquisition announcements (the Morgan Stanley Scheme). Collectively, the complaint alleges, the defendants made at least $15 million in illicit profits from these two insider trading schemes., The Commissions complaint alleges that in the UBS Scheme, from at least 2001 through 2006, Mitchel S. Guttenberg, an executive director in the equity research department of UBS, illegally tipped material, nonpublic information concerning upcoming UBS analyst upgrades and downgrades to at least two Wall Street traders, Erik R. Franklin and David M.

Franklin also traded in his and his father-in-laws personal accounts. The complaint alleges that to avoid detection of this scheme, Guttenberg used coded text messages on disposable cell phones to communicate the tips to Franklin and arrange meeting places where Franklin would pay Guttenberg his share of illegal profits in cash. The complaint further alleges that Tavdy illegally traded on this inside information for Andover Brokerage, LLC and Assent LLC, registered broker-dealers where Tavdy was a proprietary trader. According to the complaint, Tavdy also traded on this inside information stolen from UBS in his personal account, the accounts of a relative and friend, and the accounts of Jasper Capital LLC, a day-trading firm with which Tavdy was associated., The Commission further alleges that Franklin and Tavdy also had downstream tippees who traded on the UBS tips. Franklin tipped Mark E. Lenowitz, who illegally traded on this inside information for DSJ International Resources Ltd.

Srebnik, and Ken Okada) also illegally traded on this inside information in their personal accounts and, in the case of Babcock, for the Lyford Cay hedge fund. Additionally, the complaint alleges, David A. Glass, the owner of Jasper Capital, a day-trading firm that operated from the New York City offices of Assent, also traded on Tavdys UBS tips for Jasper Capital. According to the complaint, Glass and Tavdy paid kickbacks to supervisory personnel at Assent to not disclose this trading scheme. Collectively, the complaint alleges, Guttenberg, Franklin, Tavdy, and their tippees made at least $14 million in illegal profits from the UBS Scheme., The complaint alleges that, in the Morgan Stanley Scheme, several of the participants in the UBS Scheme, and others, traded ahead of corporate acquisition announcements using inside information stolen by an in-house lawyer at Morgan Stanley. In this scheme, according to the complaint, Randi Collotta, an attorney who worked in the global compliance department of Morgan Stanley, together with her husband, Christopher Collotta, an attorney in private practice, tipped material, nonpublic information concerning upcoming corporate acquisitions involving Morgan Stanleys investment banking clients, to Marc Jurman, a registered representative in Florida, in exchange for sharing in Jurmans illicit profits from trading on this information.

In the complaint filed against Spadoni and ten other defendants, the Commission had alleged that Paul J.

In addition to freezing approximately $5.4 million in assets, the Courts order (i) requires that the Unknown Purchasers identify themselves, (ii) provides for expedited discovery, and (iii) prohibits the defendants from destroying evidence., The Commissions complaint alleges that highly profitable and suspicious purchases of call option contracts for the common stock of TXU Corp. were placed by the Unknown Purchasers through overseas accounts in late February 2007. These purchases were made in advance of a public announcement (the Announcement) on February 26, 2007, that TXU had executed a merger agreement with private equity groups headed by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., Texas Pacific Group and Goldman Sachs &amp; Co.

As the complaint alleges, the call option contracts were out of the money and most were set to expire in March, within weeks of the purchase date.

In its complaint, the Commission alleged that in 2002, Martin authorized and directed an Indonesian consulting firm (Consulting Firm) to pay a bribe of $50,000 to a senior Indonesian Ministry of Environment official (the Senior Environment Official).  The complaint alleged that the illegal payment was made to influence the Senior Environment Official to repeal language in a decree that was unfavorable to Monsantos business in Indonesia., The complaint further alleged that to generate the funds to make the illegal $50,000 payment and to conceal the unlawful activity, Martin directed the Consulting Firm to create a set of invoices to falsely bill Monsanto in an amount sufficient to cover the illegal payment.  Martin subsequently approved the false invoices for payment by Monsanto, and took steps to ensure that Monsanto paid the false invoices, thereby causing Monsantos books and records to be falsified and circumventing Monsantos system of internal accounting controls.  Even though Martins scheme was carried out pursuant to his instructions and the $50,000 payment was made to the Senior Environment Official, the unfavorable decree remained in place., Without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, Martin consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating and/or aiding and abetting violations of the anti-bribery, books and records, and internal control provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1).

The Commissions request for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze was granted by the Honorable Ricardo M. Urbina, who froze $3 million pending a preliminary hearing., The Commissions complaint alleges a complex scheme that combines electronic intrusions into online brokerage accounts with a traditional market manipulation. From at least December 2005 through December 2006, one or more foreign-based unknown traders purchased, through four sub-accounts of an omnibus trading account titled in the name of Relief Defendant JSC Parex Bank and held at Pinnacle Capital Markets LLC of North Carolina, shares in 15 U.S.-based Nasdaq-traded companies.  These unknown traders then hacked into unsuspecting investors online brokerage accounts at seven major online broker-dealers and sold off investors existing securities holdings.  They then used the proceeds to buy shares on the open market of the thinly-traded issuers the unknown traders had previously purchased in their own sub-accounts.  This illicit account activity artificially heightened the share price and trading volume for each of the thinly-traded issues and enabled the unknown traders to sell their holdings at a substantial profit, realizing at least $732,941 in ill-gotten gains, and possibly more.  The unknown traders also used electronic means to hide their identities and mask the means by which they intruded into accounts., The Commissions complaint further alleges that the unknown traders violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and seeks permanent injunctions against future violations by the unknown traders and disgorgement of all the unknown traders ill-gotten gains, including prejudgment interest and civil penalties.

Shah (Shah) alleging that Shah, the Vice President of Quality Control, Quality Assurance and Regulatory Affairs of former drug maker Able Laboratories, Inc. (Able), engaged in unlawful insider trading by selling shares of Ables common stock during a 16-month period in which he possessed material, non-public information about Ables faulty quality control testing practices. Before halting operations in May 2005 due to such testing improprieties, Able developed, manufactured and sold at least 40 generic drugs including numerous antibiotic, analgesic and antipsychotic medications., The Commissions complaint alleges that on eight separate occasions from August 2003 through December 2004, Shah acquired an aggregate of 58,000 shares of Ables common stock by exercising employee stock options, and in each case sold the securities either immediately thereafter or within a few days. According to the complaint, at the time he engaged in these transactions, Shah was aware that Able was concealing from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) problems with the quality control testing of Able products that resulted in the public release of drugs failing to meet established quality control standards. Shah reaped $909,000 in ill-gotten gains as a result of his unlawful trading. In May 2005, Ables common stock price fell more than $18 per share, or 75%, in one trading day, after Able discovered faulty testing practices of the type Shah had known about, and the company suspended all product shipments. Ables stock price continued to fall in the ensuing months, and the company eventually declared bankruptcy in July 2005, selling substantially all of its assets five months later., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Shah consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and prohibiting him from serving as an officer or director of any publicly traded company for a period of five years. Shah also agreed to pay disgorgement of his ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest thereon and a civil penalty, in amounts to be determined by the court., Also on March 8, 2007, in a related criminal action filed by the United States Attorneys Office for the District of New Jersey, Shah pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and to distribute misbranded and adulterated drugs. Three former supervisory chemists under Shah, Jose Concepcion, Ashish Macwan and Jyotin Parikh, also pleaded guilty to separate criminal informations charging each with one count of conspiracy to distribute misbranded and adulterated drug products. Shah and the three chemists each face a maximum of five years in federal prison and a $250,000 fine.

(ABC), and its former President, Keith LaMonda and his brother, Jesse LaMonda, for their roles in the fraudulent and unregistered offer and sale of fractionalized interests in life insurance policies, known as life settlements. With the consent of the parties, Judge Solis entered an order granting a preliminary injunction, an asset freeze, the appointment of a receiver, and other relief., In its complaint, the SEC alleges that from at least June 2001 through November 2006, ABC raised at least $100 million from over 4,000 investors worldwide from the sale of life settlements with guaranteed returns from 27% to 150%. ABC claimed that investor funds were controlled by an independent escrow agent, that funds sufficient to pay premiums for the life expectancy of the insured were segregated in a separate escrow account, and that financial guarantee bonds purchased by ABC would fix the date and amount of the investors return. The complaint, however, alleges that the LaMondas exercised de facto control over all funds held by its escrow agents, never fully funded the escrow accounts to pay premiums on the policies, siphoned millions of dollars of investor funds into their own pockets or entities they controlled, and used a bonding company that they knew would not perform when bonds came due. The complaint further alleges that the LaMondas never disclosed to investors that in July 2005 they were indicted for their role in the fraudulent sale of viatical and life settlement investments through Accelerated Benefits Corp. (Accelerated Benefits), or the fact that they and Accelerated Benefits were the subject of at least seven state regulatory actions based on their sales of viatical and life settlement investments., The complaint charges ABC and the LaMondas with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court granted, among other relief, a preliminary injunction order that included an asset freeze and the appointment of a receiver over ABC and the LaMondas. In its enforcement action, the SEC is seeking additional relief, including permanent injunctions, disgorgement, and civil penalties against ABC and the LaMondas., On March 7, 2007, the jury in the LaMondas criminal trial convicted Keith and Jesse LaMonda on all counts charged, including mail and wire fraud, for their role in selling viatical and life settlements through Accelerated Benefits.

Prior to intruding into these accounts, the Defendants acquired positions in the securities of at least thirteen issuers and options on shares of another issuer. Then, without the account holders knowledge, and using the victims own accounts and funds, the Defendants placed scores of unauthorized buy orders at above-market prices.

These final judgments conclude the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commissions action, except for a final distribution by the court-appointed receiver., The Commission filed its original complaint in May 2001, alleging fraud in connection with Friedlanders management of the assets of Friedlander International Limited, an overseas hedge fund. The Commission alleged that Friedlander inflated the hedge funds net asset value by improperly and arbitrarily valuing certain unlisted securities of a company in which Friedlander and entities he controlled had heavily invested. The Commissions complaint also alleged that Friedlander engaged in portfolio pumping by purchasing a thinly-traded common stock as part of a manipulative scheme to inflate the value of that stock and to inflate the hedge funds net asset value., The Commissions amended complaint, filed in October 2003, additionally alleged that, in connection with a separate pooled investment fund he managed, Friedlander converted investors proceeds to his own benefit. The amended complaint alleged that Friedlander provided pooled fund investors with false asset reports, portions of which were on the letterhead of an independent audit firm. However, the audit firm did not prepare or assist in preparing those asset reports. The audit firm also did not authorize the use of its letterhead, nor did it sign or approve any of these asset reports., The Commissions case was stayed pending the resolution of a criminal indictment, <i>U.S. v.

The charges stemmed from McNaughtons role in a Ponzi scheme in which he fraudulently raised at least $17 million from approximately 200 investors and which was the subject of a prior Commission action., In the criminal case, filed by the United States Attorneys Office for the Northern District of Ohio, the indictment charged that McNaughton raised at least $17 million from approximately 200 investors through the sale of unregistered securities in the form of notes under the name of The Haven Equity Company.

According to the indictment, McNaughton also told investors that he would send their money to a trader and friend in Ontario, Canada, who would use a trading strategy to generate the guaranteed returns.

Gerbasio (Gerbasio), a former securities registered representative with a registered broker-dealer based in Philadelphia, were criminally charged in connection with a scheme to defraud mutual funds and their shareholders of approximately $2.4 million. In an Information filed on March 20, 2007, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (the U.S. Attorney) charged that Beacon Rock and Gerbasio engaged in a scheme to evade and circumvent controls implemented by mutual funds seeking to restrict market timing, or a mutual fund trading strategy generally involving short-term purchases and sales of mutual fund shares. This is the first U.S. criminal case against a hedge fund for deceptive market timing., According to the Information, from December 1999 through November 2003, Gerbasio, while associated with two brokers registered with the Commission, provided brokerage services to Beacon Rock. The Information charges that the primary purpose of this relationship was to permit Beacon Rock, whose primary trading strategies involved market timing, to evade and circumvent controls implemented by mutual funds seeking to restrict market timing or other excessive trading. In particular, the Information alleges that Beacon Rock and Gerbasio were aware that market timing was unwanted and potentially harmful to mutual fund shareholders, and that the mutual funds would not permit such trades. Nevertheless, Gerbasio and others at his direction, engaged in a number of deceptive and fraudulent practices designed to conceal the identity of Beacon Rock and the nature of its trading activity. The Information charges that Beacon Rock made in excess of 26,000 market timing trades, resulting in approximately $2.4 million in net trading profits; and that Gerbasio earned approximately $215,000 in compensation as a direct result of the illegal trading., The U.S. Attorney charged Beacon Rock and Gerbasio with securities fraud in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) [15 U.S.C. §78j(b)], and Rule 10b-5 thereunder [17 C.F.R. 240.10b-5]., In the civil injunctive action filed by the Commission on April 21, 2005 against Gerbasio and another defendant, the Commission alleged that from at least August 2002 until October 2003, Gerbasio defrauded hundreds of mutual funds and their shareholders by engaging in deceptive market timing practices for two hedge fund customers, with the result that thousands of market timing trades were placed that would otherwise have been rejected by the fund companies. The civil complaint alleged that Gerbasio employed a variety of deceptions on behalf of the hedge fund customers, including misrepresenting the nature of their trades to the funds, opening dozens of accounts under different names to conceal the customers identities from the funds, entering trades in amounts designed to avoid the funds detection triggers, trading in funds less likely to detect the market timing, and advising the customers on strategies to conceal their market timing from funds that objected to and/or prohibited this trading., On March 30, 2006, the federal district court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania entered a Final Judgment by consent in the civil action, permanently enjoining Gerbasio from violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §78j(b)] and Rule 10b-5 thereunder [17 C.F.R. 240.10b-5], and ordering Gerbasio to pay disgorgement together with prejudgment interest in the amount of $540,044, but waiving payment of all but $100,000. The Court did not impose a civil penalty, based on Gerbasios sworn financial statements submitted to the Commission., On April 10, 2006, the Commission issued an Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions barring Gerbasio from association with any broker or dealer.

The Court found that UTA-BVI violated Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers Act), 15 U.S.C. § 80b-6(1) and 80b-6(2), and that Eldridge, who served as a director and trustee of UTA-BVI, aided and abetted UTA-BVIs violations.

Moreover, the Court found that UTA-BVI was in the business of providing investment advice to FNE and P.K.T, did so for an extended period of time and was to be compensated for its services rendered, as evidenced by Trust Management Agreements UTA-BVI entered into with FNE and P.K.T., The Court found that UTA-BVI, through Eldridge, violated the Advisers Act by making transfers of funds entrusted to it by FNE and P.K.T. for the benefit of Eldridge and the Relief Defendants. The Court found that funds were used for a variety of purposes not in the best interest of FNE and P.K.T., including for transfers to Eldridge and the Relief Defendants and for credit card payments, hotels, restaurants, retail purchases, rent and other payments and transfers. The Court found that Eldridge aided and abetted UTA-BVIs violations by directing these transfers from UTA-BVIs brokerage accounts., In granting the Commissions motion for summary judgment, the Court ruled that UTA-BVI should be permanently enjoined from future violations of the Advisers Act and that Eldridge should be permanently enjoined from aiding and abetting future violations of the Advisers Act.

Marbley of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio granted summary judgment based on facts primarily established in an earlier criminal prosecution in favor of the Commission and against Defendants Roger D. Blackwell, Kelly Hughes, Kevin Stacy and Roger D. Blackwell in his capacity as trustee of the Roger Blackwell and Associates Pension Plan Trust (Pension Plan). The Court held Blackwell, Hughes, Stacy and the Pension Plan liable for illegal insider trading in the stock of Worthington Foods, Inc. in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The Court also granted summary judgment in favor of the Commission and against Blackwell for his violation of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 16a-2, 16a-3 and 16a-8 thereunder for his failure to report changes in his beneficial ownership of Worthington stock, purchased through the Pension Plan. Finally, the Court also ruled that the Commissions claim that Blackwell violated Section 16(a) and Rule 16a-2, 16a-3, and 16a-8 with respect to Black-Jack Enterprises was inappropriate for summary judgment and remained for trial., Furthermore, the Court ruled that Blackwell, Hughes and Stacy should be permanently enjoined from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and ordered the following amounts of disgorgement against the defendants: (1) Blackwell, Hughes and Stacy were held jointly and severally liable for $104,954.72 in disgorgement and $51,363.49 in prejudgment interest; and (2) Blackwell and the Pension Plan were held jointly and severally liable for $57,023.29 in disgorgement and $27,906.47 in prejudgment interest. The Court also permanently enjoined Blackwell from committing future violations of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act., In granting this relief, the Court found that the degree of scienter in this case is nothing if not compelling. Blackwell worked assiduously to inform multiple persons and organizations of the impending Worthington merger. Hughes and Stacy risked their entire savings to invest in one single stock, illustrating that they had inside information on which to base this decision., In its Complaint, the Commission alleged that during August and September 1999, Blackwell illegally disclosed inside information he obtained while serving as a director of Worthington about Kelloggs proposed acquisition of Worthington to: (1) his father Dale Blackwell, (2) son Christian Blackwell, (3) his office assistant and close friend Kelley Hughes and her husband Kevin Stacy, (4) his close business associate attorney Arnold Jack, (3) Black-Jack Enterprises, Roger Blackwells 50/50 investment partnership with Jack, and (6) the Roger Blackwell and Associates Pension Plan Trust, Roger Blackwells marketing companys pension plan (the Blackwell Group). In total, the Blackwell Group made approximately $245,000 in ill-gotten profits by illegally trading on the inside information. (See Litigation Release No. 17944, January 21, 2003)., Blackwell, Hughes and Stacy were previously convicted for insider trading based on the same illegal transactions recounted in the above referenced Complaint.

Stockman (Stockman), who served as C&amp;As former Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors, and eight other former C&amp;A directors and officers., The SECs complaint alleges that between 2001 and 2005, Stockman personally directed fraudulent schemes to inflate C&amp;As reported income by accounting improperly for supplier payments.  In furtherance of those schemes, the complaint alleges that Stockman and other defendants obtained false documents from suppliers designed to mislead C&amp;As external auditors.  According to the complaint, when aspects of the schemes were discovered in March 2005, Stockman embarked on a public campaign to mislead investors, potential financiers and others by minimizing the extent of the fraudulent accounting and hiding C&amp;As dire financial condition.  During the time Stockman was engaged in this fraudulent conduct, he was collecting millions of dollars of the management fees C&amp;A paid Stockmans private equity fund, Heartland Industrial Partners.  The other former officers, including the Chief Financial Officer, Corporate Controller, and Treasurer, and a former member of C&amp;As Board of Directors, are alleged to have participated in the accounting schemes or the campaign to mislead investors.  The SEC and C&amp;A have agreed to settle the charges against the company., In addition to Stockman, the other former C&amp;A directors and officers charged in the complaint are:, The Commissions complaint alleges that between late 2001 and early 2005, the defendants engaged in multiple fraudulent schemes and made materially false and misleading statements concerning C&amp;As financial condition and operating results in, among other things, filings with the Commission, offering documents, and press releases.  The allegations include the following., C&amp;A simultaneously settled the charges, without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, by consenting to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13 thereunder.

Olesnyckyj has not yet been sentenced in the criminal action., On February 15, 2007, the Commission filed its action against Olesnyckyj. The complaint alleged that, from 1997 through 2003, Olesnyckyj backdated stock options grants to coincide with the dates of low closing prices for the Companys common stock, resulting in grants of in-the-money options to numerous individuals. When making grants of options, certain officers and employees at Monster would select a low closing stock price at which they wanted to grant stock options. Olesnyckyj, or others acting at his direction, then prepared backdated documentation for Monsters Compensation Committee containing the grant date that reflected the low closing price for Monsters common stock. Olesnyckyj then caused Monster to misrepresent in its periodic filings and proxy statements that all stock options were granted at the fair market value of the stock on the date of the award, when that was simply not the case. In fact, by backdating the options, Monster granted undisclosed compensation to its employees, failed to recognize compensation expenses, and overstated its net income by $340 million from 1997 through 2005. Olesnyckyj personally profited by receiving backdated options. The complaint further alleged that Olesnyckyj misled Monsters outside auditors in an attempt to hide the backdating scheme by providing documentation to them that misrepresented the grant date of the stock option awards.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20056.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Mintz, a former Enron Vice President and General Counsel of Enrons Global Finance group (EGF) and Rex R. Rogers, a former Enron Vice President and Associate General Counsel, in connection with a fraudulent scheme to make material misrepresentations in, and to omit material disclosures from, Enrons public filings. The Commissions complaint charges Mintz and Rogers with violating the antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws, and aiding and abetting Enrons violations of the antifraud and periodic reporting provisions. In addition, the complaint charges Mintz with violating the books and records and lying to auditors provisions, and Rogers with aiding and abetting violations of the insider stock sale reporting provision by Enrons then Chairman, Kenneth Lay. Mintz, as General Counsel of EGF, was responsible for managing the related party disclosures in Enrons 2000 Proxy Statement (incorporated in its 2000 Form 10-K) and second quarter 2001 Form 10-Q, and closing a fraudulent related party transaction while knowingly or recklessly disregarding that the transaction was in fulfillment of a secret oral side agreement. Rogers, as Enrons top securities lawyer, was responsible for the timing and content of all Enrons SEC filings, including Enrons 2000 Proxy Statement, second quarter 2001 Form 10-Q and relevant 2001 Form 4 filings., The Commissions complaint alleges the following: In 1999, Enron sold an interest in a troubled power project in Cuiaba, Brazil to a related party called LJM1, a partnership controlled by Enrons then Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Fastow, to deconsolidate the project (to take the asset off of its balance sheet) and recognize related earnings. (Fastow also controlled a second related party, a partnership called LJM2.) In conformity with relevant accounting rules, deconsolidation and earnings recognition were not appropriate because the seller (Enron) did not transfer to the buyer (LJM1) the usual risks and rewards of ownership, in that the sale included an oral side agreement that LJM1 would not lose money. The oral side agreement was neither memorialized in the deal documents nor disclosed to Enrons auditor. In 2001, Enron bought back LJM1s Cuiaba interest in satisfaction of the oral side agreement. Under the terms of the buyback, Enron paid LJM1 a profit despite the fact that LJM1s investment had decreased in value. The complaint alleges that Mintz knew, or was reckless in not knowing, of the oral side agreement and knowingly or recklessly directed the documenting and closing of the buyback in fulfillment of the oral side agreement., The complaint further alleges that Mintz knowingly or recklessly failed to disclose Enrons buyback of LJM1s Cuiaba interest as a currently proposed transaction in Enrons 2000 Proxy Statement (filed March 27, 2001), when he knew of, and was responsible for, the execution of the buyback agreement on March 28, 2001, the day after Enrons 2000 Proxy Statement was filed. The complaint also alleges that Mintz and Rogers knowingly or recklessly failed to disclose in Enrons 2000 Proxy Statement the monetary amount of Fastows earnings from LJM1 and LJM2 (more than $18 million), including management fees and distributions, resulting from Enron-LJM transactions. According to the complaint, Mintz and Rogers further knowingly or recklessly made a materially false and/or misleading statement in Enrons second quarter 2001 Form 10-Q (filed August 14, 2001) when stating in that filing that Fastow sold his interests in the LJM partnerships and those partnerships were no longer related parties to Enron. Mintz and Rogers knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that this statement was materially false and/or misleading because (a) the Cuiaba repurchase was pending (it closed on August 15, 2001, the day after the Form 10-Q was filed), (b) the Cuiaba repurchase was negotiated and agreed to while Fastow controlled LJM1, and (c) Enron continued to provide the LJM partnerships with the use of Enron employees, facilities and equipment during the third and fourth quarters of 2001. The complaint further alleges that Rogers knowingly or recklessly failed to disclose in Enrons 2000 Proxy Statement that during 2000, Lay sold $16 million of Enron stock to Enron to repay Lays Enron line of credit. According to the complaint, Rogers also knowingly or recklessly authorized Lay and others to fail to disclose in Lays 2001 monthly SEC Form 4 filings that during 2001, Lay sold an additional $70 million of Enron stock to Enron to repay his Enron line of credit., The complaint also alleges that Mintz directly or indirectly made, or caused to be made, materially false and/or misleading representations to Enrons auditor concerning Enrons second quarter 2001 Form 10-Q. The complaint alleges that Mintz reviewed and approved misrepresentations to be made to Enrons auditor so the auditor would sign off on the statement in the Form 10-Q that Fastow sold his interests in the LJM partnerships and those partnerships were no longer related parties to Enron. The specific misrepresentations were that there were no unfulfilled obligations, commitments, contingencies or special arrangements between Enron and the LJM entities related to the sale of Fastows LJM interests, and there were no pending transactions between the LJM entities and Enron for which the terms were negotiated and agreed to prior to the effective date of the sale of Fastows LJM interests. Mintz knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that these representations were materially false and/or misleading because, among other reasons, Mintz knew (a) from documenting and closing the Cuiaba buyback, that the Cuiaba buyback had been pending since, and its terms were negotiated and agreed to, in March 2001, and (b) the LJM entities continued to have a commitment or special arrangement with Enron whereby the LJM entities used Enron employees, equipment and facilities to conduct LJM business during the third and fourth quarters of 2001., According to the complaint, by engaging in this conduct, Mintz and Rogers violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5 and 14a-9. In addition, the complaint alleges that Mintz violated Exchange Act Section 13(b)(5) and Exchange Act Rules 13b2-1 and 13b2-2, and aided and abetted Enrons violations of Exchange Act Section 13(b)(2)(A). The complaint further alleges that through their conduct, Mintz and Rogers also aided and abetted violations of Exchange Act Sections 10(b), 13(a) and 14(a) and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13 and 14a-9. According to the complaint, Rogers also aided and abetted Lays violations of Exchange Act Section 16(a) and Exchange Act Rules 16a-2 and 16a-3., The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement with prejudgment interest and civil money penalties from both defendants, as well as orders barring them from serving as an officer or director of a publicly-traded company., The Commissions investigation is continuing., Details concerning the fraudulent Cuiaba transaction, which has been the subject of other civil actions brought by the Commission against other former Enron employees, are at: <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19865.htm>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19865.htm</a> and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18543.htm>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18543.htm</a>, <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2007/comp20058.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20058.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

As a result, from 1999 through 2001, Nicor, with the assistance of senior officers, entered into a series of improper transactions designed to shift inventory off of its books so that Nicor could access a substantial portion of its low-cost LIFO layers of inventory.  These transactions allowed Nicor to ensure that it met its earnings targets.  By entering into these transactions, Nicor inflated its reported income for 2000 and 2001, and for each of the quarters within those years (Reports) and the financial statements filed with those Reports., Additionally, Nicor failed to disclose, in either its Managements Discussion &amp; Analysis section of its Reports, or in its financial statements filed with those Reports, that it had recorded material credits to income resulting from LIFO liquidations., Without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, Nicor has consented to a permanent injunction from violating the antifraud and reporting provisions of the federal securities laws.

Through cold calls, seminars, sales agents and newspaper advertisements, First United raised over $1.38 million. In connection with the offer and sale of securities, Hall made misrepresentations and omissions of material fact to investors concerning, among other things, the use of investor funds, expected returns, and the investment risks. He also made misrepresentations that the funds raised would be invested in real estate in Washington, DC to assist lower and moderate income residents in a friendly real estate development system to assist residents who might be displaced by the market pressures of gentrification. In fact, investors funds were not invested in real estate projects in Washington, DC or elsewhere. , The final judgment, to which Hall consented, permanently enjoins Hall from violations of the registration provisions of the federal securities laws contained in Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), and from violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. In addition, the final judgment includes a conduct-based injunction that permanently enjoins Hall from participating in unregistered offers or sales of securities. Based on the criminal action described below, the Commission did not require Hall to pay disgorgement or penalties as part of the settlement. The Courts order concludes this litigation. , In a parallel criminal proceeding, <i>United States v. Robert L. Hall, Jr.</i>, No. 1:05-cr-00030-HHK (D.D.C), Hall was on March 3, 2006, convicted on 18 criminal counts related to the conduct alleged in the Commissions complaint. On December 7, 2006, Hall was sentenced to serve incarceration of 188 months, three years of supervised release, and to pay $713,924 in restitution. , For additional information, see Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18886.htm>18886</a> (September 15, 2004) and Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19860.htm>19860</a> (October 6, 2006).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20061.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The Court issued the order following the Commissions filing of an Amended Complaint, which added the Sehgals to the insider trading case that was previously filed on March 2, 2007, against certain Unknown Purchasers of TXU call options., The Amended Complaint alleges that the Sehgals made highly profitable and suspicious purchases of 700 call option contracts for the common stock of TXU Corp. through accounts at Charles Schwab &amp; Co., Inc., and Clark Dodge &amp; Co, Inc., in January and February 2007. These purchases were made in advance of a public announcement (the Announcement) on February 26, 2007, that TXU had executed a merger agreement with private equity groups headed by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., Texas Pacific Group and Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. The Amended Complaint further alleges that as a result of the Announcement, TXUs common stock jumped more than 13% over its previous trading day closing price, placing the defendants in a position to gain substantial profits. Most of the call option contracts were out of the money and were set to expire in March and April. The Amended Complaint further alleges that, as a result of the increase in price of TXU stock following the Announcement, the illicit profits on the Sehgals option contracts total approximately $270,000., The Commission alleges that the Sehgals engaged in insider trading in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The Commission is seeking permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest thereon, and civil monetary penalties., The Commissions complaint against the Unknown Purchaser alleges that between February 21 and February 23 - prior to the public disclosure of the merger agreement - while in possession of material, nonpublic information regarding the acquisition offer, the Unknown Purchasers, using overseas accounts, purchased over 8,020 call option contracts for TXU stock. The unrealized illicit profits on these option contracts total approximately $5.4 million. On March 28, 2007, the District Court also approved an extension of the asset freeze as to the Unknown Purchasers who purchased TXU securities through Credit Suisse in Zurich and Fimat Banque Frankfurt Zweigniederlassung.

Kenney, Jr. in the federal civil enforcement action filed by the Commission in September 2005.  Kenney was the former Chief Executive Officer and a former Director of WRC Media, Inc. (WRC), a provider of educational materials for the kindergarten through high school market., The Judgment permanently enjoins Kenney from aiding and abetting violations of Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 12b-20, 15d-1, 15d-11, and 15d-13 promulgated thereunder.  The Judgment also requires Kenney to pay a $60,000 civil penalty.  Kenney consented to the Judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions amended complaint., The Commissions amended complaint alleged that Kenney aided and abetted WRCs improper recognition of $1.2 million in revenue from a purported sale of educational software to the Monroe City, Louisiana School District (Monroe transaction).  Specifically, the amended complaint alleged that, in December 2002, Kenney and a sales team returned to Louisiana to obtain a replacement contract from the district superintendent after learning that a previous version of the contract could not be used to recognize revenue in 2002.  While the replacement contract did not mention any requirement of Monroe City School Board approval, school board approval was still required.  Because the replacement contract was contingent upon school board approval, the Commission alleged that the Monroe transaction did not meet the criteria under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for revenue recognition.  As a result, WRC filed financial reports with the Commission that materially misstated WRCs fourth quarter 2002 results.  Kenney was substantially involved in the negotiation of the Monroe transaction and therefore aided and abetted WRC in violating Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 15d-1, 15d-11, and 15d-13., For additional information concerning this matter, see <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr19373.htm>Litigation Release No. LR-19373</a> (September 13, 2005)., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2007/comp20064.pdf>SEC Amended Complaint in this matter</a>,  ]"

The Court also entered a Final Judgment against Edgar Mojica (Mojica) in connection with his receipt of ill-gotten gains from the defendants during the fraudulent scheme., In its Second Amended Complaint, the Commission alleged that from February 1998 through April 2001, the defendants and others raised approximately $75 million through the offer and sale of investments in a series of purported European bank trading programs. The defendants programs exhibited many of the characteristics of the fraudulent prime bank schemes that the Commission, the Federal Reserve Board and other regulators have warned do not exist. The defendants told investors that the programs involved the trading of bank instruments issued by foreign banks; they promised investors returns ranging as high as 200 percent per month; they assured investors that the investments were risk free; and they warned investors that participation in the trading programs required total secrecy and confidentiality. In reality, the defendants dissipated much of the investors funds to pay personal and business expenses, purported returns to earlier investors, payments to the relief defendants, and undisclosed salaries and fees for themselves., The Court entered Final Judgments against Thorn, McKinney, Malizia, RMAZ and Morgan permanently enjoining them from future violations of the antifraud and broker-dealer registration provisions of the securities laws and ordering the following amounts of disgorgement, pre-judgment interest and civil penalties against the defendants: 1) defendant Thorn was ordered to disgorge $5,070,395 of ill-gotten gains plus $1,802,132 of pre-judgment interest and to pay a $1 million civil penalty; 2) defendant McKinney was ordered to disgorge $54,200 plus $16,499 of pre-judgment interest and to pay a $250,000 civil penalty in addition to being held jointly and severally liable for $1,434,757 of disgorgement and $294,632 of pre-judgment interest imposed against his company, International Trading Partners, Ltd., pursuant to a previous Court order; and 3) defendants Malizia and RMAZ were ordered to disgorge $375,700 plus $188,166.39 of pre-judgment interest and Malizia was ordered to pay a $375,700 civil penalty.

In addition to incarceration, the Court also ordered Thorn to pay $7.4 million in restitution to victims of the scheme., Thorns sentence was based upon criminal charges arising from the same misconduct that led to the Commissions action filed in April 2001. According to the indictment, from December 1997 through April 2001, Thorn, directly and through other others, raised approximately $75 million from investors through the through the offer and sale of investments in purported European bank trading programs invested in medium-term notes. Thorn and others told investors that there was little or no risk in the investment and promised monthly returns ranging from 3 to 100 percent. They also represented to investors that the Federal Reserve was involved in these trading programs when in reality it was not. Rather than using the funds to make any investment, Thorn instead used investor monies to pay for his extravagant lifestyle which included mortgage payments, luxury car leases, and lavish vacations, and to operate a massive Ponzi scheme in which investors were paid a purported return with money obtained from other investors., On April 2, 2001, the Commission filed a Complaint against Thorn and others and obtained a temporary restraining order and asset freeze against him and his related entities.

Once Tenet finally revealed its scheme to the investing public and admitted that its strategy was not sustainable, the market value of Tenet’s stock plunged by over $11 billion., During the relevant time, Tenet was based in Santa Barbara, Calif., and was the second largest publicly traded healthcare company in the United States.  , To settle the charges, Tenet agreed to pay a civil penalty of $10 million.  The SEC will seek to have these funds placed into a Fair Fund for distribution to harmed investors pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC’s complaint, Tenet also agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b), 13(a), and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder., In addition to Tenet, the SEC’s complaint names Thomas B. Mackey, age 58, of Keswick, Va., Tenet’s former chief operating officer and co-president; Christi R. Sulzbach, age 52, of Santa Barbara, Calif., the former general counsel and chief compliance officer; David L. Dennis, age 58, of Los Angeles, the former chief financial officer and co-president; and Raymond L. Mathiasen, age 63, of Los Angeles, the former chief accounting officer.  Dennis and Mathiasen have agreed to settle the Commission’s charges., The Commission’s complaint alleges that between 1999 and 2002, Tenet engaged in an unsustainable strategy to reach its earnings targets by deliberately exploiting the Medicare reimbursement system.  Tenet’s scheme involved a loophole in the Medicare reimbursement system related to “outlier payments,” which are designed to compensate hospitals for caring for extraordinarily sick Medicare patients.  Tenet’s management realized that Tenet could inflate its revenue from outlier payments by simply increasing the gross charges set by its hospitals.  From 1999 to 2002, Tenet’s outlier revenue more than tripled and Tenet’s earnings goals were surpassed year after year.  Tenet’s outlier growth from fiscal 1999 to fiscal 2002 accounted for over 54% of its cumulative growth in earnings per share from operations.  Similarly, by fiscal 2002, Tenet’s outlier revenue comprised over 40% of its earnings per share., The complaint alleges that Tenet, acting through Dennis, Mathiasen, Mackey, and Sulzbach, misled the investing public by failing to disclose Tenet’s strategy, its impact on revenues and earnings, and its unsustainability in the portion of its public filings with the Commission known as “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” commonly referred to as MD&amp;A., In part as a result of its outlier scheme, Tenet received enough income to set aside funds in improper general reserves.  Tenet, with Mathiasen’s approval, created general reserves totaling approximately $107 million by the end of Tenet’s 2002 fiscal year.  These inappropriate reserves resulted in material misstatements to Tenet’s financial statements for fiscal years 2000 through 2004., Mathiasen and Dennis each agreed to settle the Commission’s charges without admitting or denying the allegations.  Mathiasen agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Sections 10(b), 13(a), and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, and 13b2-1 thereunder, to pay a civil penalty of $240,000, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  A certified public accountant, Mathiasen also agreed to be permanently denied the privilege of appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant under Rule 102(e) of the Commission’s rules of practice., Dennis agreed to be permanently enjoined from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Sections 10(b) and 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder, and to pay a $150,000 civil penalty.  The penalties paid by Mathiasen and Dennis’s penalties personally will also be added to the Fair Fund for investors along with Tenet’s payment. , The settlements by Tenet, Dennis, and Mathiasen are subject to approval by the court.,  The Commission’s complaint charges Mackey and Sulzbach with committing violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and aiding and abetting Tenet’s violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder.  The complaint seeks permanent injunctions against future violations of these provisions, orders barring each of them from serving as an officer or director of a public company, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. , On March 30, 2006, the Commission charged three of Tenet’s outside auditors with improperly changing audit work papers in connection with the audit completed during the period of the defendants’ scheme.

The Commissions complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado, alleged that Bradley and Cole fraudulently caused UCAP to overstate revenue by recording only half of a revenue adjustment necessary to make the companys financial statements comply with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and by overstating the value of its real estate.  Together, these actions enabled UCAP to meet falsely a key financial covenant required to save the companys sole line of credit.  Additionally, the complaint alleged that Bradley and Cole caused UCAP to record fraudulently revenue from a real estate transaction with a related party and fail to record an expense for a settlement agreement between UCAP and a third party.  As a result, UCAPs financial statements for the annual period ended September 30, 2002 understated the companys pre-tax net loss by over $1.8 million, or 26 percent, and were therefore false and misleading., The Commissions complaint further alleged that Bradley certified falsely UCAPs 2002 Form 10-KSB and filed it with the Commission on January 15, 2003.  Moreover, the Commissions complaint alleged that Cole caused UCAPs outside auditing firm to issue an unqualified audit report that was included in UCAPs 2002 Form 10-KSB, which falsely stated that the audit had been performed in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, and that the financial statements were free of material misstatements and were presented in conformity with GAAP., Without admitting or denying the Commissions claims, Bradley consented to the entry of an order permanently enjoining him from future violations of Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 13a-14 and 13b2-1 thereunder, and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 thereunder.  Further, Bradley consented to a bar from acting as an officer or director of any public company.  The Commission did not seek a civil penalty against Bradley based on his demonstrated inability to pay., Additionally, Cole, without admitting or denying the Commissions claims, consented to the entry of an order permanently enjoining him from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder, and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 thereunder.

The Commission charged that Albert E.

The funds have been managed by Parish Economics or by Parish. Four of the funds were described as informal pools of money through which investors could invest in, respectively, commodities and securities futures products (the Futures Pool), bonds (the Hedged Income Pool), stocks (the Stock Pool), and hard assets such as expensive watches, jewelry and fine art (Hard Asset Pool). The fifth fund is defendant Summerville Hard Assets LLC (Summerville). Summerville also purported to invest in various hard assets such as jewelry and collectibles.

The Commission alleges that, since November 2006, Ampudia made at least $140,000 in unlawful profits by manipulating the securities of at least five publicly traded companies., Acting on the Commissions request, the Court issued a temporary restraining order which, among other things, prohibits Ampudia from further violations of the federal securities laws, freezes his assets and orders the repatriation of funds taken out of the United States., The Commissions complaint alleges that Ampudia first purchased shares of small, thinly-traded companies, with low share prices, through his own online trading account. Immediately or soon thereafter, using online brokerage accounts Ampudia had opened in the names of identity theft victims, Ampudia placed a series of large purchase orders for the targeted securities, for the sole purpose of artificially increasing the price of the securities he had just purchased at lower prices. These purchases created buying pressure and the false appearance of legitimate trading activity, which caused the price of the securities to greatly increase. Ampudia then, at a profit, sold the shares he had earlier purchased in his own account., The complaint charges Ampudia with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5.

Hunter (Hunter), of La Grande, Oregon., In the Complaint, the Commission charges that, since at least October 2005, Global, Behrmann and Hunter have conducted an unregistered offering of securities through the provision of interests in Globals Secured Profit Inventory Program (SPIP). The Complaint alleges that Global, Behrmann and Hunter primarily promoted Globals SPIP through the internet and solicited investors to loan Global funds for a term of one-year in exchange for promised daily interest payments. The greater the amount of the purported loan, the greater the interest payments Global offered to investors. Global initially offered daily interest rates to investors of 0.20% per day for amounts up to $100, which it referred to as the Start-Up plan, and for investors willing to invest $10,000 or more, they could participate in Globals Big Dawgs Club and receive 1.00% daily interest. Global further offered investors the ability to lock-up access to their interest payments for one-year in exchange for 100% daily compounding on all interest payments. Global therefore offered investors effective annual rates of return of more than 1,100%. In order to generate revenue sufficient to pay investors their promised returns, Global claimed to pool investor proceeds to purchase discounted and low-cost inventory, which Global then purported to resell through various online auction websites, including Ebay and Yahoo! Auctions, as well as through flea markets, street sales and retail storefronts. From October 2005 through March 2007, the Complaint alleges that Global raised approximately $15 million from more than 8,000 investors., The Commissions Complaint alleges that Global, Behrmann and Hunter violated the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and (c) of the Securities Act of 1933 and seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions, an accounting, a partial asset freeze against Global, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest and civil penalties against Global, Behrmann and Hunter, and the appointment by the Court of an independent corporate monitor to oversee Globals ongoing business operations., Without admitting or denying the allegations of the Complaint, Global, Behrmann and Hunter consented to the Commissions request for preliminary injunctive relief, a partial asset freeze against Global, and the appointment of a corporate monitor to oversee Globals ongoing business operations.

It is alleged that Novus and RCH2 have made offers and sales through: the Internet, referrals from current investors and sales presentations at a Salt Lake City shopping mall. Both Novus and RCH2 allegedly have sold six month promissory notes providing for returns to investors of between 3% and 5% per month., The complaint further alleges that Novus and RCH2 have been telling investors this opportunity is too good NOT to be true. Novus and RCH2 allegedly claim they invest client funds in hard money lending, real estate, S&amp;P 500 options, foreign currency futures and stocks. Novus and RCH2 also allegedly represent to investors that 80% of investor funds are placed in low risk investments such as real estate with only 20% of the funds invested in high risk investments such as currency futures. Investors are also allegedly told the funds are 100% safe because they are pooled in a large interest-bearing account. It is further alleged that Novus and RCH2 have told investors their funds are backed by liquid assets or real estate and sufficient funds are maintained to cover six months worth of interest and principal., The complaint alleges that these representations are false and that, in fact, almost all investor money has been invested in high risk currency futures or S&amp;P 500 futures through US Ventures resulting in trading losses of at least $9 million.

Investors who did not have the necessary funds were allegedly directed to Eric Wheeler, a former employee of the Salt Lake City office of a bank, who assisted the prospective investors in obtaining small business lines of credit from the bank using inflated income or net revenue figures for business entities created for the sole purpose of investing with Novus or RCH2. It is alleged that once the lines of credit were established, Wheeler transferred the entire loan proceeds to Novus or RCH2, which then transferred the funds to US Ventures where the funds were invested in foreign currency futures., The Complaint charged Novus, RCH2, Hall, Thompson and Johnson with violating the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 and the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

During this period, Heron executed more than fifty illegal trades in Amkor stock and options on the basis of material, nonpublic information that Heron had learned as a result of his position as general counsel.

According to the complaint, the defendants falsely claimed to have an experienced management team and a highly-qualified staff of scientists and engineers; to have developed a new energy source that which will replace oil, gas, coal and other sources of energy within 15 years, among other breakthrough products; and to have extremely lucrative licensing and development opportunities. Defendants claims were patently false because Aquacell has no management team or employees other than Naste, and no patents, licenses, contracts or products. Additionally, the complaint alleges that the defendants have failed to disclose to investors that the state of Pennsylvania issued cease-and-desist orders and a bar against them for state securities violations. Moreover, contrary to defendants assurances that they would use investor funds to expand Aquacells research and development facility and bring Aquacells products to market, the complaint alleges that Naste has misappropriated millions of dollars in investors funds to bankroll his lavish lifestyle, and has funneled hundreds of thousands of dollars to his family and to accounts he controls. , The Commissions complaint alleges that Aquacell and Naste violated Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The Preliminary Injunction prohibited Brown and Jamerica from violating certain antifraud and recordkeeping violations of the federal securities laws., The Commission filed an emergency action on March 29, 2006, against Brown, Jamerica, a Minneapolis, Minnesota-based investment advisor of which Brown serves as the majority owner and President, and Brawta Ventures, LLC (Brawta), the private investment fund formed by Brown and Jamerica. The complaint alleged that Brown and Jamerica raised at least $1.65 million from 53 investors for Brawta. The Commission further alleged that the defendants defrauded the investors of Brawta by misappropriating at least $569,950 of investor funds to pay for Browns personal expenses and Jamericas business expenses, and by misrepresenting the value of Brawta to the investors by failing to disclose or account for the funds that were diverted., In its motion for civil contempt, the Commission submitted evidence that Brown and Jamerica, in violation of the Preliminary Injunction, continued to provide false valuations to the investors of Brawta, which substantially overstated the value of their investment. In support of its motion for civil contempt, the Commission submitted evidence that the true value of Brawta was worth less than half of what Brown and Jamerica claimed it to be. In addition, the Commission contended that Brown and Jamerica have failed to make and keep true, accurate and current records relating to the business of Jamerica, also in contempt of the Preliminary Injunction.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20081.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Scrushy that permanently bars Scrushy from serving as an officer or director of a public company, permanently enjoins Scrushy from committing future violations of the antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws, and requires Scrushy to pay $81 million in disgorgement and civil penalties., The Commissions complaint in this action charges Scrushy with directing a $2.6 billion financial fraud at the HealthSouth Corporation during the years 1996 through 2002.  Scrushy was one of HealthSouths founders, and was chairman of its Board of Directors and its chief executive officer during the relevant period of the fraud., The Complaint alleges that, at Scrushys direction, HealthSouths overstated its revenue by more than $2.6 billion from the second quarter of 1996 through the third quarter of 2002.  This overstatement led directly to quarterly and annual overstatements of net income and retained earnings.  The Commissions complaint charges that, by the end of 2002, HealthSouth was claiming to have over $1.5 billion in accumulated retained earnings, when in fact the Company had operated at a significant loss over its entire corporate history.  The HealthSouth fraud resulted in one of the largest accounting restatements in American corporate history., The Final Judgment orders Scrushy to pay $81,000,000, comprised of $3,500,000 in civil penalties and $77,500,000 in disgorgement, with the disgorgement amount subject to an offset for any amounts paid in judgments or settlements in certain derivative, corporate, and class action lawsuits seeking recovery of the same money as the Commission.  The Final Judgment provides that, upon a motion to the Court, the civil penalties paid by Scrushy may be distributed pursuant to the Fair Fund provisions of Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, in this case by asking the Court to add these sums to the Fair Fund already established as a result of the Companys settlement.  The Final Judgment permanently prohibits Scrushy from acting as an officer or director of a public company, and Scrushy has consented to refrain from seeking modification or removal of this prohibition for at least five years from the entry of the Final Judgment.  The Final Judgment permanently restrains and enjoins Scrushy from violating or aiding and abetting violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, and 13b2-1 promulgated thereunder., Scrushy consented to the entry of the Final Judgment without admitting or denying any of the allegations in the Commissions complaint.

Cal.)</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced the filing of securities fraud charges against the husband of an Amgen vice president for engaging in insider trading in the stock of Abgenix, Inc., a biopharmaceutical company that was acquired by Amgen in April 2006., The Commission’s complaint, filed on April 23 in federal district court in Los Angeles, alleges that Gary K. Melton, age 54, of Newbury Park, Calif., misappropriated confidential information from his wife, Amgen’s vice president of strategic sourcing and procurement, regarding Abgenix when he purchased Abgenix stock days before Amgen’s acquisition of Abgenix was publicly announced.  Melton realized illegal profits of $15,252 from his trades and agreed to pay approximately $31,000 to settle the charges., The Commission’s complaint alleges that in early November 2005, Melton and his wife discussed the publicly announced favorable results of a clinical trial for an antibody jointly developed by Amgen and Abgenix.  At the time, Melton commented to his wife that he might purchase some Abgenix stock, to which his wife said nothing.  Melton’s wife reported directly to Amgen’s chief financial officer and attended meetings where mergers and acquisitions were discussed., A month later, according to the complaint, Melton’s wife learned through her employment at Amgen that a public announcement of Amgen’s acquisition of Abgenix was imminent.  Recalling her earlier conversation with her husband, Melton’s wife instructed him not to purchase Abgenix stock, the complaint alleges.  The complaint further alleges that Melton understood his wife’s unexplained instruction to mean that more favorable news about Abgenix was forthcoming, and that Melton knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that his wife’s instruction not to purchase Abgenix stock was based on material nonpublic information she had acquired through her employment at Amgen and that he could not lawfully use such information for his personal benefit., According to the complaint, despite his wife’s admonition, Melton nevertheless purchased 2,050 shares of Abgenix stock between December 8 and 13, 2005.  After the market closed on December 14, 2005, Amgen and Abgenix issued a joint press release announcing Amgen’s acquisition of Abgenix for $22.50 per share, which represented a 54% premium on the closing price of Abgenix stock that day.  On December 15, 2005, Melton liquidated his Abgenix stock and realized an illegal profit of $15,252.  The complaint alleges that by engaging in such trading, Melton misappropriated material nonpublic information from his wife in breach of his duty of trust and confidence to her., To settle the Commission’s charges, Melton consented, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, to a final judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering him to pay $15,252 in disgorgement of his illegal trading profits, plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty in an amount equal to his trading profits., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/2007/comp20085.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr20085.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Cal. filed April 24, 2007)</h2>, <h2>SEC Charges Former Apple General Counsel for Illegal Stock Option Backdating</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed charges against two former senior executives of Apple, Inc. in a matter involving improper stock option backdating. The Commission accused former General Counsel Nancy R. Heinen of participating in the fraudulent backdating of options granted to Apples top officers that caused the company to underreport its expenses by nearly $40 million. The Commissions complaint alleges that Heinen, of Portola Valley, California, caused Apple to backdate two large options grants to senior executives of Apple — a February 2001 grant of 4.8 million options to Apples Executive Team and a December 2001 grant of 7.5 million options to Apple Chief Executive Officer Steve Jobs — and altered company records to conceal the fraud., The Commission also filed, and simultaneously settled, charges against former Apple Chief Financial Officer Fred D. Anderson, of Atherton, California, alleging that Anderson should have noticed Heinens efforts to backdate the Executive Team grant but failed to take steps to ensure that Apples financial statements were correct. As part of the settlement, Anderson agreed (without admitting or denying the allegations) to pay approximately $3.5 million in disgorgement and penalties., According to the Commissions complaint, filed in the Northern District of California, Apple granted 4.8 million options to six members of its executive team (including Heinen and Anderson) in February 2001. Because the options were in-the-money when granted (i.e. could be exercised to purchase Apple shares at a below market price), Apple was required to report a compensation charge in its publicly-filed financial statements. The Commission alleges that, in order to avoid reporting this expense, Heinen caused Apple to backdate options to January 17, 2001, when Apples share price was substantially lower. Heinen is also alleged to have directed her staff to prepare documents falsely indicating that Apples Board had approved the Executive Team grant on January 17. As a result, Apple failed to record approximately $18.9 million in compensation expenses associated with the option grant. Anderson, who should have realized the implications of Heinens actions, failed to disclose key information to Apples auditors and neglected to ensure that the companys financial statements were accurate. Both Heinen and Anderson personally received millions of dollars in unreported compensation as a result of the backdating., The Commissions complaint also alleges improprieties in connection with a December 2001 grant of 7.5 million options to CEO Steve Jobs. Although the options were in-the-money at that time, Heinen — as with the Executive Team grant — caused Apple to backdate the grant to October 19, 2001, when Apples share price was lower. As a result, the Commission alleges that Heinen caused Apple to improperly fail to record $20.3 million in compensation expense associated with the in-the-money options grant. The Commission further alleges that Heinen then signed fictitious Board minutes stating that the Board had approved the grant to Jobs on October 19 at a Special Meeting of the Board of Directors — a meeting that, in fact, never occurred., Heinen is charged with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b), 13(b)(5), and 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, 13b2-2, and 16a-3 thereunder, and Heinen is charged with aiding and abetting violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, and 14a-9 thereunder. The Commission is seeking injunctive relief, disgorgement, and civil money penalties against Heinen, in addition to an order barring her from serving as an officer or director of a public company., Anderson, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, has agreed to a permanent injunction from further violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 13b2-2 and 16a-3 thereunder, and from aiding and abetting further violations of Section 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, and 14a-9 thereunder.

Pember IV, as a relief defendant., The proposed final judgment would permanently enjoin Pember from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2, and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, 13b2-2, and 14a-9. The proposed final judgment also would bar Pember, pursuant to Section 21(d)(2) of the Exchange Act, from serving as an officer or director of a public company and would order her to provide written notification to the successor corporate entities of Cendant that she unconditionally and irrevocably consents to the immediate cancellation and termination of all her existing options to purchase common stock in those successor entities. Finally, the proposed final judgment would order Pember and Carleton Pember to pay disgorgement in the aggregate amount of $100,000. Pember and Carleton Pember each consented to the entry of the proposed final judgment, without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions amended complaint., From 1989 to 1997, Pember was Controller of CUCs largest division, the Comp-U-Card division. Beginning in June 1997, she became CUCs Controller and continued in that position until the December 1997 merger of CUC and HFS Incorporated. That merger formed Cendant. From the time of the merger until March 1998, she was part of the management of the accounting unit at Cendant Membership Services, the post-merger name for the former CUC business units. The Commissions amended complaint alleged that, while in those positions, Pember played an important role in the CUC/Cendant financial fraud., As part of the settlement, Pember agreed to settle a proposed administrative proceeding against her pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the Commissions Rules of Practice, to be based on the entry of the proposed injunction. Pursuant to her offer, Pember would consent to the issuance of a Commission order permanently suspending her from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant, without admitting or denying the findings set forth therein., Finally, the Commission noted that the Office of the U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey has announced that, on January 29, 2007, in her related criminal prosecution, Pember was sentenced to two years probation and 200 hours of community service. The Office stated that, during her sentencing, the U.S. District Judge noted Pembers cooperation in the government prosecution of the former Chairman and Vice Chairman of Cendant., <i>See also</i> Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr16587.htm>16587</a> (June 14, 2000); Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr16910.htm>16910</a> (Feb. 28, 2001); Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18102.htm>18102</a> (April 24, 2003); Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18711.htm>18711</a> (May 14, 2004).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20089.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The Commissions complaints, each filed in the United States District Court for the District of South Dakota, allege that Merle D. Lewis, NorthWesterns former chief executive officer; Richard R. Hylland, NorthWesterns former chief operating officer; Kipp D. Orme, NorthWesterns former chief financial officer; and Kurt D. Whitesel, NorthWesterns former controller; overstated the performance of NorthWestern and its key telecommunications subsidiary, Expanets, Inc. (Expanets), in 2002 during the same period that NorthWestern completed securities offerings totaling more than $800 million.  The Commissions complaints further allege that, after restating its financial results for the first three quarters of 2002, and disclosing Expanets true financial position and results of operations, NorthWestern declared bankruptcy in 2003., The Commission alleges that, in NorthWesterns quarterly filings, debt and equity offering filings, and other public information, these four defendants were responsible for overstating performance and concealing problems at Expanets and NorthWestern.  The Commission alleges that each defendant knew or was reckless in not knowing about the inaccuracy of NorthWesterns public claims that Expanets new computer system was operational or fully operational.  The Commission further alleges that each defendant knew or was reckless in not knowing that Expanets had failed to take appropriate charges for uncollectible accounts receivable and billing adjustments related to the computer system problems, resulting in the overstatement of NorthWesterns income from continuing operations by 90% in the second quarter of 2002 and 109% in the third quarter of 2002.  The Commission also alleges that each defendant was responsible for NorthWesterns failure to disclose that a material portion of Expanets and NorthWesterns income was derived from the reduction of various accounting reserves and through Expanets receipt of unusual non-compete payments.  Finally, the Commission alleges that each defendant was responsible for NorthWesterns failure to disclose significant intercompany cash advances to its subsidiaries during the first half of 2002, which impacted the companys liquidity position and demonstrated the subsidiaries continuing financial difficulties., The Commissions complaints charge Lewis, Hylland, Orme and Whitesel with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.

Fla., filed May 16, 2002)</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) announced that on April 12, 2007, a federal Grand Jury in the Southern District of Florida indicted Jeanne B. Leclercq and Frederick J. Shapiro on multiple counts of mail fraud, wire fraud, money laundering, and conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud. Leclercq is the former president and chief executive officer, and Shapiro, the former chief financial officer, of Starcash, Inc. (Starcash), a now defunct company that was purportedly in the business of making payday advance loans. The indictments stem from Leclercq and Shapiros role in a scheme in which they and Starcash fraudulently raised more than $8.3 million from investors nationwide. Leclercq and Shapiro were both arrested., According to the indictment, Leclercq and Shapiro, through telephone calls, faxes, e-mails, and in promotional materials, solicited investors to provide money to Starcash. The indictment alleges that the materials explained to investors that their money would be used to allow Starcash to fund current payday advance loans and to purchase additional loans on behalf of investors. The indictment also alleges that investors were led to believe that their investments was secured by accounts receivable checks of the payday loans, and that investor dollars would come into a trust account and be accessed only for funding advances and earning fees. In fact, according to the indictment, the Starcash investments were not secured and only a very small percentage of investor funds were used to fund payday loans. Instead, the indictment charges that the majority of investor funds were used to pay substantial commissions to Starcashs sales agents; to make dividend payments to other investors; and to fund a luxurious lifestyle for Leclercq and Shapiro and their friends and family members. The indictment also charges that Starcashs promotional materials did not disclose that six states and one Canadian province had issued cease and desist order prohibiting Starcash from continuing to raise money in those jurisdictions., On March 16, 2002, the Commission filed an emergency civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida against Starcash, Leclercq, and Shapiro, among others, and obtained a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze and an appointment of a receiver against them. On September 23, 2002, the Commission obtained orders of permanent injunction against Leclercq and Shapiro, pursuant to their consents and without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, based on their violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.

Baker Hughes has agreed to pay more than $23 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest for these violations and to pay a civil penalty of $10 million for violating a 2001 Commission cease-and-desist Order prohibiting violations of the books and records and internal controls provisions of the FCPA. <i>In the Matter of Baker Hughes Incorporated</i>, Admin. Proc. No. 3-10572 (September 12, 2001). In the same complaint, the SEC also charged Roy Fearnley, a former business development manager for Baker Hughes, with violating and aiding and abetting violations of the FCPA. Fearnley has not reached any settlement with the Commission regarding these charges., The SECs complaint alleges that Baker Hughes paid approximately $5.2 million to two agents while knowing that some or all of the money was intended to bribe government officials, specifically officials of State-owned companies, in Kazakhstan. The complaint alleges that one agent was hired in September 2000 on the understanding that Kazakhoil, Kazakhstans national oil company at that time, had demanded that the agent be hired to influence senior level employees of Kazakhoil to approve the award of business to the company. Baker Hughes retained the agent principally at the urging of Fearnley. According to the complaint, Fearnley told his bosses that the agent for Kazakhoil told him that unless the agent was retained, Baker Hughes could say goodbye to this and future business. Baker Hughes engaged the agent and was awarded an oil services contract in the Karachaganak oil field in Kazakhstan that generated more than $219 million in gross revenues from 2001 through 2006. Baker Hughes, the complaint alleges, paid the agent $4.1 million to its bank account in London but received no identifiable services from the agent. The complaint also alleges that in 1998 Baker Hughes retained a second agent in connection with the award of a large chemical contract with KazTransOil, the national oil transportation operator of Kazakhstan. Between 1998 and 1999, Baker Hughes paid over $1 million to the agents Swiss bank account, despite a company employee knowing by December 1998 that the agents representative was a high-ranking executive of KazTransOil., The SECs complaint against Baker Hughes also alleges violations of the books and records and internal controls provisions of the FCPA in Nigeria, Angola, Indonesia, Russia, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. In addition to violating the FCPA, certain of this conduct occurred after September 12, 2001, and consequently violated the Commissions 2001 cease-and-desist Order. Specifically, the complaint alleges that between 1998 and 2005, Baker Hughes made payments in Nigeria, Angola, Indonesia, Russia, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan in circumstances that reflected a failure to implement sufficient internal controls to determine whether the payments were for legitimate services, whether the payments would be shared with government officials, or whether these payments would be accurately recorded in Baker Hughes books and records., For example, the complaint alleges that, Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Baker Hughes has consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act). Baker Hughes also has agreed to disgorge $19,944,778, and to pay prejudgment interest thereon in the amount of $3,133,237.41, and to pay $10,000,000 as a civil penalty for the companys violations of the prior Commission cease-and-desist Order. Under the terms of the final judgment, Baker Hughes will also retain an independent consultant to review the companys FCPA compliance and procedures., The Commission also filed, in the same complaint, a contested action against Roy Fearnley, a former business development manager for Baker Hughes, seeking to permanently enjoin Fearnley from violating Sections 30A and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder, and aiding and abetting Baker Hughes violations of Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and seeking disgorgement, prejudgment interest and civil penalties., The Commission acknowledges Baker Hughes cooperation in the investigation., In a related criminal proceeding, the United States Department of Justice filed criminal FCPA charges against Baker Hughes and its wholly-owned subsidiary Baker Hughes Services International, Inc., with an office in Atyrau, Kazakhstan. Baker Hughes Services International, Inc. entered a guilty plea before the Honorable Gray H. Miller, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Texas, and agreed to plead guilty to one count of violating the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA, one count of aiding and abetting the falsification of the books and records of Baker Hughes, and one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA, and to pay a criminal fine of $11 million. The Department of Justice has also entered into an agreement with Baker Hughes to defer prosecution for two years on charges of violating the anti-bribery and books and records provisions of the FCPA.

Specifically, the Court ordered $2,707,177 in disgorgement of profits from the illegal trading, $18,047 in prejudgment interest, and an $8,121,561 million penalty equal to three times the profits from the illegal trading., The Court found that the Defendants opened a U.S. brokerage account using false information and documents. During a six week period in January and February 2007, Defendants traded just before news releases of at least 12 different U.S. public companies and amassed profits totaling approximately $2.7 million.

Richard D. Power, Edward Federman, and Richard J. Skip Heger</i>, Civil Action No. 06-15343 (RWS) (S.D.N.Y. filed December 21, 2006). The proposed settlement is based on the allegations in the Commissions complaint concerning Federmans involvement in fraudulent accounting practices at Tyco in violation of the federal securities laws., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, Federman consented to the entry of a final judgment that would permanently enjoin him from violating Rule 13b2-1 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), and 13(b)(2)(a) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13. The proposed final judgment would also order Federman to pay disgorgement in the amount of $1,651,064, plus prejudgment interest thereon in the amount of $799,693.10, and a civil penalty in the amount of $200,000. Finally, pursuant to the proposed final judgment, Federman would be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for a period of five years., Edward Federman joined Tyco in 1983 as Assistant Corporate Controller. From February 1998 through April 1999, Federman was the Controller and Vice President of Finance at Tyco. From 1999 until his resignation in January 2001, Federman was the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Tycos Electronics division., The Commissions complaint alleges that Federman and his co-defendants inflated Tycos publicly reported operating income and cash flow through the use of a sham dealer connection fee transaction utilized in Tycos ADT Security Services, Inc. subsidiary from 1997 through 2002. During the period when Federman served as Corporate Controller, Tycos independent accountant raised concerns about the transaction. In response to those concerns, Federman successfully defended and repackaged the sham transaction to better conceal its fraudulent nature. As a result, from Tycos fiscal year ended September 30, 1998, through its fiscal quarter ended December 30, 2002, the dealer connection fee transaction improperly inflated Tycos operating income and cash flow by hundreds of millions of dollars.

The three penny stock issuers named in the complaint were Emerging Holdings, Inc., Massclick, Inc., and China Score, Inc. The complaint also named Lyons Checkshop, Inc., Tyson Su, and Marc Primo Pulisci as relief defendants based on their receipt of proceeds from the fraudulent scheme., The Commissions complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, alleges that, between March and August 2004, the defendants artificially inflated the stock price and trading volume of certain companies whose stock traded on the over-the-counter market. The complaint alleges that defendants Luscko and Neu formed four companies, including defendants Emerging Holdings, Massclick and China Score, as well as another entity that is now defunct, and then recruited friends and business associates to act as company officers. According to the complaint, Luscko and Neu arranged for these companies to transfer millions of shares of stock to their own or their friends brokerage accounts in a series of sham transactions designed to bypass Commission regulations that required the shares to be restricted from being resold into the open market. The complaint also alleges that Luscko and Neu drafted false and misleading spam e-mails that were edited by defendant Medlin. Further, the complaint alleges that Medlin embarked on a weekend spam e-mail campaign, bombarding the investing public with millions of spam e-mails that generated significant investor interest and resulted in rapid increases in the companies stock price and volume. The Commission further alleges that, having pumped up the companies stock prices, Luscko and Neu then, directly or through their friends, dumped their shares into the open market, and the companies stock prices declined rapidly thereafter. As a result of trades made in these four stocks, Luscko, Neu, and Medlin netted $6.5 million., In a related criminal action, the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia filed charges against Luscko and Neu, who both pled guilty to conspiring to commit securities fraud and e-mail fraud. Neu was sentenced to five years imprisonment and three years supervised release. Luscko was sentenced to five years imprisonment and two years supervised release. The criminal authorities have seized more than $3,000,000 from bank accounts associated with Luscko and Neu., The Commissions complaint alleges that Luscko, Neu, Emerging Holdings, Massclick, and China Score violated the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933. The complaint also alleges that Luscko, Neu, and Medlin violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint further alleges that Medlin violated the anti-touting provisions of Section 17(b) of the Securities Act. The Commission seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against each of the individual defendants, as well as a penny stock bar against Luscko, Neu, and Medlin, and injunctions prohibiting Luscko and Neu from conducting unregistered securities offerings.

(Capitol) and one of its owners, Terry M. Phillips (Phillips).  The Commission charged Capitol, a privately-owned, Virginia-based video game distributor, with aiding and abetting video game publisher Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (Take-Two) in Take-Twos violations of the antifraud, reporting and recordkeeping provisions of the federal securities laws during fiscal years 2000 and 2001 through a fraudulent video game parking scheme.  The Commission also charged Phillips with liability as a controlling person for Capitols violations and instituted a settled administrative cease-and-desist order against Phillips, which found that Phillips was a cause of Capitols violations., In its complaint filed today, the Commission alleged that Capitol aided and abetted Take-Twos violations of the antifraud, financial reporting and recordkeeping provisions of the federal securities laws by knowingly providing substantial assistance to Take-Twos fraudulent scheme to inflate reported revenue during its fiscal years 2000 and 2001.  Specifically, the complaint alleges that Take-Two shipped to Capitol hundreds of thousands of video games, typically at the end of reporting periods, and fraudulently recorded those shipments as sales when, in actuality, Capitol only temporarily parked the games for Take-Two and did not intend to sell them.  The complaint alleges that in furtherance of the scheme Take-Two twice provided funds to Capitol or another Phillips-owned entity known as Phillips Land Company (PLC), for transmission to Take Two to create the false appearance that Capitol or PLC were paying for the games.  According to the complaint, Capitol in two instances returned the games to Take-Two under invoices falsely describing them as purchases of assorted product.  The scheme enabled Take-Two to report approximately $15 million in phantom revenue from four separate parking transactions with Capitol., Capitol, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it from violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13 and 13b2-1., The complaint alleges that Phillips, as Capitols founder, 20 percent owner, and principal operator is a control person of Capitol within the meaning of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act.  Phillips, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, consented to entry of a final judgment ordering him to pay a civil money penalty of $50,000 as a control person of Capitol for its aiding and abetting violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 12b 20, 13a-1, 13a-13 and 13b2-1., The settlements with Capitol and Phillips are subject to the approval of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia., In a related administrative proceeding, Phillips consented, without admitting or denying the Commissions findings, to the entry of a Commission order to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1, and from causing any violations and any future violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13.  The Commission in its order found that Phillips and Take-Two began discussing Capitols participation in the parking arrangement in July 2000.  In October 2000, Take-Two discussed the first parking transaction with Phillips, asking Phillips if he had another company that Take Two could issue a purchase order to for the games in lieu of Capitol sending the games back as a return.  Phillips mentioned PLC, then instructed a Capitol employee to work out the details with Take-Two., On June 9, 2005, the Commission filed and simultaneously settled civil charges against Take-Two and former and current members of senior management in connection with the parking scheme.

Colls Donlan (Colls), age 44, both of San Diego, California. The Commissions complaint alleges that Donlan defrauded WFI and its shareholders by abusing his position as WFIs stock options administrator to fraudulently issue and transfer WFIs stock and stock options to an account in his name, in violation of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. The complaint charges Donlan with securities fraud and names Colls as a relief defendant because she received proceeds from the fraud., The Commissions complaint alleges that between November 2002 and November 2003, Donlan abused his position as WFIs stock options administrator to issue and transfer over 700,000 shares of WFI stock and stock options to a brokerage account that he held jointly with his wife, Colls. According to the complaint, Donlan caused these transfers by making false entries in WFIs stock options software to create and then hide the unauthorized stock options grants to Colls and by providing false information to WFIs brokerage firm and transfer agent. Over the thirteen month period of the fraud, Donlan initiated twenty-seven unauthorized transfers of WFI stock and stock options to his and Colls brokerage account., The complaint further alleges that Donlan and/or Colls exercised the options and sold the stock on the open market, realizing net proceeds of at least $7.7 million. All of these proceeds, according to the complaint, were then transferred or paid to other accounts. Some of the proceeds may also have been used to purchase real estate, including a home in San Diego for $942,000 in cash and property in Julian, Calif., for $655,000 in cash., In addition to freezing several million dollars in personal and real property, the courts order requires an accounting of Donlans and Colls assets, provides for expedited discovery, and prohibits them from destroying evidence.

The Commission filed an Amended Complaint against all three defendants on May 1, 2007. The Commissions Amended Complaint alleges that, between June 2006 and April 2007, Manterfield and Andersen, acting through Lydia, engaged in a scheme to defraud more than 60 investors, who invested approximately $34 million in Lydia Capital Alternative Investment Fund LP (Fund), an unregistered hedge fund managed by Lydia., The Amended Complaint alleges that defendants told investors that they intended to use the Funds assets to acquire a portfolio of life insurance polices in the life settlement market. According to the Amended Complaint, while the Fund did acquire interests in some insurance polices, defendants materially misled investors about their operations and misappropriated at least $2 million of investor funds. According to the Amended Complaint, Manterfield, Andersen, and Lydia sold limited partnership interests and retained investors in the Fund through a series of material misrepresentations and omissions, including but not limited to: (1) materially overstating, and in some instances completing fabricating the Funds performance; (2) inventing business partners, offices, and investors in an attempt to legitimatize the firm and concealing the truth as to why key vendors and banks ceased relationships with the Defendants; (3) lying about Manterfields significant criminal history, and failing to disclose a February 2007 criminal asset freeze in England; (4) lying about how the Fund planned to address certain material risks and failing to disclose others; and (5) misstating the nature of the Funds assets and its investment process.

According to the indictment, Russo represented to investors that they could expect above average positive returns and that their investments would be safe, but Russo did not invest his victims money as promised and lost more than $20 million in investor funds. The indictment further alleges that, to conceal the losses and his misrepresentations, and to lull victims into further investments, Russo generated false account statements that reflected inflated balances and gains that did not exist. According to the indictment, more than 250 individuals were victims of Russos scheme.

In a Second Amended Complaint in the insider trading case originally filed on March 2, 2007, against certain Unknown Purchasers of TXU call options, the Commission alleged that, on February 5,6,7,8 and 23, 2007, Naseem, in breach of his duty to Credit Suisse and its client, telephoned the Pakistani banker and conveyed to him non-public, material information concerning the proposed but unannounced leveraged buyout of TXU Corp. by an investor group led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. and Texas Pacific Group., and other information. According to the Second Amended Complaint, the Pakistani banker, on February 23, 2007, purchased 6,700 TXU call option contracts with March 2007 expiration dates through UBS AG London, and these purchases allowed him to reap, following the public announcement of the buyout, trading profits of approximately $5 million., The Second Amended Complaint further alleges that Naseem also made calls from his office phone to the Pakistani bankers home and cell phones and alerted him to pending business combinations and deals involving 9 other issuers: Hydril Company, Trammell Crow Co., John Harland Co., Energy Partners Ltd., Veritas DGC Inc., Jacuzzi Brands, Caremark Rx, Inc., and Northwestern Corporation. According to the Second Amended Complaint, Credit Suisse served as an investment banker or financial advisor in all of the involved deals, and the phone calls to the Pakistani banker were made close in advance of — and frequently the day of or the day before — announcements of the proposed deals.

Finally, according to the Second Amended Complaint, Naseem, in order to insure he would obtain a personal, financial benefit from his misappropriations, in May 2006 opened up a brokerage account in Pakistan and granted trading authority over that account to the Pakistani banker, i.e., to his tippee., The Commission alleges that, as a result of these activities, Naseem engaged in insider trading in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The defendants allegedly solicited investors by, among other things, telling them that their funds would be pooled to purchase Prime Bank instruments that would be traded by top-rated banks and promising returns as high as 20% per month.

Penthouse, Samel and Galanis, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, consented to the entry of these final judgments., The Securities and Exchange Commission filed its action against Penthouse, Samel and Galanis on January 24, 2005. The Commissions complaint alleged that Penthouse, Samel and Galanis engaged in accounting fraud and financial reporting violations at Penthouse in connection with the companys Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2003. According to the complaint, Penthouse improperly included as revenue on the financial statements for that quarter $1 million received as an up-front payment in connection with a five-year website management agreement. The inclusion of the $1 million payment under the agreement increased Penthouses reported revenue by approximately 9%, from $11,072,000 to $12,072,000 and changed a quarterly net loss of $167,000 to a purported net profit of $828,000. The Complaint alleged that Penthouses Form 10-Q was materially misleading in several other respects. For example, the Commission alleged that it bore an unauthorized electronic signature of Robert C. Guccione, Penthouses principal executive officer and principal financial officer, and thus represented that Guccione had reviewed and signed it, and the accompanying Sarbanes-Oxley certification. According to the complaint, this representation was false, as Guccione had not seen or approved the filing of the Form 10-Q or the Sarbanes-Oxley certification. Further, according to the complaint, Penthouses auditors and outside counsel also had not reviewed the filing, a fact that also was not disclosed in the filing., The Comissions complaint alleged that Samel and Galanis prepared and filed the false Form 10-Q, and they did so knowing or recklessly disregarding that Guccione had not seen or approved it, that Penthouses auditor had not performed its required review of the Form 10-Q, and that it would be improper to include the $1 million payment as revenue for the quarter ended March 31, 2003.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20110.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

(RUSA), an entity located in Newport Beach, California that Ghods owns and controls., The Complaint alleges that from as early as February 2004 through May 2006, Ghods and RUSA actively participated in a fraudulent prime bank scheme perpetrated by Geoffrey Gish (Gish) and several entities that he controlled. That prime bank scheme involved the sale of approximately $29.6 million of securities to more than 300 investors located throughout the United States. The Commission previously filed an emergency action against Gish and his affiliated companies on May 17, 2006. <i>SEC v. Geoffrey Gish, et al.</i>, Case No.1:06-cv-1171-CC (N.D. Ga.)., The Complaint alleges that Ghods and RUSA participated in one of the three fraudulent prime bank schemes that Gish offered, Zamindari Capital, LLC, and received approximately $9 million of investor funds. Zamindari was represented to be a high yield investment program that generated lucrative profits by purchasing debt instruments from major international banks at a discount and quickly reselling them at face value. RUSA was the entity that would supposedly trade these debt instruments for Zamindari investors., To entice investors to invest in Zamindari, the Complaint alleges that Ghods represented that all investor funds would remain in a blocked account, from which no withdrawals could be made. In truth, no such blocked account existed. Ghods transferred approximately $830,000 of investor funds to Unisource Cap, LLC, another company that she owned and controlled, and then used those funds to pay miscellaneous personal expenses. Ghods also claims that she used $2.2 million of investor funds for the development of an iron ore mine in Mexico that Unisource purportedly owns. Ghods transferred the remaining $5 million of investor funds to an offshore bank account, and those funds were then transferred to a third party., The Complaint further alleges that, to create the false appearance that their investments were safe, Ghods told Gish and several investors that RUSA guaranteed all investments with a $100 million certificate of deposit that RUSA held at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, a Canadian financial institution. In fact, no certificate of deposit existed.,  The Complaint alleges that Ghods and RUSA violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that relief defendant Unisource, directly or indirectly, obtained funds or other assets to which it has no legitimate claim, and has been unjustly enriched thereby.

Wang and Chen used material non-public information from Wangs employer, Morgan Stanley, which was contacted to provide services in connection with the acquisitions., Acting on the Commissions request, the Court today issued a temporary restraining order which, among other things, freezes the defendants assets and orders repatriation of funds taken out of the United States., The Commissions complaint alleges that Wang and Chen obtained illegal profits of more than $600,000 by trading on the basis of material nonpublic information before the public announcements of three acquisitions: Morgan Stanley Real Estates (MSRE) December 19, 2005 announcement of its acquisition of Town &amp; Country Trust; MSREs August 21, 2006 announcement of its acquisition of Glenborough Realty Trust; and Formation Capital, LLC and JER Partners January 16, 2007 announcement of its agreement to acquire Genesis HealthCare Corporation., The complaint further alleges that Wang was privy to material nonpublic information concerning each of these pending acquisitions. Since August 29, 2005, Wang has been employed as a Vice President of Morgan Stanley in a group that supported the Principal Transaction Group, which provides financing for MSRE and other entities potential acquisitions. In this position, Wang received documents via e-mail and had access to documents on a shared network drive which demonstrated that the firm was providing financing on certain acquisitions before they were publicly announced., The Commissions complaint alleges that Chen and Wang funded and exercised control over Fengs online brokerage accounts. When Fengs first brokerage account was opened, it was funded with money from a checking account in Wang and Chens name. In addition, Feng, who lives in Beijing, China, did not access the two online brokerage accounts that were opened in her name on the days of the relevant trading.

In a Third Amended Complaint in the insider trading case originally filed on March 2, 2007 against certain Unknown Purchasers of TXU call options, the Commission alleged that, on February 5, 6, 7, 8 and 23, 2007, Naseem, in breach of his duty to Credit Suisse and its client, telephoned Rahim and conveyed to him non-public, material information concerning the proposed but unannounced leveraged buyout of TXU Corp. by an investor group led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. and Texas Pacific Group., and other information. According to the Third Amended Complaint, Rahim, on February 23, 2007, purchased 6,700 TXU call option contracts with March 2007 expiration dates through UBS AG London, and 15,000 shares of TXU stock through Bank Julius Baer Co. Ltd. (Guernsey Branch). According to the Commission, these purchases allowed him to reap, following the public announcement of the buyout, trading profits of approximately $5.1 million., The Third Amended Complaint further alleges that Naseem made calls from his office phone to Rahims home and cell phones and alerted him to pending business combinations and deals involving 9 other issuers: Hydril Company, Trammell Crow Co., John Harland Co., Energy Partners Ltd., Veritas DGC Inc., Jacuzzi Brands, Caremark Rx, Inc., and Northwestern Corporation. The Third Amended Complaint alleges that, in at least 25 instances, Rahim placed trades in the securities of these issuers minutes after receiving a phone call from Naseem. According to the Third Amended Complaint, Credit Suisse served as an investment banker or financial advisor in all of the involved deals, and the phone calls to Rahim were made close in advance of — and frequently the day of or the day before — announcements of the proposed deals. The Third Amended Complaint also alleges that Rahim purchased securities in those companies in advance of public merger announcements through accounts held at Merrill Lynch Pierce Fenner &amp; Smith and/or Bank Julius Baer Co. Ltd (Guernsey Branch), obtaining profits of $2,425,000. Finally, according to the Third Amended Complaint, Naseem, in order to insure he would obtain a personal, financial benefit from his misappropriations, in May 2006 opened up a brokerage account in Pakistan and granted trading authority over that account to Rahim, his tippee., The Commission alleges that, as a result of these activities, Rahim engaged in insider trading in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The Commission is seeking permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest thereon, and civil monetary penalties., The Commissions original complaint against the Unknown Purchasers alleged that between February 21 and February 23 — prior to the public disclosure of TXU Corp.s merger agreement — while in possession of material, nonpublic information regarding the acquisition offer, the Unknown Purchasers, using overseas accounts, purchased over 8,020 call option contracts for TXU stock. The unrealized illicit profits on these option contracts total approximately $5.4 million. On March 2, 2007 the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois in Chicago entered a Temporary Restraining Order freezing assets of the Unknown Purchasers. On March 28, 2007, the District Court approved an extension of the asset freeze as to the Unknown Purchasers who purchased TXU securities through Credit Suisse in Zurich and Francisco Javier Garcia, then identified as the Unknown Purchaser who purchased TXU securities through Fimat Banque Frankfurt Zweigniederlassung. The Court also approved a 60-day extension of the asset freeze as to Rahim, then identified as the Unknown Purchaser who traded through UBS AG London. Garcia, believed to be a resident of Switzerland, purchased at least 260 TXU call options in advance of the public announcement. As a result of his insider trading, Garcia is in a position to reap trading profits of at least $150,500, the Commission alleges., As a result of an Amended Complaint filed by the Commission, on March 28, 2007, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois in Chicago entered a Temporary Restraining Order freezing assets of Sunil and Seema Sehgal, a married couple residing in the United Kingdom. The Amended Complaint added the Sehgals as defendants in the March 2, 2007 case against certain Unknown Purchasers of TXU call options, and alleged that the Sehgals made highly profitable and suspicious purchases of 700 call option contracts for the common stock of TXU Corp. through accounts at Charles Schwab &amp; Co., Inc., and Clark Dodge &amp; Co, Inc., in January and February 2007. The Commission alleged that, as a result of the increase in price of TXU stock following the public announcement of the leveraged buyout, the illicit profits on the Sehgals option contracts total approximately $270,000. On April 12, 2007, the Court approved a 60-day extension of the asset freeze as to the Sehgals. In its Third Amended Complaint, the Commission alleges that, in addition to timely purchases of TXU securities, Seema Sehgal also traded Hydril Company stock, and Sunil Sehgal traded Hydril Company, John Harland Co., and Caremark Rx, Inc. securities in advance of public merger announcements, realizing aggregate trading profits of approximately $292,900 in addition to the TXU profits., The Commission wishes to thank the New York Stock Exchange, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the Swiss Federal Banking Commission and the Financial Services Authority of the United Kingdom for their assistance in this matter., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2007/comp20113.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20113.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The Commission alleges that Christopher Balkenhol, 40, of San Mateo California, learned about secret merger negotiations from his wife, who worked at Oracle as the lead executive assistant to Oracles CEO and two co-Presidents.  Without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, Balkenhol agreed to settle the action against him, paying a total of approximately $198,000-including a penalty of nearly $100,000., The Commissions complaint, which was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, alleges that Balkenhol traded in a series of Oracle acquisition targets during 2004 and 2005.  Balkenhol allegedly learned about the planned acquisitions from his wife, who had access to the schedules of Oracles three top executives and was aware of significant merger-related meetings.  The Commission does not allege that Balkenhols wife knew about Balkenhols illicit trades.  Rather, the complaint alleges that Balkenhol breached a duty not to misuse confidences gleaned from his wife for his own gain., The complaint alleges that Balkenhol engaged in pattern of insider trading by purchasing stock in Oracle acquisition targets before any public announcement of Oracles interest.  Balkenhols first profitable trade came on March 1, 2005, when he invested $85,000 in Minneapolis-based Retek Inc. the day after Oracle executives began considering a tender offer for Retek.  When Oracle announced the tender offer the following week, Reteks stock price jumped and Balkenhol sold the shares for approximately $15,000 in alleged unlawful profits., Balkenhol allegedly continued his pattern of insider trading with a series of stock purchases in another acquisition target, Siebel Systems, Inc., during Oracles negotiations to acquire the company in 2005.

NJ Affordable Homes, a case pending in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. The Amended Complaint adds Kenneth Lagonia as a defendant in the Commissions previously filed offering fraud case against NJ Affordable Homes and its president, Wayne Puff. The Amended Complaint alleges that Lagonia, a resident of Manorville, New York, played an integral role in the final years of a Ponzi scheme that defrauded hundreds of NJ Affordable Homes investors, and made numerous fraudulent misrepresentations and omissions regarding NJ Affordable Homes business and the nature of the securities it was offering., The Amended Complaint further alleges that from at least 1999 to September 12, 2005, the day the Commission obtained a temporary restraining order against NJ Affordable Homes and Puff, NJ Affordable Homes sold more than $90 million worth of securities in unregistered offerings to hundreds of investors in New Jersey and other parts of the United States. In selling those securities, NJ Affordable guaranteed investors high rates of return, of 15% and more, based on promises that their money would be used to fund the purchase, renovation, and resale of real property. However, the Defendants failed to disclose to investors that, among other things, the companies properties were over-valued; that NJ Affordable Homes had a negative net worth and ever-worsening cash flow problems; that money from new investors was being used to fund payments to existing investors; that NJ Affordable Homes books and records were in disarray and the company could not prepare audited financial statements; and that many of the companys property sales were to straw buyers at inflated prices, generating fictitious revenue and resulting in increased and undisclosed debt obligations to NJ Affordable Homes., Specifically, the Amended Complaint alleges that NJ Affordable Homes, Puff, and Lagonia violated Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder., For further information, see Litigation Release Nos. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr19372.htm>19372</a> (September 12, 2005), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr19377.htm>19377</a> (September 14, 2005), and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr19408.htm>19408</a> (September 29, 2005).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20116.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Crow, Duncan Capital LLC, Duncan Capital Group LLC (DC Group), Robert David Fuchs, and Robert MacGregor with violations of the broker-dealer registration and reporting requirements. , The Commissions complaint alleges that, from November 2003 through at least December 2004, defendant Crow, who had been previously enjoined by the United States District Court for the Southern District of California from future violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws and sanctioned by the Commission, acted as an unregistered principal of defendant Duncan Capital, a registered broker-dealer. The complaint alleges that Crow controlled virtually every significant aspect of Duncan Capitals operations and received the vast majority of the firms profits. Yet Duncan Capitals regulatory filings failed to identify Crow as an officer, director or control affiliate of the firm, and falsely stated that: (1) no court had ever enjoined any of Duncan Capitals control affiliates in connection with an investment-related activity; and (2) the Commission had never entered an order against any of the firms control affiliates in connection with an investment-related activity., The Commissions complaint also alleges that defendant Fuchs, the owner and nominal president of defendant Duncan Capital and the person who filed the false regulatory filings on behalf of Duncan Capital, acquiesced in Crows undisclosed control of Duncan Capital and helped facilitate it by, among other things, transferring Duncan Capitals profits to other entities Crow controlled. , The complaint further alleges that, with the knowledge and substantial assistance of Fuchs, defendant Duncan Capital also failed to register several associated persons, including Crow and defendant MacGregor, Duncan Capitals senior managing director in charge of private placements. , The Commissions complaint alleges that by engaging in this conduct, the defendants violated the broker dealer registration and reporting requirements of the federal securities laws. Specifically, the complaint alleges that: (1) Duncan Capital violated Sections 15(b)(1), 15(b)(7) and 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 15b3-1, 15b7-1 and 17a-3(a)(12) thereunder; (2) Crow violated Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act and aided and abetted Duncan Capitals violations of Section 15(b)(1) of the Exchange Act and Rule 15b3-1; (3) MacGregor and DC Group violated Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act; and (4) Fuchs aided and abetted Crow, MacGregor and DC Groups violations of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act and Duncan Capitals violations of Sections 15(b)(1), 15(b)(7) and 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 15b3-1, 15b7-1 and 17a-3(a)(12) thereunder. , In its enforcement action the Commission seeks permanent injunctions against Crow, Fuchs, MacGregor, Duncan Capital and DC Group from future violations of the foregoing securities laws, the disgorgement of all ill-gotten gains and civil penalties.

Bert Fingerhut et al.</i>, Civil Action No. 07-2294 (D.N.J.) </h2>, <h2>SEC Charges Former Wall Street Executive and Three Others in Scheme to Defraud Savings Banks and Their Depositors in Dozens of Stock Offerings</h2>]","[On May 16, 2007, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey charging four individuals with securities fraud for participating in a decade-long scheme to defraud savings banks and their depositors in connection with the banks conversion from mutual to stock ownership.  All four defendants have agreed to settle the Commissions charges., The Commissions complaint alleges that Bert Fingerhut spearheaded a sophisticated scheme to circumvent federal and state banking regulations in order to make lucrative stock purchases in bank conversions.  From January 1997 through January 2007, Bert Fingerhuts scheme generated a total of over $12 million in fraudulent profits from secondary market sales of bank stock illegally obtained in 65 public offerings., The other three defendants were nominees for Bert Fingerhut who knowingly played active roles in implementing the scheme and profited from their efforts:  Robert Danetz, a childhood friend of Bert Fingerhut; Bruce Fingerhut, Bert Fingerhuts nephew; and Stephen Danetz, Robert Danetzs brother.  The complaint alleges that the defendants made numerous misrepresentations in stock subscription agreements and stock order forms to carry out their fraudulent scheme.  The complaint also alleges that Robert Danetz and Bruce Fingerhut acted as undisclosed nominees and used phony identification cards and other documents in order to deceive the banks.  All four defendants have agreed to settle the Commissions charges., More specifically, the defendants named in the Commissions complaint are:, Bert Fingerhut, age 63, a resident of both Aspen, Colorado and Palo Alto, California.  From 1965 through 1983, he was associated in different capacities with Oppenheimer &amp; Co., Inc. (Oppenheimer), then a registered broker-dealer.  Among other positions, he was Director of Research and Executive Vice President and a member of both the Management and Executive Committees of Oppenheimer.  From 1983 through 1988, he worked as an analyst for Odyssey Investors, Inc., a registered broker-dealer formerly affiliated with Oppenheimer., <b>Robert Danetz</b>, age 62, and a resident of both Teaneck, New Jersey and Roxbury, New York.  He is a retired school teacher., <b>Bruce Fingerhut</b>, age 38, and a resident of Alexandria, Virginia.  He is a freelance opinion poll researcher., <b>Stephen Danetz</b>, age 65, and a resident of New York, New York.  He is a real estate attorney., The Commissions complaint further alleges as follows:, Federal and state banking regulations are designed to ensure that when a bank converts to stock ownership, each of the banks depositors has a fair chance to purchase stock before other interested investors do so.  Because the demand for shares issued by a converting bank often exceeds the number of shares the bank is selling, banking regulations restrict the number of shares that any one depositor may acquire and prohibit depositors from agreeing to transfer their shares to anyone else before the shares are issued.  The demand for such shares often also causes the shares to trade in the secondary market at a high premium to the initial purchase price.  Accordingly, the chance to purchase shares from a converting bank is often a very lucrative investment opportunity., The defendants deliberately evaded these and other applicable banking regulations and offering terms contained in the converting banks prospectuses that imposed maximum purchase limits and prohibited the transfer of depositors purchase rights.  These priority purchase rights allow the depositors to purchase up to a certain number of shares at a relatively low price, and shares are allocated among depositors according to various criteria if an offering is oversubscribed.  To ensure that only depositors benefit from their priority purchase rights, federal and state banking regulations prohibit depositors from transferring ownership of their purchase rights or from entering into any agreement regarding the sale or transfer of shares purchased in the offering., Bert Fingerhut funded the opening of accounts in his own name and the names of his nominees at mutual savings banks throughout the country.  When any of the banks undertook a conversion, he secretly funded his nominees stock purchases, controlled the sale of his nominees shares and retained most of the trading profits.  He also had the nominees submit stock order forms in which they falsely certified to the banks that they were purchasing the stock for their own account and had no agreement to transfer the shares or the proceeds of their sale.  Bert Fingerhut caused his nominees to make these material misrepresentations in 65 public stock offerings by banks.  The 65 offerings were oversubscribed, and the defendants misconduct therefore limited the amount of stock available to legitimate depositors, some of whom received less stock than they requested or were completely shut out.  Bert Fingerhut and his nominees made over $12 million from the scheme at the expense of other depositors., Robert Danetz and Bruce Fingerhut knowingly played key roles in carrying out the scheme, and reaped large profits of their own from their misconduct.  They did most of the legwork to set up the nominee accounts and acted as nominees in numerous offerings.  For years, they traveled the country opening as many accounts as possible, sometimes using phony identification cards and bogus utility bills to satisfy certain banks in-state residency requirements.  As nominees, they both knowingly made misrepresentations in each of the subscription agreements they signed.  Stephen Danetz, a lawyer, also willingly participated as a nominee for Bert Fingerhut and knowingly made misrepresentations in one of the most profitable conversions targeted by the scheme.  In addition, he was involved in discussions with Bert Fingerhut and Robert Danetz that led Robert Danetz to make false statements to the Commissions staff in an earlier investigation into a similar, unrelated scheme that targeted the conversion of NewAlliance Bancshares, Inc., All four defendants are charged with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In the complaint, the Commission seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement and civil penalties., In a parallel criminal proceeding, the United States Attorneys Office for the District of New Jersey has announced that it filed criminal charges against Bert Fingerhut for the same conduct.  Earlier today, Bert Fingerhut pled guilty to the criminal charges and, in connection with his guilty plea, agreed to pay a total of $11 million in forfeiture, representing his own illegal profits from the scheme., In the Commissions action, each of the defendants, without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions complaint, has consented to the entry of a permanent injunction against violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In addition, Bruce Fingerhut has agreed to disgorge his ill-gotten gains of $181,269, plus prejudgment interest, and pay a civil penalty in the amount of $150,000.  Stephen Danetz has agreed to disgorge his ill-gotten gains of $137,975, plus prejudgment interest, and pay a civil penalty in the amount of $120,000.  Because Bert Fingerhut has already agreed to forfeit an amount equivalent to his ill-gotten gains in conjunction with his guilty plea in the parallel criminal case, the consent judgment in the civil case does not require disgorgement of those same ill-gotten gains.  The Commissions claims for civil penalties against Bert Fingerhut and Robert Danetz will remain pending., The Commission acknowledges the assistance and cooperation of the United States Attorneys Office for the District of New Jersey, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service in this matter.

The complaint alleged that Parrish and Zimmerman fraudulently sold interests in fictitious prime bank debt instruments and payment obligations, claiming that they carried a financial insurance guarantee to further enhance the value and lower the risk of default.

In addition to finding both Levines liable for securities fraud and other federal securities law violations, the Court held the defendants jointly and severally liable for disgorgement of $217,368.59 plus prejudgment interest and ordered them to pay, jointly and severally, a civil penalty of $200,000. The Court also enjoined the Levines for a period of ten years from violating the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws, and barred each of them for a period of ten years from serving as an officer or director of a public company., The judgment followed a December 2006 hearing during which the Court heard evidence on what remedies should be imposed as a result of the October 2003 jury verdict that found that the defendants had fraudulently overstated the assets of C.E.C. Industries Corporation (CEC) and filed false annual and quarterly reports with the Commission. In his Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, Judge Kennedy stated, among other things, that [t]he Levines undertook a complex scheme of stealth and concealment by which they defrauded investors and brought financial gain to themselves, and that they were the undisputed kingpins of the scheme. Judge Kennedy further stated the Levines utterly failed to acknowledge their wrongdoing or show contrition., The Commissions complaint, filed on September 28, 1999, alleged that the Levines overstated CECs assets in reports that they filed with the Commission for CECs fiscal years 1996 and 1997. Gerald Levine was CECs chief executive officer; his wife Marie was CECs secretary-treasurer, and the companys principal financial officer. The complaint also alleged that the Levines, acting through another corporate entity, Wire to Wire Inc., profited from their fraud by selling CEC stock while they knew that they had overstated CECs assets. In particular, the complaint alleged that the Levines overstated the value of two purported corporate assets: (1) a 9,000-acre tract of land in Tennessee that they claimed held 52 million tons of coal and substantial timber assets; and (2) forty one paintings by Sky Jones, which they claimed had a value of $1.7 million. The Commission proved at trial that CEC (and its corporate affiliates) did not own the land and that the paintings were worth no more than $10,350. Previously, on September 11, 2001, CEC settled the Commissions financial fraud charges against the company, without admitting or denying the allegations, by consenting to the entry of a final judgment that included a permanent injunction., Judge Kennedy specifically found that Gerald and Marie Levine each violated Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder, and Sections 17(a)(1), (2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933, and enjoined the Levines for a period of ten years from violating these provisions.

BISYS has agreed to settle the case, without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, and has agreed pay approximately $25 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest., The Commissions complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that from July 2000 through December 2003, former BISYS officers and employees engaged in a variety of improper accounting practices that resulted in an overstatement of the companys reported financial results for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2001, 2002, and 2003 by roughly $180 million.

The improper accounting practices in BISYSs other divisions overstated the companys pre-tax earnings by an additional $60.9 million for the same period., The complaint alleges that as a result of these and other improper accounting practices, BISYS filed annual and quarterly reports with the Commission that included financial statements that were inaccurate and misleading. In addition, the companys overstated financial results were incorporated in annual reports to shareholders, press releases, and offering documents including registration statements., The complaint alleges that by engaging in this conduct, BISYS violated the financial reporting, books-and-records, and internal controls provisions of the Exchange Act. Specifically, the complaint alleges that BISYS violated Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13 thereunder. The complaint further alleges that BISYS received approximately $20 million in ill-gotten gains as a result of its issuance of convertible debt, stock, and options at prices that were inflated as a result of its violations., Without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, BISYS has agreed to settle the charges by consenting to a permanent injunction against further violations of the relevant reporting, books-and-records, and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws, and it has agreed pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest totaling approximately $25 million., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2007/comp20125.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20125.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Goodwin, former senior vice-president of worldwide sales of Interspeed, Inc., a now-defunct North Andover, Massachusetts Internet equipment provider.  The final judgment against Goodwin, age 45, of Plano, Texas, entered on May 21, 2007, permanently enjoins Goodwin from violating antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and permanently bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company., The Commissions Complaint, filed on September 30, 2002, alleges that during 2000, Goodwin, the companys senior vice president of world-wide sales, orchestrated a scheme to inflate Interspeeds revenue in order to meet analysts revenue expectations and to boost his own bonus.  The Complaint alleges that Goodwin arranged transactions containing secret side letters, arranged round-trip transactions in which funds were funneled to a customer to use to pay for Interspeed products, and forged a signature and falsified the terms of a contract.  In November 2000, Interspeed filed amended Forms 10-Q with the Commission restating revenue for the first three quarters of fiscal year 2000.  According to the Complaint, Interspeeds reported revenue for the period decreased 60% from $14.1 million to $5.4 million, and its net loss increased from $8.5 million to $12 million.  According to the restatement, Interspeed had overstated its revenue by between 25% and 93% for each of the three affected filing periods.  Interspeeds fraudulent quarterly reports were also incorporated by reference in a Form S-8 registration statement, filed with the Commission on August 24, 2000., To settle the Commissions charges, Goodwin consented, without admitting or denying the allegations of the Complaint, to entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder and from aiding and abetting violations of Section 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-13 thereunder.  The judgment imposes a permanent officer and director bar.  The judgment further orders that Goodwin is liable for disgorgement of his performance-based bonus of $70,500, plus pre-judgment interest of $30,021, but waives payment based on sworn representations by Goodwin in his statement of financial condition and other documents and information submitted to the Commission., In a related criminal proceeding, on June 9, 2006, Goodwin was convicted of eight counts of securities and wire fraud following a nine day jury trial prosecuted by the U.S. Attorneys office for the District of Massachusetts.  On October 13, 2006, Goodwin was sentenced to serve a prison term of 30 months, followed by supervised release for three years., For further information, see Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18758.htm>18758</a> (June 22, 2004), Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18468.htm>18468</a> (November 17, 2003), Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18180.htm>18180</a> (June 6, 2003), and Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17758.htm>17758</a> (October 1, 2002).,  ]"

In addition, the final judgments hold De Vasconcelos and Universo FoneClub jointly and severally liable for $3,269,459 in disgorgement plus $151,928.49 in prejudgment interest but waive payment of all but $1,805,612.66 of that sum and do not impose a civil monetary penalty against De Vasconcelos or Universo FoneClub based on the sworn representations made in their Statements of Financial Condition and other documents and information submitted by them to the Commission.  The final judgments also require Sales to pay, over a seven month period, $9,423.80 in disgorgement plus $437.92 in prejudgment interest and a $25,000 civil penalty., On May 30, 2006, the Commission filed a complaint alleging that De Vasconcelos and Sales were promoting a pyramid scheme known as AFoneClub@ that targeted Brazilian-Americans.  The complaint alleged that the defendants falsely promised members of the Brazilian community that they would earn substantial sums of money by paying approximately $2,000 to $5,000 to become members of a company (referred to as the FoneClub) that purportedly sold prepaid telephone calling cards through a multi-level marketing structure.  However, the complaint alleged that the defendants, who had emphasized to potential investors that neither they nor the company would earn profits from the sale of phone cards, were in reality luring victims into a pyramid scheme in which its members would only make money through the recruitment of new members.  The complaint further alleged that the defendants emphasized in their sales pitches, which were made in Portuguese, that God wanted the Brazilian community to prosper financially and that FoneClub would provide the opportunity for it to do so., Simultaneously with the filing of its complaint on May 30, 2006, the Commission sought and obtained from the court an emergency order to halt this affinity fraud and to freeze the defendants assets.  This order froze approximately $1.8 million in assets, representing the bulk of the disgorgement and penalty payments set forth above.  Under the terms of the final judgments, these payments will be transferred to the courts registry and the SEC may propose a plan, subject to the courts approval, to distribute these funds to the victims of the fraud., For further information, see Lit.

Landzberg (Landzberg), a former proprietary trader for Barclays U.S. Distressed Debt Desk. The complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that Barclays and Landzberg engaged in securities fraud through a pattern of illegal insider trading., According to the complaint, Barclays and Landzberg illegally traded millions of dollars of bond securities over eighteen months, while aware of material nonpublic information received through six creditors committees. Landzberg simultaneously served as Barclays representative on the creditors committees and as its proprietary trader. Landzberg signed confidentiality agreements and committee bylaws on Barclays behalf, and received material nonpublic information concerning the financial condition and prospects of the issuers, their most recent business plans, detailed management projections, contemplated financing alternatives, proprietary advisor analyses, and the timing and terms of proposed plans of reorganization. Between March 2002 and September 2003, the repeated illegal insider trading by Barclays and Landzberg breached fiduciary and other duties of trust or confidence., The complaint alleges that Barclays and Landzberg misappropriated material nonpublic information by failing to disclose any of their trades to the creditors committees, issuers, or other sources of such information. In a few instances, Landzberg used purported big boy letters to advise his bond trading counterparties that Barclays may have possessed material nonpublic information. However, in no instance did Barclays or Landzberg disclose the material nonpublic information received from creditors committees to their bond trading counterparties. Three of the six committees were official unsecured creditors committees appointed by the Office of the United States Trustee under the auspices of the federal bankruptcy courts. Barclays served as Chair of two of these bankruptcy committees at the time of its illegal insider trading., The complaint further alleges that Barclays senior management authorized Landzberg to buy and sell securities for Barclays account while he served on bankruptcy creditors committees. Barclays Compliance personnel failed to prevent the illegal insider trading, despite receiving notice that the proprietary desk had nonpublic information and should have been restricted from trading., Barclays and Landzberg each consented, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, to entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Mercury Interactive, LLC (f/k/a Mercury Interactive Corporation), Amnon Landan, Sharlene Abrams, Douglas Smith, and Susan Skaer </i>, Case No. 07-2822 (RS). (N.D. Cal., filed May 31, 2007)</h2>, <h2>SEC Settles With Mercury Interactive and Sues Former Mercury Officers for Stock Option Backdating and Other Fraudulent Conduct </h2>]","[, The SECs complaint alleges that from 1997 to 2002, Mercury, acting through Landan and at various times Abrams, Smith and Skaer, backdated the date on which stock options were granted to executives and employees.  The backdating made it appear that the options were granted at times corresponding to low points of the closing price of the companys stock -- despite the fact that the purported grant date bore no relation to when the grant was actually approved -- and resulted in artificially and fraudulently low exercise prices for those options.  The senior officers used hindsight to select the purported grant dates of the options, backdating the grants by over four months and making the grants in-the-money from 44 cents to $60 on the date they were actually approved.  The complaint alleges that from 1997 through 2005, the accounting consequences of these benefits were then concealed as Landan, and at various times Abrams, Smith, Skaer and others, caused Mercury to fail to record over $258 million in compensation expenses and to provide false and misleading compensation disclosures to Mercurys shareholders in filings with the Commission.  Mercury and the senior executives continued the backdating for years in spite of a specific change mandated and approved by shareholders in 1998 that required the exercise price of all employee options to be 100% of the fair market value of the companys stock on the grant date., The SEC alleges that the company backdated 45 different stock option grants to executives and employees, representing every grant made by the company to executives and employees during 1997 to April 2002.  As alleged in the complaint, Skaer, or others at here direction, prepared false documentation memorializing the grants, including false written consents and meeting minutes.  The complaint alleges that Landan, Abrams, Smith and Skaer each personally benefited by receiving backdated stock options that were in-the-money by, in the aggregate, millions of dollars through the fraudulent scheme., The complaint also alleges that from 1998 through 2001, Mercury, acting through Landan, Abrams and Skaer, fraudulently backdated the date of option exercises of certain senior Mercury officers.  According to the complaint, senior executives were given preferential treatment and on multiple occasions were permitted to backdate the date of exercise of stock options with the company.  The complaint alleges that these executives, including Landan and Abrams, backdated option exercises to dates consistent with low-points of the companys stock, in order to minimize their taxable gain on exercise or receive more favorable long-term capital gains treatment on profits they earned upon the later sale of the stock acquired through exercise.  For example, the complaint alleges that  in connection with three backdated exercises, Landan was able to underreport over $18 million in gains upon exercise.  In fact, Landan and Abrams at times backdated the exercise of backdated option grants.  The company concealed from its shareholders the benefits reaped by these executives by making fraudulent proxy disclosures relating to officer stock option exercises, while Landan, Abrams and Skaer also concealed the backdated exercises in Forms 4 filed with the Commission., In addition, the complaint alleges that during at least 1997 through 2001, Mercury, through Landan, Abrams and others, secretly managed the companys reported earnings per share (EPS) to meet or exceed financial analyst expectations by manipulating the recognition of revenue and making fraudulent disclosures concerning its sales orders.  According to the complaint, Mercury stopped the shipment of its products once revenue targets for a period had been achieved, pushing the recognition of the revenue into subsequent periods.  Between 1998 and 2001, this practice allowed the company to shift material amounts of revenue between reporting periods (from between $35 million to approximately $182 million in revenues).  The company concealed the effect of this stop-shipment practice from the public through fraudulent and misleading statements and omissions concerning the backlog of its product bookings.  Landan and Abrams understood that the backlog of revenues was material information that was being concealed from analysts and investors.  For example, a 1999 PowerPoint presentation by Abrams to Landan and others concerning the companys financial picture stated in a slide:  Our Hidden Backlog . . . What Any Analyst Would Love to Get Their Hands On!, Finally, the complaint alleges that during 1999 through 2005, at various times Abrams, Skaer, and others participated in the fraudulent structuring of loans for stock option exercises by overseas employees of the company in order to conceal the variable accounting consequences of those transactions, causing the company to fail to report approximately $24 million in required compensation expenses, which materially overstated the companys reported pre-tax earnings during this period., Without admitting or denying the SECs allegations, Mercury agreed to pay a $28 million civil penalty to settle the Commissions charges.  Mercury also agreed to an injunction that permanently enjoins it from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, and 14a-9., The complaint alleges that Landan, Abrams, Smith and Skaer violated or aided and abetted violations of the antifraud, record-keeping, financial reporting, internal controls, equity transaction reporting and proxy provisions of the federal securities laws.  The complaint also alleges that Landan and Smith violated Exchange Act Rule 13a-14 by signing certifications required by Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 that were false and misleading concerning Mercurys 2002 through 2005 periodic reports.  The SECs complaint seeks against each of the individuals permanent injunctions, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, civil monetary penalties and officer and director bars.  In addition, the complaint seeks against Landan and Smith reimbursement of bonuses and profits from stock sales pursuant to Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2007/comp20136.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  ]"

Reyes, routinely provided extra compensation to employees by granting valuable in-the-money stock options for which a financial statement expense was required.  In order to avoid reporting to investors the hundreds of millions of dollars in undisclosed compensation expenses, Brocades former executives allegedly concealed the fact that the options had been granted in-the-money by creating records making it falsely appear that the options had been granted at a lower price on an earlier date., As the Commission alleged in its complaint against the Company, as well as its earlier complaint against Reyes and other former executives, Brocade backdated dozens of grants for tens of millions of stock options.  Among other things, Brocade personnel are alleged to have backdated large option grants for prized new hires to dates before the employees had even interviewed at the Company, creating false paperwork to make it appear the employees had been hired months earlier., When the stock option abuses surfaced, Brocades audit committee conducted a thorough investigation, resulting in the resignation of Reyes and the restatement of the Companys previously-reported income., Without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, Brocade has agreed to settle the charges by consenting to a permanent injunction against further violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities, Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act, and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder, and payment of a civil monetary penalty of $7 million., On July 20, 2006, the Commission charged Reyes, as well as former Vice President of Human Resources Stephanie Jensen, and former CFO Antonio Canova, with fraud and other securities law violations; that action is ongoing.,  ]"

Szeliga, a resident of Littleton, Colorado, and a former chief financial officer of Qwest Communications International Inc. (Qwest). Szeliga, without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, consented to the entry of the judgment that enjoins her from violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder, and aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder; directs her to pay $226,135 of disgorgement, plus $100,917 of prejudgment interest, and a $250,000 civil penalty; and prohibits her from acting as an officer or director of a public company. Szeligas misconduct occurred when she was Qwests senior vice president of financial planning and analysis and then chief financial officer., According to the SECs Complaint filed in the USDC of Colorado in March 2005, from at least April 1, 1999 through March 31, 2002, Szeliga and others at Qwest engaged in a massive financial fraud that hid from the investing public the true source of the companys revenue and earnings growth. The complaint alleged that to meet aggressive targets for Qwests revenue and earnings growth, Qwest fraudulently and repeatedly relied on immediate revenue recognition from one-time sales of assets known as IRUs and certain equipment, while falsely claiming to the investing public that the revenue was recurring. The complaint also alleged that Szeliga and others fraudulently and materially misrepresented Qwests performance and growth to the investing public, failed properly to account for IRU sales transactions in Qwests financial statements, and caused the company to report falsely approximately $3 billion in revenue. The complaint also alleged that Szeliga and others failed to make required accounting disclosures about IRUs to the investing public. In addition, the complaint alleged that, to meet revenue targets, Szeliga and others caused the manipulation of revenue associated with Qwest Dex, formerly a wholly-owned subsidiary of Qwest. Additionally, the complaint alleged that Szeliga fraudulently lowered liabilities related to employee vacations to increase artificially Qwests earnings to meet revenue and growth targets. The complaint further alleged that Szeliga sold Qwest stock knowing that Qwest had issued materially false information to the investing public in violation of the insider trading prohibition of the securities laws., In addition, the Commission today instituted an Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the Commissions Rules of Practice, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions to which Szeliga consented that suspends Szeliga from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant., The litigation against the remaining five defendants named in the Commissions complaint is continuing., For additional information on related actions, see Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20088.htm>20088</a> (April 24, 2007), Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr19313.htm>19313</a> (July 26, 2005), Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr19136.htm>19136</a> (March 15, 2005), Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr19134.htm>19134</a> (March 15, 2005), Sec.

Wesley Rhodes, age 55 and a resident of West Linn, Oregon, and three Oregon companies he controlled consented to be enjoined from future securities fraud., The Commissions complaint alleges that Rhodes and his companies raised millions of dollars from individual investors, including many senior citizens, by representing that he would invest their money in stocks and bonds. The complaint further alleges that contrary to representations made to investors, Rhodes did not invest their funds in stocks and bonds. Instead, Rhodes took their money and used it for other purposes, including buying vintage automobiles and sports memorabilia. According to the complaint, Rhodes sent account statements to the investors representing that their investments had an aggregate value of nearly $40 million as of June 30, 2006. At the time a receiver was appointed for Rhodes companies on September 21, 2006, however, Rhodes had less than $2 million invested in stocks and bonds., On September 21, 2006, the Commission filed in the United States District Court for the District of Oregon a complaint and an application for temporary emergency relief against Rhodes and three Oregon companies he controlled, charging that they defrauded investors in violation of the federal securities laws. Aside from Rhodes, the defendants were Rhodes Econometrics, Inc., an investment adviser registered with the Commission, and two other companies, The Rhodes Company and Resource Transactions, Inc., both unregistered investment advisers. On the same date, the Commission obtained a temporary injunction against all defendants for securities fraud, as well as a temporary asset freeze and the appointment of a temporary receiver over all Rhodes-controlled companies. (See Litigation Release No. 19855.) The Commission subsequently obtained a preliminary injunction against all defendants and an order appointing a permanent receiver., Rhodes and his companies, without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions complaint, consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

In total, the Court ordered these defendants to pay in excess of $2.5 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties; and each has been permanently enjoined from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws.  On the same date, at the Commissions request, the District Court also ordered the dismissal of the case against Apacor Financial, Inc.

The alleged misrepresentations and omissions related to, among other things, the use of the offering proceeds and the risks associated with the investment.  Specifically, the complaint alleged that, contrary to representations, at the time of the offerings each of these issuers was in dire financial circumstances, and the offering proceeds were used, not for the purchase of productive assets as promised, but, largely, to pay commissions, officers salaries and personal expenses, and to pay interest to prior investors.  The complaint further alleged that no registration statement was in effect as to these promissory notes; nor were they exempt from registration, and that, in connection with the charged conduct, Wensel, Carlson, and Spirk acted as unregistered broker-dealers., The Courts Final Judgments enjoined Musick, Wensel, Carlson, Spirk, and Wallace from future violations of the antifraud provisions, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as the securities registration provisions, Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act.

The complaint further alleges that Schwinger learned of the impending merger while interviewing Vasteras Chief Counsel, who was then seeking to be hired by KMR as a partner.  In responding to Schwingers inquiries during the interview process about the Chief Counsels reasons for leaving Vastera, the Chief Counsel allegedly disclosed to Schwinger no later than October 27, 2004 that Vasteras acquisition was imminent.

Sometime in June 2005, Galamb learned that Hudson United was in the process of being sold or acquired.  At or around that time, another Hudson United employee, with whom Galamb had a close working relationship and who worked in Hudson Uniteds corporate offices, told Galamb that, based on certain activity she had witnessed, she believed the bank was going to be sold.  The employee told Galamb that there had been a flurry of activity that, from her experience, was consistent with acquisition and merger negotiations., The complaint further alleges that on July 7, 2005, in violation of his fiduciary duties to Hudson United and its shareholders, Galamb purchased 1,450 shares of Hudson United stock, paying $36.50 per share.

The Commission alleges that Arizona attorney David B. Stocker and Texas attorney Phillip W. Offill, Jr. assisted Michigan-based AVL Global, Inc., in a scheme to dump millions of shares of AVL Global stock into the marketplace without any public disclosure of the companys failing operations. In the same action, the Commission also charged Peter W. Fisher and his son, N. Tyler Fisher, the principals behind AVL Global, for their roles in the scheme., According to the Commissions complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, the defendants devised a scheme to deliver millions of AVL Global shares to Peter Fisher — an Ontario resident with a criminal record who secretly controlled the company through his son — as well as various family members, business associates and stock promoters. The Commission alleges that, in late 2005, Peter Fisher and Tyler Fisher then caused AVL Global to issue a series of misleading press releases that touted the companys business prospects when, in reality, AVL Global had essentially abandoned its business and ceased operations. Peter Fisher, who controlled the vast majority of the companys stock, dumped his shares and netted approximately $160,000., The Commission further alleges that Stocker and Offill arranged a series of sham transactions that helped the company avoid registering the stock sales with the Commission and disclosing to the public AVL Globals true financial position. According to the complaint, the defendants caused AVL Global to issue approximately 15 million shares of stock to bogus investment companies controlled by Offill or Stocker. Stocker falsely claimed that these companies had purchased the stock for investment purposes and thus the sales were exempt from registration; however, within days of the supposed investments, the Stocker and Offill entities transferred all the stock to Peter Fisher and his associates, who could then commence dumping the stock into the market., The Commissions complaint alleges that the defendants violated the registration provisions of the federal securities laws (Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933), and that Peter and Tyler Fisher violated the antifraud provisions as well (Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder).

(Zomax), a former U.S. public corporation that was based in Plymouth, Minnesota. The Commissions Complaint alleges that from the end of 2003 through 2004, Tom Shanahan (Shanahan), the former General Manager of Zomax Limited and Clem Hannon (Hannon), the former Financial Controller of Zomax Ireland, engaged in a fraudulent scheme to artificially inflate the financial results of Zomax Ireland by manipulating certain accounting entries and financial records to hide the declining performance of Zomax Ireland. The Complaint seeks injunctive relief against Shanahan and Hannon, as well as the imposition of an officer and director bar., The Complaint alleges that Shanahan and Hannon directed one of Zomax Irelands financial accountants to conceal Zomax Irelands losses by making false journal entries to overstate the sales accrual account, to capitalize spare machine parts that should have been expensed, and to understate accruals for employee holiday pay. The Complaint further alleges that Shanahan and Hannon submitted false Zomax Ireland financial information to Zomax. In addition, they sent false site certifications to Zomax, which Zomax required in order to fulfill its obligations under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Complaint alleges that Shanahan and Hannons fraudulent scheme caused Zomax to misstate its financial statements for the first three quarters of 2004. The Complaint also alleges that Shanahan and Hannons fraudulent accounting at Zomax Ireland had a material effect on Zomaxs consolidated quarterly financial statements during the first three quarters of 2004. On March 31, 2005, Zomax filed its Form 10-K for 2004, which restated its financial statements for the first three quarters of 2004. The restatement, caused primarily by Shanahan and Hannons fraudulent accounting, negatively impacted Zomaxs previously reported quarterly results for 2004. For the first quarter of 2004, Zomax previously reported a net loss of $981,000; the restatement increased this net loss by $565,000 to $1,546,000. For the second quarter of 2004, Zomax previously reported net income of $1,252,000; the restatement decreased net income for this period by $718,000 to $534,000. For the third quarter of 2004, Zomax previously reported a net loss of $5,497,000; the restatement increased this net loss by $540,000 to $6,037,000., The Complaint alleges that Shanahan and Hannon committed fraud in connection with the purchase and sale of securities, in violation of Sections 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The Complaint also alleges that Shanahan and Hannon violated Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder by knowingly circumventing Zomaxs system of internal accounting controls, knowingly falsifying Zomax Irelands books, records and accounts, and as a result, aided and abetted Zomaxs violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-13 thereunder., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2007/comp20156.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20156.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

(Sadia), a Brazilian food products company. The Commission charged Fontana with engaging in illegal insider trading both by purchasing securities of Perdigão S.A. (Perdigão) prior to Sadias tender offer for Perdigão and by selling the same securities of Perdigão prior to Sadias subsequent revocation of the tender offer. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, Fontana has consented to the entry of a final judgment imposing injunctive and monetary relief and barring him from acting as an officer or director of a publicly traded company for a period of five years., The Commissions complaint alleges that Fontana learned of the contemplated tender offer on April 26, 2006, through a conversation with the chairman of Sadias board of directors. According to the complaint, Fontana subsequently purchased 18,000 American Depositary Shares (ADSs) of Perdigão at an average cost of $19.12 per ADS through three transactions executed between July 5 and 12, 2006, on the basis of material, nonpublic information concerning the proposed acquisition, and in breach of a duty of trust and confidence he owed to Sadia. On Sunday, July 16, 2006, Sadia announced the tender offer for Perdigão. The following day, the price of Perdigão ADSs increased to $24.50, up $4.25 (21%) from the previous closing price. On the morning of July 21, 2006, Fontana participated by conference call in a meeting at which Sadias board of directors decided to revoke the tender offer. As the complaint alleges, after this meeting — but before Sadia announced the revocation later that day — Fontana sold all 18,000 ADSs of Perdigão at an average selling price of $26.85 per ADS. By selling in advance of the public announcement of the revocation, the complaint alleges, Fontana again engaged in illegal insider trading, in breach of a duty of trust and confidence he owed to Sadia. The complaint alleges that Fontana realized ill-gotten profits of $139,114.50 from his unlawful trading., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Fontana has agreed to settle the Commissions charges by consenting to the entry of a final judgment that would: (i) permanently enjoin him from further violations of Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder; (ii) require him to pay $142,848.95 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest; (iii) order him to pay a 1.25-time civil penalty of $173,893.13; and (iv) bar him for a period of five years from serving as an officer or director of a publicly traded company., The Commission wishes to acknowledge the assistance of the Brazilian Comissão de Valores Mobilários.

McMahon simultaneously settled with the Commission without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint. As part of the settlement agreement, which is subject to the approval of the U.S. District Court, McMahon has agreed to a permanent injunction and to be barred from acting as an officer or director of a public company for five years. In addition, McMahon will pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $150,000 and a civil penalty of $150,000., Specifically, the Commissions Complaint alleges that McMahon participated in a fraudulent transaction involving the sale of an interest in Nigerian power generating barges to Merrill Lynch that allowed Enron to improperly report $12 million in earnings in the fourth quarter of 1999. Enron never should have recorded profits from this purported sale because the risks and rewards of ownership in the barges never passed to Merrill Lynch due to an oral side agreement made by McMahon and others. The Complaint also alleges that while serving as Enrons Treasurer from April 1998 through March 2000, McMahon made false and misleading statements to the national credit rating agencies regarding Enrons financial position and cash flow. The Complaint alleges that the false and misleading statements included statements about Enrons cash flow from operations that failed to disclose that a portion of such cash flow was a result of structured financings and debt-like obligations that had nothing to do with Enrons operations or trading business. In addition, the Complaint alleges that McMahon made additional false and misleading statements to the rating agencies after he became Enrons Chief Financial Officer on October 24, 2001 through Enrons bankruptcy filing in December 2001., McMahon has agreed to be enjoined permanently from violating Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1, and from aiding and abetting the violation of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13., In settlement of this action, McMahon also consented to the entry of an Administrative Order, pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the Commissions Rules of Practice, suspending him from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant, with a right to reapply after three years., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2007/comp20159.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20159.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Christian, without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, consented to the entry of the judgment that enjoins him from violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5 thereunder, and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 15(c) and 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-3 and 17a-3. The final judgment also directs Christian to pay $250,000 of disgorgement., According to the SECs Complaint filed in the SDNY in July 2005, Christian, a resident of New York, NY, engaged in late trading on behalf of Trautman Wasserman customers. See Litigation Release 19294 (July 7, 2005). Christian carried out the late trading scheme by having customers submit proposed mutual fund trading orders during the trading day and time-stamping them just before 4:00 p.m. to make it appear that customer orders were received before 4:00 p.m. Christian did not, however, enter these proposed trades for execution. Instead, Christian communicated with customers well after 4:00 p.m. (often until 6:30 p.m. or later) to determine if the customers wanted to execute the proposed orders or submit different orders based on post-4:00 p.m. market information. After customers made their final post-4:00 p.m. trading decisions, Christian entered the customers orders into the trading system at the price based on the net asset value determined as of 4:00 p.m. Additionally, Christian created false records to conceal the late trading., Christian and Trautman Wasserman received 307 letters from 40 fund companies seeking to stop excessive trading by accounts at Trautman Wasserman. Knowing that mutual fund companies monitored market-timing activity by account number and registered representative identification number, Christian opened and traded in multiple accounts for his market-timing customers and utilized numerous different registered representative identification numbers, to evade mutual fund companies restrictions on frequent trading., In addition, in July 2005 the Commission issued an order pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Exchange Act barring Christian from association with any broker or dealer based upon Christians guilty plea to a criminal charge in New York state court.

The balance of the investor funds went into the fraudulent investment programs of Lexington International Fund, LLC a/k/a Lexington International Fund, Inc. (Lexington) and Oxford Adams Capital, LLC (Oxford Adams). Gish was alleged to have operated the investment programs as a Ponzi scheme., The Complaint alleged that Gish commingled funds from the three investment entities, and that Gish and the co-defendant entities that he controlled made numerous false statements regarding the use of the investment funds, the historical rates of return of the investments, and the risk to the investors. The Zamindari offering documents claimed, among other things, that the investor funds would be used to purchase debt instruments issued by a major bank or corporation. The Lexington offering documents claimed that Lexington traded foreign currency contracts. The Oxford Adams offering documents claimed that the entity was an options trading program. All three investment programs, however, were alleged to have been fictitious prime bank schemes., The Complaint alleged that Zamindari, Lexington, and Oxford lured investors with offering materials that falsely suggested that each program had historically generated returns ranging between 44% to over 100% per year.

Graham, the former CFO of Intervoice, Inc., for engaging in a fraudulent scheme to inflate Intervoices revenues and misstate other important financial metrics so as to deceive investors as to the companys true financial condition. Graham, a resident of Dallas, Texas, has agreed to settle with the Commission without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. Under the settlement, Graham agreed to the entry of an order that enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud and books and records provisions of the securities laws, imposes a permanent officer and director bar, and requires payment of over $200,000 for civil penalties and disgorgement., The Commissions complaint, dated June 21, 2007, alleges that the scheme involved the improper recognition of revenue from a series of transactions that resulted in Intervoices publication of materially false and misleading financial statements in four financial periods between 2000 and at least 2002. As set forth in the complaint, Graham negotiated and approved transactions between Intervoice and its distributors that were each subject to significant, ongoing, post-transaction obligations and thus did not qualify for revenue recognition under Intervoices policies or generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The complaint alleges that, as to certain transactions, Graham agreed in advance to reconfigure the hardware and software products, or to substitute products of commensurate value, in order to meet the needs of its distributors ultimate end users, thereby precluding revenue recognition under GAAP. As to other transactions, the complaint alleges that Graham requested distributors to take products in advance of their receiving orders from end customers, and agreed to allow the distributors to return the products without penalty if the end customers failed to purchase the products. According to the complaint, Graham failed to document these terms, and, in some cases, affirmatively misled Intervoices external auditors by providing false information and documents. In addition, the complaint also alleges that, during 2001, Graham helped one of Intervoices suppliers, Speechworks International, Inc., to improperly recognize revenue by falsifying documents that he knew the company would use to deceive its own auditors., The complaint further alleges that during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, Graham negotiated a transaction in which Intervoice paid $900,000 to Speechworks in exchange for Speechworks amending a stock warrant that it had previously issued to Intervoice. The amendment purported to permit Intervoice to immediately exercise the warrant and resell the underlying shares as freely trading shares pursuant to a specific registration exemption. The complaint alleges, however, that because of the $900,000 payment to Speechworks, these shares were not eligible for the exemption and should have been issued to Intervoice as restricted stock. Nonetheless, the complaint alleges, Intervoice improperly sold the shares of Speechworks stock as freely-trading shares and earned gross proceeds of $21.4 million., The complaint alleges that through his fraudulent conduct Graham violated Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder, aided and abetted Intervoices violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder, and aided and abetted Speechworks violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. I addition to injunctions and a permanent officer and director bar, Graham has consented to the entry of a judgment that requires disgorgement of $75,000 with $33,270.37 in prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $100,000., In a related proceeding, the Commission filed a civil action against Richard J. Westelman and Steven Forman, the former CFO and controller of Speechworks (now a part of Nuance, Inc.), and Arthur Haberman, Speechworks former director of finance, for their role in the improper transactions with Intervoice.

The Commission charged that Westelman, a resident of Scituate, Massachusetts, and Forman, a resident of Chelmsford, Massachusetts, engaged in a fraudulent scheme to inflate Speechworks revenues and misstate other important financial metrics so as to deceive investors as to the companys true financial condition. The Commission also charged Arthur Haberman, Speechworks former director of finance, with violating and aiding and abetting Speechworks violations of various books and records provisions of the federal securities laws. Both Westelman and Haberman have agreed to settle with the Commission without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. Westelman agreed to the entry of an order that enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud and books and records provisions of the securities laws, imposes a permanent officer and director bar, and requires payment of a $100,000 civil penalty. Haberman agreed to the entry of an order that enjoins him from future violations of the books and records provisions of the securities laws and requires payment of a $25,000 civil penalty. The Commissions action against Forman, in which it is seeking injunctions, an officer and director bar, and a civil penalty, is pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts., The Commissions complaint, dated June 21, 2007, alleges that from at least 2001 through at least 2003, Westelman and Forman engaged in a fraudulent scheme to inflate Speechworks revenues and misstate other key financial information. According to the complaint, Westelman negotiated and approved a series of transactions between Speechworks and one of its key resellers, Intervoice, Inc., that called for the reseller to make royalty payments prior to its shipment of software to end customers. For one transaction, the complaint alleges Westelman requested Intervoice to provide falsified documents that allowed him to improperly recognize as revenue a $900,000 cash payment Intervoice made in return for amending a warrant Speechworks had previously issued to Intervoice. For another transaction, the complaint alleges that Westelman and Forman schemed to recognize as revenue $2 million in prepayments to Speechworks, even though they knew the deal was not properly documented and did not otherwise qualify for revenue recognition under Speechworks policies and GAAP. The complaint further claims that Westelman and Forman purposefully misled Speechworks external auditors about the terms of the deal and, among other things, permitted the auditors to rely on documents that they knew to be false and misleading. The complaint also alleges that Westelman helped Intervoice improperly recognize revenue. Finally, the complaint alleges that Haberman improperly recorded Intervoices royalty prepayments as revenue in the companys books and records., The complaint alleges that through their conduct, Westelman and Forman variously violated, or aided and abetted Speechworks violations of, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder, aided and abetted Speechworks violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder; and Westelman also aided and abetted Intervoices violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and Haberman violated Rule13b2-1 of the Exchange Act and aided and abetted Speechworks violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder., In a related proceeding, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action against Rob Roy J.

Collins and IBM for Assisting in Dollar General Corporations Accounting Fraud</h2>]","[<p align=right>CORRECTED, The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced the filing of a settled civil action against Kevin B. Collins, an employee of International Business Machines Corporation (IBM), for aiding and abetting Dollar General Corporations commission of accounting fraud. The Commission filed the civil action against Collins in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee. As set forth in the Commissions complaint, Collins assisted Dollar Generals commission of accounting fraud through a sham transaction that was designed to achieve a particular accounting result for Dollar General. Also today, the Commission instituted a settled cease-and-desist proceeding against IBM for its role in the Dollar General fraud and for IBMs own books and records violations., According to the Commissions complaint, in 1999, IBM and Dollar General agreed that Dollar General would lease new electronic cash registers from IBM to replace Dollar Generals old registers. As originally planned, Dollar General would phase out the old registers and purchase the new IBM equipment over a multi-year period. As alleged in the Commissions complaint, in the second half of 2000, IBM, through Collins, instead suggested that Dollar General accelerate the roll-out of new IBM equipment by leasing for approximately $10 million all of the new equipment by the end of 2000. This would have the result of increasing IBMs revenue for fiscal year 2000, as well as increasing Collins bonus compensation for that period. As alleged by the Commission, Dollar General initially rejected the proposal, however, due to an accounting problem. Specifically, if Dollar General replaced all of the Omron equipment, it would be required to write off the book value of that equipment as an expense. This book loss problem, as it became known, in turn, would have a negative impact on Dollar Generals earnings for its fiscal year 2000., The Commission further alleges in its complaint that IBM, through Collins, devised a way to solve Dollar Generals book loss problem. Specifically, Collins proposed that IBM would purchase Dollar Generals old cash registers for approximately $11 million. As alleged, by selling the equipment at that price, Dollar General would avoid most of the negative consequences of having to write off the book value of the equipment that would have occurred if it simply replaced the old registers with the new IBM equipment. According to the Commissions complaint, the proposed purchase was not a bona fide transaction because, among other reasons, IBMs purchase price for Dollar Generals old cash registers was repaid to IBM by an offsetting increase in the amount that Dollar General was to pay for the new IBM equipment. In addition, although IBM agreed to buy the Omron equipment for more than Dollar General was going to pay for the new IBM registers, IBM and Collins knew that the old cash registers were worthless to IBM, IBM intended to destroy the equipment, and ultimately IBM never took possession of any of the sales registers. As alleged, IBM nevertheless engaged in the purchase and Dollar General removed the old cash registers from its books and minimized the negative impact on its earnings in fiscal year 2000., The Commissions complaint alleges that, as a result of his conduct, Collins aided and abetted Dollar Generals violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 12b-20 and 13a-11. Collins has agreed, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from aiding and abetting violations of these provisions. In addition, the final judgment orders Collins to pay $95,000, comprising $48,769 in disgorgement, $21,231 in prejudgment interest and a civil penalty of $25,000. Collins settlement is subject to court approval., In the related administrative proceeding instituted today against IBM, the Commission found that, as a result of the above-referenced conduct, IBM caused Dollar Generals violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 12b-20 and 13a-11. The Commissions order also finds that IBM maintained inaccurate books and records during 2000 and 2001 as a result of numerous discrete revenue recognition errors that took place in the United States and at least 23 other countries, totaling approximately $577 million in revenues over that two-year period. The order also finds that IBM violated Section 13(b)(2)(A) by failing to keep accurate books and records. IBM, without admitting or denying the Commissions findings, consented to the issuance of the Commissions order directing IBM to cease and desist from committing or causing future violations of these provisions. Under the terms of the order, IBM also undertakes to pay $7 million to the court in connection with the Commissions previously filed action <i>SEC v. Dollar General, et al.</i> C.A.

The Commission’s complaint alleges that over a two-year period, GLG made more than $2.2 million in four of its managed hedge funds by engaging in multiple violations of Rule 105 of Regulation M of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Rule 105, designed to prevent manipulative short selling, prohibits covering certain short sales with securities obtained in a public offering.

Defendants late trades were part of a profitable investment strategy that depended for its success on mutual fund trading based on information obtained after the markets closed at 4:00 p.m. ET., The complaint alleges that Simpson Capital is the investment adviser to two hedge funds, Simpson Partners, L.P. and Simpson Offshore, Ltd.

Resteiner for criminal charges based on his operation of a fraudulent investment scheme through which he raised more than $30 million. Resteiner was a defendant in a previously filed SEC fraud action based on the same conduct.  The sentence, handed down on May 16, 2007, ordered Resteiner to serve 87 months of incarceration, followed by two years of supervised release, and to pay restitution in the amount of $33.9 million.  Resteiner renounced his U.S. citizenship in 1995, and will be deported from the United States following his term of imprisonment.  , The criminal indictment alleged that Resteiner created and executed a scheme by which he defrauded approximately 50 investors, many of whom were members of the Church of Christ Scientist (Christian Science Church), out of more than $30 million through a purported high-yield, international bank trading program.  As part of this scheme, Resteiner, assisted by others, made false representations to prospective investors, including that he was one of only a few people in the world permitted to conduct off-balance sheet trading, that his trading program would pay annual returns of no less than 50 percent, and that investors principal would never be at risk.  The indictment further alleged that Resteiner knew that he was not a trader and had no way to generate the promised investment returns, that investors principal was not safe, and was in fact being used to pay purported interest payments to investors to lure more investors into the scheme, and to support his lavish lifestyle.  The indictment alleged Resteiner maintained  homes in the Bahamas and in Switzerland, a yacht, an airplane, a helicopter, two Rolls Royce motor cars, two Hummer vehicles, a Porsche Carerra sports car, and other assorted vehicles. , On April 16, 2001, the Commission filed a complaint in the Massachusetts federal district court against Resteiner and others charging them each with participating in the same investment scheme alleged in the indictment.  On August 19, 2002, the Massachusetts federal district court entered default judgments against Resteiner and another defendant, Voldemar A. VonStrasdas, in the Commissions action.  The Court ordered Resteiner and VonStrasdas jointly and severally to pay disgorgement plus prejudgment interest of $25,930,895.26.  In addition, the Court ordered Resteiner and VonStrasdas each to pay civil penalties of $4.4 million, and permanently enjoined each of them from violating the antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws.  The court also entered judgments by consent against two other individuals involved in Resteiners fraudulent investment scheme, Charles G. Dyer and Miles M.

(CyberKey), on charges of securities fraud and lying to the SEC during its probe of a scheme Plant orchestrated to pump up the price of Cyberkeys shares.  Plant is alleged to have given false testimony to the Commission about Cyberkeys purported business dealings with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the receipt of payments under a DHS contract, and a purported business relationship with an intermediary company., The two-count indictment charges Plant with orchestrating a fraud scheme in which he personally made in excess of one million dollars selling Cyberkey shares at inflated prices while lying to the public about Cyberkeys business prospects and management., According to the indictment, Plant was responsible for disseminating, in an effort artificially to inflate the price of Cyberkeys shares, numerous false and misleading press releases between December 8, 2005 and March 15, 2007. These press releases contained materially false and misleading statements concerning 1) a fictitious $24.5 million purchase order that CyberKey supposedly received from DHS, when as Plant knew, that DHS purchase order did not exist; 2) revenues and profits that CyberKey had supposedly realized from the fictitious DHS purchase order, when as Plant knew, CyberKey did not receive, and did not expect to receive, any revenues or profits from the fictitious DHS purchase order; 3) Plants false representations that Cyberkeys financial statements were in the process of being audited and would be released in the near future, when as Plant knew, CyberKey did not expect to release audited financial statements in that time period; and/or 4) Plants false representations that the failure of the company to realize revenues from the DHS contract was the result of both improper accounting practices used by a company officer, and a third-partys actions to circumvent CyberKey as the middleman of the DHS purchase order, when as Plant knew, the lack of revenues from the DHS purchase order resulted because there was no such purchase order with DHS., The Commissions civil fraud complaint against Cyberkey and Plant covering the scheme, filed on March 20, 2007, further alleged that CyberKey had no business relationship at all, either directly or indirectly, with DHS, and generated no revenues whatsoever from any such relationship., Todays criminal indictment charges Plant with securities fraud, in violation of 15 U.S.C. §§ 78j(b), 78ff; and making a false statement to the Commission, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001., Plant was arrested on March 13, 2007, in St. George, Utah, by agents of the FBIs Philadelphia Economic Crimes Squad and the United States Postal Inspection Service on charges of securities fraud and aiding and abetting securities fraud. One week later, the Commission filed its civil case against Cyberkey and Plant for engaging in an ongoing unregistered offering of Cyberkey shares while promoting the bogus DHS purchase order., For more information, see Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20049.htm>20049</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20171.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Michael W. Sulfridge</i>, Civil Action No. 307-CV-1173-L Northern District of Texas (Dallas Division)</h2>, <h2>SEC Settles Fraud Charges Against Former Controller of Sourcecorp, Inc. Subsidiary</h2>]","[On June 28, 2007, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a settled civil action in Dallas federal court against Michael W. Sulfridge, the former controller of Image Entry, Inc., a data entry services provider with its principal office in London, Kentucky. Image Entry is a wholly owned subsidiary of Dallas-based Sourcecorp, Inc., whose common stock previously traded on the Nasdaq National Market but which now is privately owned., Sourcecorp acquired Image Entry in 2001 from Image Entrys CEO, Bill Deaton, and members of Deatons family. As part of the acquisition, Sourcecorp entered into employment agreements with Deaton in which Sourcecorp agreed to pay Deaton an annual bonus, over a three-year earn out period, tied to Image Entrys performance against certain earnings criteria. The Commission alleges that Sulfridge and Deaton — who previously settled Commission charges — planned and executed a scheme to overstate Image Entrys earnings to increase the amount of Deatons earn out bonus. The Commission alleges that Sulfridge received approximately $585,000 from Deaton for his involvement. The Commissions complaint describes an alleged scheme to inflate Image Entrys earnings from 2001 through the first quarter of 2004 by (1) recognizing unearned revenue from state and federal government data entry contracts, (2) prematurely recognizing revenue from a federal government data entry contract that Image Entry had not yet been awarded, and (3) diverting various Image Entry expenses to other companies Deaton owned to reduce Image Entrys expenses and increase its earnings. The Commission contends that this alleged misconduct artificially inflated Image Entrys earnings and, by extension, Deatons earn out bonus. Moreover, because the allegedly inflated figures were included in Sourcecorps publicly reported consolidated financial results, the Commissions complaint asserts that Sourcecorps earnings were materially overstated., Without or admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, Sulfridge has consented to entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder, and aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder. As part of the settlement, Sulfridge also will be barred from serving as an officer or director from a public company for five years. In addition, Sulfridge will disgorge $50,000 of his improper compensation. The Commission has waived the remainder of Sulfridges disgorgement and not assessed a financial penalty based on Sulfridges sworn financial statements and other documents submitted to the Commission., For additional information, see Commission Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19834.htm>19834</a>, <i>SEC v.

As accounted for, the book value of certain excess plush toy inventory, such as seasonal stuffed animals, was not reduced in connection with the transaction.

In the complaint, the Commission alleged that from approximately October 2006 through the present, Coleman and the Hockey Barn defrauded investors through an offering of promissory notes and other investment contracts. Among other things, Coleman falsely told investors that they could obtain a return of at least 400% within 60 days from an investment in a purported bond trading program., The Complaint named the Hockey Barn, a New York limited liability company located in Amherst, New York, as a defendant. The Complaint also named Coleman, age 28, and a resident of East Amherst, New York, as a defendant., The complaint alleged the following. Hockey Barn purported to be a developer of hockey facilities in New York, Florida, and other states. Coleman falsely told prospective investors that the investments he was offering were to raise financing toward Hockey Barns purported business goals. Coleman falsely told investors that Coleman and/or Hockey Barn would use theirs and others invested funds to trade bonds, and that this trading program would produce returns of at least 400% within 60 days. For example, in or about January 2007, Coleman falsely told an approximately 65 year old woman that his purported war bond trading program would generate returns of approximately 400% within 60 days. This investor then gave Coleman $25,000 to invest in the purported trading program. When the investor did not receive her promised return, she asked for the return of her original investment. In April 2007, Coleman gave the investor a $25,000 check that then bounced. Additionally, in or about December 2006, Coleman solicited a friend. Coleman falsely told his friend that Coleman planned to pool $1 million from a group of investors to purchase bonds from the U.S. Government and then sell the bonds back to the government after 60 days. Coleman falsely told this friend that a $100,000 investment would generate returns of between $450,000 and $550,000 (450% to 550%). The friend agreed to invest $225,000. To date, this investor has not received any of the promised returns on his investment., The Commission alleged that the Hockey Barn and Coleman violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5. The Commission is seeking temporary restraining orders, and preliminary and permanent injunctions against future violations of these provisions. The Commission is also seeking other expedited relief including an asset freeze and accounting., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2007/comp20180.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20180.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Amerifirst Funding, Inc., Amerifirst Acceptance Corporation, Jeffery C. Bruteyn and Dennis W. Bowden</i> (U.S.D.C., Northern District of Texas, Dallas Division, Civil Action No. 3:07-CV-1188-D)</h2>, <h2>SEC Files Emergency Lawsuit to Halt Fraudulent Securities Offering Targeting Elderly Investors</h2>]","[On July 2, 2007, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed an emergency action in Dallas federal court to halt what the Commission contends is a fraudulent offering of securities, known as Secured Debt Obligations (SDOs), by Amerifirst Funding, Inc. and Amerifirst Acceptance Corporation (together, Amerifirst). The SDOs are notes purportedly secured by automobile financing receivables created or purchased by the defendants. The district court entered, under seal, a temporary restraining order suspending the offering, as well as orders freezing the defendants assets and requiring an accounting and repatriation of assets. The court also appointed a receiver to secure assets for investors, and ordered defendants to preserve documents and submit to expedited discovery. On July 3, 2007, the court unsealed all of the orders., The defendants named in the Commissions Complaint are:, The Commissions Complaint also names two relief defendants, seeking return of investor funds they unjustly received:, The Commissions Complaint alleges that the defendants, directly and through sales agents, have raised at least $35 million since January 2006 from the sale of SDOs to at least 330 investors, many of them senior citizens who, the Commission alleges, were specially targeted by the defendants and their agents as prospective investors. Investors are lured into purchasing SDOs through a series of misrepresentations and omissions that portray SDOs to be as safe as FDIC-backed certificates of deposit. For instance, the defendants offering materials assert that SDOs are guaranteed by a commercial bank and backed by several layers of insurance supposedly provided by Lloyds of London, Firemans Fund and Allianz. As the Commission alleges, the defendants offering materials assert that this insurance coverage is comparable to or better than FDIC insurance. The Commission also alleges that the defendants have represented that they would use investor funds for limited, specially enumerated purposes, such as creating or purchasing automobile financing receivables or placing the funds in government securities or highest-quality corporate bonds. The Complaint outlines other representations by the defendants, such as defendant Bruteyns supposed securities licenses and business experience, all of which are intended to bolster the premise that the SDOs are safe and conservative investments., The Commission alleges, however, that these representations are materially false and misleading. According to the Complaint, the SDOs are fraught with undisclosed risks. For instance, the Commission contends that the SDOs are not guaranteed by any commercial bank and are not insured as represented, if at all. Indeed, according to the Complaint, the Firemans Fund and Allianz coverage represented in the defendants offering materials does not exist and the Lloyds insurance provides only miniscule coverage at best. In addition, the Complaint alleges that the offering materials are wholly silent on Bruteyns checkered history, such as his two Chapter 7 bankruptcy filings (most recently, a no-asset proceeding he filed in 2003) and the National Association of Securities Dealers August 2003 action permanently barring him from associating with any NASD member., Moreover, as detailed in the Complaint, the defendants have misused and misappropriated investor funds. The Complaint alleges, for example, that defendants have used only a relatively small amount of investor funds to create or purchase automobile financing receivables and have almost wholly failed to place any investor money into government securities or highest-quality corporate bonds. Rather, the defendants allegedly have used millions of dollars to make speculative investments in the stock market, including millions invested in high-risk equities options trading and junk-grade corporate bonds. The defendants transferred millions more to Hess Financial, which Bruteyn owns and uses for such personal expenditures as real estate purchases (almost $2.2 million), credit card payments ($160,000), divorce and child support payments ($109,000), luxury cars ($100,000), an airplane ($30,000) and various and sundry other items like country club dues, interior decorating, home improvement, travel, utilities and cash withdrawals (altogether, almost $800,000). Bowden, too, is alleged to have misapplied investor funds, including over $850,000 to purchase and remodel a Dallas home., The defendants are charged with securities fraud under Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and with conducting an unregistered offering under Section 5 of the Securities Act. In addition to the relief granted by the court, the Complaint seeks civil penalties and disgorgement of ill-gotten gains against each defendant., The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Texas State Securities Board and the State of Florida Office of Financial Regulation.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20181.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Hunter</i>, Civil Action No 1:07-CV-0767 (N.D. Ga., filed April 5, 2007).</h2>]","[The Commission announced today that it has amended its previously filed complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia to add fraud charges against Global Online Direct, Inc. (Global), a Nevada corporation headquartered in Union, Oregon, and its principals, Bryant E. Behrmann (Behrmann), of Las Vegas, Nevada, and Larry Buck E. Hunter (Hunter), of La Grande, Oregon., The Commissions original complaint, filed on April 5, 2007, charged Global, Behrmann, and Hunter with conducting an unregistered offering of securities through the offer and sale of interests in Globals Secured Profit Inventory Program (SPIP), in violation of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933.  At the time the original complaint was filed, Global, Behrmann, and Hunter consented to, and the Court ordered, the appointment of Michael A. Grassmueck (Grassmueck) as an independent corporate monitor for Global., On June 4, 2007, the Court issued, also with Defendants consent, an Order expanding Grassmuecks authority to that of a Receiver for Global, and freezing the assets of Global, Behrmann, and Hunter.  The Order requires the Receiver to perform an accounting of the offering and sale of securities by Global, which it termed loans, including the names of all investors and/or lenders, the principal amount invested with and/or loaned to Global by all investors, and the amounts paid by Global to any investors., The Amended Complaint, which was filed on July 3, 2007, charges that, since at least October 2005, Global, Behrmann and Hunter have orchestrated a massive Ponzi scheme and conducted an unregistered offering of securities through Globals SPIP.  Global, Behrmann and Hunter solicited investors to loan Global funds for a term of one year in exchange for promised daily interest payments.  Depending on the amount invested, Global promised effective annual returns of more than 1,800%.  Global purported to generate revenue sufficient to pay investors their promised returns by pooling investor proceeds to purchase distressed inventory, which Global then claimed to resell through various online auction websites, including Ebay and Yahoo! Auctions, as well as through flea markets, street sales and retail storefronts.  From October 2005 through March 2007, Global raised approximately $45 million from more than 9,000 investors., The Amended Complaint further alleges that Global, Behrmann and Hunter failed to disclose to investors that Globals purported business model was wholly incapable of generating the returns promised to investors, and that the vast majority of the returns paid to existing investors were in fact the proceeds invested by later investors - the key hallmark of a Ponzi scheme.  Global, Behrmann, and Hunter also failed to disclose other material information to investors, including that: (a) as of March 2007, Global was more than $30 million in arrears in honoring investor withdrawal requests and owed investors approximately $265 million - an amount more than $250 million in excess of all assets of Global; (b) even though they had promised investors that their investments were secured and backed by actual product inventories, they had taken no steps to secure or tie any individual investment to any actual product inventory, and the total value of the inventory was only a tiny fraction of the investments purportedly secured; (c) Global maintained no effective bookkeeping or accounting systems, and thus were completely incapable of tracking or identifying the amounts invested by investors, the returns paid to investors, the cost of inventory purchased, and the proceeds generated through inventory sales; and (d) state cease-and-desist and injunctive orders for prior violations of securities laws had been entered against Global by the states of Pennsylvania and South Dakota, against Behrmann by the states of North Dakota, Pennsylvania and South Dakota, and against Hunter by the states of Idaho, Illinois, Minnesota, North Dakota, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota and Washington.  Additionally, while representing to investors that Behrmann was an attorney and a former judge, Defendants failed to disclose that his law license had been suspended since 1999 for professional misconduct and that the Idaho Supreme Court had found Behrmann to have engaged in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation in course of his practice of law., The Amended Complaint further alleges that Global, Behrmann and Hunter violated the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and (c) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the Securities Act) and the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.

Lefford further consented to disgorge his trading profits of $31,450, plus prejudgment interest of $3,280, and pay a penalty of $31,450., According to the Commissions complaint filed on September 26, 2006, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Lefford engaged in unlawful insider trading while employed as the house manager for Sillermans South Hampton, New York residence. The Commissions complaint alleges as follows: In the summer of 2004, Sillerman, an entertainment industry entrepreneur, was in the process of negotiating the acquisition of a controlling interest in a publicly-traded company named Sports Entertainment Enterprises, Inc. (SPEA) to use as the vehicle for acquiring the commercial rights to Elvis Presleys name and likeness. Lefford learned material non-public information about Sillermans intended acquisition of SPEA from one or more documents faxed between Sillermans office in Manhattan and his South Hampton residence. On August 12, 2004, Lefford used that information to purchase 5,000 shares of SPEA stock at 12 cents per share. Sillermans acquisition of SPEA and SPEAs concurrent acquisition of the commercial rights to Elvis Presley name and likeness were jointly announced on the morning of December 16, 2004, and SPEA stock closed at $6.41 that day, an increase of over 6,400% from the prior day., For additional information see: Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19845.htm>19845</a> (September 26, 2006),  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20184.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

(Brightpoint) enjoining Harcharik for a period of five years from future violations of the antifraud, books-and-records, and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws and ordering him to pay $50,000 in civil penalties. This final judgment follows a jury verdict on May 25, 2007, in favor of the Commission, rendered after a four-day trial before the Honorable Harold Baer, Jr., United States District Judge for the Southern District of New York. Harcharik played a key role in a fraudulent scheme involving a purported insurance policy that enabled Brightpoint to conceal $11.9 million in losses that it sustained in 1998., In its complaint, filed on September 11, 2003, the Commission alleged that Harcharik and other co-defendants, including John Delaney, Brightpoints former corporate controller, devised and executed an accounting fraud scheme in order to keep escalating losses at Brightpoint within a previously announced range. Specifically, the complaint alleged that Harcharik negotiated and executed a sham insurance policy issued by American International Group, Inc. (AIG) for the sole purpose of allowing Brightpoint to write off these losses as covered by insurance. The complaint further alleged that the purported policy was simply a vehicle that masked a round trip of cash between Brightpoint and AIG, rather than real insurance. As a result of the scheme, Brightpoints pre-tax net income for 1998 was overstated by 61 percent., This was the first case to go to trial involving the fraudulent use of finite insurance. The jury found Harcharik liable for aiding and abetting securities fraud in violation of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and aiding and abetting violations of Exchange Act Section 13(b)(5) (internal controls and books-and-records provision) and Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1 (books-and-records provision)., The final judgment entered against Harcharik concludes the Commissions litigation in this matter. Previously, all of the defendants except Harcharik had agreed to settle the Commissions charges. In connection with the settlements, AIG paid a civil penalty of $10 million, Brightpoint paid a civil penalty of $450,000, Delaney paid a civil penalty of $100,000 and consented to the entry of a Final Judgment that permanently enjoined him from future violations of the securities laws and permanently barred him from serving as an officer or director of any public company, and Brightpoints former chief financial officer, Phillip Bounsall (Bounsall), agreed to pay a civil penalty of $45,000., AIG, Brightpoint and Bounsall also consented to the issuance of separate cease-and-desist orders by the Commission.

The complaint further alleges that in seventeen instances, Kamardin, in his own account, bought shares in the thinly traded issuer just prior to or at the same time that compromised accounts were made to buy shares, creating the false appearance of market activity. Shortly after the intrusions, Kamardin sold all of his shares at the inflated prices. In all but three of these instances, Kamardin realized a profit from his trading, netting a total profit of $82,960., The judgment permanently enjoins Kamardin with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The judgment also orders Kamardin to pay $82,960.16 in disgorgement together with $5,085.50 of prejudgment interest thereon, and $130,000 in civil penalties., The SECs Office of Investor Education and Assistance has previously issued an investor alert available on the SECs website, which provides tips for avoiding becoming a victim of an online intrusion.

Boling of Altamonte Springs, Florida and stock promoter Jeffrey S. Mills of Longwood, Florida pled guilty on July 3, 2007, to federal charges for their roles in the broadcasting of hundreds of thousands of fraudulent vicemail stock tip messages. The messages, which were left on telephone voicemail recording machines throughout the country, were designed to deceive a recipient into believing he had inadvertently received a hot stock tip meant for a close friend of the caller., Roderic Boling and Jeffrey Mills each pled guilty before District Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to one count of securities fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud in connection with the fraudulent vicemail scheme. Anna Boling pled guilty to misprision of a felony for her role in concealing from a grand jury and law enforcement officials her own activities, as well as those of her then-husband., According to the statement of offenses, Mills was hired in July and August 2004 to promote five microcap stocks. Mills recruited Roderic Boling to record and distribute the fraudulent voicemails and together they designed and created the scripts for the messages with the intent of fraudulently inducing prospective investors into purchasing the securities touted in the voicemails at inflated prices. Roderic Boling asked his then-wife Anna Boling to record the fraudulent messages, which she knew would be distributed to hundreds of thousands of persons across the country. After Anna Boling learned that her mother and sister had been subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury, she falsely told them that she had not recorded the messages, and caused her relatives to convey that false information to the grand jury., At sentencing, Roderic Boling and Jeffrey Mills each face a maximum term of imprisonment of 25 years, and a fine of $5,000,000. Anna Boling faces a maximum term of imprisonment of 3 years and a fine of $250,000.

Shanahan, Sr. (Shanahan), the former Chief Executive Officer of Engineered Support Systems, Inc., and his son Michael F. Shanahan, Jr. (Shanahan Jr.), a former member of Engineered Supports Compensation Committee of its Board of Directors, alleging that they participated in a fraudulent scheme in which they granted undisclosed, in-the-money stock options to themselves and to other Engineered Support officers, employees, and directors.  According to the complaint, Engineered Support employees and directors received approximately $20 million in unauthorized and undisclosed compensation as a result of the backdating, $16 million of which was received by top executives and directors. Shanahan personally profited from the backdating scheme by $8,916,562., The complaint alleges that, from 1997 through 2002, Shanahan and Shanahan Jr. approved the issuance of backdated stock options that coincided with historically low closing prices of Engineered Supports common stock.  The companys stock options vested at the time of grant, providing the option recipients with instantly realizable compensation.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, on at least two occasions, Shanahan approved the cancellation and reissuance of previously backdated Engineered Support stock options that had fallen out-of-the-money with new backdated grant dates and exercise prices, in order to bring them back in-the-money.  The complaint also alleges that Shanahan granted additional Engineered Support stock options to non-employee directors in excess of authorized amounts, from which these directors profited by approximately $6 million.  The complaint alleges that Shanahan Jr. profited by $379,738 from the receipt of unauthorized stock options., As part of the scheme, Shanahan and Shanahan Jr. allegedly caused Engineered Support to misrepresent in its Forms 10-K, proxy statements, and registration statements filed with the Commission that all stock options had been and would be granted at the fair market value of the Companys common stock on the date of the award.  The complaint also alleges that Engineered Support failed to report the additional compensation its executives had received through in-the-money option grants, and that the Company failed to disclose the repricing of options that had fallen out-of-the-money, or the granting of stock options to non-employee directors in excess of authorized amounts., The Commissions complaint alleges that Shanahan and Shanahan Jr. violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Sections 10(b) and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Rules 10b-5 and 14a-9 thereunder, and aided and abetted violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1 and 12b-20 thereunder.

Kelly, engaged in the unregistered sale of Tasty Fries securities.  Tasty Fries, aided and abetted by Edward Kelly, also committed reporting, record keeping and internal control violations., The Commissions complaint alleges that between 2001 and 2005, Edward Kelly, on four occasions, improperly attempted to increase the number of authorized shares of Tasty Fries stock.  As a result, since 2001, the company issued over 78 million more shares of common stock than its articles of incorporation authorized, and incorrectly accounted for its issuances of common stock in its financial statements.  Since January 2002, all of the companys financial statements filed with its annual and periodic reports are materially misstated.  The complaint further alleges that between 2002 and 2004, Tasty Fries and Edward Kelly also made materially false and misleading statements in press releases and in Commission filings relating to the development and production status of a French fry vending machine that Tasty Fries was developing.  Edward Kelly improperly profited by $32,925 from such statements as the result of improper trading in Tasty Fries stock.  The complaint alleges that this conduct violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder., The Commissions complaint also alleges that Tasty Fries, Edward Kelly, and Louis Kelly engaged in improper unregistered offers and sales of Tasty Fries common stock by compensating advisors and consultants with common stock in sales that the company did not effectively register.  Tasty Fries used this stock to pay consultants and advisors who either did not provide bona fide services to Tasty Fries or provided promotional and investor relations services.  In three such instances, Louis Kelly, an attorney licensed in Pennsylvania, authored the legal opinions that the company filed with its ineffective registration statements.  The complaint further alleges that Tasty Fries and Edward Kelly also engaged in improper unregistered sales of Tasty Fries common stock by engaging in so-called gypsy swaps in which they arranged for shareholders to sell purportedly nonrestricted Tasty Fries stock to others, in exchange for which Tasty Fries ultimately received all or some of the stock purchase price, and the selling shareholders received from the company new restricted shares, which sometimes included extra bonus shares provided as an inducement for the shareholders to sell their purportedly nonrestricted stock.  The complaint alleges that this conduct violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act., The Commissions complaint further alleges that Tasty Fries, aided and abetted by Edward Kelly, has failed to make filings with the Commission of required annual, quarterly and current reports; to make and keep books, records, and accounts that accurately and fairly reflect Tasty Fries transactions and dispositions of Tasty Fries assets; and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls.  As a result, Tasty Fries, aided and abetted by Edward Kelly, violated Sections 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 15(d) of the Exchange Act and Rules 15d-1, 15d-11, 15d-13, and 12b-20, promulgated thereunder.

Meltzer was charged in a previously-filed action with securities fraud in connection with his stock-related spamming activities. Meltzer consented to the entry of the final judgment, without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions complaint, except as to jurisdiction., The Complaint, filed February 18, 2003, alleged that Meltzer, a professional Internet spammer, used the Internet to commit securities fraud. In return for compensation from stock promoters and issuers, Meltzer sent millions of unsolicited emails and created numerous websites to promote various penny stocks. In order to conceal his identity — and to avoid the detection of web hosts seeking to stop Internet spam — Meltzer operated under at least thirty different assumed Internet identities., The SECs Complaint alleged that Meltzers spam and websites made false and misleading representations about the stock he helped to promote. Meltzer falsely stated that his recommendations represented his own investment opinions based on his review of the issuers public filings and his interviews with the issuers management. In fact, Meltzer did not review the issuers filings, did not interview their management, and simply republished recommendations and representations that he received from the promoters who had hired him. Those promoters received, in some instances, many more shares of stock than Meltzer did, a fact that Meltzer chose not to disclose. Also, in his emails and websites, Meltzer knowingly or recklessly made false and misleading representations concerning the issuers current business and projections of future performance that had no reasonable basis in fact. Between 1998 and 2001, Meltzer touted the stocks of at least twelve issuers and received at nearly $160,000 in stock and cash as ill-gotten gains as a result of his fraudulent conduct., The final judgment against Meltzer permanently enjoins Meltzer from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5. The judgment also imposes a penny stock bar against Meltzer. In addition, Meltzer was ordered to pay disgorgement in the amount of $159,619.62 with prejudgment interest in the amount of 89,045.70, for a total of $248,665.32, but payment was waived for the amount exceeding $25,000, and civil penalties were not imposed, based on Meltzers sworn representations regarding his financial condition.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20198.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

According to the Complaint, Materna and Holtzhauser engaged in accounting fraud by recording and directing numerous adjustments to the consolidated financials (top-side adjustments), which were wholly unsupported and often duplicative of entries already recorded at the operating unit level. The Complaint alleges that Venesky made improper accounting entries at OMG Americas. According to the Complaint, the improper accounting practices were done with the intent to manage earnings. The scheme resulted in the filing of materially false and misleading financial statements in the companys annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2002, and in the companys quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the first three quarters of 2002, and the fourth quarter results on Form 10-K, and the first three quarters of 2003 filed on Form 10-Q. In March 2005, after conducting an internal investigation, OM Group issued a restatement reducing its retained earnings for the relevant period by $64 million as a result of the fraud. The Commissions Complaint charges Materna and Holtzhauser with violating, among others, the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. The Commissions Complaint charges Venesky with aiding and abetting violations of the antifraud provisions, among others. On July 18, 2007, the Commission issued a settled cease-and-desist order that finds that OM Group violated the antifraud, reporting, books and records, and internal controls provisions. OM Group produces value-added, metal based specialty chemicals and related materials., According to the Commissions Complaint:, At the end of each quarter and fiscal year, OM Group consolidated the financial statements of its operating entities into one consolidated financial statement, which was reported on OM Groups Forms 10-K and 10-Q. During the close process, Holtzhauser and Materna made more than 700 top-side adjustments to OM Groups consolidated financial statement. The adjustments were across the divisions and the support for the adjustments was either inadequate or did not exist. Many of the improper accounting practices included, among other things, overcapitalizing overhead costs, inflated inventory recovery yields, improper supplier receivables and interest receivables, duplicating entries already made at the operating unit level, recording inaccurate inventory estimates, and recording expenses out of period. Venesky, the Controller of OMG Americas, was responsible for consolidating OMG Americas financial results. Venesky used inaccurate estimates to record inventory. More often than not, Veneskys estimates increased following feedback from Holtzhauser and Materna., E-mails reflect the intent to adjust numbers to meet earnings targets or to enhance OM Groups performance. E-mails also show that there was a concerted effort by Materna, Holtzhauser, and Venesky to conceal material information from auditors. In one e-mail, Venesky wrote to Materna and Holtzhauser that My concern about inventory is that going too heavy in WIP [work-in-process] or others will trigger even greater scrutiny. Truth is, we have a fresh set of auditors, and I have no idea how much conversational auditing this group will take. The documents also reflect a pattern of recording almost random round numbers to journal entries to try to manage earnings, and to look for other candidates, i.e., other accounting categories in which to make more adjustments. In addition, certain journal entries were made at locations that auditors would not likely visit during audits. During the relevant period, OM Group did not have an adequate system of internal controls that would detect and prevent the improper accounting practices., Materna and Holtzhauser, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, each consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining each from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, and Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder, and aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder; imposes a $100,000 civil penalty; and a five-year officer-and-director bar; and consented to the issuance of an order imposing a five-year 102(e) suspension. Holtzhauser will also pay disgorgement of $76,707. Venesky, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from aiding and abetting violations of Section 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder, and violating Rules 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder, and imposing a $25,000 civil penalty; and consented to the issuance of an order imposing a three-year 102(e) suspension. OM Group consented, without admitting or denying the findings by the Commission, to an order to cease-and-desist from committing any future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder., The Commission considered remedial acts promptly undertaken by OM Group and cooperation afforded the Commission staff., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2007/comp20199.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>; <a href=/litigation/admin/2007/33-8826.pdf>Administrative Proceeding 33-8826</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20199.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Davis (Davis), Lucre Fund, LLC (Lucre Fund), JTA Enterprises, Inc. (JTA Enterprises), William H. Clark (Clark), Level Par Investments, LLC (Level Par), Kelly G. Rogers (Rogers), Sterling Meridian LLC (Sterling Meridian), Ronald J. Linn (Linn), Glenn Maske (Maske) and William F. Dippolito (Dippolito).  In its complaint, the Commission alleges that the defendants engaged in fraudulent conduct in connection with three related high-yield investment securities offerings.  Between September 2005 and April 2006, Davis through his Atlanta-based company, Global Finance, raised a total of $9.9 million from over 100 investors located throughout the United States.  As part of Daviss offering, two of his facilitators, Clark and Rogers, conducted separate fraudulent offerings and forwarded the proceeds of their offerings to Davis., According to the complaint, Davis falsely represented that Global Finances investment program would earn returns ranging from 25 percent per month to 90 percent per week.  Davis also claimed that the funds were safe because they would be deposited into an escrow account maintained by Dippolito, an attorney.  Based on Daviss claims, Global Finance received a total of $9.9 million from Clark ($4 million), Rogers ($4.7 million) and another investor ($1.2 million).  The Commission also alleges that JTA Enterprises and Lucre Fund, which are controlled by Clark (Denville, New Jersey), received investment proceeds from at least 65 investors raised by Linn and Maske through their entity, Sterling Meridian (Yorba Linda, California); Linn and Maske told the investors that they had access to legitimate high yield investments paying monthly returns of 18 to 20 percent., The complaint also alleges that Rogers, through Level Par (Frisco, Texas), solicited 35 investors by representing that his investment, purportedly involving the trading of bank debentures, was totally secure and paid weekly returns of 25 percent.  According to the Commissions complaint, the investment programs were shams and the investors funds were used for purposes other than investments, including the personal use of the promoters., Finally, the Commission alleges that Dippolito, a Tacoma, Washington lawyer, acting as escrow agent and using the title paymaster, promised he would secure the funds until Davis notified him that Global Finance would purchase an investment.  Instead, Dippolito disbursed the funds to persons he knew were prior investors, for which he received a percentage-based fee., The Commission also names in its complaint, as relief defendants, USAssets &amp; Funding Corp. (Littleton, Colorado), Nevada Sentry Service Corp. (Milwaukee, Wisconsin), Wells Ventures LLC (Tucson, Arizona), Triquestra Management Corp. (Dallas, Texas) and CMR Mngt. Group, LLC (West Trenton, New Jersey)., The Commission alleges in its complaint that defendants Global Finance, Davis, JTA Enterprises, Lucre Fund, Clark, Level Par, Rogers, Sterling Meridian, Linn and Maske each violated Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.   The Commission also alleges that Dippolito aided and abetted Daviss violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Commission further alleges that Clark, Linn and Maske violated Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act for acting as a securities broker without having been registered with the Commission., The Commission is seeking against each of the defendants a permanent injunction and an accounting.  The Commission is also seeking against each of the defendants, with the exception of Level Par, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest and a civil money penalty.  Rogers consented to the entry of an injunction against him without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations.

Libman</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that today it filed a civil action in the United States District Court for the Central District of California against Alan D. Libman (Libman) alleging that Libman engaged in the fraudulent offer and sale of securities.  As alleged in the complaint, Libman offered investors the opportunity to invest in purported celebrity-related and historical memorabilia and artwork through a non-existent entity called Investment Strategies.  As alleged, the investments offered and sold by Libman were securities because they qualify as investment contracts under the federal securities laws., The Commission alleges that Libman made numerous material misrepresentations to investors regarding the investments.  For example, Libman often promised specific, large rates of return over brief periods.  As alleged, Libman eventually stopped paying his investors the promised returns, evaded contact with them, and fled to Canada.  The Commission alleges that, instead of using the investors funds as he promised, Libman used their money for other purposes, including to cover his personal expenses and life style.  According to the complaint, since the investments did not yield the claimed returns, investors lost most of their investments.  As alleged, from 2000 through 2004, Libmans false representations led at least twenty investors to give him more than $1 million for the schemes that he carried out through Investment Strategies.  According to the complaint, Libman, by soliciting investors, negotiating over investment terms, and representing that he would accept compensation for his efforts from the investment proceeds, acted as an unregistered broker.  Libman also failed to register with the Commission any of the securities that he offered and sold to investors., The complaint alleges that Libman violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Sections 10(b), 15(a)(1), and 15(b)(6)(B)(i) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5.  The Commission seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  The Commission also seeks a court order requiring Libman to provide an accounting for the receipt and disposition of all investor funds and an order requiring Libman to comply with an administrative broker-dealer bar order previously entered against him., Libman has been the subject of prior Commission action.  On May 26, 1992, in a settled action that the Commission brought, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California enjoined Libman permanently from violating and/or aiding and abetting violations of the antifraud, securities registration, and other provisions of federal securities laws including, specifically, Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act  15(c)(2), and 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 10b-9, 15c2-4, 17a-3, and 17a-4.

On February 4, 1994, pursuant to a settlement with Libman, the Commission issued an Order permanently barring Libman from association with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, investment company, or municipal securities dealer based on the prior entry of the injunction against him.  See In the Matter of Alan D. Libman, Admin. Proc. File No. 3-7803 (February 4, 1994)., On November 7, 2006, a Grand Jury sitting in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California indicted Libman on multiple counts of mail fraud and money laundering.  See United States v. Libman, 06 CR 835 (C.D. Cal., November 7, 2006).

(Molecular) and, along with his wife, used that information to trade in Molecular securities ahead of the mergers public announcement. The Ontario Securities Commission also brought its own separate enforcement action today to address this conduct., The SEC alleges that Shane Bashir Suman, 34, of Toronto, learned about secret merger negotiations through access he had to electronic data in his job as an information technology specialist at MDS, then gave that information to his wife, Monie Rahman, 36. In the days before the tender offer became publicly known, Suman and Rahman made just over $1 million by trading in the securities of Molecular., The SECs complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that Sumans job gave him access to a vast amount of secret corporate information. In particular, Suman was able to read the contents of confidential e-mails and other electronic data without detection. For example, the circumstances in which Suman was called to restore an electronic document on Jan. 23, 2007, the day before he and his wife started trading, suggested the code name for the MDS-Molecular merger and the sensitivity associated with that project. Later that day, Suman conducted Internet searches for both that code name and for Molecular Devices. Just after running those searches, Suman called Rahman and spoke to her for 100 minutes, much longer than their phone records indicate they usually spoke., Between Jan. 24 and Jan. 26, 2007, Suman and Rahman bought 12,000 Molecular shares and 900 Molecular call options. Brokerage account records indicate that a portion of the Molecular securities purchases were financed with a margin loan of approximately $200,000, and the couple previously did not have a position in Molecular securities. On Jan. 29, 2007, MDS and Molecular jointly announced the tender offer for Moleculars shares. The stock price immediately rose from almost $24 to roughly $35, making Rahman and Sumans trades worth more than $1 million., Suman and Rahman are both Canadian citizens, though Rahman has lived in Logan, Utah, since June 2006.

The Commissions complaints, each filed in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado, allege that John C. Charters, Expanets former chief executive officer, and Richard E. Fresia, Expanets former chief financial officer, overstated the performance of Expanets in 2002 during the same period that NorthWestern completed securities offerings totaling more than $800 million.  The Commissions complaints further allege that, after restating its financial results for the first three quarters of 2002, and disclosing Expanets true financial position and results of operations, NorthWestern declared bankruptcy in 2003., The Commission alleges that, in NorthWesterns quarterly filings, debt and equity offering filings, and other public information, Charters and Fresia were responsible for overstating the performance of and concealing problems at Expanets.  The Commission alleges that each defendant knew or was reckless in not knowing that Expanets had failed to take appropriate charges for uncollectible accounts receivable and billing adjustments related to the implementation of Expanets new computer system, resulting in the overstatement of NorthWesterns income from continuing operations by 90% in the second quarter of 2002 and 109% in the third quarter of 2002.  The Commission also alleges that each defendant was responsible for NorthWesterns failure to disclose that a material portion of Expanets income was derived from the reduction of various accounting reserves and through Expanets receipt of unusual non-compete payments., The Commissions complaints charge Charters and Fresia with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.

Mikula, age 21, of Athens, Ga., Gabriel J. Frankewich, age 29, of Byron, Ga., New Millenium Enterpreneurs, LLC, and Phoenixsurf.com. alleges that under the purported program, to receive the promised return, investors had to purchase advertising and view at least 15 web pages of advertising per day during the 8 day period. Although the defendants represented that they would pay the promised returns with funds received from investors and other businesses/programs within the NME/Phoenix network, they operated Phoenixsurf.com primarily as a pure Ponzi scheme — using for the most part only new investor funds to pay the promised returns to existing investors. The complaint alleges that the defendants paid investors $36.7 million, almost all of which came from advertising purchases from new investments in the scheme., To settle the Commissions charges, the defendants consented, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, to a judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act.

The fraudulent practices alleged involved the misuse of corporate reserves to manipulate reported earnings in fiscal year 1999 and a scheme at its former subsidiary, United Agri-Products (UAP), in 2000 that involved, among other things, improper and premature revenue recognition.  Additionally, the complaint alleges that between fiscal years 2002 and 2005, ConAgras corporate tax department made numerous tax errors, causing the company to improperly account for tax benefits and understate its income tax expense.   Between the first quarter of fiscal year 1999 and the third quarter of fiscal year 2001 ConAgra misstated its reported income before income taxes by nearly $218.5 million.  As a result of the income tax errors, ConAgra misstated its reported income tax expense by $105 million., The complaint alleges varied misconduct that includes the following:, <b>Misuse of Reserves</b>, <b>Fraudulent Scheme at UAP</b>, <b>Misleading Disclosure</b>, <b>Income Tax Errors</b>, The complaint alleges that, without engaging in the improper and at times fraudulent accounting practices, ConAgra would have missed the Wall Street analysts consensus estimates of the companys earnings per share for at least six of eleven fiscal quarters in fiscal years 1999, 2000 and 2001.  As a result of the conduct described above, ConAgra materially misstated its financial performance in earnings releases and in periodic reports filed with the Commission.  Other financial misstatements of ConAgra during this time include a registration statement filed with the Commission.  ConAgra has restated its financial results for the years 1999 through 2005., To settle the charges, ConAgra has agreed to pay a $45 million penalty, which the SEC will seek to place into a Fair Fund for distribution to harmed investors.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, ConAgra agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud, reporting, books and records and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws (Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10-b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13).

Schroeder, alleging that they engaged in an illicit scheme to backdate stock option grants., The Commission alleges that, since 1997, KLA concealed more than $200 million in stock option compensation by providing employees and executives with potentially lucrative in-the-money options while secretly backdating the grants to avoid reporting the expenses to investors.  The Commission further alleges that Schroeder, of Los Altos Hills, Calif., repeatedly backdated options between 1999 and 2002, and once in 2005 - even after he received advice from company counsel that retroactively selecting grant dates without adequate disclosure was improper., The Commissions complaint against KLA, filed in federal district court in San Jose, Calif., alleges that former company executives routinely used hindsight to issue options to employees priced at or near KLAs lowest stock price of the preceding weeks.  Although pricing the options below current prices required the company to report a compensation charge under well-settled accounting principles, former KLA officials avoided reporting the charges by falsely documenting that the options had been granted on an earlier date. The backdated grants resulted in materially misleading disclosures, with the Company overstating its net income in fiscal years 1998 through 2005 by as much as 156 percent., In a separate complaint filed against Schroeder, the Commission charges that he repeatedly engaged in backdating after becoming CEO in 1999, including pricing large awards of options to himself that were in the money by millions of dollars - a potential windfall never disclosed to KLA-Tencors shareholders.  According to the complaint, Schroeder received a legal memorandum in March 2001 cautioning that the Board and its committees are limited in their ability to grant options at a retroactive price without exposing the company to risk of an accounting charge.  The memo further warned that [a]ny attempt to set a price before such a grant is made raises substantial risks under securities and tax laws [and] accounting rules and gives rise to disclosure obligations.  The Commission alleges that Schroeder nonetheless continued to backdate options., KLA-Tencor, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, agreed to settle the matter by consenting to a permanent injunction from further violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13 thereunder., Schroeder is charged with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b), 13(b)(5), and 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, 13b2-1, 13b2-2, and 16a-3 thereunder, and Schroeder is charged with aiding and abetting violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13, and 14a-9 thereunder.

Mass.)</h2>, <h2>SEC Charges Former Chairman and CEO of Brooks Automation, Inc. with Securities Fraud and Reporting Violations in Stock Option Backdating Scheme</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced the filing of a civil securities fraud action against Robert J. Therrien of Osterville, Massachusetts, former President and CEO of Brooks Automation, Inc., a Chelmsford, Massachusetts software company, alleging that Therrien received millions of dollars in undisclosed compensation when he fraudulently backdated his exercise of an option to purchase company stock and engaged in a scheme to manipulate grants of stock options in order to provide Brooks employees and executives, including himself, with more lucrative in-the-money options, while avoiding having to inform shareholders of the millions of dollars in resulting compensation expense.  According to the complaint, Therrien engaged in the scheme to grant in-the-money options by falsifying company records to create the false appearance that the options actually had been granted at a lower market price on an earlier date.  The complaint alleges that Therrien personally benefited by over $10 million from his fraudulent conduct., According to the complaint, Therrien engaged in a scheme in which Brooks granted in-the-money options (which had exercise prices below the stocks market price on the day of the grant, giving the recipient an immediate paper gain) to himself and other employees, but backdated them to make it appear that the options were at-the-money (with an exercise price the same as the stocks market price on the day of the grant).  Under applicable accounting principles, Brooks did not need to record an expense in its financial statements for grants of at-the-money options, but was required to record an expense for any in-the-money options.  Accordingly, the complaint alleges, by backdating the options, Therrien and Brooks concealed millions of dollars in compensation expenses incurred in the option grants.  As a result of the transactions alleged in the complaint, Brooks financial statements allegedly overstated income and understated employee compensation expenses by at least $54 million during the period from 1999 through 2005.  After the backdating of stock option grants was discovered, Brooks announced in July 2006 that it was restating its financial results for the fiscal years 1996 through 2005 to record additional cumulative compensation expense of $64.5 million reflecting all options grants., The complaint alleges that Therrien received approximately $5.8 million in undisclosed compensation from a single options transaction that was falsely reported.  That transaction allegedly took place in November 1999, after Therrien learned that an option he held to purchase 225,000 shares at approximately 10% of Brooks market price had expired unexercised the previous August.  Therrien allegedly signed false documents in November 1999 resulting in the issuance of a new in-the-money option to him at the original price, which he immediately exercised to purchase 225,000 shares of Brooks stock at a fraction of its current market price.  According to the complaint, as a result of his fraudulent exercise, Therrien received approximately $5.8 million in undisclosed compensation from Brooks.  The complaint alleges that Brooks and Therrien falsely reported this transaction in Commission filings as an option exercise that had occurred the prior August and failed to report Therriens compensation from the issuance of the new option., The Commissions complaint describes several instances of company-wide option grants with purported grant dates that Therrien allegedly knew were backdated and in which he personally received backdated options.  For example, the complaint alleges that he knew that option grants with a purported date of October 1, 2001 in fact were not finalized until November 30, 2001.  During that period the price of Brooks stock rose by more than $11 per share, so that the backdating produced immediate compensation to its recipients totaling over $22 million, which Brooks failed to disclose in its financial reports.  Therrien personally benefited by $1 million from this instance of backdating., The complaint alleges that by his conduct Therrien violated the general antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, and provisions that prohibit falsifying records,  making materially misleading filings with the Commission, and making misrepresentations to accountants, including Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 10(b), 13(b)(5), 14(a), and 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, 13b2-1, 13b2-2, 14a-9 and 16a-3 thereunder, and that he aided and abetted Brooks uncharged violations of financial reporting, recordkeeping and internal controls requirements, including Exchange Act Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder., The Commissions action seeks injunctive relief, a civil penalty, disgorgement and an officer and director bar against Therrien., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2007/comp20210.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  ]"

For Fraudulent Earnings and Revenue Management Scheme</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a civil action against Cardinal Health, Inc. (Cardinal), a pharmaceutical distribution company based in Dublin, Ohio, in which Cardinal agreed to pay $35 million to settle charges that it engaged in a nearly four-year long fraudulent revenue and earnings management scheme, as well as other improper accounting and disclosure practices., The Commissions complaint alleges that, from September 2000 through March 2004, Cardinal engaged in this conduct in order to present a false picture of its operating results to the financial community and the investing public - one that matched Cardinals publicly disseminated earnings guidance and analysts expectations, rather than its true economic performance.  Through these practices, Cardinal materially overstated its operating revenue, earnings and growth trends in certain earnings releases and filings with the Commission., According to the complaint, Cardinal managed its reported revenue and earnings through a variety of undisclosed and improper actions. Cardinal inflated reported operating revenue by misclassifying more than $5 billion of bulk sales as operating revenue.  As detailed in the complaint, Cardinal classified its revenue from drug distribution as either bulk revenue, which consisted of certain full case quantities of pharmaceutical products delivered to customer warehouses, or operating revenue, which consisted of all other sales.  The complaint alleges that Cardinal implemented an undisclosed internal practice under which it reclassified any revenue from the sale of bulk product held on its premises for 24 hours or longer as operating revenue.  Shortly thereafter, as the complaint describes, Cardinal began intentionally holding certain bulk shipments for longer than 24 hours, in order to shift revenue from the bulk revenue line to the operating revenue line and fraudulently inflate its operating revenue and operating revenue growth rates in certain quarters (the 24-Hour Lever).  Cardinal used the 24-Hour Lever along with other revenue and earnings management practices to fraudulently overstate its operating results., According to the complaint, Cardinal managed its reported earnings by:, In addition, the complaint alleges that Cardinal failed timely to disclose the impact of a change in the method of applying its last-in-first-out (LIFO) inventory valuation accounting principle and, on one occasion, intentionally transferred inventory within business units in order to avoid a negative LIFO impact on year-end reported earnings.  Furthermore, the complaint alleges that Cardinal prematurely recognized millions of dollars in revenue from Pyxis, a wholly-owned subsidiary it featured as an important growth driver., The terms of the settlement reflect, and the Commission acknowledges, the cooperation provided by Cardinal during the course of the SEC investigation.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions complaint, Cardinal has consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it from violating: the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5; the reporting provisions of the Exchange Act, Section 13(a) and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13; and the record-keeping and internal controls provisions of the Exchange Act, Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B).

New York Partnership Exchange advertised its broker-dealer services and solicited customers through a website and various print advertisements., Moreover, the complaint alleges that from 1999 through August 2006, the defendants defrauded customers of their trading proceeds by misrepresenting that their trades were delayed and by improperly withholding portions of payments due sellers.

(ISSI) and its former Chief Financial Officer, Gary L. Fischer, alleging that they engaged in a long-running fraudulent scheme to backdate stock option grants.  The Commission alleges that ISSI and Fischer concealed millions of dollars of stock option compensation expenses by providing executives and employees with potentially lucrative in-the-money options while backdating the grants to avoid reporting the expenses to investors.  Both Fischer, of Santa Clara, Calif., and ISSI, settled the matter without admitting or denying the Commissions charges., The Commissions complaint against ISSI and Fischer, filed in the Northern District of California, alleges that Fischer routinely used hindsight to select option grant dates when ISSIs stock traded at or near monthly or quarterly lows, and at prices below the closing price on the date when Fischer actually selected the grant date.  According to the complaint, the dates Fischer selected were then incorporated into Stock Option Committee resolutions and Compensation Committee minutes, even though the committees rarely, if ever, met on the date listed on the minutes and resolutions., Pricing the options below current prices would have required the company to report a compensation expense under well-settled accounting principles.  By falsely documenting that the options had been granted on an earlier date, ISSI avoided reporting the expenses in its financial statements.  The complaint alleges that the backdated grants resulted in materially misleading disclosures, with the company overstating its actual net income (as restated) or understating its actual net loss (as restated) in fiscal years 1997 through 2005, including a 528 percent overstatement of actual net income in fiscal year 2004.  The Commission further alleges that Fischer personally benefited from the backdating scheme.  Fischer received backdated options which he later exercised to reap undisclosed profits., Fischer, without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions complaint, agreed to settle the matter by consenting to a permanent injunction against violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), 13(b)(5), 14(a) and 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b 5, 13a-14, 12b-20, 13a 1, 13a 11, 13a-13, 13b2 1, 13b2 2, 14a-9 and 16a 3 thereunder, paying $414,830 in disgorgement and interest, and a $125,000 civil penalty, and consenting to an order barring him for five years from acting as an officer or director of a public company., ISSI, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, agreed to settle the matter by consenting to a permanent injunction against violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B) and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rules 10b-5, 12b 20, 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13 and 14a-9 thereunder., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2007/comp20219.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  ]"

According to the Commission, Lavin, 41, of Woodinville, Wash., promised investors extraordinary returns of 18 to 36 percent per year from the GAP investments.  Far from producing the promised returns, the Commissions complaint alleges that Lavin used investor funds to pay for personal expenses for himself and his friends, including lavish trips, automobiles, a Seattle Mariners luxury skybox, and real estate in Costa Rica.  Lavin also diverted investor funds to a now-bankrupt Texas real estate project known as Wildflower Resort Company., The complaint alleges that Lavin told investors that their money would be placed into funds managed by GAP, where it would be invested in foreign currencies and asset-backed securities.  Instead, Lavin converted the investors money to his own use.  In addition, as in a classic Ponzi scheme, Lavin used money raised from new investors to pay purported returns to previous investors.  The Commission further claims that Lavin sent false account statements to GAPs investors showing ever-increasing account balances based upon accumulation of the promised returns.  In reality, according to the complaint, the GAP funds never made any money and Lavin fabricated the account balances on the statements to fool investors into believing their investments were profitable and to induce them to make additional investments., The Commissions complaint, filed in federal district court in Seattle, seeks to enjoin Lavin and GAP from future violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws [Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act.

Specifically, the Commissions complaint alleges that, by selecting these highly favorable dates and causing options to be granted on dates when she knew the options were already in-the-money, Argo created an opportunity for herself and other executives and employees at SafeNet to reap substantial profits.  Argo then backdated documents to conceal from SafeNets investors that SafeNet was issuing in-the-money option grants., According to the complaint, Argo was aware that SafeNet routinely granted in-the-money options, and she knowingly or recklessly failed to cause SafeNet to record compensation expense as required by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).  Consequently, SafeNet reported materially misstated financial results for periods beginning in late-2000 through early-2006.

Specifically, the Complaint alleges that Joe Frohnas brother, with whom Joe Frohna had a relationship of trust and confidence, was the leader of a bio-equivalence study for a drug being developed by XOMA and Genentech, Inc.

The Bio-Equivalence Study was one of the keys to XOMAs stock value because bio-equivalence needed to be established for FDA approval and for this drug to be sold to the general public. Joe Frohna knew this information. On April 3, 2002, Joe Frohnas brother learned that the Bio-Equivalence study was unsuccessful. Later that same day, Joe Frohna called his brother and learned that the Bio-Equivalency Study was unsuccessful.

Cal.)</h2>, <h2>SEC Charges British Trader With Making Over $3 Million in Illicit Profits Through Insider Trading Involving Call Options and Derivative Spread Bets</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that it filed an amended complaint in federal court in San Diego on August 1, 2007, charging Taher Suterwalla, 30, of London, England, with insider trading in the securities of Petco. The amended complaint alleges that in the three weeks preceding Petcos acquisition announcement, Suterwalla purchased Petco call options from a Swiss financial institution, which filled Suterwallas orders by purchasing Petco call options in the United States. The options generally were out of the money, representing a bet that the price of Petco stock would rise substantially, and were set to expire within weeks of the purchase date, representing a bet that the price rise would happen soon. The amended complaint further alleges that Suterwalla purchased from brokerage houses in the United Kingdom certain derivative instruments known as spread bets, which caused the brokers to purchase Petco common stock and options in the United States., The amended complaint alleges that Suterwalla entered into the transactions while aware of material nonpublic information regarding the pending acquisition of Petco, and that he took highly leveraged and speculative positions in the price of Petcos securities, which exposed him to the potential for millions of dollars in losses if Petcos price declined. The amended complaint further alleges that Suterwalla made all of his purchases within 17 days of Petcos acquisition announcement, that he made a number of his purchases the day before the announcement, and that his illicit profit from these transactions was more than $3 million., On July 18, 2006, the United States District Court for the Southern District of California entered a temporary restraining order freezing assets of certain then-unknown purchasers of call options for the common stock of Petco and prohibiting the unknown purchasers from obtaining the options or the proceeds from the sale of the options. In addition to freezing approximately $862,000 in assets, the court issued orders that provide for expedited discovery and prohibit the defendants from destroying evidence. On August 4, 2006, the court entered a preliminary injunction that extended the temporary restraining order and asset freeze. In amending the complaint, the Commission identified Suterwalla as a defendant who had been described as one or more unknown purchasers of Petco securities in the initial complaint., The Commission alleges that Suterwalla engaged in insider trading in violation of the antifraud provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Commission is seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest thereon, and the imposition of civil penalties., For more information, see Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19778.htm>19778</a> (July 27, 2006)., The Commission acknowledges the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the United Kingdom Financial Services Authority, the Swiss Federal Banking Commission, and the Ontario Securities Commission for their continuing assistance in this matter., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2007/comp20224.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20224.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Jerry K. Castleman and Kathleen M. Lynn</i>, Civil Action No. 06-3226 (Werlein) (S.D. Tex.)</h2>, <h2>SEC Settles Civil Fraud Charges Against Two Former Enron Executives</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) announced today that on August 2, 2007, the U.S. District Court in Houston entered final judgments in the Commissions civil action against Jerry K. Castleman, a former Enron executive and accountant, and Kathleen M. Lynn, a former Enron executive. , In its complaint filed on October 13, 2006, the Commission alleged that Castleman, Lynn, and others participated in a transaction that defrauded Enrons security holders to enrich themselves and others. The complaint also alleged that the defendants conduct involved both the closing of a sham sale pursuant to which Enron manufactured earnings, and the later unwinding of this sham sale by Enron repurchasing the asset without reversing the previously (and improperly) recognized earnings. The sham sale manipulated Enrons publicly-reported earnings, which resulted in Enron filing materially false and misleading financial statements in the companys annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal years ended December 31, 1999 and 2000, and in the companys quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the third quarter of fiscal year 1999, the first three quarters of fiscal year 2000, and the first two quarters of fiscal year 2001., Specifically, the Commissions complaint alleged, among other things, that Enron sold an interest in a troubled power project in Cuiaba, Brazil to a related party called LJM Cayman, LP (LJM1), controlled by Enrons then Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Fastow (the selldown). Through the selldown, Enron South America (ESA), an Enron subsidiary, deconsolidated its interest in the project and Enron recognized earnings from related gas supply contracts. Enron and ESA needed these earnings to meet earnings estimates for the third and fourth quarters of 1999. In conformity with relevant accounting rules, deconsolidation and recognition were not appropriate, because the seller (Enron) did not transfer to the buyer (LJM1) the usual risks and rewards of ownership, in that the selldown included an oral side agreement that LJM1 would not lose money on its Cuiaba investment (the side agreement). The side agreement was neither memorialized in the deal documents nor disclosed to Enrons auditor. In 2001, to satisfy the side agreement, Enron bought back LJM1s interest without reversing the previously (and improperly) recognized earnings. In addition, Enron paid LJM1 a profit, despite the poor economics of the project., Castleman and Lynn each consented to the final judgments without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint. They each agreed to be enjoined permanently from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1, and from aiding and abetting violations of Exchange Act Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13. Castleman also agreed to be enjoined permanently from violating Exchange Act Rule13b2-2. Lynns judgment orders her to pay nominal disgorgement of $1 and a civil penalty of $30,000. Castlemans judgment orders him to pay $41,268.29, consisting of disgorgement of $30,000 and prejudgment interest of $11,268.29, with all but $12,000 waived, based upon Castlemans sworn financial statements and other documents submitted to the Commission. The Commission intends to have the disgorgement and civil penalty amounts paid into a court account pursuant to the Fair Fund provisions of Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 for ultimate distribution to victims of the fraud., In settlement of this action, Castleman also consented to the entry of an Administrative Order, pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the Commissions Rules of Practice, suspending him from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant, with a right to apply for reinstatement after five years., For additional information see Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19865.htm>19865</a>, October 13, 2006.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20225.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Tether in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida. Until August 2004, Tether was the chief executive officer and a director of Solomon Technologies, Inc., a Florida corporation. Solomons securities have been registered with the Commission since January 2004. The Commissions complaint alleges that in April 2004, Tether fraudulently misrepresented his beneficial ownership of Solomon stock in Solomons amended annual report filed on Form 10-KSB/A for the year ended December 31, 2003. Specifically, the complaint alleges that Tether transferred 200,000 shares of his Solomon stock while that stock was subject to a publicly disclosed lock up agreement and that the stock was used to pay for a 47-foot catamaran. However, as alleged in the complaint, Tether failed to disclose in the Form 10-KSB/A that he had transferred his locked up stock. Additionally, the Form 10-KSB/A overstated Tethers beneficial ownership of Solomon stock by the 200,000 shares he had already transferred. Moreover, the complaint alleges that Tether failed to file timely a Statement of Changes in Beneficial Ownership of Securities on Form 4 disclosing the transfer of the shares., Based on this conduct, the Commission alleges that Tether violated Sections 10(b), 13(g) and 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, 13d-1(d), 13d-2(b) and 16a-3 thereunder, and that he aided and abetted Solomons violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13a-1 thereunder.

Non-conforming mortgages have income verification and credit history standards that are generally more flexible than those required for sale or exchange under Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac programs and can constitute “subprime” mortgages.  , The Commission’s complaint charges First BanCorp with aiding and abetting violations of the federal securities laws by Doral Financial Corporation, another NYSE-listed, Puerto Rico-based bank holding company.  Doral Financial previously consented to the entry of a court order enjoining it from violating the antifraud, reporting, books and records and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws and ordering that it pay a $25 million civil penalty [LR-19837 (Sept. 19, 2006)].  , According to today’s complaint, First BanCorp, which purportedly purchased the non-conforming mortgages from Doral Financial, profited from the transactions by earning more than $100 million in net interest income at little or no risk.  Doral Financial, which purportedly sold the mortgages to First BanCorp, improperly recognized income on the transactions.  According to the Commission, the mortgage-related transactions were not true sales under generally accepted accounting principles because senior management of Doral Financial agreed orally and in emails to extend the recourse provision beyond the 24-month period included in the written agreements to recourse for the duration of the mortgages., The Commission’s complaint, which was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges First BanCorp with aiding and abetting violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20 13a-1 and 13a-13.

Armstrong posted over eighty such recommendations during the first three weeks that the stock of BluePoint was publicly traded. According to the Complaint, Armstrong praised BluePoints investment value and encouraged investors who were experiencing trouble having their orders filled to keep trying.

Platforms claimed to have an aerial system, the ARC System, for transmitting cellular telephone calls and other types of electronic data, using either fixed-wing aircraft or a blimp to carry transmission equipment.  However, many of the statements in the press releases were fraudulent.  During the period when the defendants were issuing the statements in the press releases, they were profiting from payments they received from the company, from illegal stock sales into the secondary market, and/or from stock sales made directly to investors., The final judgments follow two orders granting partial summary judgment to the Commission.  On January 8, 2007, the Court granted partial summary judgment against Platforms, Martin, and Draper for violating Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933.

Distribution payments will be sent to investors in the next month.  This distribution represents return of investors moneys recovered in litigation by the Commission from foreign bank accounts of Weare and J&amp;K Global Marketing in Luxembourg and Grenada. The funds will be paid to 1,011 investors in the United States, and 713 foreign investors in twenty-eight countries, who submitted claims that were approved.  Investors, some of whom are senior citizens, are receiving a return of 100 percent of their investment principle, reduced by any previous payment they had received from J&amp;K.  This distribution represents the Commissions continuing efforts to protect senior citizens and other investors from securities fraud on the Internet even when the investment amounts are small.  The Commission received substantial international assistance from Luxembourg and Grenada which enabled the recovery of these funds.  The District Court has scheduled a hearing on October 15, 2007 to address the remaining disputed claims., The Commissions Complaint alleged that from at least November 1999 through April 2001, Weare and J&amp;K offered memberships in an investment program through an Internet website and in postings to Internet bulletin boards. The complaint alleged that J&amp;K fraudulently represented that by making an initial investment of $375, which it would invest in high-yield ventures, an investor would after six months receive a return of $375 a month for each of the next six months (an annual return of 600%) and then have the ability to continue receiving returns the following year with a second investment of $375.  Bank records revealed that J&amp;K raised at least $6.4 million but made no investments. The Commission alleged that the J&amp;K Global program was a Ponzi scheme in which money from new investors was used to make payments to prior investors.  Weare used the balance of the money raised from investors for personal living expenses such as clothing, limousine services and medical care., The Commissions Complaint also alleged that Weare fraudulently raised money for AAA-Auction.com,, which operated an Internet auction site in 1998 and 1999. According to the complaint, Weare raised at least $415,000 from 35 AAA-Auction.com investors by misrepresenting that their money would be used to purchase inventory to be sold on live auctions on its website.  Weare falsely represented that AAA-Auction.com would pay quarterly returns and repay investors principal after a year. The complaint alleged that Weare used substantial amounts of investors funds for other purposes, including general business expenses, child support payments, and undisclosed sales commissions of up to 40 percent., On January 8, 2002 the District Court permanently enjoined Weare and J&amp;K from violating Sections 5(a) and (c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, and ordered Weare and J&amp;K together to pay disgorgement of $6,278,334.91 and prejudgment interest of $486,848.02, and Weare to pay a civil penalty of $220,000 and J&amp;K to pay a civil penalty of $110,000.  The Court permanently enjoined AAA-Auction.com, another company controlled by Weare, from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5, and ordered Weare and AAA-Auction together to pay disgorgement of $623,250.00 and prejudgment interest of $142,724.40.

As a result, from 1999 through 2002, the former officer defendants engaged in or approved improper transactions, and made material misrepresentations in financial statements and documents filed with the Commission.  They also failed to disclose material information regarding Nicors rigged reductions in gas inventory levels that enabled it to improperly manipulate its earnings and to increase Nicors revenues under a performance-based utility rate plan.  In addition, the former officers materially understated Nicors expenses during the first and second quarters of 2001 by improperly bundling a weather-insurance contract with an agreement to supply gas to Nicors insurance provider at below-market prices.  Moreover, they caused the losses on the supply agreement with the insurance provider to be improperly charged to Nicors utility customers. These improper transactions enabled Nicor to understate its expenses and to manipulate its earnings to achieve its earnings targets.  As a result of the manipulative scheme, Nicor materially overstated its reported income for the years ending 2000 and 2001, and for each of the quarters within those years and the financial statements filed with those reports., Additionally, the former officer defendants failed to make disclosures required by GAAP about the effects of LIFO inventory liquidations on Nicors reported income.  Nicor, through Fisher, Halloran, and Behrens, failed to disclose in either its Managements Discussion &amp; Analysis section of its 2000 and 2001 annual and quarterly reports, or in its financial statements filed with those reports, that it had recorded material increases to income resulting from the liquidation of its LIFO inventory, and that the continued liquidation of Nicors low-cost inventory was not sustainable., The complaint alleges that by their conduct Fisher, Halloran, and Behrens violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and aided and abetted Nicors violations of the reporting provisions of the same laws, including Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder., Nicor, Inc. previously consented to the entry of a court order enjoining it from violating the antifraud and reporting provisions of the federal securities laws and ordering that it pay a $10 million civil penalty [LR-20060, March 29, 2007]., The Commissions action seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement, civil penalties, and officer and director bars against Fisher, Halloran, and Behrens., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2007/comp20233.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  ]"

According to the Complaint, notwithstanding this extraordinary position, Whittier failed to file the stock ownership reports that were required to be filed when the funds Endwave position exceeded five percent and then ten percent of Endwaves outstanding shares.

The Court permanently enjoined Rogers from future violations of the securities registration and anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws. The Court also ordered Rogers to pay disgorgement in the amount of $10,959,000, plus prejudgment interest, and imposed a civil penalty of $120,000., In its Complaint, filed on March 3, 2005, the Commission alleged that Rogers, a twice-convicted felon, whose criminal and securities fraud history spans nearly four decades, started this scheme shortly after being paroled from a 35-year prison sentence for mail and securities fraud. The Commission alleged that from January 2004 through the present, Rogers and the other defendants, operating principally through Premium Income Corp. (PIC) engaged in a deliberate scheme to defraud investors with promises of guaranteed profits and safety of principal. The complaint alleged that the defendants falsely claimed that PIC would use 100% of investor funds to write covered call options in the foreign currency market. In fact, according to the complaint, the defendants operated a Ponzi scheme, using new investor funds to pay interest to earlier investors, and made undisclosed payments to Rogers and PIC salesmen. Based on evidence presented to the Court on March 3, 2005, Judge Boyle granted the Commissions request for a temporary restraining order, the appointment of a Receiver, an asset freeze and other equitable relief to halt the ongoing scheme, In her order granting summary judgment, Judge Boyle concluded that the Commission established that there was no genuine issue of material fact that: (1) the PIC foreign currency program was a security; (2) Rogers recruited and trained 140 sales agents to offer and sell the security and encouraged them to disseminate false and misleading information about the PIC investment; (3) Rogers and his sales force materially misrepresented the risks involved in covered call options; (4) Rogers falsely touted his credentials and experience in legitimate international commerce, while failing to disclose to the sales agent or investors his long history of criminal convictions and regulatory injunctions; (5) Rogers, in fact, did not use investor funds to write covered calls, but rather risked investor funds in speculative foreign currency trade, resulting in the loss of millions of dollars; and (6) PIC operated as a Ponzi scheme, using funds supplied by new investors to pay the monthly returns promised to existing investors., On January 18, 2007, the Court issued final judgments against PIC, Inforex Ltd. and Tri-Forex International, Ltd., based on their failure to appear or otherwise defendant the case.

Bruteyn (Bruteyn) and Dennis Bowden (Bowden) and relief defendants Hess Financial Corporation (Hess Financial) and American Eagle Acceptance Corp. (American Eagle). The pending civil action charges the defendants with raising as much as $55 million through the fraudulent offer and sales of so-called Secured Debt Obligations (SDOs)., The Commission presented evidence that AmeriFirst sales agents lured elderly investors and those saving for retirement, with advertisements for relatively high-yielding FDIC-insured certificates of deposit, then convinced the investors to purchase the SDOs. The Commission provided evidence that defendants misrepresented the safety of the SDOs by falsely asserting, among other claims, that the investment had little or no risk because accounts were guaranteed by a commercial bank, protected by many layers of insurance coverage and fully secured by collateral. The Commission also presented evidence that the defendants touted the credentials of Bruteyn, a principal of AmeriFirst Funding, Inc. and AmeriFirst Acceptance Corp., while failing to disclose his long history of financial irresponsibility and securities-related sanctions, including personal bankruptcies and a permanent bar from associating with any broker-dealer. Finally, the Commission provided proof that defendants falsely promised to use investor funds only in specified investment vehicles, while, in fact, they misused millions of dollars of investor funds to purchase speculative investments and spent millions more for their personal benefit., Judge Fitzwater concluded that the Commission had established a reasonable likelihood that the defendants violated the securities registration and anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws in the course of offering and selling the SDOs. Specifically, the Court stated that the Commission had established that defendants made material misrepresentations and omissions concerning the safety of the SDOs and Bruteyns history of financial irresponsibility and securities-related sanctions. The Court also found that the Commission had establish that defendants misused investor funds by purchasing unauthorized investment vehicles and diverting a substantial amount of investor funds for their own personal use and benefit., The Court continued its asset freeze entered July 2, 2007 against AmeriFirst Funding, Inc., AmeriFirst Acceptance Corporation, Bruteyn and Bowden and relief defendants Hess Financial and American Eagle. The Court also ordered the defendants and relief defendants to repatriate assets located outside the jurisdiction of the court, ordered the defendants to render an accounting of their assets and all investor monies and prohibited defendants from secreting or destroying their records., In a separate ruling on August 2, 2007, the Court granted the Commissions request to extend the receivership, asset freeze and other equitable relief to five new relief defendants named in the Commissions First Amended Complaint, InterFinancial Holdings, Inc. (InterFinancial), a Nevada corporation traded on the Pink Sheets under the symbol IFCH, Hess International Properties, LLC (Hess International LLC), a Texas limited liability company, Hess International Investments, SA (Hess International SA), a Honduran corporation, Gerald Kingston (Kingston), and United Financial Markets, Inc. (United Financial), a Texas corporation. While the Court extended all prior remedies to InterFinancial, the Court confined the relief against InterFinancial to real property in Roatan, Honderas, the companys only known asset., In the First Amended Complaint, the Commission alleged, among other claims, that over $2 million in AmeriFirst investor funds were diverted to purchase 58 acres of real estate in Roatan, Honduras. The Commission presented the Court with evidence that InterFinancial, Hess International LLC and Hess International SA may each have an ownership interest in this property. The Commission provided evidence that Kingston, individually and through United Financial, received more than $1 million in commissions from the fraudulent offer and sale of AmeriFirst SDOs.

As alleged in the complaint, the defendants claimed that investors funds would be used to expand EMS and NMPCs mineral processing and fertilizer production businesses. The defendants guaranteed investors a 7% to 9% annual return their on investment, which was to be paid out of the operating revenue from the mining and fertilizer businesses. In reality, the defendants were running a Ponzi scheme; neither EMS nor NMPC operated a functioning mining or fertilizer business, and the returns promised to investors were paid using the investments of new investors. The complaint further alleges that the defendants scheme raised approximately $20 million from over 100 investors nationwide, many of whom had been saving for retirement and liquidated their personal Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) to invest in the mining claims., The Commission charged EMS, Higgs, Schwartz, and Lawton with violating the registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act).

In November 2002, the Commission filed an emergency action against the defendants, Virtual Cash and others charging them with violations of the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws., According to the Indictment, from at least September 2001 through December 2002, the defendants used in-house sales agents and an independent sales group, Omni Advertising &amp; Marketing, Inc. (Omni), to raise funds for their purported payday advance business, promising up to 150% returns on their investments. They further represented to investors that their funds would be used to purchase accounts receivables, that their funds would be fully collateralized by accounts receivables, that Virtual Cash was properly licensed and profitable, and that investors would not incur any costs in connection with their investments. In truth, Virtual Cash was never profitable or properly licensed as a money transmitter, and most of the funds invested by investors were not used to fund accounts receivables. Rather, investor funds were used to fund Virtual Cashs operations, to pay substantial commissions to Virtual Cash and Omni sales agents and, to pay dividends to prior investors.

Smeraski was charged in a previously-filed action with securities fraud in connection with a massive financial reporting fraud at McKesson HBOC Corporation (now, McKesson Corporation), a Fortune 100 company headquartered in San Francisco, California.  Smeraski consented to the entry of judgment without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions complaint except as to jurisdiction., <b>The Commissions Complaint</b>, The Complaint, filed September 27, 2001, alleged that Smeraski, a senior sales vice president, together with other senior executives participated in a long-running fraudulent scheme to inflate the revenue and net income of HBO &amp; Company, an Atlanta, Georgia-based vendor of health care software that merged with McKesson in 1999.  Smeraski and others routinely approved software sales contracts with associated side letters containing unsatisfied contingencies precluding revenue recognition and backdated contracts and other documents for the purpose of recognizing revenue in an earlier reporting period.  Both of these practices failed to comply with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.  The fraud enabled HBO &amp; Company to report falsely in press releases and in periodic reports filed with the Commission that the company was having an unbroken run of financial success and that HBO &amp; Company had continually exceeded analysts expectations.  However, when McKesson HBOC announced in April 1999 that the company was conducting an internal investigation into financial reporting irregularities, its shares tumbled from approximately $65 to $34, a drop that slashed its market value by more than $9 billion., <b>The Settlement</b>, The final judgment against Smeraski permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5)of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

According to the complaint, from about January 2004 until at least Fall 2006, Tomayko, age 59, of Irving, Texas raised at least $14.5 million from over 900 domestic and international investors through a fraudulent, unregistered offering of preferred stock and joint venture interests IGT, a Texas corporation based in Irving., The SECs complaint alleges that Tomayko and IGT (the defendants) lured new investors and induced additional investment from existing ones by claiming to own three valuable licenses to construct Indonesian oil refineries and promising huge returns once the refineries were financed and built. Tomayko repeatedly told investors that IGT would imminently receive funding for construction of the refineries from sources such as letters of credit or other bank instruments provided by a wealthy contact in Indonesia; a hidden vault filled with gold bullion controlled by Indonesian tribal elders; and investments by the Saudi royal family. Defendants represented that investor funds would be used to maintain IGTs Indonesian refinery licenses and procure financing to build the refineries., In reality, the Commission alleges, Defendants claims were baseless. Tomaykos schemes to finance the Indonesian refinery were based on dubious and unverified information, and the promised financing has never materialized. Indeed, Tomayko used false bank and other documents to bolster his claims to investors that financing for the refineries was imminent. Contrary to Defendants representation, Tomayko used millions of dollars of investor funds to pay his personal expenses and support his lavish international lifestyle, and he squandered millions more, without due diligence, chasing financing in Indonesia., The defendants are charged with securities fraud under Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and with conducting an unregistered offering under Section 5 of the Securities Act.

The scheme was orchestrated by Duchesne, and began with a matched trade between Duchesne and Hayden that inflated Nationwides stock price from pennies to $9.35 per share.  The Complaint alleges that, thereafter, Duchesne, Hayden, and Parsley bought or sold Nationwide shares at inflated prices to increase the price of Nationwide stock, to generate volume, and to prime the market for the manipulated shares.  The Complaint further alleges that Nationwide, Duchesne, and Moffitt disseminated false and misleading information regarding Nationwides financial condition and business prospects, as part of the manipulative scheme.  This information included a false press release, false public filings, and a website that falsely portrayed Nationwide and its business prospects.  According to the Complaint, the object of the scheme was to artificially inflate the price of Nationwide stock, to induce public investors to purchase Nationwide stock, to support Nationwides attempt to acquire other companies, and to enable certain of the defendants to profit from selling Nationwide stock at artificially-inflated prices.  The scheme collapsed on October 1, 2002, when the Commission suspended trading in Nationwide securities., The Complaint charges each of the defendants with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Oil for Food Program — Company Agrees to Pay Over $3.5 Million and to Make Certain Undertakings Regarding its Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Compliance Program</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed Foreign Corrupt Practices Act books and records and internal controls charges against Textron Inc., a Rhode Island-based industrial equipment company, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The Commissions complaint alleges that from approximately 2001 through 2003, two of Textrons David Brown French subsidiaries authorized and made approximately $650,539 in kickback payments in connection with its sale of humanitarian goods to Iraq under the U.N. Oil for Food Program. The kickbacks were made in the form of after-sales service fees, however no bona fide services were actually rendered. The Program was intended to provide humanitarian relief for the Iraqi population, which faced severe hardship under international trade sanctions. Iraq was allowed to purchase humanitarian goods through a U.N. escrow account. However, according to the complaint, the kickbacks paid by Textrons subsidiaries bypassed the escrow account and were instead paid by third parties to Iraqi-controlled accounts. The contracts submitted to the U.N. did not disclose that the cost of the illicit payments were included in the inflated contract price. The Complaint also alleges that Textrons subsidiaries made illicit payments of $114,995 to secure thirty-six contracts in the United Arab Emirates, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Egypt, and India from 2001 to 2005., According to the Commissions Complaint:, Textron subsidiaries David Brown Guinard Pumps S.A.S. and David Brown Transmissions France S.A. made $1,936,926 in profits on Oil for Food contracts that involved illicit after-sales service fees (ASSF). DB Guinard Pumps obtained three Oil for Food contracts that were inflated by ten percent to cover the cost of secret ASSFs that it had agreed to make in undisclosed side letters with Iraq. Management approved ASSFs of approximately $83,000 to be funneled to Iraq through a Lebanese consultant. When the goods were held up at the Iraqi border on one contract, the Lebanese consultant provided DB Guinard Pumps with bank records showing that the ASSF payment was made on the companys behalf into a Lebanese bank account in the name of an Iraqi individual for the benefit of the Iraqi ministry. DB Transmissions France obtained ten Oil for Food contracts that were also inflated by ten percent to cover the cost of secret ASSFs. DB Transmissions Frances Export Sales Manager noted in an internal memorandum that DB Transmissions France wishes to avoid any written agreement [concerning the ASSF] with client side and [i]f written document cannot be avoided, this must remain highly confidential. He also noted that he discussed this issue with French management and received approval from his superiors to include the amount of the ASSF in the inflated contract price submitted to the U.N. Management approved ASSF payments of approximately $567,000 to be funneled to Iraq through a Jordanian consultant., Textrons David Brown subsidiaries entered into thirty-six contracts involving illicit payments totaling $114,995.20 in countries other than Iraq. The payments were similar to the ASSF payments made on Oil for Food contracts because no bona fide services were performed and the payments were made to secure contracts. In the United Arab Emirates, subsidiaries paid $20,429 to employees of two government-owned gas companies, GASCO and ZADCO. $16,342 was paid to two friends employed by a Bangladesh government-owned fertilizer company. In Indonesia, a company representative was paid $149,000 of a $321,171 contract (more than half the contract value) to perform after-sales services. Of the $149,000 paid to the representative, $10,000 went to a procurement official of a government-owned company, Pertamina, to sponsor a golf tournament with very little documentation to show what the representative actually did with the remainder. Finally, $13,354 was paid to a government customer in Egypt, and $51,870 was paid to a non-government customer in India to secure business., Textron knew or was reckless in not knowing that illicit payments were paid in connection with all of these transactions. Textron failed to maintain an adequate system of internal controls to detect and prevent the payments. Textrons French subsidiaries both failed to enter into signed agreements with their consultants despite Textrons requirements that they do so, and management of the subsidiaries failed to report known transgressions to higher level managers. Further, although Textron knew of endemic corruption problems in the Middle East, it appeared to take on faith, without adequate confirming steps, that its managers and employees were exercising their duties to manage and comply with compliance issues. Textrons accounting for its Oil for Food transactions failed properly to record the nature of the companys payments. In twelve transactions, a portion of the subsidiaries sale price for goods to Iraq constituted ASSFs, which were characterized on the books and records as commissions. The illicit payments made in non-Iraq countries were also incorrectly characterized as commissions and consultation fees., Textron, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, ordering it to disgorge $2,284,579 in profits, plus $450,461.68 in pre-judgment interest, and to pay a civil penalty of $800,000. Textron is also ordered to comply with certain undertakings regarding its Foreign Corrupt Practices Act compliance program. Textron will also pay a $1,150,000 fine pursuant to a non-prosecution agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice, Fraud Section., The Commission considered remedial acts promptly undertaken by Textron, which self-reported, and cooperation afforded the Commission staff in its continuing investigation.

Many of the investors were elderly and invested their retirement savings.  The Commission also alleges the father-daughter fraudsters pocketed $700,000 for their personal use while the scam was on the verge of collapse., According to the Commissions complaint, Neuhaus and Snowden sold shares of life insurance policies, calling them bonded life settlements.  They persuaded investors to buy the securities by representing that their money would be used to purchase and pay the necessary premiums on the life insurance policies.  They promised returns up to 125 percent when the person insured by the policy died., The Commissions complaint alleges that Neuhaus and Snowden instead used investors money for their own personal use and to cover the premiums on other insurance policies owned by other groups of investors.  Their conduct constituted a Ponzi scheme in which every new investor was being defrauded to provide the cash needed to conceal the misrepresentations to an earlier group of investors.

According to the complaint, Hollnagel, a resident of Chicago, Illinois, and BCI, headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, told investors that they would use investor funds to purchase specifically identified commercial aircraft for the LLCs and, in turn, lease the aircraft to commercial airlines. According to the complaint, investors were told they would receive part of the lease revenue from the particular aircraft, in the form of regular monthly payments, as their return. The complaint further alleged that the Defendants also told investors that if an aircraft owned by an LLC was sold, investors were entitled to half of all proceeds from the sale above and beyond their capital contribution. In reality, according to the complaint, Defendants operated a massive Ponzi scheme. In addition, the complaint alleged that, in 2007, Defendants continued their scheme by fraudulently repurchasing investors interests through materially misleading statements.

The Court permanently enjoined Tackaberry and Palazzo from future violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. The Court also ordered Palazzo and Tackaberry to disgorge $11,725,294.82, plus prejudgment interest, and imposed civil penalties of $75,000 each., In its Complaint, filed July 14, 2006, the Complaint alleged that from 1996 to 2004, Tackaberry and Palazzo raised, in unregistered transactions, more than $15 million from at least 275 investors, including many senior citizens, by issuing promissory notes in the Pittsford Issuers. Tackaberry and Palazzo owned and managed all of the Pittsford Issuers. The Complaint further alleged that the defendants were engaged in a fraudulent scheme, in which they made numerous misrepresentations and omissions to investors concerning their investments and the Pittsford Issuers financial condition, including: (i) making, and failing to disclose, transfers of large amounts of money, including a $2.4 million payment to Communicate Wireless, an entity that Tackaberry and Palazzo had significant personal interests in; (ii) making, and failing to disclose, transfers of money to Palazzo; (iii) failing to disclose that that they commingled the Pittsford Issuers assets in one bank account; and (iv) falsely claiming that certain of the Pittsford Issuers would retain an independent third-party agent to represent investors interests in connection with the offerings.

The Court also found that Palazzo and Tackaberry never disclosed that the separate bank accounts of the Pittsford Issuers had been closed and all funds commingled into a single account.

The Commission charged Lisa C. Berry with routinely backdating option grants from 1997 to 2003, first as General Counsel of KLA-Tencor Corporation, and then as General Counsel of Juniper Networks, Inc. The Commission alleges that Berrys misconduct caused the two companies to conceal hundreds of millions of dollars in stock option compensation expenses relating to undisclosed in-the-money options provided to company executives and employees., The Commission also announced today that it has filed a settled enforcement action against Juniper, an information technology company based in Sunnyvale, Calif. Without admitting or denying the allegations, Juniper has consented to a permanent injunction against violations of the antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws. KLA, a San Jose-based semiconductor equipment company, previously settled charges brought by the Commission., The Commissions complaint against Berry, filed in federal district court in San Jose, Calif., alleges that she routinely used hindsight to identify dates with historically low stock prices, facilitating the backdating of option grants by KLAs stock option committee. According to the Commission, Berry then moved to Juniper shortly before its 1999 IPO, touting her experience in stock administration. The complaint alleges that Berry established a similar backdating process at Juniper, creating minutes of fictitious stock option committee meetings to document false grant dates — at times affixing the names of other committee members with a signature stamp., According to the Commissions complaint, the backdated grants resulted in materially misleading disclosures, with KLA overstating its net income in fiscal years 1998 through 1999 by as much as 47 percent and Juniper overstating its 2003 net income by nearly 22 percent. In 2007, both KLA and Juniper restated their financial statements, with Juniper recording nearly $900 million in previously unreported compensation expenses., Juniper, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, agreed to settle the matter by consenting to a permanent injunction from further violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B) and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13, and 14a-9 thereunder., Berry is charged with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder, and Berry is charged with aiding and abetting violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B) and 14(a) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13 and 14a-9 thereunder.

The final judgments include injunctions against future violations of various provisions of the federal securities laws. Based on Sacanes obligation to pay restitution in the related criminal action, <i>United States v.

In the criminal matter, after sentencing Sacane to three years in prison based on his guilty plea, the Court on April 11, 2007, ordered Sacane to pay restitution in accordance with a restitution agreement worth approximately $5.7 million., The Commissions complaint, filed in federal district court in Connecticut, charged the defendants for their involvement during 2002 and 2003 in fraudulent schemes concerning the purchase and sale of the common stock of two biotechnology companies: Esperion Therapeutics, Inc. and Aksys Ltd. The Commissions complaint alleged that the defendants manipulated the price of both Esperion and Aksys stock by making regular and substantial purchases of both stocks through the hedge funds that they managed and concealing these purchases by failing to file various forms and schedules with the Commission as required by the federal securities laws and making false filings with the Commission. According to the complaint, Sacane also made misrepresentations to officers of Esperion and Aksys about the stock purchases, and made misrepresentations to Sacanes former employer about purported non-public information Sacane possessed about both companies in order to prevent the former employer from selling Aksys and Esperion stock. The Complaint further alleged that Sacane and Durus later sold stock of both companies without disclosing their ownership position as required by the federal securities laws. The Commissions complaint alleged that the defendants undisclosed purchases of Esperion and Aksys stock artificially inflated the price of both stocks by creating the appearance of a greater demand for the stocks than actually existed in the market. According to the complaint, from November 2002 through July 2003, Esperions stock price more than tripled from $5.65 per share to approximately $20 per share, and Aksys stock price quadrupled from $3.65 per share to approximately $15 per share. By July 24, 2003, the defendants undisclosed purchases also resulted in them controlling approximately 33% of Esperions outstanding stock and approximately 78% of Aksys outstanding stock., In settling the Commissions complaint, and without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Sacane and Durus consented to the entry of the final judgments that enjoin Sacane and Durus from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 , Sections 10(b), 13(d), 13(f), 13(g), 16(a), and 16(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 13d-1, 13d-2, 13f-1, and 16a-3 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

The Commission further alleges that, in order to raise money while evading legal restrictions on FacePrints ability to sell stock to the public, Cote arranged to surreptitiously sell shares through nominees. According to the Commission, FacePrint and Cote issued stock to a FacePrint employee and the 20-year-old niece of Cotes assistant. Cote, who the complaint alleges controlled these nominees brokerage accounts, began selling the stock to the public, unloading over nine million shares by May 2006. Cote then funneled nearly $1.5 million from these illegal stock sales back to the company., The Commissions complaint further alleges that Cote facilitated his illicit stock sales by timing them to coincide with company press releases and spam e-mail campaigns conducted by stock promoters hired by the company., The Commissions complaint charges FacePrint and Cote with registration violations as well as violations of the rules governing the activities of those participating in a distribution of securities. The complaint further charges Cote with violations of the stock ownership reporting requirements.

(IES), and its former Chief Executive Officer, Herbert R. Allen, former Chief Operating Officer, Richard L. China, former Regional Operating Officers, Ernest P. Breaux and Thomas E. Stalvey, former Regional Controller, James M. Calcote, and former subsidiary president, J. Carl Cannon, alleging that they engaged in numerous disclosure and accounting violations in 2003 and 2004., The Commissions complaint, filed in the Southern District of Texas, alleges that over the course of four consecutive quarters during 2003 and 2004, IES failed to disclose in its Commission filings that the collectibility of approximately $3 million in unsigned change orders from two construction contracts was in dispute at one of its subsidiaries, and that IES failed to appropriately reserve for these material loss contingencies in its financial statements. The complaint alleges that Cannon, the subsidiary president, represented to IESs external auditors that the change orders were fully collectible at a time when he knew they were in dispute. The impact of the disputed change orders was material to IESs pre-tax income during the relevant periods, and ultimately IES wrote off approximately 70% of the income previously recorded from the change orders. In addition, the complaint alleges that during three of those quarters, IES lowered its allowance for doubtful accounts by approximately $1.8 million without proper disclosure to investors. The complaint alleges that the individual defendants — members of IESs senior, regional, and subsidiary management — each knew that the collectibility of the unsigned change orders was in dispute, and based on their respective conduct, aided and abetted IESs disclosure and accounting violations., The Commissions complaint alleges that IES violated Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder. The complaint further alleges that Allen, China, Breaux, Stalvey, Calcote, and Cannon aided and abetted IESs violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder. In addition, the complaint alleges that Allen violated Exchange Act Rule 13a-14, Cannon violated Exchange Act Rule 13b2-2, and China aided and abetted IESs violations of Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act. The Defendants, without admitting or denying the allegations set forth in the complaint, agreed to settle the Commissions action by consenting to permanent injunctions against their respective violations., In a related matter, on August 30, 2007, the Commission filed cease-and-desist proceedings against IESs former Chief Accounting Officer, David A. Miller, for his role in causing IESs disclosure lapses in 2003 and 2004. Miller, without admitting or denying the findings in the Commissions order, agreed to cease and desist from causing violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder.

Pursuant to the distribution plan, persons or entities that purchased shares of Biogen common stock on February 18, 2005, and held such shares through to and until at least February 28, 2005, are eligible to receive monies from the distribution fund., The Commissions complaint in this matter, filed in January 2006, alleged that, on February 18, 2005, Bucknum sold 89,700 shares of Biogen stock after learning negative information about one of Biogens major drugs. The Commissions complaint further alleged that when Biogen announced the information publicly on February 28, 2005, the price of Biogens stock declined as a result., In February 2006, the Court entered a final judgment by consent, ordering Bucknum, among other things, to pay a total of $3,009,702 in disgorgement of the ill-gotten gains from his trading, pre-judgment interest and civil penalties. In September 2006, the Court appointed Richard J.

The Court ordered Zanello to pay $80,971 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and ordered Humesky, Rodd and Broege to pay disgorgement in the amounts of $156,366, $156,366, and $73,000, respectively. The disgorgement amounts represent the defendants ill-gotten gains (sales commissions) from their participation in a fraudulent investment scheme. The Court further ordered each defendant to pay a civil penalty of $50,000.

In consenting to the judgments, the defendants agreed to defer the Courts determination of disgorgement and penalty amounts to a later date., The litigation relates to the investments that the defendants sold on behalf of LinkTel Communications, Inc. (LinkTel), an Atlanta, Georgia company that sold and operated pay telephones. Many of the investments were marketed and sold to senior citizens as a means of generating income to pay for the seniors long-term care health insurance policies. The complaint alleged that the defendants made material misrepresentations and omissions in connection with the sale of the investments. For example, the defendants falsely represented to potential investors that they had investigated LinkTel and that it was a profitable company. In addition, they told the investors that LinkTel was a safe investment and that the investment was fully insured. In fact, LinkTel was a fraudulent Ponzi scheme.

Saks has agreed to settle the case, without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, and has agreed to an injunction barring future violations of these provisions., The Commissions complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that from the mid-1990s until 2003, certain employees of the companys Saks Fifth Avenue Enterprises division (SFAE) engaged in two deceptive practices in order to achieve their financial targets for the month, quarter or retail season and that these practices resulted in the companys overstatement of income by material amounts in its financial statements for its 2000, 2001, and 2002 fiscal years and for two quarters in fiscal 2001 and 1999.

The SECs action, filed in federal district court in Chicago, Illinois, charges 26 defendants and alleges that they participated in a massive fraud on U.S. investors that involved the sale of securities in the form of Universal Leases. The Universal Lease investments were structured as timeshares in several hotels in Cancun, Mexico, coupled with a pre-arranged rental agreement that promised investors a high, fixed rate of return. The Universal Lease scheme has now collapsed and investor losses exceed $300 million., The SEC alleges that Michael E. Kelly (Kelly) and those working with him defrauded thousands of U.S. investors into using their retirement savings to buy Universal Leases on the false promise of safe and guaranteed returns. The SEC alleges that from 1999 until 2005, Kelly and others raised at least $428 million through the Universal Lease scheme from investors throughout the United States, with more than $136 million of the funds invested coming from IRA accounts. The SEC further alleges that a nationwide network of unregistered salespeople who sold the Universal Leases collected undisclosed commissions totaling more than $72 million. The SEC also alleges that Kelly and others ran the scheme from Cancun, Mexico, through a number of foreign entities in Mexico and Panama. According to the SECs complaint, Kelly and others told investors that Universal Leases would generate guaranteed income through the leasing of investor timeshares by a large, independent leasing agent. In fact, the complaint alleges, the leasing agent was a small Panamanian travel agency controlled by Kelly, and for most of the scheme its payments to investors came from accounts funded by money raised from new investors. Further, the complaint alleges that Kelly and the other defendants failed to disclose key facts about the Universal Lease investment, including the risks of the investment and that more than $72 million in investor funds were used to pay commissions as high as 27% to the selling brokers., The SECs complaint names the following individuals and entities as defendants: Kelly, Michael P.

Rocklage, William M. Beaver and David G. Jones in connection with an insider trading case involving trading in the common stock of Massachusetts-based Cubist Pharmaceuticals, Inc. The final judgments enjoin Rocklage, Beaver and Jones from violating the antifraud provisions of the securities laws and order them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest and civil penalties., On January 12, 2005, the Commission filed a complaint alleging that, on December 31, 2001, Scott M. Rocklage, who was at that time Cubists Chairman and CEO, informed his wife, Patricia Rocklage, that the results of a clinical trial on one of Cubists most important products, Cidecin (now known as Cubicin), were negative. The complaint further alleged that, unbeknownst to her husband, Ms. Rocklage had a pre-existing understanding with her brother, Beaver, whereby she would give him a wink and a nod if she ever became aware of any bad news about Cubist that might affect its stock price. According to the complaint, shortly after learning about the trial results, Ms. Rocklage told her husband that she intended to signal Beaver to sell his Cubist stock, and Scott Rocklage urged his wife to not communicate with Beaver about the trial results. The complaint alleged that, notwithstanding her husbands entreaties, by no later than the morning of January 2, 2002, Ms. Rocklage provided a wink and a nod to Beaver, who, at approximately 10:00 a.m. that day, sold all 5,583 shares of Cubist stock that he owned or controlled. The complaint further alleged that, after receiving the signal from his sister, Beaver tipped his friend and neighbor, Jones. Jones then proceeded to sell all 7,500 shares of Cubist stock that he owned on the morning of January 3, 2002. Following the announcement of the trial results on January 16, 2002, after the market closed, Cubists stock price dropped by 46%, from a closing price of $31.75 that day to a closing price of $17.02 on January 17, 2002. The complaint alleged that, by selling when they did, Beaver and Jones avoided losses of $99,527 and $133,222, respectively., Previously, the District Court rejected the defendants motion to dismiss the Commissions complaint, and the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed that decision on November 14, 2006. The defendants had argued that, after she received the inside information, Ms. Rocklages disclosure to her husband that she was going to tip her brother negated any liability under insider trading case law. The First Circuit rejected this argument and ruled that the Commission had stated a valid claim against the defendants and affirmed the District Courts rejection of the defendants motion to dismiss.<br/>Ms. Rocklage, Beaver and Jones have agreed to settle the charges against them without admitting or denying the allegations contained in the Commissions complaint. Under the terms of the settlement, each of the defendants has consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining them from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The defendants sales netted them nearly $3 million in ill-gotten gains., The Commissions complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, alleges that, over the past four years, Paloma repeatedly passed himself off to principals of private, cash-strapped companies as a legitimate financier, persuading company principals to issue to Paloma-affiliated entities large controlling blocks of stock, which were then resold in unlawful public offerings., In each case, according to the complaint, Paloma would surreptitiously gain control of a companys shares by convincing management to issue large blocks of stock to one or more entities he controlled. These issuances, purportedly made under federal registration exemptions to accredited investors, were part of a plan to circumvent the registration requirements of the federal securities laws. In furtherance of this plan, Paloma obtained bogus opinions of counsel that permitted transfer agents to issue share certificates to his entities free of legends restricting resale. In fact, the entities Paloma controlled were not <i>bona fide</i> accredited investors, but merely conduits through which he and Kaplan effected unregistered public distributions of stock., The Commission further alleges that, once his entities acquired the free-trading shares, Paloma then coordinated manipulative public trading — carried out, in part, by Kaplan — which artificially inflated the value of each issuers stock. With the appearance of an active trading market established, Paloma coordinated the dissemination of millions of false and/or misleading blast fax and spam e-mails touting the companies shares. Ultimately, Paloma and Kaplan dumped stock of the microcap issuers into the public market at the artificially inflated prices, realizing profits of some $2,155,000 and $677,000, respectively., After Paloma and Kaplan liquidated their holdings of each companys stock, they ceased trading in the stock and the market for the shares collapsed. The Commission alleges that Paloma and Kaplan carried out versions of this scheme using the shares of Courtside Products, Inc., Latin Heat Entertainment, Inc., Xtreme Technologies, Inc., PokerBook Gaming Corp., Commanche Properties, Inc., TKO Holdings Ltd. and Motion DNA Corp., In a related criminal action, the U.S. Department of Justice announced today that Paloma and Kaplan have pleaded guilty in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia for their participation in stock manipulation schemes. On August 20, 2007, Paloma pleaded guilty to a criminal information charging him with one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and one count of electronic mail fraud. On July 25, 2007, Kaplan pleaded guilty to a criminal information charging him with one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud. Each of these charges carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. The written plea agreements and supporting documentation for both defendants were unsealed yesterday., In the Commissions action, Paloma has consented to the entry of a final judgment (1) permanently enjoining him from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; (2) imposing a penny stock bar against him; and (3) directing that he disgorge $2,155,034 in unlawful profits, plus prejudgment interest of $364,265.

The civil action alleged that he orchestrated a stock manipulation scheme involving false claims that Paloma-controlled Desert Winds Entertainment had signed a $25 million contract with Warner Bros.

The Commission alleges that Shey learned from a UTStarcom executive with whom he maintains a relationship of trust and confidence that the company was going to pre-announce that it had missed earnings guidance for the quarter.  Shortly after talking with the UTStarcom executive, Shey and his wife began liquidating their UTStarcom holdings, avoiding over $420,000 in potential losses when, days later, the public disclosure of the disappointing financial results caused the stock price to plummet., The Commissions complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, alleges that in addition to his relationship with the UTStarcom executive, Shey also managed a venture capital fund owned in part by UTStarcom, and thus was privy to certain confidential information about the company.  In late September 2005, UTStarcom failed to finalize a significant deal and the company was preparing to pre-announce to the market that it would not be able to meet its earnings guidance for the quarter.  According to the Commission, Shey spoke to the UTStarcom executive by phone the weekend before the public announcement.  Shortly after that conversation, Shey contacted his broker and began the process of liquidating his extensive UTStarcom stock holdings., According to the complaint, just minutes after the market opened on Monday, October 3, Shey began selling his UTStarcom stock, and Sheys wife began selling UTStarcom stock in accounts of her family members.  Shey sold more than 600,000 shares over the following days, making his final sale less than an hour before UTStarcom announced the revenue shortfall on October 6.  Following that announcement, the companys stock price fell by more than 26 percent., The Commissions complaint alleges that Shey violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder by making the illegal stock sales before the announcement and avoiding losses of more than $420,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Shey agreed to disgorge $420,226.60 plus prejudgment interest of $31,909.96, to pay a civil penalty of $420,226.60, and to an order enjoining him from future violations of the securities laws., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2007/comp20270.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  ]"

The action also names several South Florida companies as relief defendants, including Oak Tree Escrow Corp., Luna Pazza, Inc., SMR Acquisitions, Inc., SMRDevelopment.com, Inc., and Global Survey Corp.

The Court also appointed David Mandel, Esq. as Receiver over the corporate Defendant and Relief Defendants., The SECs complaint alleges that from at least May 2005 to the present, Homeland, LaBarre, and Yurkin have raised at least $1.13 million from 93 investors nationwide by offering and selling unregistered securities in the form of units consisting of one share of Homelands common stock and one warrant. The complaint further alleges that, in connection with the offer and sale of Homelands securities, the Defendants are making numerous material misrepresentations and omissions to investors through Homelands website, its telemarketers, and its offering materials distributed to potential investors. The misstatements and omissions include, among other things, false representations concerning an upcoming initial public offering, the use of investor proceeds, and Homelands assets and acquisitions.

Teruya (Teruya) , age 35, and his company, Senior Resources of Hawaii, Inc. (Senior Resources) seeks to halt the defendants fraudulent activities and deprive them of their ill-gotten gains.  Teruya is a representative of an SEC-registered investment adviser, which was not named in either of todays action., According to the SECs complaint, since at least 2004 and continuing as recently as August 2007, Teruya, through Senior Resources, has on multiple occasions fraudulently induced clients to sign a series of pre-printed, fill-in-the-blank forms by misrepresenting the purpose of the forms, the reasons that they needed prospective clients signatures on the forms, and the way in which they would use the forms.  The complaint alleges that Teruya used the signed forms to sell the seniors existing securities holdings without their knowledge or authorization.  The complaint also alleges that Teruya, who is also a licensed insurance agent, then used the proceeds of the unauthorized sales to purchase equity-indexed annuities for which he received substantial, undisclosed commissions totaling about $2 million., The complaint alleges that each month the defendants lured about 75 senior citizens, mostly retirees in their 60s, 70s, and 80s, to free breakfast and dinner seminars focusing on retirement financial planning.  The complaint alleges that the defendants targeted seniors through advertisements in local newspapers, such as The Honolulu Advertiser and Honolulu Star-Bulletin, and direct mail invitations.  The advertisements featured eye-catching headlines, such as 7 Seldom Heard, Significant Financial Opportunities [That] May Be Available to Many Retirees, and 10 Common Costly Financial Mistakes Hawaii Retirees May Make and Ways to Avoid Them., As alleged in the complaint, defendants then offered seminar attendees free one-on-one consultations with Teruya, a self-proclaimed certified retirement financial adviser.  The complaint further alleges that, during these individual meetings, defendants fraudulently induced the seniors to sign the blank forms., The SECs complaint charges the defendants with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

Specifically, the complaint alleges that REP paid investors annual dividends using money obtained from other investors. The complaint also alleges that the defendants falsely claimed that Coldwell Banker was associated with the funds, when, in actuality, Coldwell Banker had nothing to do with the fund offerings. Finally, the complaint alleges that the defendants enticed investors with baseless promises of high rates of return on their investments, and dangled the unlikely possibility of conducting a public offering by converting the funds and REP into a publicly-traded real estate investment trust., The Commissions complaint alleges that REP, the funds, Davenport, Owens, Ryan, McGill, Sanders, Tuchman, and Rayburn violated the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933.

Haylors fraudulent conduct involved several accounts, including temporary accounts receivable, inventory, consignments and unrecorded liabilities, and caused Ferro to overstate its operating income by $5 million for 2003 and by $700,000 for the first quarter of 2004. On March 31, 2006, Ferro restated its financial results.

G. Lynn, of the Northern District of Texas, issued a temporary restraining order and asset freeze against Terax Energy Inc., Westar Oil, Inc., and Mark Roy Anderson, in an emergency civil action filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Commissions complaint alleges that Anderson, of Los Angeles, California, is orchestrating an ongoing fraudulent scheme involving the stock of Terax Energy, Inc., a Dallas, Texas based oil and gas company that trades on the OTC BB. According to the complaint, after Anderson obtained undisclosed control of Terax in April 2007, Terax issued several false and misleading press releases, and the companys stock price increased from approximately $0.30 to as much as $4.88 per share. The complaint also alleges that Anderson fraudulently raised about $1 million from about 30 investors in a private placement of common stock by Westar, a private Nevada corporation he controls, after making false claims regarding its oil and gas operations, its purported pending initial public offering, and plans to exchange Westar stock for Terax stock., The defendants in the Commissions civil action are:, The Commissions complaint also names two entities controlled by Anderson as relief defendants, <strong>The September Trust</strong> and <strong>Camden Holdings, Inc.</strong>, which are also subject to the Courts asset freeze order. , According to the Commissions complaint, Anderson was disbarred by the State Bar of Nevada in 1993 and was convicted in 1994 on federal mail fraud charges. The Commissions complaint alleges that through July 2007, while under Andersons control, Terax has issued several materially false and misleading press releases announcing, among other things: (1) that the company intended to extend its leases and rework its wells in Erath County, Texas, resulting in expected net revenues from the wells of $750,000 per month; (2) Westar had executed a $175 million financing agreement on behalf of Terax with an unnamed New York energy lender; and (3) Terax had acquired a controlling interest in a publicly-held Canadian oil company. The Commissions complaint alleges that in fact, at the time the press releases were issued: (1) the Erath County leases had been placed into receivership by a state court judge and the lessor had advised Terax that he was terminating the leases; (2) the New York lender had never committed to the financing; and (3) the acquisition of the Canadian company did not close because Anderson stopped payment on the $2 million check to the Canadian brokerage firm that brokered the deal., The complaint further alleges that Anderson and Contreras caused Terax to issue approximately 1 million free trading shares of its common stock in violation of the registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act). Camden Holdings and The September Trust, which Anderson controls, received 500,000 of those shares., The complaint alleges that Terax and Anderson violated Sections 5 (a), (c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, that Westar violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that Contreras violated Sections 5(a) and (c) of the Securities Act. The Commissions complaint seeks preliminary and permanent injunctive relief and a civil monetary penalty against all the defendants, as well as disgorgement of all illicit profits from Terax, Westar, Anderson, September Trust and Camden Holdings. The complaint also seeks officer and director and penny stock bars against Anderson., Separately, the Commission issued an order, pursuant to Section 12(k) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, temporarily suspending trading in the securities of Terax, beginning at 9:30 a.m. EDT on September 12, 2007, and terminating at 11:59 p.m. EST on September 25, 2007. The Commissions order cites concerns about the accuracy and adequacy of publicly disseminated information concerning, among other things: (1) the status of Teraxs oil and gas operations, (2) Teraxs purported financing agreements, (3) Teraxs supposed acquisition of a controlling interest in a foreign oil and gas firm, (4) the existence, terms and status of a purported share exchange agreement between Terax and Westar Oil, Inc., and (5) the identity of the persons in control of the operations and management of Terax.

(Ambassador), a now defunct eyeglass frame distributor that was located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and whose stock was traded on the Chicago Stock Exchange. Green is Ambassadors former treasurer and principal financial accounting officer. The Commissions Complaint, filed in September 2002, alleged, among other things, that, from at least 1997 through at least December 1998, Budilov and Green engaged in a fraudulent scheme to artificially inflate Ambassadors assets, income, and retained earnings. The Complaint alleged that, as a result of the scheme, Ambassador falsely claimed, in its filings with the Commission and in press releases, that it was profitable when, in fact, the company had incurred substantial losses. In addition, Ambassador overstated its assets by as much as 35 percent. The Commissions Complaint alleged that, as part of the scheme, Budilov and Green falsified Ambassadors books and records related to income, expense, accounts receivable, retained earnings, and inventory, and lied to Ambassadors auditors. The Complaint further alleged that, after others began suspecting the fraud, Budilov attempted to conceal their involvement by destroying evidence, causing others to destroy evidence, and persuading others to accept responsibility for the fraud., In connection with largely the same conduct as that described in the Commissions Complaint, Budilov and Green were indicted and the Commissions civil enforcement action was stayed pending the disposition of those proceedings. On November 26, 2004, Green pleaded guilty to two counts of the superseding indictment and on January 30, 2006, he was sentenced to 5 years of probation, including 8 months of home custody, and ordered to pay restitution of $17,447,437. On July 12, 2005, Budilov pleaded guilty to four counts of the superseding indictment, and on January 13, 2006, he was sentenced to a term of 27 months of imprisonment, 5 years of probation, and ordered to pay restitution of $17,447,437. The restitution order against Budilov and Greene was reduced to a judgment, owed jointly and severally by both of them. As a result of these sanctions entered in the criminal proceeding, the Commission accepted settlements from each defendant without imposing addition monetary sanctions., For further information, please see Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17752.htm>17752</a> (September 26, 2002).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20281.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The Court had previously entered preliminarily injunctions against Grosky and Partners Holding., The Commissions complaint alleged that, from at least January 2000 through at least April 2006, Efoora raised approximately $40 million by selling over 100 million shares of its stock to about 5,000 investors. Efoora did not register its offering with the Commission as required by the federal securities laws. Efoora, through a network of finders that included Partners Holding, also solicited investors by making a series of false or misleading statements about Efooras business, including, among other things, the amount of offering proceeds it paid to its finders and that it would be receiving FDA approval for its HIV Rapid Test and conducting an IPO by certain dates. Partners Holding was not registered as a broker or dealer at the time its salespersons sold shares of Efoora stock. Grosky drafted or approved Efooras false and misleading offering materials and controlled Partners Holding. Grosky and Defendant Melvin S. Dokich also improperly sold Efoora stock issued in their names directly to the general public., The judgments enjoin Grosky and Partners Holding from future violations of Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Milby, age 53, resides in Campbellsville, Kentucky.  Mid-America is based in Portland, Tennessee., The SEC’s complaint alleges that, in 2005 and 2006, Milby and Mid-America offered and sold interests in at least 30 oil-and-gas investment programs based on false and misleading information.  The defendants falsely claimed that the investments were registered with the Commission and misrepresented the returns that investors would receive.  They provided baseless claims regarding oil production and falsely asserted that Mid-America investors were making huge profits.  The defendants also concealed important information concerning Milby’s recent personal bankruptcy and his seven-year bar from drilling in Texas.  Moreover, they did not inform investors that several state securities agencies had found the investments to be illegal and ordered the defendants to halt the offerings in those states.  Instead, they claimed, among other things, that Mid-America was “leading the way in domestic oil exploration.”  The complaint further alleges that the defendants misrepresented the use of the offering proceeds and the production revenues and misappropriated and misapplied approximately $12 million of the funds raised. , The SEC alleges that Milby and Mid-America violated the securities-registration, broker-registration, and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws — specifically, Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The Commission alleged that Ficken, a former registered representative of broker-dealer Prudential Securities, Inc., committed fraud in connection with his deceptive market timing trades in dozens of mutual funds.  The final judgment enjoined Ficken from future violations of the federal securities laws and ordered him to pay $589,854 in disgorgement and pre-judgment interest., The Commission filed its complaint against Ficken, four other former Prudential Securities registered representatives, and their former branch manager, on November 4, 2003, and amended its complaint on July 14, 2004.

According to the amended complaint, Ficken knew that the mutual fund companies monitored and attempted to restrict excessive trading in their mutual funds.  The amended complaint alleged that, to evade those restrictions when placing market timing trades, Druffner Group members disguised their own identities by establishing multiple broker identification numbers and disguised their customers’ identities by opening numerous customer accounts for what were, in reality, only a handful of customers., <a name=P14_2275></a>The final judgment enjoins Ficken from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and orders him to pay disgorgement of $494,975, representing profits gainsed as a result of the conduct alleged in the amended complaint, together with prejudgment interest thereon in the amount of $94,879.

Ballows whereabouts are unknown. Additionally, the court noted Keener gave no assurances at trial that future violations would not reoccur or that he recognized the wrongful nature of his conduct., While Casias also participated in ongoing fraud, the Court found that Casias, as a registered representative and broker-dealer, performed essentially as an instrument Ballows manipulations. In so finding, the Court concluded Casiass fraudulent trades were not isolated, but executed with great frequency during much of period at issue. The Court found that Casias displayed reckless disregard of the fraudulent schemes and gave no assurances at trial that no future violations would occur.

Acting as fronts for the traders, these companies received hefty finder fees on several thousand stock loan transactions even though they did not provide any legitimate finding services and, in many cases, were simply shell companies that were not even involved in the stock loan business. These phony finders included a mailman, a perfume salesman, and a dental receptionist. The defendants shared in the sham finder fees through secret kickback arrangements.

Darin DeMizio is a stock loan trader and registered representative associated with Morgan Stanley, where he is a stock loan trading desk supervisor.

Cobblehill is owned and controlled by Miller., The Commissions complaint alleges two interrelated finder fee schemes. The first scheme operated as follows: Over the course of nearly a decade, two stock loan traders employed by Morgan Stanley — Darin DeMizio and Peter Sherlock — and three other individuals, including relatives of the two traders, skimmed millions of dollars in stock lending profits from Morgan Stanley and another brokerage firm through illegal kickback schemes with a stock loan finder named Anthony Lupo. From July 2000 through June 2006, Lupo collected over $4 million in finder fees as a result of these schemes and paid over $1 million in undisclosed kickbacks. Pursuant to the scheme, Darin DeMizio and Sherlock caused Morgan Stanley to enter into unnecessary loan transactions at inferior interest rates for the purpose of artificially generating finder fees for Lupo. In exchange, Lupo paid cash kickbacks directly to Sherlock in cash and paid nearly $600,000 to shell companies controlled by Craig DeMizio, Darin DeMizios brother, and Donato Tramontozzi, Sherlocks brother-in-law and a fulltime pharmacist., In a second and related scheme, Joseph Miller, a finder and former stock loan trader at Morgan Stanley, paid undisclosed cash kickbacks to a stock loan trader at a division of The PNC Financial Services Group Inc.

Mark Ristow et al.</i>, Civil Action No. 07-4547 (D.N.J.)</h2>, <h2>SEC Charges Three Individuals in Multi-Million Dollar Scheme To Defraud Savings Banks And Their Depositors</h2>]","[On September 24, 2007, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey charging three individuals with securities fraud for participating in a decade-long scheme to defraud savings banks and their depositors in connection with the banks conversion from mutual to stock ownership. All three defendants agreed to settle the Commissions charges., When banks convert to stock ownership, depositors receive priority rights to purchase shares at a low price. Banking regulations and offering terms limit the number of shares a depositor may purchase and prohibit transfer of the depositors purchase rights. The SECs complaint alleges that, from 1994 to 2007, Mark Ristow orchestrated a scheme to circumvent the limitations on stock purchases in 23 bank conversions. Ristow made over $3 million in profits by selling the bank stock he had illegally obtained. The other defendants are Andrew Crabb, Ristows cousin, and Susan Gitlin, Ristows sister-in-law. In return for a share of the profits, they assisted Ristow by acting as his nominees, thus enabling Ristow to purchase even more shares. Because the offerings were oversubscribed, the defendants fraud harmed legitimate depositors who received fewer shares than they otherwise would have., More specifically, the defendants named in the Commissions complaint are:, <b>Mark Ristow</b>, age 62, a resident of Indianapolis, Indiana. He is a retired real estate investor and property manager. He received a Master of Business Administration from Harvard Business School in 1971., <b>Andrew Crabb</b>, age 41, and a resident of Mechanicstown, Ohio. He is employed as an engineer for an environmental consulting firm. Crabb is Ristows cousin and lived in New Jersey during the relevant period., <b>Susan Gitlin</b>, age 49, and a resident of Norfolk, Virginia. She is a medical research scientist and an assistant medical school professor. Gitlins sister is married to Ristow., The Commissions complaint alleges as follows:, The defendants deliberately evaded federal and state banking regulations designed to ensure that when a bank converts to stock ownership, each of the banks depositors has a fair chance to purchase stock before other interested investors do so. These and other applicable regulations and the offering terms contained in the converting banks prospectuses imposed maximum purchase limits and prohibited the transfer of depositors purchase rights. To ensure that only depositors benefit from their priority purchase rights, federal and state banking regulations prohibit depositors from transferring ownership of their purchase rights or from entering into any agreement regarding the sale or transfer of shares purchased in the offering., Ristow funded the opening of accounts in his own name and the names of Crabb and Gitlin at mutual savings banks throughout the country in the hope that they would convert to stock ownership. When any of the banks undertook a conversion, Ristow secretly funded his nominees stock purchases, controlled the sale of his nominees shares and retained most of the trading profits. Ristow also had the nominees submit stock order forms in which they falsely certified to the banks that they were purchasing the stock for their own account and had no agreement to transfer the shares or the proceeds of their sale. Ristow caused his nominees to make these material misrepresentations in 23 public stock offerings by banks. The 23 offerings were oversubscribed, and the defendants misconduct therefore limited the amount of stock available to legitimate depositors, some of whom received less stock than they requested or were completely shut out. Ristow and his nominees made over $3 million from the scheme at the expense of other depositors., Crabb and Gitlin knowingly played a key role in carrying out the scheme, and profited from their own misconduct. Crabb and Gitlin worked with Ristow to set up as many accounts as possible on Ristows behalf. To satisfy in-state residency requirements, Crabb and Gitlin opened multiple accounts in their names for Ristow at banks in their respective home states, New Jersey and Virginia. Crabb spent over a decade traveling around New Jersey opening accounts for Ristow and using his own home address for those accounts to avoid arousing suspicion. To help Ristow open an account at a New Jersey-based credit union, Crabb had his New Jersey consulting firm join the credit union and then sent the credit union a phony letter on his firms letterhead offering Ristow a position with the firm., All three defendants are charged with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. In the complaint, the Commission seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement and civil penalties. Each of the defendants, without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions complaint, has consented to the entry of a permanent injunction against violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. In addition, all three of the defendants have agreed to settle the SEC charges by consenting, without admitting or denying the complaints allegations, to the entry of permanent antifraud injunctions. In addition, Crabb will disgorge $98,628 in profits he made from the scheme, plus prejudgment interest, and pay a civil penalty in the amount of $100,000. Gitlin will disgorge $164,761 in profits, plus prejudgment interest, and pay a civil penalty in the amount of $75,000. Because Ristow has already agreed to forfeit an amount equivalent to his ill-gotten gains in conjunction with his guilty plea in the parallel criminal case, the consent judgment in the SEC case does not require disgorgement of those same ill-gotten gains. The Commissions claim for a civil penalty against Ristow will remain pending., In a parallel criminal proceeding, the United States Attorneys Office for the District of New Jersey has announced that it filed criminal charges against Ristow for the same conduct. Earlier today, Ristow agreed to pay a total of $2.85 million in forfeiture, representing his own illegal profits from the scheme., The Commission acknowledges the assistance and cooperation of the United States Attorneys Office for the District of New Jersey, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service in this matter., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2007/comp20292.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20292.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Mass.)</h2>, <h2>SEC Halts Investment Fraud and Obtains Emergency Restraining Order and Asset Freezed</h2>]","[On September 21, 2007, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed an emergency civil enforcement action in U.S. District Court in Boston to halt an ongoing investment fraud by Boston-based Transnational Fund, Inc. and Michael Luckett. That same day, the District Court granted the Commissions request for a temporary restraining order, asset freeze, and other relief., The Commissions complaint alleges that, from July 20, 2007, through the present, Transnational and Luckett conducted a fraudulent offering of unregistered securities known as Transnational Certificates using Transnationals websites, www.transnationalfund.org and www.transnationalfund.com. Defendants promised to pay investors at a rate of 6.35% annual percentage yield in nine months. At least 15 investors in six different states, including Arizona, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri, Pennsylvania, and Texas, purchased these Certificates for at least $432,400. The Complaint further alleges that, in soliciting investors, Transnational and Luckett made material misrepresentations and omissions in that they: (1) failed to disclose to investors and potential investors that Luckett would use investor funds for personal purposes; (2) misrepresented that Transnational was just like a bank; and (3) misrepresented that Transnational had been in business for years. The Complaint alleges that Luckett took thousands of dollars from at least one Transnational bank account into which he had deposited investor funds and used the money to pay, among other things, rent on a luxury condominium in Boston and the lease on a Toyota automobile. According to the Complaint, he also used bankcards issued on bank accounts holding Transnational investor funds for various personal living expenses., In other court pleadings, the Commission described the process investors went through to purchase the Certificates. Investors searched the Internet using such terms as high yield certificate of deposit on websites such as Yahoo! or Google, and a link to the Transnational website would come up. Investors then went onto the Transnational website and completed an application to purchase a Certificate online. After receiving a confirmation e-mail from Transnational instructing the investor to sign a form agreement from the website and send a cashiers check to an address in Hartford, Connecticut (which turned out to be merely a drop box that forwarded mail to Luckett in Boston), investors sent completed forms and checks to Transnational. These funds were then deposited into various bank accounts Transnational opened in the Boston Financial District within the course of several weeks., In addition to restraining the defendants from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, the District Courts order, entered by Judge Reginald C. Lindsay, freezes the defendants assets and orders the defendants to cease all operations of Transnationals websites on the Internet. The order also prohibits defendants from soliciting, accepting, or depositing any money from investors. The court set a date for hearing the Commissions request for a preliminary injunction on October 4, 2007., The Commissions complaint charges Transnational and Luckett with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. In addition to the emergency relief, the Commission seeks a preliminary injunction, a permanent injunction, disgorgement, and civil penalties., Luckett was arrested by the Boston Police Department on September 13, 2007, and charged with larceny in connection with this activity. He was arrested as he attempted to withdraw $45,000 in cash from a bank account holding Transnational investor funds., The Commission acknowledges the substantial assistance provided by the Massachusetts Financial Crimes Task Force in this matter., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2007/comp20294.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20294.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The Amended Complaint now also charges Patrick Verdi, the former supervisor of the stock loan desk of Schonfeld Securities LLC (Schonfeld), and G.P. Institutional Services, Inc. (GP), a purported stock loan finder firm controlled by Verdi, as defendants in the pending action, with engaging in a scheme to defraud Schonfeld and others through the payment of sham finder fees to GP., The Amended Complaint specifically alleges as follows: From at least March 2000 through January 2004, Verdi schemed with defendant Joseph Simone, then the head of the stock loan desk of Van der Moolen Specialist USA, LLC (VDM), to pay sham finder fees to GP on stock loan transactions in which GP performed no services. VDM paid the sham finder fees to GP on stock loan transactions in which Verdi had Schonfeld borrow stock from, or lend stock to, VDM at rates that favored VDM at Schonfelds expense. Simone had VDM lend or borrow the same stock in transactions with other firms at better rates, and GPs finder fees were paid out of VDMs artificial profits. Verdi and Simone arranged the stock loans themselves and GP did not provide any finding services on the transactions. Verdi controlled GPs bank accounts and transferred virtually all of the sham finder fees received by GP to members of his family. Verdi made approximately $2 million from the scheme., The Commissions Amended Complaint charges Verdi and GP with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The SECs settled action also charged the following former Freddie Mac executives: David W. Glenn (Glenn), its former President, Chief Operating Officer, and Vice-Chairman of the Board; Vaughn A. Clarke (Clarke), its former CFO; Robert C. Dean (Dean), a former Senior Vice President; and Nazir G. Dossani (Dossani), a former Senior Vice President., The SECs Complaint alleges that Freddie Mac engaged in a fraudulent scheme that deceived investors about its true performance, profitability, and growth trends, and that in 2000, 2001 and 2002 the Company misreported its net income in each of those years by 30.5%, 23.9% and 42.9%, respectively. As outlined in the Commissions Complaint, Freddie Macs senior management exerted consistent pressure to have the Company report smooth and dependable earnings growth and to present investors with the image of a company that would continue to generate predictable and growing earnings. The Companys violations were the direct result of this corporate culture that placed great emphasis on steady earnings, and a senior management that fostered a corporate image that was touted as Steady Freddie to the marketplace, Among the violative conduct alleged in the Complaint was the use of certain transactions to nullify the transitional effects of the Companys implementation of accounting standard SFAS 133(which relates to accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities); the improper change in valuing the Companys swaptions portfolio at year-end 2000; the improper use of derivatives to shift earnings between periods; the improper use of a reserve in connection with the Companys application of SFAS 91 (which relates to accounting for loan origination costs); the use of certain transactions to nullify the effects of an accounting pronouncement known as Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 99-20; and the maintenance and reporting of a reserves for losses on loans materially in excess of probable losses., In its settlement with the Commission, Freddie Mac agreed, without admitting or denying the allegations, to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins the Company from violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, which are anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws. Freddie Mac also agreed to pay a $50 million civil penalty, which is expected to be distributed to injured investors through a Fair Fund. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions Complaint, Glenn, Clarke, and Dossani agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act. In a separate proceeding, Dean consented to the entry of a Commission Order requiring the he cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act.

The Commissions complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that, during the period of misconduct, the son, a former investment banker with Banc of America Securities, LLC (BAS), obtained material, nonpublic information about three issuers who were clients of BAS and tipped his father, who then traded in the securities of those issuers. At the time of the trading, the father was employed by Broadband Capital Management, LLC, a registered broker-dealer through whom he placed his illegal trades. The complaint also alleges that twice during the Commission staffs investigation, the father-with the sons assistance-created fraudulent documents that the father provided to the Commission staff in an effort to mislead the Commission staff as to the reasons for his trades in two of the issuers., Named in the complaint are:, <p class=em2><b>Elliot Joel Smith</b> (E.

Smith purchased shares of the common stock of Aspen, Regeneration, and Triangle in brokerage accounts over which he exercised control. When the information was later disclosed, the prices of the respective securities rose and E. Smith or accounts he controlled profited.

According to the Commission, investment adviser Charles Trigilio withdrew more than $3.4 million from his clients accounts for his personal use, transferred money from one client to another in a classic Ponzi scheme tactic, and gave clients false information about their investments to hide the losses from his spectacularly unsuccessful trading strategy., According to the Commissions complaint, filed today in federal district court in Los Angeles, Trigilio has managed at least 96 brokerage accounts belonging to dozens of investors at a number of different brokerage firms since at least 2003. He concealed his identity from the brokerage firms, pretending to be the investor when making trades and transferring money from their accounts to himself and others. The Commission alleges that Trigilio misappropriated $3.1 million from investor accounts at one brokerage firm alone, transferring the money to bank accounts held in his name or the name of his wife and her business., The Commissions complaint further alleges Trigilio fraudulently concealed the large losses he incurred trading options in his clients accounts. Between January 2006 and September 2007, the accounts handled by Trigilio at one brokerage firm suffered nearly $2 million in trading losses. According to the Commission, Trigilio concealed the losses from investors by providing them with phony account information. He further hid his fraud by using money obtained from several clients to pay promised returns. Among other things, the Commission alleges he concealed his activities by using his clients personal information to establish and control their brokerage accounts while requiring clients to agree not to directly contact the brokers themselves., The Commissions complaint charges Trigilio with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act, and seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions, disgorgement, and civil penalties. The Commission further seeks disgorgement of all investor funds disbursed to relief defendant, Razel Trigilio. In addition, the Commission is seeking an order temporarily prohibiting Trigilio from further trading in the brokerage accounts of his investor clients in order to manage and preserve any remaining investor funds.

The complaint alleges that the defendants misappropriated investor funds to pay for telemarketing lead lists, commissions to Johnson and his sales agents, rent for telemarketing office space, and otherwise fund the solicitation of additional investors.  The complaint further alleges that although the defendants opened a Laguna Hills facility in late 2006, it was nothing more than a shell and, as a result of the defendants misuse of investor monies, quickly fell behind on its rent and equipment leasing obligations., The Complaint alleges that Johnson, Consulting Dynamics and Advance Body Imaging violated the securities registration provisions of Section 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933, as well as the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

(Syncor) prior to the companys acquisition in January 2003. The action stems from payments made by Syncors former subsidiary, Syncor Taiwan, Inc. (Syncor Taiwan), to doctors employed by private and public hospitals in Taiwan over a 17-year period ending in 2002. In connection with these payments, the Commission charged Fu with violating, and aiding and abetting Syncors violations of, the books-and-records and internal-accounting-controls provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, Fu has consented to the entry of a final judgment imposing a permanent injunction and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $75,000., The Commissions complaint alleges that from 1985 through December 2002, Syncor Taiwan paid commissions and, commencing in 1997, referral fees to doctors employed by private and public hospitals in Taiwan. The total alleged payments to doctors averaged over $30,000 per year from 1989 through at least 1993 and increased to average over $170,000 per year from at least 1997 through the first half of 2002. According to the complaint, Syncor Taiwan improperly recorded these payments in its accounting books and records as Advertising and Promotions expenses. The subsidiarys books and records were then consolidated into the books and records of Syncor and included in the financial statements Syncor filed with the Commission., The Commissions complaint alleges that Fu had the authority to maintain compliance with existing internal accounting controls and to implement additional internal accounting controls sufficient to ensure that Syncor Taiwan executed and recorded payments in compliance with the books-and-records and internal-accounting-controls provisions of the FCPA (Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act)). The complaint further alleges that Fu was aware at all relevant times that Syncor Taiwan was paying commissions and referral fees and that, at least as early as 1994, he knew or was reckless in not knowing that payments were improperly recorded on the books and records of Syncor Taiwan and, thus, of Syncor. Nonetheless, as alleged in the complaint, Fu failed to maintain compliance with existing internal accounting controls and also failed to implement additional internal accounting controls, thereby causing payments to be improperly recorded and aiding and abetting Syncors violations of the books-and-records and internal-accounting-controls provisions of the FCPA., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Fu has agreed to settle the Commissions charges by consenting to the entry of a final judgment: (i) permanently enjoining him from future violations of Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder, and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act; and (ii) ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $75,000., Previously, in December 2002, the Commission instituted settled civil and administrative proceedings against Syncor arising out of alleged payments made by certain of Syncors foreign subsidiaries, including Syncor Taiwan, to doctors employed by hospitals controlled by foreign authorities. Without admitting or denying the allegations, Syncor consented to pay a $500,000 civil penalty and to be subject to a cease-and-desist order. <i>See SEC v. Syncor International Corp.</i>, C.A.

Warren and Exo-Brain were each ordered to pay disgorgement of $6,400,000, pre-judgment interest in the amount of $1,981,734.50 and civil penalties of $75,000. The defendants were ordered to pay these amounts within 30 days from the entry of the judgment. The Court made specific findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding Warrens conduct in the fraudulent offer and sale of unregistered Exo-Brain securities., The courts order found that in 2000 and 2001, the defendants raised up to $12.4 million from investors in a series of fraudulent, unregistered offerings of securities. The court concluded that the defendants made misrepresentations and omissions of material facts to investors in connection with the offer and sale of securities including, among other things, misrepresenting the capabilities and developmental status of the technology, misrepresenting the companys financial condition, and that the defendants disregarded warnings of legal counsel recommending against further efforts to raise funds from investors. Additionally, the court found that in their May 2000 financial statement, the defendants failed to disclose to investors that E-Brain LLC lost money at a considerably faster pace than depicted in the limited financial statements provided to investors, and that the statement only reflected the results of operation for the first month of the companys existence. The court also found that E-Brain LLC, in order to fund its operation, had to seek investor funds six times in calendar year 2000. The court concluded that in the defendants first offer to investors dated December 10, 1999, Warren falsely claimed that a prototype had been developed which could, among other things, send e-mails and faxes and browse the Internet, when, in fact, no prototype with these abilities had been developed., In earlier orders of the Court dated February 11 and February 17, 2005, the Court permanently restrained Warren and Exo-Brain from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Leftwich and John A. Nieto. At the time of the alleged misconduct, Chavarria, Leftwich and Nieto were employed as accountants in Dell Inc.s (Dell) Americas Business Unit at its corporate headquarters in Round Rock, Texas. The Commission alleges that the three accountants engaged in unlawful insider trading in the securities of Dell in advance of a public announcement on August 11, 2005 that Dells second quarter 2006 revenues had fallen short of the companys earlier guidance and analysts expectations. In addition, the Commission alleges that Leftwich engaged in unlawful insider trading when he purchased Dell securities in advance of a Dell earnings release on October 31, 2005 announcing Dells failure to hit its earnings target for the third quarter 2006., In its complaint, the Commission alleges that, in July and August 2005, Chavarria, Leftwich and Nieto purchased Dell put options while in possession of material, non-public information regarding Dells financial performance for the second quarter of 2006. Specifically, the Defendants knew, in advance of the August 11, 2005 release, that the companys second quarter revenues had fallen short of the companys earlier guidance and analysts expectations. On the day after the announcement of the revenues miss, Dells stock price dropped more than 7% on the news. By selling their Dell put options, the Defendants profited as follows: Chavarria, $153,240; Leftwich, $81,658; and Nieto, $16,677., In addition, on October 31, 2005, Leftwich bought Dell put options prior to a negative Dell earnings announcement. The negative news caused an 8.3% decline in Dells stock price. Leftwich sold the puts on the following day and profited $24,769., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Chavarria and Nieto have agreed to settle the Commissions charges by consenting to the entry of a final judgment that would: (i) permanently enjoin them from further violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; (ii) order them to pay $153,240 and $16,677, respectively, in disgorgement; (iii) order them to pay $16,673 and $2,059, respectively, in prejudgment interest; and (iv) order them to pay a civil penalty of $153,240 and $16,677, respectively. With regard to Leftwich, the Commission alleges in its complaint that Leftwich violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. In its complaint, the Commission seeks against Leftwich a permanent injunction, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, and a civil money penalty.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20313.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Using a network of independent sales agents, USPT offers prospective investors residing primarily in Latin America the opportunity to invest in a variety of mutual funds available from well-known U.S. fund companies (and at least one hedge fund), through a trust created at a U.S. bank on behalf of each investor. Touting its experience and high quality financial products, USPT offers and sells mutual funds through a series of investment plans that provide investors with a choice of making either annual contributions for multiple years or a single, lump-sum contribution to remain invested for at least ten years. Among other misrepresentations, USPT and its principals have failed to disclose that they are taking as much as 85% of investors contributions in the annual plan, and 12% of contributions in the lump-sum plan, to pay undisclosed exorbitant commissions, fees and a net profit to USPT., The Commissions complaint charges the defendants with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Meridian also backdated officer certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the SEC charged., Meridian owns interests in companies that engage in e-commerce in the medical industry, and provides management services to those companies.  According to the Commissions complaint, during the second and third quarters of its 2004 fiscal year, Meridian improperly recognized a $30 million default judgment and interest as assets and income when it had no reasonable basis to believe the judgment was collectible.  As a result, Meridian turned quarterly losses of 7 cents per share into earnings of $2.12 per share.  Following the filing of the 2004 second quarter report, Meridians stock price doubled.  Similarly, Meridian recognized additional interest on the default judgment during the third quarter of 2004.  The complaint alleges that this improper recognition again turned quarterly losses to quarterly gains.  Following the filing of its 2004 third quarter report, Meridians stock price increased by 40%., In addition to Meridian, the complaint names Anthony C. Dike, age 52, of Los Angeles, Calif., Meridians chairman and chief executive officer at the time, and Michelle V. Nguyen, age 48, of Orange, Calif., Meridians former principal financial officer.  Dike and Nguyen are alleged to have prepared misleading financial statements by booking the $30 million default judgment when neither had any reasonable basis to believe the judgment was collectible.  The complaint further alleges that when Dike filed Meridians second and third quarter reports, he included Nguyens name on the Sarbanes-Oxley Act certifications filed with the reports even though he knew Nguyen had not signed them.  While Nguyen signed the certifications included with Meridians second quarter report after it had been filed, she never signed the certifications included with Meridians third quarter report.

York International, a global provider of heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and refrigeration products and services, was acquired by Johnson Controls, Inc. in 2005.  The Commissions complaint alleges that York Internationals Delaware subsidiary paid approximately $522,500 to an intermediary while knowing that most of the money was intended to bribe United Arab Emirate officials; York Internationals Dubai subsidiary authorized and made approximately $647,110 in kickback payments under the U.N. Oil for Food Program; and that York Internationals subsidiaries devised elaborate schemes to conceal kickback payments of over $7.5 million made to secure orders on certain commercial and government projects in the Middle East, India, China, Nigeria and Europe., According to the Commissions Complaint:, In 2003 and 2004, York Internationals Delaware subsidiary, York Air Conditioning and Refrigeration, Inc. (YACR) paid approximately $522,500 to an intermediary while knowing that most of the money was intended to bribe United Arab Emirate officials to secure contracts in connection with the construction of a government-owned luxury hotel called the Conference Palace.  Altogether, thirteen illicit payments were made on this project, totaling $550,000., In addition, from 2000 to 2003, York Internationals Dubai subsidiary authorized and made approximately $647,110 in kickback payments in connection with its sale of humanitarian goods to Iraq under the Oil for Food Program (the Program).  Although the payments were characterized as after-sales service fees, no bona fide services were actually performed.  The Program provided humanitarian relief to the Iraqi population during the time that Iraq was subject to international trade sanctions.  The kickback payments paid in connection with York Internationals subsidiarys sale of goods were paid by a third party to Iraqi-controlled accounts in countries such as Jordan., From 2001 through 2006, York International, through certain subsidiaries, made over $7.5 million in illicit payments to secure orders on certain commercial and government projects in the Middle East, India, China, Nigeria and Europe.  York Internationals subsidiaries devised elaborate schemes to conceal kickback payments to certain individuals who had enough influence to secure contracts for York Internationals subsidiaries.  These payments were referred to internally as consultancy payments, however, similar to the payments made under the Oil for Food Program, no bona fide services were performed.  A total of 854 improper consultancy payments were made on approximately 774 contracts -- 302 projects involved government end-users, such as government owned companies, public hospitals, or schools., York International violated the anti-bribery provision by paying bribes to UAE officials to secure business.  York International failed to devise and maintain an effective system of internal controls to prevent or detect numerous violations, as shown by: 1) the extent and duration of the illicit payment schemes, 2) the involvement of multiple subsidiaries and numerous managers and employees, and 3) the improper recording of these payments in the books and records. York International failed to accurately record in its books and records the kickbacks that were authorized for payment to Iraq, the bribes in the UAE, and the illicit consultancy payments made in various countries., York International, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, ordering it to disgorge $8,949,132 in profits, plus $1,083,748 in pre-judgment interest, and to pay a civil penalty of $2,000,000.  York International is also ordered to retain an independent compliance monitor.

Among other things, the Order also freezes the Defendants assets and the assets of Defendant Dawsons spouse, Lisa Dawson., The Commissions complaint, filed on November 30, 2006, alleges that the Defendants misappropriated more than $2 million from at least seven investment advisory clients. Dawson, the president and sole shareholder of BMG and Ethan Thomas, targeted primarily elderly investors living on Long Island, and advised these clients to surrender existing variable annuity policies, mortgage their residences, and transfer the proceeds to Ethan Thomas for Dawson to manage through BMG, his investment advisory firm. In connection with Dawsons advisory services, Dawson made materially false and misleading statements to his clients about their investments and the use of their funds. Dawson promised between a 12 and 15 percent guaranteed return on each investment, and he assured clients that he would arrange to pay their mortgages and/or pay monthly returns on the investments. To the extent that the 12 to 15 percent return exceeded the clients mortgage obligation, Dawson promised that excess return would be accrued in the clients account. Rather than investing the money as promised, Dawson abused his clients trust and misappropriated their funds for his own use. Dawson withdrew over $100,000 of his clients funds for his own benefit. At the same time, Dawson failed to make investors mortgage payments as he had promised. In October and November 2006, because some investors received notices that their mortgages were not being paid, they complained to Dawson, who refused to return their calls and closed BMGs office., In its enforcement action, the Commission is seeking additional relief, including orders permanently enjoining the Defendants from committing future violations of the foregoing federal securities laws, and a final judgment ordering the Defendants to disgorge ill-gotten gains and assessing civil penalties.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20321.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The Commission alleged that, in fact, the defendants were using the funds from new investors to pay prior investors and to enrich themselves. The Commission charged Greth and Melton with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and further charged Greth with violations of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940., Greth died immediately after the filing of the Civil Action, and the Commission pursued its claims for monetary relief against Greths Estate. The Commission ultimately resolved the litigation with both the Estate and Melton, resulting in judgments to which the defendants consented without admitting or denying the factual allegations in the Complaint.

The stolen funds were part of the compensation the Customer received in 2004 from the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund of 2001 (the Fund). The broker named in the complaint, Kevin James Dunn, Jr. (Dunn), was employed by MetLife Securities, Inc. (MetLife) at the time of the fraud., The Commissions complaint specifically alleges as follows: Dunn was friends with the Customer and convinced her to invest her entire recovery from the Fund with MetLife and allow him to manage the investment. Dunn then proceeded to betray the Customers trust by engaging in a series of material misrepresentations about the purchase and sale of securities in her account and other fraudulent acts aimed at swindling her out of a substantial portion of the compensation she received from the Fund. From September 2005 through April 2007, Dunn misappropriated a total of $248,000 from the Customer by fraudulently creating a joint account in both of their names, forging her signature on wire transfers from the joint account, and telling her outrageous lies about the status of her securities investments to deceive her into providing him with blank checks that he deposited into his own bank account. Although MetLife terminated Dunn in February 2007, he continued to defraud the Customer for another two months by acting as if he was still employed as a broker at MetLife and deceiving her into giving him additional blank checks., Dunn is charged with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

On October 11, the Court entered an order, with the defendants consent, granting a preliminary injunction against Samples and POG, and freezing their assets and ordering an accounting., The complaint alleges that Samples offered and sold almost $1 million worth of POGs Private Capital Accounts to the public.

(HSBC), imposing a $10 million penalty and ordering HSBC to pay disgorgement in the amount of $463,893, with prejudgment interest of $36,667, for allowing its name and logo to be used in connection with a Florida-based offering fraud by Pension Fund of America, L.C. (Pension Fund).  The Commissions civil action was filed on September 19, 2007 to coincide with the Commissions institution of a settled cease-and-desist proceeding with HSBC., The Commissions Complaint alleges that from August 2003 to March 2005, HSBC served as trustee for the investment component of Pension Fund and its affiliated entities trust plans.  Since at least 1999, Pension Fund sold retirement and college trust plans that purportedly provided term life insurance and the opportunity to invest in one or more pre-selected mutual funds.  However, Pension Fund failed to disclose, among other things, that it was taking up to 95 percent of the investors funds to pay commissions and fees.  Pension Fund raised at least $127 million from more than 3,400 investors, primarily from Central and South America.  On March 28, 2005, the SEC filed an emergency action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida against Pension Fund and its principals to halt the offering fraud.  The Court appointed a receiver over Pension Fund, who shut down its operations, marshaled its assets, and developed a claims process to distribute recovered funds to its investor victims., According to the Commissions Complaint, HSBC allowed the use of its name and logo in Pension Funds offering materials.  HSBC also allowed Pension Fund to use marketing materials that falsely suggested that the trust plans were co-developed by HSBC and Pension Fund, and that investors funds would be totally safe because the money would be deposited in a trust account at HSBC.  In reality, Pension Fund deposited investors funds in an ordinary checking account in its name at HSBC, and used up to 95 percent of such funds to pay its own undisclosed sales commissions, expenses and fees.  Pension Funds marketing brochures provided a list of mutual funds offered as part of the trust plans, but did not disclose any information about the sales commissions, administrative expenses, or the front-load mutual fund fees charged to investors.  HSBC failed to follow its own internal procedures in reviewing and approving certain Pension Fund offering materials., Additionally, HSBC actively participated in the selection of offshore, high front-load mutual funds to be offered to prospective investors under a negotiated fee arrangement between HSBC and Pension Fund.  However, neither the amount of the funds sales loads, nor HSBCs role in the funds selection, were disclosed to investors.  In October 2003, shortly after HSBC became trustee for Pension Funds plans, HSBC drafted a letter on its own letterhead announcing the new relationship and inviting certain of Pension Funds existing investors to transfer their funds to HSBC.   Pension Fund sent the letter to approximately half of its existing investors, and enclosed a form bearing HSBCs logo that listed new mutual fund selections available upon transfer to HSBC.   Neither the letter nor the enclosure disclosed that investors would incur new front-load fees in connection with such transfers, or the amounts of those prospective costs.  As a result, the Complaint alleges that HSBC violated Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933., The Final Judgment was entered in the civil case with HSBCs consent, without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions Complaint.  The Final Judgment orders HSBC to pay a total of approximately $10.5 million, which will be paid into a Fair Fund for the benefit of investors injured in the Pension Fund offering fraud.,  ]"

According to the complaint, Hollnagel, a resident of Chicago, Illinois, and BCI, headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, told investors that they would use investor funds to purchase specifically identified commercial aircraft for the LLCs and, in turn, lease the aircraft to commercial airlines. According to the complaint, investors were told they would receive part of the lease revenue from the particular aircraft, in the form of regular monthly payments, as their return. The complaint further alleged that the Defendants also told investors that if an aircraft owned by an LLC was sold, investors were entitled to half of all proceeds from the sale above and beyond their capital contribution. In reality, according to the complaint, Defendants operated a massive Ponzi scheme. In addition, the complaint alleged that, in 2007, Defendants continued their scheme by fraudulently repurchasing investors interests through materially misleading statements. Finally, the complaint alleges that, as a result of their conduct, Hollnagel and BCI violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder., As part of the Order entered on August 22, 2007, the court found that BCI and Hollnagel made material misrepresentations to investors and acted with scienter.  As a result, the Court issued a preliminary injunction against Hollnagel and BCI enjoining them from further violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The Court declined, however, to grant the Commissions request for an asset freeze or the appointment of a receiver at that time to give BCI and Hollnagel the opportunity to fulfill their promise to pay investors within 60 days the $48 million that is due to them. The Court further provided, among other things, that BCI must provide certain reports to the Commission on a weekly basis and must provide notice to the Commission prior to any significant withdrawals (in excess of $20,000)., In its Motion for an Order to Show Cause and the Supplement to the Motion, the Commission alleges, among other things, that Defendants, on multiple occasions, did not comply with the reporting and notice requirements set forth in the Order and that Defendants were not repaying all of the investors in cash as required by the Order. , For additional information, see <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20254.htm>Litigation Release No. 20254</a> (Aug. 24, 2007)., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2007/20330-m.pdf>Motion for Order to Show Cause</a> and <a href=/litigation/complaints/2007/20330-m2.pdf>Supplement to Motion for Order to Show Cause</a>,  ]"

Brody violated Rule 105 of Regulation M under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 when they used shares purchased in at least eighteen registered public offerings to cover short sales that they made during a restricted period.  The Defendants realized profits in excess of $1.48 million from the illegal trades., In general, Rule 105 seeks to prevent manipulative trading by short sellers prior to registered public offerings and to promote offering prices that are based upon open market prices, determined by supply and demand, rather than by artificial forces.  At the time of the alleged violations, Rule 105 generally prohibited short sellers, regardless of intent, from using securities purchased in registered public offerings to cover short sales that occurred during the five business days before the pricing of the offerings (the restricted period).  The Defendants realized profits from their illegal trading because Colonial Fund typically sold shares short during the restricted period at prices that were higher than what it would pay a short time later when it purchased shares in the registered public offerings., The Complaint also alleges that, in an effort to conceal their illegal trading, the Defendants often engaged in sham market trades after covering Colonial Funds restricted period short positions.  For example, Colonial Fund, after covering, entered riskless cross trades to buy and sell the same quantity of shares, at the same price, and from the same broker.  Defendant Brody, acting through Colonial Investment, directed, authorized, supervised, and profited from the illegal trading alleged in the Complaint., The Commission seeks an injunction prohibiting each Defendant from further violating Rule 105 of Regulation M.

Nortel Networks Corporation and Nortel Networks Limited</i>, Civil Action No. 07-CV-8851 (S.D.N.Y.)</h2>, <h2>Nortel Networks Pays $35 Million to Settle Financial Fraud Charges</h2>]","[, Without admitting or denying the Commissions charges, Nortel has agreed to settle the Commissions action by consenting to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud, reporting, books and records and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws - namely, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13.  Nortel also has agreed to pay a $35 million civil penalty, which the Commission will seek to place in a Fair Fund for distribution to affected shareholders, and to report periodically to the Commissions staff on its progress in implementing remedial measures and resolving an outstanding material weakness over its revenue recognition procedures., According to the Commissions complaint, from late 2000 through January 2001, Nortel made changes to its revenue recognition policies that were not in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).  The changes were made to fraudulently accelerate revenue into 2000 to meet its publicly-announced revenue targets for the fourth quarter of 2000 and for that year.  The complaint alleges that Nortel also selectively reversed certain revenue entries during the 2000 year-end closing process when its acceleration efforts pulled in more revenue than necessary to meet its targets.  These actions, the complaint alleges, inflated Nortels fourth quarter and fiscal year 2000 revenues by approximately $1.4 billion., The complaint further alleges that Nortel had improperly established, and was improperly maintaining, over $400 million in excess reserves by the time it announced its fiscal year 2002 financial results.  According to the complaint, these reserve manipulations erased Nortels fourth quarter 2002 pro forma profit and allowed it to report a loss instead so that Nortel would not show a profit earlier than it had previously forecast to the market.  The complaint alleges that in the first and second quarters of 2003, Nortel improperly released approximately $500 million in excess reserves to boost its earnings and fabricate a return to profitability.  These efforts turned Nortels first quarter 2003 loss into a reported profit under US GAAP, and largely erased its second quarter loss while generating a pro forma profit.  According to the complaint, in both quarters Nortels inflated earnings allowed it to pay tens of millions of dollars in so-called return to profitability bonuses, largely to a select group of senior managers., In settling the matter, the Commission acknowledges Nortels substantial remedial efforts and cooperation., The Commission previously announced the filing of civil fraud charges in U.S. District Court against Nortels former CEO Frank Dunn, former CFO Douglas Beatty, former Controller Michael Gollogly and former Assistant Controller MaryAnne Pahapill (a.k.a. Mary Anne Poland) for their roles in Nortels accounting fraud.

Lenzner and Michael P. Pitterich, both of whom reside in Sewickley, Pennsylvania. The Commissions complaint alleges they engaged in unlawful insider trading. In particular, Pitterich unlawfully purchased 2,000 shares of the common stock of NSD Bancorp, Inc. (NSD Bancorp) in advance of an October 15, 2004, public announcement of a merger between NSD Bancorp and F.N.B. Corporation (FNB) and after being tipped about the merger by Lenzner, a member of NSD Bancorps Board of Directors. Following the announcement, NSD Bancorps share price increased $12.68 or 52 percent, from $24.02 to $36.70. On October 18, 2004, three days after NSD Bancorps public announcement, Pitterich sold all 2,000 shares of his stock for a profit of $25,230., The Commissions complaint further alleges that Pitterich knew Lenzner was a member of NSD Bancorps Board of Directors. Because of his position as a Director, by September 15, 2004, Lenzner knew that at least four companies had submitted indications of interest in acquiring NSD Bancorp and that FNB had specifically offered $40 per share. The complaint further alleges that on September 22, 2004, Lenzner provided Pitterich with such information at or before they attended a Pittsburgh Pirates baseball game. On the morning of September 23, 2004, Pitterich, who had no prior history of trading in the securities of NSD Bancorp, purchased 1,000 shares of NSD Bancorps stock on the basis of the material, nonpublic information provided to him by Lenzner. On October 1, 2004, Pitterich, on the basis of the same information, purchased an additional 1,000 shares.

Newman and Steven A. Newman; a former director of Xybernaut and outside counsel to Xybernaut and Ramp Corporation, Martin E. Weisberg; and Ramps former CEO, Andrew Brown. The Commissions complaint charges the defendants with engaging in a scheme to conceal Saltsman and Eitans control over Ramp and Xybernaut., In particular, the Commissions complaint alleges that between 2001 and 2004, Saltsman and Eitan, through 34 nominees, invested more than $88 million in private investments in public equity (PIPE) transactions of Xybernaut and Ramp, companies that traded on the NASDAQ Small Cap Market and the American Stock Exchange, respectively. During that period, Xybernaut issued more than 123 million shares of common stock to 21 nominees of Saltsman and Eitan in return for more than $67 million in PIPE financing. Similarly, between December 2002 and November 2004, Ramp issued more than 161 million shares of common stock to 13 nominees of Saltsman and Eitan in return for more than $21 million in PIPE financing. Xybernaut and Ramp filed 18 registration statements registering the resale of those shares, and those registration statements were misleading because, among other things, they created the impression that the investors were independent from one another and controlled by persons other than Saltsman and Eitan. Saltsman and Eitan profited from the scheme by executing short sales and covering those short positions with newly issued PIPE shares in violation of the registration provisions of the federal securities laws. Saltsman and Eitan often executed wash sales between their various nominee accounts in order to disguise these violations of the federal securities laws. As a result of their illegal conduct, Saltsman and Eitan received a total of more than $55 million in illicit profits by trading in Ramp and Xybernaut stock., The complaint also alleges that Saltsman and Eitan paid officers and directors of Ramp and Xybernaut to ensure access to future PIPE deals and maintain control over the companies. In December 2003, Saltsman and Eitan allegedly gave Brown $50,000 in cash. In 2003 and 2004, Saltsman and Eitan paid $4.1 million to Steven Newman and Weisberg. These payments, as well as the relationships that developed between the companies management and Saltsman and Eitan, were never disclosed in Ramp or Xybernauts corporate filings or registration statements., The Commissions complaint further alleges that during the course of the scheme, Brown, Weisberg, Edward Newman and Steven Newman provided valuable assistance to Saltsman and Eitan. In 2001, Weisberg helped Edward Newman and Steven Newman transfer a total of 1.1 million shares of their own Xybernaut stock to Saltsman and Eitan to allow Saltsman and Eitan to cover existing short positions in Xybernaut. In 2003, Weisberg lied to the Commission staff about sales of securities to Saltsman and Eitan that occurred during the pendency of a PIPE registration statement. Brown, Weisberg, Edward Newman and Steve Newman also concealed Saltsman and Eitans control over the PIPE investments and the nominees., The complaint alleges that each of the defendants violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that Saltsman and Eitan also violated Sections 5(a), 5(b)(2), and 5(c) of the Securities Act and Sections 13(d) and 16(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13d-1, 13d-2, and 16a-3 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that Weisberg aided and abetted Xybernauts violations of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 thereunder, and that Steven Newman, Edward Newman, and Brown violated Exchange Act Rule 13a-14.

In its enforcement action, the Commission is seeking an order permanently enjoining the defendants from future violations of the foregoing provisions of the federal securities laws, and a final judgment ordering disgorgement of ill-gotten gains and civil penalties.

The Order, among other things, temporarily enjoined Loffredi and Raymond Financial from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and froze their assets. The Court also entered an agreed order freezing the assets of Advanced Sales and Marketing Corporation (Advanced Sales), a company owned by Loffredis wife., The Commissions civil injunctive action, filed earlier that same day, alleges that Defendants Loffredi and Raymond Financial violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. According to the allegations in the Commissions complaint, from at least August 2003 to the present, Loffredi, a registered representative and the President of Raymond Financial, raised at least $2.8 million from at least fourteen customers by falsely representing that he would invest their funds in securities, primarily in the form of purported certificates of deposit (CDs). Instead of using the customers money to purchase securities, Loffredi used the customers funds to pay his personal and business expenses, to make payments to relief defendant Advanced Sales, to make payments to other customers who had invested in fictitious securities, and on at least one occasion to make payments on behalf of his wife, Karen Loffredi, a relief defendant. The Commission further alleges that Loffredi prepared and gave customers Raymond Financial account statements which falsely represented that customers owned CDs and other securities, and he also sent them false IRS Forms 1099., In addition to the emergency relief already obtained, the Complaint seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions against Loffredi and Raymond Financial. The Complaint also seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains from Loffredi, Raymond Financial, Advanced Sales and Karen Loffredi, and the imposition of civil penalties against Loffredi and Raymond Financial., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2007/comp20343.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20343.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The defendants allegedly promised returns to investors of 4% to 15% a month ostensibly through investments in real estate. However, it is alleged that the defendants actually operated a Ponzi scheme in which returns paid to earlier investors were paid from funds invested by new investors. It is also alleged that Petersen made a variety of misrepresentations to investors in the offer of notes issued by her companies including: (1) funds invested in the notes would be used to develop real estate or invest in other business ventures; and (2) the high rates of return were the result of her successful operations. The Commissions complaint further alleges that Petersen provided fictitious financial statements to investors to solicit their funds.

The judge also ordered Silva to pay 50 percent of any other compensation or income he receives from any other source to the Distribution Fund. Silva must continue these payments until he satisfies the remaining $206,259 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest. Judge Johnson also ordered Silva to use 25 percent of his gross monthly income to pay his attorneys fees; once he pays those fees, he must remit 75 percent of his gross monthly income to the Distribution Fund., The contempt order made factual findings that Silva had failed to diligently pursue employment for almost two years after the judgment was entered against him, and had used money relatives gave him on luxury and discretionary expenses such as travel, expensive meals, and numerous retail purchases instead of paying any money towards the judgment., Silva had consented to entry of a Final Judgment enjoining him from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), 17(a)(2), 17(a)(3) and 17(b) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 15(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which was entered on September 29, 2005.

The Commissions complaint alleges that Quan Zhu, age 43, of Santa Monica, Calif., traded in Countrywide stock while aware of confidential negative earnings information and in breach of his fiduciary duty to Countrywide. Zhu agreed to settle the charges, without admitting or denying the allegations, by repaying his ill-gotten trading profits and paying a monetary penalty twice the amount, for a total of approximately $108,840., On October 20, 2004, Countrywide issued a press release announcing that its third quarter earnings per share were $0.94, compared to $1.93 the year before. That day, Countrywides stock price fell 11.5% and trading volume increased 307%. The Commissions complaint alleges that by mid-October 2004, Alan Cao, a vice president of financial planning, tipped Zhu with material, nonpublic information that Countrywide would fall short of the Wall Street analysts consensus estimate for the third quarter earnings., After receiving that insider information and beginning on October 15, 2004, Zhu sold shares of Countrywide stock already owned, purchased Countrywide put options, and sold short Countrywide stock in his wifes brokerage account. A few hours after the October 20 earnings announcement, after Countrywides stock price had declined, Zhu purchased Countrywide stock to cover the shares he sold short and sold the put options which he had purchased. Zhus insider trading resulted in total profit and losses avoided of $35,547.93., To settle the Commissions charges, Zhu consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The Commissions complaint alleges that from 2000 through 2003, four of Ingersoll-Rands subsidiaries entered into contracts in which $963,148 in kickback payments were made and $544,697 in additional payments were authorized in connection with sales of humanitarian goods to Iraq under the U.N. Oil for Food Program (the Program).  The kickbacks were characterized as after-sales service fees (ASSFs), but no bona fide services were performed.  The Program was intended to provide humanitarian relief for the Iraqi population, which faced severe hardship under international trade sanctions.  It allowed the Iraqi government to purchase humanitarian goods through a U.N. escrow account.  The kickbacks paid by Ingersoll-Rands subsidiaries and third parties diverted funds out of the escrow account and into an Iraqi slush fund.  The contracts submitted to the U.N. did not disclose that the illicit payments were included in the inflated contract prices.  The complaint also alleges that $8,000 in pocket money and travel expenses were paid to Iraqi government officials in connection with a trip to Italy., According to the Commissions Complaint:, Ingersoll-Rands German subsidiary ABG entered into six Program contracts involving kickback payments of $718,637.  In November 2000, shortly after an ABG salesman negotiated two contracts in Baghdad, the office of Ingersoll-Rands Chairman received an anonymous fax alerting the company to the kickback arrangement.  Ingersoll-Rand initiated an investigation and questioned the salesman, who admitted to agreeing to pay back $292,578 to the Iraqi Ministry.  ABG attempted to go forward with the contracts with some disclosure to the U.N. that money was going back to Iraq.  However, the U.N. advised that the payments were not allowed and the contracts were never concluded.  Ingersoll-Rand did not withdraw from the Program and failed to conduct appropriate due diligence to prevent the payment of ASSFs on other Program contracts.  Indeed, in the following year, ABG negotiated four additional contracts.  These were distributorship agreements, in which ABG sold its products to intermediaries that ABG knew would resell them into Iraq.  Ingersoll-Rand either knew or was reckless in not knowing that the distributors made, or agreed to make, a total of $426,059 in kickback payments on the four contracts., Ingersoll-Rands subsidiary I-R Italiana entered into four Program contracts involving a total of  $474,302 in ASSF payments.  To conceal the kickbacks, I-R Italiana increased the payment due on each contract by 10% and created a fictitious line item on its purchase orders to justify the extra payment.  I-R Italiana entered into two side letters with Iraq to pay the ASSFs, which were not disclosed to the U.N.  In one of the side letters, I-R Italiana stated explicitly that the fictitious purchase order description used to conceal the kickback did not represent an actual performance obligation on I-R Italianas part.  In February 2002, I-R Italiana sponsored eight officials from the Iraqi Oil Ministry to spend two days touring a manufacturing facility in Italy.

The Court ordered each defendant to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest and civil penalties, the amounts of which will be decided by the Court upon subsequent motion by the Commission., The defendants consented to the entries of the judgments without admitting or denying any of the allegations of the Commissions Amended Complaint.  The Amended Complaint, which was filed on July 3, 2007, charged that, since at least October 2005, Global, Behrmann and Hunter have orchestrated a massive Ponzi scheme and conducted an unregistered offering of securities through Globals SPIP. Global, Behrmann and Hunter solicited investors to loan Global funds for a term of one year in exchange for promised daily interest payments. Depending on the amount invested, Global promised effective annual returns of more than 1,800%. Global purported to generate revenue sufficient to pay investors their promised returns by pooling investor proceeds to purchase distressed inventory, which Global then claimed to resell through various online auction websites, including Ebay and Yahoo! Auctions, as well as through flea markets, street sales and retail storefronts. From October 2005 through March 2007, Global raised approximately $45 million from more than 9,000 investors., The Amended Complaint further alleged that Global, Behrmann and Hunter failed to disclose to investors that Globals purported business model was wholly incapable of generating the returns promised to investors, and that the vast majority of the returns paid to existing investors were in fact the proceeds invested by later investors - the key hallmark of a Ponzi scheme. The Amended Complaint also charged that Global, Behrmann, and Hunter failed to disclose other material information to investors, including that: (a) as of March 2007, Global was more than $30 million in arrears in honoring investor withdrawal requests and owed investors approximately $265 million - an amount more than $250 million in excess of all assets of Global; (b) even though they had promised investors that their investments were secured and backed by actual product inventories, they had taken no steps to secure or tie any individual investment to any actual product inventory, and the total value of the inventory was only a tiny fraction of the investments purportedly secured; (c) Global maintained no effective bookkeeping or accounting systems, and thus were completely incapable of tracking or identifying the amounts invested by investors, the returns paid to investors, the cost of inventory purchased, and the proceeds generated through inventory sales; and (d) state cease-and-desist and injunctive orders for prior violations of securities laws had been entered against Global by the states of Pennsylvania and South Dakota, against Behrmann by the states of North Dakota, Pennsylvania and South Dakota, and against Hunter by the states of Idaho, Illinois, Minnesota, North Dakota, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota and Washington. The Amended Complaint further alleged that, while representing to investors that Behrmann was an attorney and a former judge, Defendants failed to disclose that his law license had been suspended since 1999 for professional misconduct and that the Idaho Supreme Court had found Behrmann to have engaged in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation in course of his practice of law., Behrmann is the secretary and treasurer of Global and a resident of Las Vegas, Nevada.

Gerald E. Lynch of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final consent judgment against defendant Michael W. Cash, a former senior executive of a wholly-owned subsidiary of RenaissanceRe Holdings Ltd.  Cash, without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, consented to the final judgment that (i) enjoins him from violating the antifraud and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws and from aiding and abetting violations of the record-keeping and reporting provisions; (ii) requires him to pay a civil penalty of $130,000; and (iii) bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years., The Commissions amended complaint alleges that Cash, along with the other defendants, committed fraud in connection with a sham transaction that they concocted to smooth RenaissanceRes earnings.  Cash and the other defendants used two seemingly separate, unrelated contracts that were, in fact, intertwined.  Together, the contracts created a round trip of funds.  In the first contract, RenaissanceRe purported to assign at a discount $50 million of its recoverables to Inter-Ocean Reinsurance Company, Ltd. in exchange for $30 million in cash, for a net transfer to Inter-Ocean of $20 million. RenaissanceRe recorded income of $30 million upon executing the assignment agreement.  The net $20 million was held by Inter-Ocean as a bank or cookie jar that RenaissanceRe used in later periods to bolster income.  Cash and the co-defendants designed and executed a second contract in the guise of a reinsurance agreement with Inter-Ocean.  In fact, this second contract was a complete sham and was only a vehicle to refund to RenaissanceRe the $20 million from the bank or cookie jar plus the purported insurance premium paid under the reinsurance agreement.  Not only was RenaissanceRe certain to meet the conditions for coverage, it also would receive back all of the money paid to Inter-Ocean under the two agreements plus investment income earned on the money in the interim, less transactional fees and costs., RenaissanceRe accounted for the sham transaction as if it involved a real reinsurance contract that transferred risk from RenaissanceRe to Inter-Ocean, when in fact, the amended complaint alleges, Cash knew that this was not true.  As a result of RenaissanceRes accounting treatment for this transaction, the amended complaint alleges, RenaissanceRe materially understated income in 2001 and materially overstated income in 2002, at which time it made a claim under the reinsurance agreement.  It then received as apparent reinsurance proceeds the funds it had paid to Inter-Ocean and that Inter-Ocean held in a trust for RenaissanceRes benefit., Previously, RenaissanceRes former controller, defendant Martin J. Merritt, without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, consented to a partial final consent judgment that, among other things, deferred the determination of civil penalties and disgorgement to a later date.  In a related civil action, RenaissanceRe without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, also consented to a final judgment, The Commissions case against defendant James Stanard, RenaissanceRes former chief executive officer, remains pending.

Rule 105, as in effect at the time of the conduct alleged in the complaint, prohibited covering a short sale with securities obtained in certain public offerings when the short sale occurred during a specific period (usually five business days) before the pricing of the offering.  , The Commission’s complaint alleges that, from January 2004 through June 2006, Armstrong Capital, Bay Capital, and Bliss violated Rule 105 in connection with 57 public offerings by using shares purchased in those offerings to cover short sales made during the restricted period set by Rule 105.

(SHS)</h2>, <h2>SEC Files Settled Books and Records and Internal Controls Charges Against Chevron Corporation For Improper Payments to Iraq Under the U.N. Oil for Food Program — Company Agrees to Pay a Total of $30 Million</h2>]","[, According to the Commissions Complaint:, From April 17, 2001 through May 6, 2002, Chevron purchased approximately 78 million barrels of crude oil from Iraq pursuant to 36 contracts with third parties.  Chevrons traders entered into oil transactions with third parties that included the payment of $20 million in illegal surcharges to Iraq.  In January 2001, after learning of surcharge demands by Iraqs State Oil Marketing Organization (SOMO), Chevron implemented a company-wide policy prohibiting the payment of surcharges in connection with the purchase of Iraqi oil from third parties.  Among other things, the policy required traders to obtain prior written approval for all proposed Iraqi oil purchases, and charged management with reviewing each proposed Iraqi oil deal.  Chevrons traders did not follow the company-wide policy and Chevrons management was unsuccessful in ensuring its compliance.  Despite being required to consider the identity, experience and reputation of a third party seller prior to approving a proposed Iraqi oil purchase, Chevrons management relied on its traders representations.  In one such instance, a credit check by Chevron of a proposed third party seller revealed that the seller was a brass plate company.  This meant that the company had no experience in the oil business, no real business operations, and no known assets.  Despite concerns on the part of Chevrons management, Chevron entered into two transactions to purchase three million barrels of oil from the third party in January 2002.  Illegal surcharges were paid on both of these transactions and passed back to Chevron in inflated premiums., At least one trader responsible for a large portion of Chevrons purchases from Iraq factored the cost of the surcharge payments into price negotiations with third parties.  One third party seller, whose company on occasion sold oil to Chevron, stated that the trader he dealt with at Chevron and the traders bosses always knew about the illegal surcharge demands by Iraq.  At one point, the Chevron trader even asked the third party seller to persuade Iraq to reduce the amount of its surcharges.  Chevrons own internal documents show that it was well aware of the costs of doing business with Iraq.  Chevrons premium payments to third parties increased after Iraqs surcharge demands began.  Despite the obvious increase in premiums, Chevrons management routinely approved the Iraqi oil purchases proposed by Chevrons traders.  Chevron failed to devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls to detect and prevent such illicit payments.  Chevrons accounting for its Oil for Food transactions failed properly to record the true nature of the companys payments to third parties., Chevron, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, ordering it to disgorge $25,000,000 in profits, and to pay a civil penalty of $3,000,000.

Fla. filed November 15, 2007)</h2>, <h2>SEC Files Civil Action and Obtains Asset Freeze in Connection With Widespread Real Estate-Based Offering Fraud</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that today it filed a civil action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida against James Thomas Webb and several companies that he owns and controls alleging that they engaged in a real estate-based fraudulent investment scheme that raised at least $8.4 million from more than 80 investors. In its filing, the Commission sought, on an emergency basis, a court order freezing the defendants and relief defendants assets during the pendency of the case and an order requiring the defendants and relief defendants to provide a verified accounting for, among other things, the receipt and disbursement of all investor funds. The court entered the emergency Order today granting this relief and set an initial hearing date of November 26, 2007., The Commissions complaint alleges that, since 2002, Webb and companies he owns and controls, CitiRise Redevelopment, LLC (a North Carolina limited liability company), CitiRise Redevelopment, LLC (a Florida limited liability company) (collectively, Citirise), Progressive Redevelopment, LLC (Progressive), and Alpine Properties, LLC (Alpine), solicited investors to invest in a real estate scheme. According to the complaint, investors typically were asked to invest a minimum of $40,000 in the investment contracts. The Commission alleges that Webb and his companies falsely represented to investors that, in exchange for their investment, the defendants would generate substantial investment returns through the purchase, renovation and resale of distressed residential real estate in various locations including North Carolina, Virginia, Missouri and Tennessee. Instead, according to the complaint, Webb routinely used investor funds for his own purposes, including to fund his personal bank accounts and to pay for personal expenses, such as leases on exotic cars and recreation travel. The Commissions complaint also names as relief defendants Webbs wife, Sharon Sloan-Webb, and two other entities owned or controlled by Webb and/or his wife, Majestic Redevelopment, LLC and Webb Builders LLC. According to the complaint, the relief defendants controlled bank accounts that received investors funds., The complaint further alleges that defendants commingled investor funds and misrepresented that: (1) investors with Alpine, between 2002 and 2004, would receive monthly or bi-monthly returns, ranging from 20% to 114% per year, even though these returns were not paid as promised; (2) investors with CitiRise and Progressive, from approximately mid-2004, would receive substantial returns of at least 12.5% per transaction, with the prospect of multiple transactions per year, when (i) Webb, CitiRise and Progressive had no reasonable basis for stating that they could generate such returns, (ii) Webb, individually and through Alpine, had a history of defaulting on similarly promised returns, and (iii) in fact, such returns were not paid. According to the complaint, the defendants also misrepresented that each investors money would be used for purchasing, refurbishing, and developing the property named in the investment contract, when in reality money was not used to improve the properties as promised. Moreover, the Commission alleges that, since at least mid-2004, the defendants falsely represented that each investment was, in form or in substance, an all encompassing or turn-key investment, such that investors understood their initial investment would cover the entirety of the projected costs and efforts of the transaction; in reality, Webb failed to complete property renovations and failed to sell or manage the properties as promised, leaving investors responsible for various ownership costs and to their own devices to try to sell unrenovated properties., The Commissions complaint alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5. The complaint also alleges that the defendants violated the securities registration provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act. In addition to emergency relief, the Commissions complaint seeks a judgment permanently enjoining the defendants from violating these provisions of the securities laws, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The Commission also seeks from each relief defendant disgorgement off ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2007/comp20364.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20364.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

LLC with selling investors shares of limited liability companies that they claimed had received revenues from telecommunications equipment and services contracts with hotels, casinos, resorts and similar establishments, many of which were purportedly located in Las Vegas.  In fact, no such contracts ever existed.  To perpetrate their fraudulent scheme, May and E-M relied on a network of individuals, some of whom organized investment seminars to entice investors to invest with E-M., The Commissions civil injunctive complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Michigan, alleges that May, through E-M, raised as much as $250 million between 1998 and July 2007 from investors living in such states as Michigan, California, Florida, Illinois, New York, Ohio and New Jersey.  According to the complaint, May and E-M sold securities in the form of interests in limited liability companies (LLCs), and told investors that these LLCs had been contracted to install and provide telecommunications equipment and services to such major hotel chains and casinos as Hilton, MGM Grand, Motel 6, Tropicana and Sheraton.  Both orally and in writing, May and E-M promised returns in the form of monthly payments to investors for a period as long as 12 to 14 years, and guaranteed that investors, at a minimum, would receive the promised payments for approximately the first 20 to 24 months after they invested., The complaint alleges that, in reality, the LLCs did not have any telecommunication contracts with the establishments identified in offering materials provided by May and E-M.  To further their scheme, May and E-M provided some investors with copies of fictitious contracts between E-M or certain LLCs and various hotels and casinos.  Some of these fictitious contracts included the names of purported hotel executives who did not exist., The SEC complaint alleges that, as a result of their misconduct, May and E-M violated, and unless enjoined will continue to violate, Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Srebnik is one of fourteen defendants in the Commissions complaint, which alleged illegal insider trading in connection with two related schemes in which Wall Street professionals serially traded on material, nonpublic information tipped, in exchange for cash kickbacks, by insiders at UBS Securities LLC and Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., Inc., With respect to Srebnik, the Commissions complaint alleged that from at least 2001 through 2006, Mitchel S. Guttenberg, an executive director in the equity research department of UBS, illegally tipped material, nonpublic information concerning upcoming UBS analyst upgrades and downgrades to at least two Wall Street traders, Erik R. Franklin and David M. Tavdy, in exchange for sharing in the illicit profits from their trading on that information. The complaint alleged that Franklin illegally traded on this insider information for a hedge fund he managed at Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., Inc., Lyford Cay Capital, LP, and in his personal accounts at Bear Stearns. As alleged in the complaint, Andrew Srebnik worked on a trading desk at Bear Stearns where he had access to Franklins trading information. The complaint alleged that based on Franklins trading patterns and discussions with another registered representative at Bear Stearns knowledgeable of Franklins trading, Srebnik knew that Franklin was using material, nonpublic information to trade ahead of upcoming UBS analyst recommendations. The complaint further alleged that from at least March 2002 through June 2002, Srebnik monitored Franklins trading at Bear Stearns and used the UBS tips to purchase and sell securities in his personal account, in violation Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Srebnik consented to the entry of the final judgment which (i) permanently enjoins him from violating Exchange Act Section 10(b), Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Securities Act Section 17(a); and (ii) orders him to pay $54,730, which consists of disgorgement of $23,178, prejudgment interest thereon of $8,374, and a civil penalty of $23,178.

According to the complaint, Majors and Wolcott issued millions of Maximum shares in the names of alleged consultants in Mexico using false consulting contracts and false Form S-8 registration statements.

The final judgment against Pietrzak and Furlong includes permanent injunctions, disgorgement, prejudgment interest, civil penalties, officer and director bars and penny stock bars.  Pietrzak is the former CFO and general counsel to HCCA.  Furlong is the former CEO and President of the company.  The final judgment follows a lengthy jury trial which resulted in an August 3, 2007 verdict against the defendants, and in favor of the Commission on every count in the Commissions complaint., The final judgment permanently enjoins Pietrzak and Furlong from: (i) future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; (ii) future violations of aiding and abetting in the filing of false periodic reports with the Commission in violation of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13 thereunder;  (iii) future aiding and abetting violations involving internal accounting controls and books and records in violation of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act; and (iv) future violations involving failure to implement internal accounting controls in violation of Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder.  The final judgment also permanently enjoins Furlong from future violations of stock ownership reporting provisions of Sections 16(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 16a-2 and 16a-3 thereunder., As to other relief, the final judgment also orders Pietrzak to pay disgorgement in the amount of $1,282,205, representing gross proceeds he received from sales of his HCCA stock, during the period that the accounting fraud was ongoing, along with pre-judgment interest thereon in the amount of $884,317 for a total of $2,166,522.

Civil penalties were imposed against the defendants in the amounts of the respective ordered disgorgement against them, however the judgment provides that the civil penalties shall be deemed paid to the extent that disgorgement is paid.  All payments in the final judgment are due within 30 days of the entry of the judgment.  Finally the judgment bars Pietrzak and Furlong from ever again serving as an officer or director of a public company, and bars them from offering or selling penny stocks., The jury verdict, upon which the final judgment is based, included findings on a wide-range of securities law violations, including that material misrepresentations were made by HCCA in filings with the Commission, and that Pietrzak and Furlong engaged in protracted efforts to fraudulently increase the stock price and value of the company by, among other means, filing false and misleading registration statements and periodic and current reports, and by issuing false press releases and a letter to shareholders.  During the same time, Pietrzak and Furlong sold millions of their own shares of HCCA stock, fraudulently receiving the amounts that the judgment ordered them to disgorge.  The verdict also concluded that from 1996 through 2000, HCCA, through the efforts of Pietrzak and Furlong, reported to the public that it was an entity with substantial assets when, in fact, it was virtually worthless.

In reality, there were no transactions under the program that GlobeTel executives described as the off-net revenue program.  Two of GlobeTels subsidiaries - Volta and Lonestar - actually did no business.  The third subsidiary, Centerline, reported millions of dollars in business with Monterossos and Vargas own private company, Carrier Services Inc. (CSI), which did not occur., The Commission alleges that Monterosso and Vargas created hundreds of false invoices from technical data they obtained from their friends in the telecom industry.  Those invoices - and the technical data that Monterosso and Vargas provided to the companys auditors - caused GlobeTel to report $119 million in false revenue.  This so-called off-net revenue accounted for approximately 80 percent of the revenue GlobeTel reported between the third quarter of 2004 and the second quarter of 2006 - four out of every five dollars that the company reported., The complaint alleges that Monterosso and Vargas received hundreds of thousands of dollars in payments from GlobeTel - including about $300,000 in cash that Vargas withdrew from CSIs bank accounts and gave to Monterosso., GlobeTel has not filed a quarterly or annual statement for any period after the second quarter of 2006.  On May 8 and June 29, 2007, GlobeTel filed Forms 8-K announcing that it will restate its financials for 2004 through 2006 to eliminate about $120 million in revenue.  On November 2, 2007, the company filed a restated Form 10-KSB for 2004 in which the company reduced its annual revenue by $17.68 million., In its complaint, the Commission alleges that Monterosso and Vargas violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Sections 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder and that they aided and abetted violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder.

The court also froze the defendants assets, ordered the defendants to promptly provide sworn accountings, ordered that discovery be accelerated and that defendants be prohibited from destroying documents, and ordered that a preliminary injunction hearing be held on  December 12, 2007 to determine if the interim relief should be continued., The Commissions complaint, filed on November 26, alleges that defendants, operating out of a storefront boiler room in Brooklyn, have been selling limited partnership interests in Rabinovich &amp; Associates (sometimes referred to hereafter as the Fund or the firm) and other securities to investors, including senior citizens and retirees.  The Complaint further alleges that the defendants obtain investments in the Fund by cold-calling and have made, and are continuing to make, fraudulent statements to investors and prospective investors in the Fund, including: (1) false claims that the Fund has been extraordinarily profitable whereas the Funds actual performance has been dismal; and (2) false representations that Rabinovich &amp; Associates is a Wall Street firm and a member of the NASD, the New York Stock Exchange, and the Securities Investor Protection Corporation.  The defendants allegedly have also failed to disclose to investors that Rabinovich has been barred by the NASD from associating with any broker or dealer and that there is a pending action by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA) seeking to bar Lovaglio from associating with any broker or dealer., According to the complaint, the defendants have raised at least $550,000 from at least twenty-three investors, and have lost most of that money, even while providing investors with quarterly account statements that reflect large gains and dividends in every period.  The complaint further charges that investors are located across the country and the firm targets senior citizens and unsophisticated investors  -- at least eleven of the Funds investors are allegedly sixty years old or older, including three who are in their seventies and three who are in their eighties, The complaint names as defendants the following entity and individuals:, The Complaint charges that the defendants have defrauded Fund investors and prospective investors, are unlawfully operating as unregistered broker-dealers and offering and selling securities in an unregistered offering; and that defendant Rabinovich &amp; Associates is unlawfully operating as an unregistered investment company.  The complaint thus alleges that all defendants have violated Sections 5(a) and (c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; that Rabinovich has violated Section 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and  Lovaglio has aided and abetted those violations; and Rabinovich &amp; Associates has violated Section 7(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940.

The action, which alleged that six former PFTC executives engaged in a scheme beginning in January 2001 by which the defendants defrauded a defined contribution plan client and group of Putnam mutual funds of approximately $4 million, was dismissed as to defendants Virginia Papa, of Newton, Massachusetts, a former managing director and director of defined contribution servicing; Sandra Childs, of Duxbury, Massachusetts, a former managing director who had overall responsibility for PFTCs compliance department; and Kevin Crain, of Princeton, New Jersey, a managing director who had responsibility for PFTCs plan administration unit. The Court found that the Commissions complaint did not allege sufficient conduct by those three parties to sustain fraud claims against them., Simultaneously, the Court denied motions to dismiss by three other defendants: Karnig Durgarian, of Hopkinton, Massachusetts, a former senior managing director and chief of operations for PFTC, as well as principal executive officer of certain Putnam mutual funds from 2002 through 2004; Donald McCracken, of Melrose, Massachusetts, a former managing director and head of global operations services for PFTC; and Ronald Hogan, of Saugus, Massachusetts, a former vice-president who had responsibility for new business implementation at PFTC., The Commissions Complaint, filed on December 30, 2005, alleges that the defendants misconduct arose out of PFTCs one-day delay in investing certain assets of a defined contribution client, Cardinal Health, Inc., in January 2001. The markets rose steeply on the missed day, causing Cardinal Healths defined contribution plan to miss out on nearly $4 million of market gains. According to the Complaint, rather than inform Cardinal Health of the one-day delay and the missed trading gain, the defendants decided to improperly shift approximately $3 million of the costs of the delay to shareholders of certain Putnam mutual funds through deception, illegal trade reversals, and accounting machinations. The Complaint also alleges that the defendants improperly allowed Cardinal Healths defined contribution plan to bear approximately $1 million of the loss without disclosing to Cardinal Heath that they had done so. The Complaint further alleges that certain defendants also took steps to cover-up the wrongful conduct and, as a result, the conduct was not discovered until January 2004., The Complaint alleges that through their fraudulent conduct, defendants violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and violated and/or aided and abetted violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The complaint further alleges that Durgarian also violated Sections 34(b) and 37 of the Investment Company Act of 1940.

Between approximately May 2002 and February 2007, Great American and Sette sold unregistered common stock valued at more than $2.3 million to over 100 investors.  Throughout the course of this stock offering, Great American and Sette made numerous materially misleading statements, and failed to disclose material information, to investors to induce them to purchase shares of Great American.  For example, Sette told investors that Great Americans MailCall system was capable of handling thousands of users, when, in fact, the system could not handle more than approximately 48 users simultaneously.  Sette told investors that Great American had signed contracts with various entities to market and/or use the MailCall service, when, in fact, Great American had not entered into any such contracts.  Sette made completely baseless revenue projections when he told investors that Great American would generate millions of dollars in revenue in its first years of operations.  Sette also told investors that Great American would soon be conducting an IPO and its shares would increase in value, when in fact, Great American, had not taken any significant steps to conduct an IPO. , The Commissions complaint alleges that the defendants violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

In a separate action, former President, CEO, and Chairman of the Board John F.

Under well-settled accounting principles, granting in-the-money options obligated the company to report compensation expenses to shareholders.  The Commission alleges that Maxim avoided reporting these expenses by backdating paperwork to make it appear that the options had been granted on an earlier date.  As a result, the company overstated its net income by more than 10% for its fiscal years 2003 through 2005., The Commissions complaints also allege that former CFO Jasper was aware of the improper backdating practices, drafted backdated grant approval documents for Maxims CEO to sign, and disregarded instructions from CEO Gifford to record an expense in connection with certain backdated options.  According to the Commission, Gifford should have known that the company was not reporting expenses for those in-the-money stock options and instead was falsely reporting that they were granted at fair market value., Maxim, without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, consented to a permanent injunction against violations of the Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13, and 14a-9 thereunder.

The defendants are Mitchell S. Drucker, the former associate general counsel of NBTY, a nutritional supplements manufacturer and retailer, and his father, Ronald Drucker, a former New York City police detective. The Commission had charged that, while Mitchell Drucker was a lawyer at NBTY, and had learned that NBTY was about to announce lower than expected quarterly earnings, he and his father sold their holdings of NBTY stock just before the negative announcement. Collectively, the defendants avoided $197,243 in losses by selling in advance of the announcement., United States District Judge Colleen McMahon, who presided over the trial, will determine the sanctions to be imposed against the defendants. The Commission is seeking a judgment requiring the defendants to pay disgorgement equal to their avoided losses plus penalties up to three times the amount of disgorgement, injunctions and, against Mitchell Drucker, an officer and director bar., Mitchell Drucker, age 38, is a resident of Saint James, New York. Ronald Drucker, age 63 is a resident of Mount Sinai, New York., The Commission charged that on October 18, 2001, Mitchell Drucker directed the sale of his entire holdings of NBTY stock, consisting of 25,700 shares, after learning material, non-public information that NBTYs fourth quarter earnings per share (EPS) would be about 50 percent lower than analysts expectations. The day after Mitchell Druckers sales, NBTY publicly announced, through a press release, that its fourth quarter EPS would be significantly lower than analysts expectations. After NBTYs earnings news became public, the price of NBTY shares fell by 41%., The Commission also charged that just after Mitchell Drucker began selling his stock, on October 18, 2001, he engaged in a series of telephone calls with Ronald Drucker in which Mitchell Drucker conveyed the material non-public information regarding NBTYs fourth quarter EPS results. As a result of this tip, Ronald Drucker also sold his entire holdings of NBTY stock, consisting of 10,000 shares, on October 18, 2001. Furthermore, while Mitchell Drucker was placing his own trades on October 18, 2001, he also directed the sale of the entire NBTY holdings of his friend, relief defendant William Minerva, which consisted of 1,575 shares., By trading in advance of the public release of NBTYs fourth quarter EPS, Mitchell Drucker, Ronald Drucker, and Minerva avoided losses of $138,174, $51,116, and $7,953, respectively., The jury found that defendants Mitchell Drucker and Ronald Drucker each violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Judge McMahon will make the determination as to the relief that should be imposed against the defendants and relief defendant. The Commission seeks an order permanently enjoining the defendants from violations of the above provisions of the federal securities laws, requiring disgorgement of losses avoided, plus prejudgment interest thereon, and imposing civil penalties pursuant to Section 21A of the Exchange Act. The Commission also seeks an order barring Mitchell Drucker from acting as an officer or director of a public company.

According to the complaint, Mondschein sold this information as sales leads solely to enable insurance agents to solicit these customers, many of whom had already purchased fixed or equity-indexed annuity products, to buy additional annuity products., The complaint alleges that Mondschein never disclosed to any of these customers that he intended to sell, and did sell, their confidential personal information to insurance agents, and further alleges that he affirmatively misled his clients as to the nature of his compensation arrangements and relationships with the various insurance agents.  According to the complaint, virtually all of Mondscheins customers were senior citizens., The SEC complaint also alleges that:, According to the complaint, over the course of his numerous years as a broker, Mondschein allegedly developed an extensive securities liquidation business that he marketed exclusively to insurance agents.  Mondschein allegedly promised the insurance agents speedy transfer and liquidation services to help close more annuity sales.  The insurance agents recommended to their clients that they use Mondschein, instead of their existing broker, to sell their securities.  The complaint alleges that Mondschein collected substantial brokerage commissions and other fees for selling the securities of elderly persons to fund their annuity purchases., The Commissions complaint alleges that Mondschein committed securities fraud in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5.

Minn. 2007) (filed December 6, 2007)</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced a record $468 million settled enforcement action in an options backdating case against William W. McGuire, M.D., the former Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of UnitedHealth Group Inc.  The settlement is the first with an individual under the “clawback” provision (Section 304) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to deprive corporate executives of their stock sale profits and bonuses earned while their companies were misleading investors., The Commission’s complaint alleges that during a 12-year period, McGuire repeatedly caused the company to grant undisclosed, in-the-money stock options to himself and other UnitedHealth officers and employees without recording in the company’s books and disclosing to shareholders material amounts of compensation expenses as required by applicable accounting rules.  Without admitting or denying the SEC’s charges, McGuire agreed to a $468 million settlement that includes a $7 million civil penalty and reimbursement to the Minneapolis-based health care company for all incentive- and equity-based compensation he received from 2003 through 2006.  , The Commission’s complaint alleges that from at least 1994 through 2005, McGuire looked back over a window of time and picked grant dates for UnitedHealth options that coincided with dates of historically low quarterly closing prices for the company’s common stock, resulting in grants of in-the-money options.  According to the complaint, McGuire signed and approved backdated documents falsely indicating that the options had actually been granted on these earlier dates when UnitedHealth’s stock price was at or near these low points.  These inaccurate documents caused the company to understate compensation expenses for stock options, and were routinely provided to the company’s external auditors in connection with their audits and reviews of UnitedHealth’s financial statements., According to the SEC’s complaint, UnitedHealth filed with the Commission quarterly and annual reports, proxy statements, and registration statements that McGuire knew, or was reckless in not knowing, contained materially false and misleading statements concerning the true grant dates and proper exercise prices of stock options.  Because of McGuire’s misconduct, investors were misled to believe that stock options were granted with strike prices not less than the fair market value of UnitedHealth’s stock on the date of grant and in accordance with the terms of the company’s stock option plans.  In March 2007, UnitedHealth restated its financial statements for each year from 1994 through 2005, and disclosed material cumulative pre-tax errors in stock-based compensation accounting that totaled $1.526 billion for that period., The Commission’s complaint further alleges that from 1994 through 2005, McGuire personally received more than 44 million split-adjusted UnitedHealth options, most or all of which were backdated.  McGuire exercised and sold more than 11 million of these backdated options for an in-the-money gain of more than $6 million.  McGuire also received nearly $5 million of incentive-based cash bonuses in 2005 and 2006 tied to earnings per share targets that UnitedHealth would not have achieved under financial statements restated due to errors in stock-based compensation accounting., Without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commission’s complaint, McGuire consented to the entry of an order permanently enjoining him from violating or aiding and abetting violations of the antifraud, reporting, record-keeping, internal controls, proxy statement, certification, and securities ownership reporting provisions of the federal securities laws, and barring him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for a period of 10 years.  McGuire will (i) disgorge ill-gotten gains of $10,997,596 with $1,697,492 in prejudgment interest, (ii) pay a $7 million civil penalty, and (iii) pursuant to Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reimburse UnitedHealth for all incentive- and equity-based compensation he received from 2003 through 2006, totaling approximately $448 million in cash bonuses, profits from the exercise and sale of UnitedHealth stock, and unexercised UnitedHealth options.  , Under the terms of the settlement, McGuire’s disgorgement plus prejudgment interest and his Section 304 reimbursement would be deemed satisfied by his return to UnitedHealth of approximately $600 million in cash and UnitedHealth options pursuant to the terms of his separate settlement with the company, also announced today, resolving employment claims and shareholder derivative lawsuits filed against McGuire in state and federal courts in Minnesota.  McGuire’s settlement with the SEC is subject to the approval of the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota., The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service.

Strauss of Cleveland, Ohio, a defendant in a previously-filed civil injunctive action involving a multi-faceted scheme to manipulate the stock price of Competitive Technologies, Inc., (CTT), a technology development company located in Fairfield, Connecticut. In addition, the jury was unable to reach verdicts on most of the charges against two remaining defendants: Richard A. Kwak, a registered representative formerly associated with a broker-dealer in San Diego, CA and Stephen J. Wilson, a registered representative formerly associated with a broker-dealer in Media, PA. Yesterday, the SEC informed the Court that it will retry its case against Kwak and Wilson at a future date. The verdict against Strauss followed a three-week trial in Bridgeport, Connecticut before the Honorable Janet Hall, United States District Court Judge for the District of Connecticut., The Commissions complaint, filed against a total of eight defendants on August 11, 2004, alleged that the defendants participated in a scheme to manipulate and inflate the price of CTT stock from at least July 1998 to June 2001. The complaint alleged that the defendants artificially raised and maintained the price of CTTs stock and created a false or misleading appearance with respect to the market for CTT stock through manipulative practices such as placing buy orders at or near the close of the market in order to inflate the reported closing price (marking the close), placing successive buy orders in small amounts at increasing prices (painting the tape), and using accounts they controlled or serviced to place pre-arranged buy and sell orders in virtually identical amounts (placing matched trades)., The SEC also announced that on October 26, 2007 and on October 31, 2007, the Court in this case entered final judgments by consent against four of the original defendants: CTT; Frank McPike of Ridgefield, Connecticut, the former CEO of CTT; John R. Glushko, formerly a registered representative associated with a broker-dealer in Las Vegas, Nevada; and former registered representative Thomas C. Kocherhans of Orem, Utah., The judgments against CTT, McPike, Glushko and Kocherhans, to which they consented without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, enjoin them from violating Sections 9(a) and 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and, as to Glushko and Kocherhans only, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act). Additionally, McPike and Kocherhans have agreed to pay civil penalties of $60,000 and $50,000, respectively. Glushko was also held liable for $10,000 in disgorgement plus $8,308 in prejudgment interest, but payment of the disgorgement and prejudgment interest amounts were waived and no penalty was imposed based upon Glushkos financial condition. The Court will determine whether additional sanctions, including a bar from serving as an officer or director of any public company, are warranted against McPike at a later date., The jury found Strauss liable for violating Sections 9(a) and 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act. In addition, the jury found Strauss liable for aiding and abetting defendant and former registered representative Chauncey Steeles violations of Sections 9(a) and 10(b) of the Exchange Act. Steele previously settled the Commissions action against him in 2005. The district court will determine the appropriate sanctions and remedies against Strauss at a later date.

The defendants, who reside in South Florida, New York, California, and Nevada, are insiders or promoters of publicly traded companies who made stock sales to a hedge fund in exchange for illegal kickbacks to an individual whom they believed to be the hedge fund manager, but who was in reality an undercover FBI agent. The five complaints charge the following Defendants with violating Section 17(a)(1) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder: (1) Vincent Cammarata, Rex A.

Williams; and (5) Sean P. Sheehan., In related criminal prosecutions, the United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of Florida (USAO) today announced the criminal indictments of defendants Morden, Haynes, Gjonbalaj, Foglia and Williams., According to the SECs complaints, which were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, the five schemes involved sales of securities in publicly traded companies to a purported hedge fund. To make the sales, the defendants agreed to pay kickbacks to the individual managing the hedge fund. In fact, there was no hedge fund and the purported manager was an FBI operative in the sting operation. The Commissions complaints allege that, in each case, the hedge fund manager told the seller or promoter that the kickback had to be kept secret, because it would violate his fiduciary obligations to the hedge fund. The manager also told the seller or promoter that he had created a phony consulting company to which the kickback could be paid pursuant to a consulting agreement. The sellers or promoters were explicitly told that the consulting entity did not exist, that no actual consulting work would be performed, and that the phony consulting arrangement was simply a means to secretly pay the kickback to the hedge fund manager. All of the defendants agreed to pay a kickback and, with one exception, the defendants paid the promised kickback to the representative after the hedge fund bought the stock defendants were promoting. Every buy transaction by the hedge fund had a material effect on the stock trading volume of the companies in question., In its actions, the Commission is seeking permanent injunctions prohibiting Defendants from committing future violations of the foregoing federal securities laws, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus pre-judgment interest thereon, and civil penalties. The Commission is also seeking an officer and director bar against Williams and penny stock bars against all the individual defendants., Haynes was previously enjoined from further violations of the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws following his participation in a $7 million offering fraud. <i>SEC v.

The scheme involving the purported sale of English and Spanish language tutorials particularly preyed on Hispanic communities in Orlando, Fla., and Puerto Rico., The SEC charged Robert Lane, Wealth Pools International, Inc., and Recruit For Wealth, Inc. with the fraudulent offer and sale of unregistered securities in the form of Associate memberships in an enterprise called Wealth Pools.  The fraudulent offering began in 2005 and the defendants claim to have raised over $132 million in 2007 alone, according to the SECs complaint., Wealth Pools purports to be a multi-level marketing company primarily selling an English and Spanish language tutorial DVD called Talk-N-Tutor through a network of sales Associates around the world, the SEC alleges in its complaint.  The DVD is, in reality, a front for Wealth Poolss true product - an investment in one or more pools that offer investors an opportunity to receive passive income through the efforts of others to recruit new investors, according to the complaint.  The SEC further alleges that investors do not profit from the sale of DVDs to consumers, but from the recruitment of new investors termed Associates., The SECs complaint also charges the defendants with luring investors through Opportunity Meetings held at Wealth Poolss Orlando, Fla., headquarters, in Puerto Rico, and live on the internet.  The defendants enticed investors to purchase thousands of DVDs by falsely promising them that they would earn income for life with no further effort, according to the SECs complaint.  The SEC further charged the defendants with failing to disclose, among other things, that Wealth Pools is a pyramid scheme utterly dependent on an ever increasing number of new investors to pay existing ones, and is destined to collapse, leaving investors with substantial losses.  Additionally, the SEC alleges that the defendants do not disclose the dilutive effect of new investors on all investors returns, which renders baseless the defendants representations that 97% of Associates make money and receive a lifetime of passive income.  Finally, the complaint alleges that the defendants do not disclose that Lane was president of another company that used similar methods that failed, resulting in it declaring bankruptcy and being enjoined by the State of Florida., The SEC filed its action in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida seeking a temporary restraining order, preliminary and permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  The complaint alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933.  The SEC also named as relief defendants members of Robert Lanes family and other related entities who received investor proceeds raised in the fraudulent and unregistered offering., On December 6, 2007, the Honorable John Antoon II, United States District Judge entered, ex parte, an emergency order temporarily restraining the defendants and freezing the assets of Wealth Pools International, Inc., Recruit For Wealth, Inc., Robert Lane, and relief defendants Julia Lane, Richard Lane, Renee Becker, T-N-T Education, Inc., Mundo Trade, Inc., and First Fiduciary Business Trust.  The order also provides for expedited discovery, a sworn accounting and the preservation of records.  The Court also appointed Denise Dell-Powell, an attorney in the law firm of Akerman Senterfitt of Orlando, Fla. as a receiver over Wealth Pools International, Inc. and Recruit For Wealth, Inc.  Among other things, the receiver is responsible for marshaling and safeguarding assets held by these entities.

Saiz and his firm, Calderon, Jaham &amp; Osborn (CJO), allege that they failed to comply with generally accepted accounting standards, were not knowledgeable about San Diego, and failed to obtain sufficient competent evidential matter., According to the Commissions complaint, San Diego was the seventh largest city in the United States in 2001 and 2002, with revenues exceeding $1 billion per year and assets in excess of $10 billion. San Diegos pension plan had net assets of $2.5 billion and total additions to the plan of more than $85 million. CJO was the independent auditor for San Diego and its pension plan in 2001 and 2002, and Saiz was sole shareholder of CJO, which had approximately 30 employees., The Commissions complaint alleges that Saiz and CJO drafted, subject to San Diegos review and approval, the disclosures in footnotes to the citys financial statements. The footnotes disclosed that San Diego was under-funding its annual pension contribution but also included positive statements about the citys method for funding its pension obligations. These statements included that the citys funding method contained a provision to ensure that the pensions funded level would not drop below a certain level to protect the pension plans financial integrity; that the pension plans actuary believed that the citys pension funding method was an excellent method for the city; and that the total amount that the city had under-funded its annual pension contribution, or net pension obligation, was funded in a reserve., The SECs complaint alleges that these statements were false and misleading because the citys net pension obligation was not funded in a reserve and, in 2002, the pension plan had fallen below a funded level that the actuary deemed appropriate and the actuary no longer supported the citys funding method. The complaint further alleges that Saiz and CJO knew or were reckless in not knowing that the disclosure was false and misleading as a result of information Saiz received from his audits of the city and its pension plan and his review of the citys bond offering documents., CJO and Saiz also drafted footnotes that disclosed that the city provided health benefits to retirees at a cost of $7.2 million in 2001 and $8.9 million in 2002 and that the expenses for such benefits were recognized as they were paid. The complaint alleges that Saiz and CJO knew or were reckless in not knowing that this disclosure was misleading because it failed to disclose, as Saiz and CJO knew from auditing the city and its pension plan, that the retiree health care expense was being paid with earnings from the pension plan and that the city would soon have to begin paying this substantial expense out of its own budget., According to the SECs complaint, Saiz and CJO also audited San Diegos financial statements and issued reports falsely stating that the financial statements were fairly presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and the audits were performed in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards (GAAS). Saiz and CJO also consented to San Diegos including CJOs audit report in its 2002 and 2003 municipal securities offerings. As alleged in the complaint, the false and misleading statements regarding the citys pension obligations were not presented in conformity with GAAP., The Commissions complaint also alleges that at the time they consented to San Diegos including the audit report in the 2003 offering documents, Saiz and CJO also failed, as required by GAAS, to inquire into the recent substantial increase in the citys obligations to its pension to determine whether the financial statements or the audit report required revision., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint filed in federal district court in San Diego, Saiz and CJO have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Additionally, Saiz has agreed to pay a $15,000 civil penalty., The Commission previously entered an order sanctioning the City of San Diego for committing securities fraud by failing to disclose to the investing public important information about its pension and retiree health care obligations in the sale of its municipal bonds in 2002 and 2003. To settle the action, the city agreed to cease and desist from future securities fraud violations and to retain an independent consultant for three years to foster compliance with its disclosure obligations under the federal securities laws., The Commissions investigation is ongoing as to other individuals and entities that may have violated federal securities laws., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2007/comp20394.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20394.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

In addition, the complaint alleges that Collins worked on, and oversaw other attorneys work on, short-term transactions that occurred regularly at the end of Refco fiscal periods from February 2000 through May 2005.  In these transactions, a Refco subsidiary, at the end of a fiscal period, loaned hundreds of millions of dollars to a third party that, in turn, was obligated to loan an equal amount simultaneously to RGHI.  The transactions were reversed shortly after the fiscal periods ended.  In these transactions, Refco assumed hundreds of millions of dollars in potential liabilities, in the form of guaranties and indemnification that it extended to the third parties to protect them from a default by RGHI or claims that might arise out of the loans., In 2004, Refco placed $600 million in senior subordinated notes with certain financial institutions pursuant to an offering circular.  In 2005, Refco commenced its initial public offering of common stock pursuant to a registration statement filed with the Commission.  The complaint alleges that the offering circular failed to disclose RGHIs indebtedness, the period end transactions, and the related potential liabilities and that the registration statement failed to disclose the indebtedness and the potential liabilities.  The complaint further alleges that Collins, while aware of the indebtedness and the transactions, reviewed and revised sections of the offering circular and the registration statement, without inserting requisite disclosures regarding the indebtedness, the period-end transactions, and the potential liabilities., The complaint seeks a permanent injunction enjoining Collins from violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5.  The complaint also seeks civil money penalties against Collins pursuant to Section 21(d)(3) of the Exchange Act., In a related action, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York today announced the filing of criminal charges against Collins for his role in the Refco fraud., The Commissions investigation is continuing., The Commission acknowledges the assistance and cooperation of the Office of the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, the United States Postal Inspection Service, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission., See also <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19716.htm>Litigation Release No. 19716</a> (June 5, 2006)., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2007/comp20402.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  ]"

(MSDW) financial advisors, Darryl A. Goldstein and Christopher ODonnell, for allegedly engaging in a fraudulent market timing scheme.  Market timing refers to the practice of short term buying, selling, and exchanging of mutual fund shares in order to exploit inefficiencies in mutual fund pricing., The Commissions Complaint alleges that Goldstein and ODonnell engaged in a number of deceptive practices to defraud at least 50 mutual fund companies and their shareholders by circumventing the funds restrictions on market-timing.  The conduct alleged occurred from on or about January 2002 until August 2003 and generated approximately $1 million in net commissions or asset-based fees for the defendants.  The Complaint further alleges that, in response to market-timing trades by Goldstein and ODonnell for their hedge fund customers, mutual fund companies sent MSDW at least 225 block letters that barred or restricted trading by Goldstein, ODonnell, or their customers., The Commissions Complaint specifically alleges that Goldstein and ODonnell, in an effort to circumvent mutual funds market-timing restrictions and conceal their hedge fund customers ongoing market-timing trading, repeatedly and systematically employed a variety of deceptive practices including, but not limited to, opening and trading in multiple brokerage accounts, trading using different financial advisor identification numbers, and trading through variable annuity contracts., The Commissions Complaint alleges that the Defendants used 11 different FA identification numbers, opened approximately 122 brokerage accounts and 64 variable annuity contracts, and placed more than 4,000 market-timing trades totaling over $4.8 billion in trading volume, in less than two years for only two hedge fund customers.  The Complaint alleges that by engaging in the fraudulent market-timing scheme, Goldstein and ODonnell violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5., In a related administrative proceeding, Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. Incorporated (MS&amp;Co.), as successor to MSDW, consented to the issuance of a Commission order which found that MSDW failed reasonably to supervise four financial advisors with a view to preventing and detecting their violations of the federal securities laws who engaged in the fraudulent market timing scheme within the meaning of Section 15(b)(4) of the Exchange Act and willfully violated Rule 22c-1(a) under the Investment Company Act of 1940 by allowing multiple mutual fund trades to be placed or amended after the 4:00 p.m. ET close of trading but priced at the net asset value determined at the market close.  The order also found that MSDW violated Section 17(a)(1) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 17a-3 by failing to make and keep records of customer orders placed after the market close and orders placed for certain hedge fund customers in variable annuity sub-accounts.  Without admitting or denying the findings contained in the Commissions order, MS&amp;Co. consented to a censure and an order to pay disgorgement, including prejudgment interest, of $5,120,000 and a penalty of $11,880,000, for a total of $17 million., In another related administrative proceeding, Marc H. Plotkin, a former MSDW financial advisor who worked with Goldstein, consented to the issuance of a Commission order which found that Plotkin willfully aided and abetted and caused violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5 and ordered Plotkin to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of those statutory Sections and Rule.

Maggio, a former senior executive of Refco Inc. and its corporate predecessor, Refco Group Ltd. (together, Refco).  Maggio was an executive vice president at Refco and headed Refcos registered broker-dealer subsidiary.  The Commissions complaint alleges that Maggio played a significant role in concealing hundreds of millions of dollars of related party receivables.  The complaint also alleges that Maggio participated in certain practices that inflated Refcos financial results.  As a result, the complaint alleges, Maggio violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, and 13b2 2(a), and aided and abetted violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 15(d) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 15d-2 and 15d-13.  Maggio has consented to the entry of a proposed final judgment that would settle the injunctive action against him., The Commissions complaint alleges that, from at least 1998 to October 2005, Phillip R. Bennett, Refcos chairman and chief executive officer, implemented a fraudulent scheme that periodically concealed receivables owed to Refco by Refco Group Holdings, Inc. (RGHI), a non-Refco entity that Bennett controlled.  These related party receivables were primarily the result of trading losses and operating expenses that Refco transferred over time to RGHI.  Refco utilized a series of short-term loans that temporarily transferred the receivables to third parties immediately prior to the ends of Refco fiscal periods.  A few days after the fiscal periods ended, the transactions were reversed, and the receivables were transferred back to RGHI.  The Commissions complaint alleges that Maggio oversaw these fiscal period-end transactions.  Maggio discussed the transactions with Bennett, made arrangements with many of the third parties that temporarily assumed the receivables, executed some of the documents involved in the transactions, and provided false and misleading information about the receivables to Refcos public accountant., The Commissions complaint also alleges that Bennett instituted practices that inflated Refcos reported financial results in 2005.  Maggio helped Bennett carry out those practices.  They involved Refco recording fictitious interest income purportedly earned on the RGHI receivables and income from sham foreign exchange transactions.  The inflation of financial results was undertaken to make Refco more attractive to potential investors., The Commissions complaint further alleges that, in 2005, Refco filed with the Commission and provided to investors registration statements and periodic reports that provided false and misleading information about the receivables and Refcos revenue and income.  The filings failed to disclose the receivables and the period end transactions, and some of the filings reported income that had been fraudulently inflated., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, Maggio has consented to the entry of a proposed final judgment that would enjoin him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, and 13b2 2(a), and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 15(d) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 15d-2 and 15d-13.  The proposed final judgment also would prohibit him from serving as an officer or director of a public company., Maggio also agreed to settle proposed administrative proceedings against him pursuant to Section 15(b)(6) of the Exchange Act and Section 203(f) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, to be based on the entry of the proposed injunction.  Pursuant to his offer of settlement, Maggio would consent to the issuance of a Commission order barring him from association with any broker, dealer, or investment adviser., In a related action, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York announced today that Maggio has pleaded guilty to felony charges arising from his role in the Refco fraud., The Commission acknowledges the assistance and cooperation of the Office of the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, the United States Postal Inspection Service, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission., The Commissions investigation is continuing., See also Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19716.htm>19716</a> (June 5, 2006); Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20402.htm>20402</a> (December 18, 2007)., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2007/comp20405.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  ]"

May and E-M consented to the Order without admitting or denying the allegations of the SECs complaint.

According to the allegations of the complaint, May and E-M sold securities in the form of interests in limited liability companies (LLCs), and told investors that these LLCs had been contracted to install and provide telecommunications equipment and services to such major hotel chains and casinos as Hilton, MGM Grand, Motel 6, Tropicana and Sheraton.  The complaint goes on to allege that May and E-M, both orally and in writing,  promised returns in the form of monthly payments to investors for a period as long as 12 to 14 years, and guaranteed that investors, at a minimum, would receive the promised payments for approximately the first 20 to 24 months after they invested., The SECs complaint further alleged that, in reality, the LLCs did not have any telecommunication contracts with the establishments identified in offering materials provided by May and E-M.  To further their alleged scheme, May and E-M provided some investors with copies of fictitious contracts with various hotels and casinos.  Some of which allegedly included the names of purported hotel executives who did not exist.

(the entities collectively, LOM), a Bermuda-based group of financial services firms that includes several broker-dealers, for participating in two fraudulent schemes to manipulate the stock prices of microcap companies Sedona Software Solutions, Inc. and SHEP Technologies, Inc.  The Complaint also alleges that defendants Anthony Wile, Wayne Wile, Todd Peever, James Curtis, and Robert Chapman engaged in market manipulation.  The Commission also filed settled civil injunctive actions against John Cooper, Ian Park, Lawrence Isen, and Sedona., In the actions filed today, the Commission makes the following allegations in the complaints: , <b>The Sedona Manipulation Scheme</b>, Defendant Anthony Wile, a stock promoter, issued deceptive press releases and other promotional materials and created a website, in early 2003, to create the misleading impression that Renaissance Mining Corporation (Renaissance) had acquired certain gold mines and was a leading gold producer.  Defendant Park, former CEO of Renaissance, participated in the preparation of Renaissances false and misleading press releases and website.  In early January 2003, using LOM-controlled nominees, the Lines brothers secretly acquired over ninety-nine percent of Sedonas outstanding shares from defendant Cooper, the then-CEO of Sedona, and a group of Sedona shareholders.  The Lines brothers failed to file with the Commission reports of their beneficial ownership of Sedona stock.  Wile and the Lines brothers then arranged to take Renaissance public by merging it with Sedona, a publicly-traded shell company.  The Lines brothers and LOM Capital agreed to raise $6 million on behalf of Renaissance in a purportedly private placement, in order to enable Renaissance to acquire and reactivate the mines that Wile falsely claimed Renaissance owned.  In soliciting investments for that placement, defendant Scott Lines made numerous false and misleading statements to LOM brokerage customers, including a U.S. customer., In mid-January 2003, defendant Anthony Wile primed the market for Sedona and Renaissance shares by orchestrating touting by defendant Robert J. Chapman, a purportedly independent newsletter writer who secretly owned Renaissance shares, and other investment newsletter writers.  Chapman issued at least one report touting the merger and telling the public that shares of Sedona, which had last traded at three cents per share, would open on January 21 at around $10 per share., On the morning of January 21, defendants Brian Lines, Scott Lines, Anthony Wile, and Wayne Wile orchestrated a manipulative stock trade on the open market to create an artificially inflated market for Sedona shares.  Between January 21 and January 27, Brian and Scott Lines sold or caused the sale of 159,000 Sedona shares on the open market at between $8.95 and $9.40 per share, reaping illegal proceeds of approximately $1.5 million.  These sales, which were made without a registration statement in effect, were largely executed through Lines Overseas Managements account at a U.S. broker-dealer with the assistance of defendant Ryan Leeds, then a registered representative at that firm.  Leeds, by selling the Lines brothers stock without making a reasonable inquiry regarding the source of the shares, and Cooper, through his unregistered sale of the Sedona stock to the Lines brothers, both violated the securities registration provisions., The Sedona scheme collapsed on January 29, 2003, when the Commission suspended trading in Sedonas stock because of questions concerning the accuracy and completeness of public information about Sedona and Renaissance.  After the Commissions trading suspension, defendants Brian and Scott Lines ordered LOM staff to backdate and falsify internal records to create the false impression that the Sedona stock was owned by the nominees., <b>The SHEP Manipulation Scheme</b>, In 2002 and 2003, defendants Brian Lines, Scott Lines, Peever, Curtis, and certain LOM entities engaged in a similar scheme to secretly obtain control of a publicly traded shell company, Inside Holdings, Inc. (IHI), again through the use of LOM nominees.  This scheme involved merging IHI with a private company, paying touters to promote the stock, and later selling stock into the ensuing demand.  During the first half of 2003, the Lines brothers, Peever, and Curtis sold over three million SHEP shares into this demand, generating about $4.3 million in illegal proceeds.  Isen, one of the paid SHEP touters, published bullish reports on SHEP in his OTC Journal newsletter, without disclosing that he was selling almost all of the 100,000 SHEP shares he received as compensation for his touting.  As part of the scheme, the Lines brothers, Peever, and Curtis failed to file required reports of their beneficial ownership of IHI and SHEP stock, and defendant Brian Lines caused several false reports to be filed with the Commission to conceal that he, Scott Lines, Peever, and Curtis owned substantial positions in, and had been selling, SHEP stock.  Defendant Leeds also sold SHEP stock for defendants Brian and Scott Lines in violation of the securities registration provisions., *	*	*	*, In the litigated matter, the Complaint charges Scott Lines, Brian Lines, the LOM entities, Anthony Wile, Wayne Wile, Peever, Curtis, and Chapman with fraud for their roles in the Sedona and/or SHEP manipulations.  Specifically, each, except LOM Holdings, Ltd. and Chapman, is charged with having violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Defendants LOM Holdings, Ltd. and Chapman are charged with fraud for violating Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Defendants Scott Lines, Brian Lines, Anthony Wile, Peever, Curtis, Leeds, and the LOM entities, except LOM Holdings, are also charged with violating Section 5 of the Securities Act, the securities registration provisions of the federal securities laws.  Scott Lines and LOM Securities (Bermuda) Ltd. are also charged with illegally operating as unregistered broker-dealers in the U.S., in violation of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act.  Defendants Scott Lines, Brian Lines, Lines Overseas Management Ltd., Peever, and Curtis are charged with violating and/or aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(d) and/or 16(a) of the Exchange Act and/or Rules 13d-1, 13d-2, and 16a-3 thereunder, the beneficial ownership reporting provisions.  In addition, Brian and Scott Lines are charged with aiding and abetting Sedonas violation of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13a-11 thereunder for failing to disclose their acquisition of control over the Sedona shell.  The Complaint seeks permanent injunctions against future violations of the federal securities laws by the defendants, as well as disgorgement and civil penalties.  The Complaint also seeks permanent penny stock bars against Scott Lines, Brian Lines, the LOM entities, Anthony Wile, Wayne Wile, Chapman, Peever, and Curtis, and seeks a permanent officer-and-director bar against Anthony Wile., Separately, Sedona, Ian Park, John Cooper, and Lawrence Isen have consented to the entry of final judgments against them, without admitting or denying the allegations in the SECs complaints in those actions.  Sedona has consented to the entry of a permanent injunction against future violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13a-11 thereunder, which are issuer reporting provisions of the federal securities laws.  Cooper has consented to the entry of a permanent injunction against future violations of Section 5 of the Securities Act, the securities registration provisions, and Sections 13(d) and 16(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13d-2 and 16a-3 thereunder, the beneficial ownership reporting provisions of the federal securities laws, and aiding and abetting violations of the issuer reporting provisions, and to pay a $30,000 civil penalty.  Park has consented to the entry of a permanent injunction against future violations of Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, to pay a $30,000 civil penalty, and to be barred for five years from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  Isen has consented to the entry of a permanent injunction against future violations of Securities Act Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3), which are antifraud provisions, and Securities Act Section 5, to pay disgorgement of $133,595 and a $40,000 civil penalty, and to certain undertakings., The proposed relief in the settled actions is subject to court approval., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> SEC Complaints in this matter:  <a href=/litigation/complaints/2007/comp20407-sedona.pdf>Sedona and Cooper</a>; <a href=/litigation/complaints/2007/comp20407-park.pdf>Park</a>; <a href=/litigation/complaints/2007/comp20407-isen.pdf>Isen</a>; <a href=/litigation/complaints/2007/comp20407-lines.pdf>Lines et al.</a>,  ]"

Czuczko previously consented, without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions complaint, to entry of an order enjoining him from further violations of the securities laws., The Commissions complaint alleges that between December 2005 and the end of March 2006, Czuczko, age 35, of Beverly Hills, California, routinely promoted thinly-traded penny stocks on his Stockster website while he personally planned to sell his shares of the stocks into the rising price spurred by the recommendation.  Czuczkos practice was to buy shares of the recommended stocks shortly before posting the buy selection on the Stockster website.  When unsuspecting Internet visitors bought the recommended stocks and, as Czuczko intended, drove up the price of the shares, Czuczko sold or scalped his holdings for substantial profits without disclosing his own sales on the Stockster site.  To drive visitors to the Stockster website and thus increase the number of potential investors, Czuczko spent considerable sums on a sustained Internet advertising campaign.  According to the Commissions complaint, in a related scheme, Czuczko touted shares of his own company, Epic Media, Inc., on a predecessor to the Stockster website.  After the price of Epic Media stock spiked, Czuczko sold his shares at a profit.  Czuczko did not publicly disclose those trades, among others, in stock ownership forms required to be filed with the Commission under federal securities laws., The Commission filed its complaint on August 1, 2006.  On December 5, 2007, the court entered judgment enjoining Czuczko from future violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws (Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder), as well as from future violations of the ownership disclosure provisions of the federal securities laws (Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 16a-3 thereunder).  In addition, the court ordered Czuczko to disgorge $1,552,463 in ill-gotten gains plus $121,105.64 in prejudgment interest, imposed a $100,000 civil monetary penalty, and barred him from participating in penny stock offerings and from serving as an officer or director of a publicly traded company.,  ]"

For Improper Payments to Iraq Under the U.N. Oil for Food Program — Company Agrees to Pay Over $2.9 Million</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed Foreign Corrupt Practices Act books and records and internal controls charges against Akzo Nobel N.V., a Netherlands-based pharmaceutical company, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.  The Commissions complaint alleges that from 2000 to 2003, two of Akzo Nobels subsidiaries authorized and made $279,491 in kickback payments in connection with their sales of humanitarian goods to Iraq under the U.N. Oil for Food Program (the Program).  The kickbacks were characterized as after-sales service fees (ASSFs), but no bona fide services were performed.  The Program was intended to provide humanitarian relief for the Iraqi population, which faced severe hardship under international trade sanctions.  It allowed the Iraqi government to purchase humanitarian goods through a U.N. escrow account.  The kickbacks paid in connection with Akzo Nobels subsidiaries sales to Iraq bypassed the escrow account and were paid by third parties to Iraqi-controlled accounts in Lebanon and Jordan., According to the Commissions Complaint:, Akzo Nobels subsidiary Intervet International B.V. entered into one Program contract involving a kickback payment of $38,741.  During the Program, Intervet conducted business in Iraq through two separate agents, who were paid jointly on all Iraqi contracts.  In August 2000, the agents fees were 2.5 percent each.  In September 2000, one of the agents informed Intervet that the Iraqi ministry required that Intervet make a five percent kickback under a Program contract under negotiation.  Although Intervet initially refused to make the payment, at the contract signing, an Intervet employee who was aware of the kickback demand saw the agent deliver an envelope to one of the Iraqi representatives.  Shortly thereafter, the agent sought reimbursement of the five percent kickback made on the contract.  In order to reimburse the agent for the kickback while not accurately reflecting the true purpose of the payment in the companys books and records, the Intervet employees agreed to revert to Intervets pre-August 2000 commission arrangement with its two agents, giving each agent a five percent commission.  By doing so, the agents could keep the 2.5 percent they were each entitled to receive and the agent who paid the kickback could be reimbursed for the five percent passed on to the Iraqi ministry., Akzo Nobels subsidiary N.V. Organon entered into three contracts that involved the payment of $240,750 in ASSF payments.  The same agent that worked on the Intervet transaction was involved in each of these transactions.  On the first contract, Organon and the Iraqi ministry agreed on an initial contract price.  However, when Organon prepared the contract documents that were approved by the U.N., Organon inflated the contract price by ten percent to cover the ASSF payment.  On the two subsequent contracts, Organon simply agreed with the Iraqi ministry on an initial contract price that was inflated by ten percent, and then submitted that inflated contract price in the U.N. documents.  An Organon employee created backdated price quotes that matched the pricing reflected in the three contracts.  The agents commission was increased from five percent to fifteen percent to account for the ten percent kickback.  On the first contract, the agent requested that Organon pay ten percent of his commission to an entity called Sabbagh Drugstore.  On the remaining two contracts, the agent requested that Organon pay the extra ten percent commissions directly to an account in his name.  The Organon employees were aware that the contract price submitted to the U.N. was inflated by ten percent and that the increase in the agents commission resulted in money going directly to the Iraqi Ministry of Health, also known as Kimadia., Akzo Nobel knew or was reckless in not knowing that illicit payments were either offered or paid in connection with all of these transactions.  Akzo Nobel failed to maintain an adequate system of internal controls to detect and prevent the payments.  Akzo Nobels accounting for these transactions failed properly to record the nature of the companys payments, and characterized the ASSFs as legitimate commission payments to the agent., Akzo Nobel, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, ordering it to disgorge $1,647,363 in profits, plus $584,150 in pre-judgment interest, and to pay a civil penalty of $750,000.  Akzo Nobel will also enter into a non-prosecution agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice, Fraud Section.  Akzo Nobels former subsidiary will enter into a criminal disposition with the Dutch Public Prosecutor pursuant to which it will pay a fine., The Commission considered remedial acts promptly undertaken by Akzo Nobel, which self-reported, and cooperation afforded the Commission staff in its continuing investigation.

Ficken was charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and securities fraud, four counts of wire fraud, four counts of securities fraud, and one count of obstruction related to testimony he gave during the Commissions related investigation., The Commission previously filed a civil enforcement action against Ficken and others. The Commission filed its complaint against Ficken, four other former Prudential Securities registered representatives, and their former branch manager, on November 4, 2003, and amended its complaint on July 14, 2004. The amended complaint alleged that Ficken was part of a three-person group of registered representatives, known as the Druffner Group, that defrauded mutual fund companies and the funds shareholders by placing thousands of market timing trades worth more than $1 billion for five hedge fund customers from at least January 2001 through September 2003. According to the amended complaint, Ficken knew that the mutual fund companies monitored and attempted to restrict excessive trading in their mutual funds. The amended complaint alleged that, to evade those restrictions when placing market timing trades, Druffner Group members disguised their own identities by establishing multiple broker identification numbers and disguised their customers identities by opening numerous customer accounts for what were, in reality, only a handful of customers., On September 13, 2007, a the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts entered a final judgment against Ficken after having previously granted the Commissions motion for summary judgment against him. The Commission alleged that Ficken, a former registered representative of broker-dealer Prudential Securities, Inc., committed fraud in connection with his deceptive market timing trades in dozens of mutual funds.

(Lucent) in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia alleging violations of the books and records and internal controls provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Lucent, a Delaware corporation that provides communications systems and services, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Alcatel-Lucent, a French company. Lucent has agreed, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, to the entry of a permanent injunction and to pay $1.5 million in civil penalties., The Commissions complaint alleges that, from at least 2000 to 2003, Lucent spent over $10,000,000 for approximately 1,000 Chinese foreign officials, who were employees of Chinese state-owned or state-controlled telecommunications enterprises, to travel to the United States and elsewhere. The Commission alleges that the majority of the trips were ostensibly designed to allow the Chinese foreign officials to inspect Lucents factories and to train the officials in using Lucent equipment. In fact, according to the complaint, during many of these trips, the officials spent little or no time in the United States visiting Lucents facilities. Instead, they visited tourist destinations throughout the United States, such as Hawaii, Las Vegas, the Grand Canyon, Niagara Falls, Disney World, Universal Studios, and New York City. As set forth in the complaint, the Chinese government enterprises for whom the officials worked were either entities to which Lucent was seeking to sell its equipment and services or existing Lucent customers. The Chinese foreign officials who traveled at Lucents expense were often identified by Lucent in its internal documents as decision makers with respect to awarding new business., According to the Commissions complaint, Lucent improperly recorded many of the trips in its books and records. For example, over 160 trips were booked to Lucents Factory Inspection Account even though the customers did not visit a Lucent factory at any time during the trip. The Commission also alleges that Lucent lacked the internal controls to detect and prevent trips intended for sightseeing, entertainment and leisure, rather than business purposes. Moreover, Lucent failed, for years, to properly train its officers and employees to understand and appreciate the nature and status of its customers in China in the context of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The Commission alleges that, in authorizing and improperly recording the payments for approximately 315 trips for Chinese government officials that had a disproportionate amount of sightseeing, entertainment and leisure, Lucent violated the books and records and internal controls provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977., In the settlement, Lucent, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining Lucent from future violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and ordering Lucent to pay a civil penalty of $1,500,000.

The complaint further alleges that Apuzzo substantially assisted URI and Nolan in implementing the fraudulent scheme by, among other things, signing agreements with URI that he knew or was reckless in not knowing were designed to hide URIs continuing risks and financial obligations relating to the sale-leaseback transactions, and directing or approving the issuance of inflated invoices that he knew or was reckless in not knowing URI, through Nolan and others, would use to inflate URIs gain on the transactions  As a result of the fraudulent transactions, URI materially overstated its financial results in its Forms 10-K for fiscal years 2000 and 2001, as well as in other filings and public releases., The Commissions complaint alleges, as a result of his actions, that Apuzzo aided and abetted URIs violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5 and 13a-1 thereunder, and Nolans violations of Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1.  As part of this action, the Commission seeks a permanent injunction prohibiting Apuzzo from future violations of the federal securities laws, an officer and director bar, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and other equitable relief., The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the U.S. Attorneys Office for the District of Connecticut and the New Haven Field Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the investigation of this matter., The Commissions investigation is continuing., For further information, see <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20396.htm>Litigation Release No. 20396</a> (December 12, 2007)., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2007/comp20418.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  ]"
