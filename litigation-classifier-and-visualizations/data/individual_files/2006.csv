Yaroshinsky</i>, Civil Action No. 06CV2401 (S.D.N.Y., filed March 28, 2006)</h2>, <h2>Federal Court Issues Preliminary Injunction Order Against Alexander J. Yaroshinsky</h2>]","[The United States Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on March 31, 2006, the Honorable Judge Richard C. Casey, a federal judge in the Southern District of New York, entered a preliminary injunction order, by consent, against Alexander J. Yaroshinsky, Vice President of Biostatistics and Clinical Operations at California-based Connetics Corp.  The preliminary injunction will continue to restrain Yaroshinsky from violating certain antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  Also by consent, Judge Casey ordered that Yaroshinskys assets remain frozen subject to carve-outs for specified expenses until further notice, and granted other relief.  The preliminary injunction order continues the relief originally obtained on March 28, 2006, in response to the Commissions emergency civil injunctive action that sought a temporary restraining order, an order freezing assets, disgorgement and civil penalties, and other relief against Yaroshinsky based on his alleged violations of the federal securities laws.  The Commission continues to seek, among other things, a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus pre-judgment interest, and civil money penalties., The Commissions complaint alleges that Yaroshinsky, who participated in tests which led the FDA to ultimately conclude that the drug was unsafe for use, learned the FDAs preliminary views with respect to the cancer tests in an April 13, 2005 call with the FDA.  Shortly thereafter, Yaroshinsky positioned himself to profit from a fall in the price of Connetics stock.  In accounts he controlled, Yaroshinsky sold 15,100 previously acquired Connetics shares, and bought 2,076 put contracts which gave him the right to sell Connetics shares at a fixed price and profit when the shares fell below that price.  Ultimately, on June 13, 2005, when news of the non-approval was made public, Connetics share price fell 27% and Yaroshinsky reaped a benefit of at least $680,000., The preliminary injunction enjoins Yaroshinsky from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Yaroshinsky consented to the preliminary injunction, continued asset freeze, and other relief, without admitting or denying the SECs allegations.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19636.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Md.)</h2>, <h2>SEC Files Emergency Enforcement Action Against Eric M. Westbury and Three Companies He Controls to Stop On-Going Fraud and Other Federal Securities Law Violations</h2>, <h2>Commission Seeks Appointment of a Receiver, an Asset Freeze and Other Relief to Protect Investor Funds and to Ensure the Equitable Distribution of Assets Among Injured Investors</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) today filed an emergency civil action in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland (Greenbelt Division) to stop Eric M. Westbury (Westbury) of Silver Spring, Maryland, and three companies that Westbury owns or controls, from continuing to engage in anti-fraud and other federal securities law violations against investors in those entities.  The Commissions complaint alleges that Westbury is at the center of two on-going, related frauds; the first involves a fraud on investors in SBM Certificate Company (SBM) and SBM Investment Certificates, Inc. formerly known as 1st Atlantic Guaranty Corp. (1st Atlantic); and the second involves a fraud on the District of Columbia Department of Banking and Financial Institutions/Credit Enhancement Fund (the District), an investor in and client of Geneva Capital Partners, LLC (Geneva).  Westbury is the Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President of SBM and of 1st Atlantic, and 100% owner of Geneva.   SBM and 1st Atlantic are headquartered and doing business in Bethesda, Maryland, and Geneva is headquartered and doing business in Silver Spring, Maryland., The Commissions complaint alleges that SBM and 1st Atlantic issued face amount certificates totaling approximately $33 million, to over 2,000 investors, most of whom are individuals whose certificates represent investments of less than $10,000.  A face-amount certificate company is a specialized type of investment company that issues fixed-income debt securities, agreeing to pay the principal amount of the instruments plus accrued interest on maturity.  For the protection of investors, face amount certificate companies are required, among other things, to maintain at all times minimum certificate reserves on all of their outstanding face-amount certificates in an aggregate amount sufficient to ensure that their liabilities are at least equal to their outstanding face-amount certificates., The Commissions complaint alleges that since approximately January 2003, 1st Atlantic and SBM have failed to maintain the statutorily required minimum reserves in cash or qualified investments on their outstanding face-amount certificates.  In fact, the complaint alleges, certain of the assets that SBM has represented comprise its reserves are fictional.  As a result, if investors attempt to redeem their investments in the normal course, neither SBM nor 1st Atlantic will have adequate reserves to pay back all of their invested capital.  Although neither 1st Atlantic nor SBM is offering face-amount certificates to new investors, both companies are permitting existing investors to roll-over their invested capital, without disclosing the foregoing information or its impact on the nature and quality of their investment., The Commissions complaint further alleges a separate but related ongoing fraud at Geneva.  Based on material misrepresentations and omissions, and without being apprised of serious conflicts of interest, the District invested with Westbury and Geneva over $21 million of District of Columbia and federal funds earmarked for the D.C. charter school Credit Enhancement Fund.  The Credit Enhancement Fund program provides loans and guaranties to charter schools to improve their creditworthiness so that commercial financial institutions will be more willing to make loans to, and/or participate in bond issues for, the particular charter schools capital improvements.  Rather than invest the funds in accordance with the terms of the offering documentation, the Commissions complaint alleges that Westbury and Geneva invested almost all of the money in Westbury-related and controlled companies.  In an effort to conceal their fraud, Westbury and Geneva have continued to make material misrepresentations and omissions, in account statements and other documentation, provided to the District.  While the District has received $10 million of the funds it initially invested back from Geneva, and used those funds to extend loans to District charter schools, the Commissions complaint alleges that the District has demanded the balance of its investment from Geneva and Westbury but Geneva and Westbury have been unable to comply with that request., The Commissions complaint charges defendants 1st Atlantic and SBM with violating Sections 28(a) and 28(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940.  In addition, the Commissions complaint charges 1st Atlantic, SBM, Westbury and Geneva with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, thereunder.  The Commissions complaint also charges Westbury and Geneva with violating Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940., The Commission is seeking a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction enjoining each of the defendants from engaging in the violations set forth above; and an order appointing a receiver for and freezing the assets of SBM, 1st Atlantic, and Geneva; granting expedited discovery; prohibiting the alteration or destruction of documents; and requiring an accounting from the defendants.  In addition to the emergency relief obtained, the Commissions complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, as well as disgorgement and prejudgment interest, from each defendant, and civil penalties from defendants Westbury and Geneva., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2006/comp19638.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19638.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

No.06 CV 2621 (Southern District of New York)</h2>, <h2>SEC Charges Four Securities Industry Professionals and a Brokerage Firm With Fraud for Engaging in Manipulative Short Selling</h2>]","[On April 4, 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York charging Andreas Badian, Jacob Spinner, Mottes Drillman, Jeffrey Danny Graham and Pond Securities Corp. (doing business as Pond Equities) with fraud and other securities violations in connection with manipulative short selling of the stock of Sedona Corporation.  In addition, the Commission charged Pond and two of its principals, Ezra Birnbaum and Shaye Hirsch, with failure to supervise Spinner and Drillman., The Commission alleges that Badian, acting for an unregistered investment adviser, used short selling to manipulate Sedonas stock price downward to enhance a clients economic interest in an agreement with Sedona.  Under the agreement, the client loaned Sedona $2.5 million dollars in consideration for Sedonas promise to pay the client $3 million approximately four months later.  The agreement permitted the client to convert Sedonas debt into Sedona common stock at a discount to the market price during a five-day period prior to the conversion.  Based on the formula, the lower Sedonas stock price, the more shares the client would receive on conversion.  To preclude the client from manipulating Sedonas share price, the agreement prohibited the client from short selling Sedonas stock., Despite the prohibition against short selling, traders Spinner, Drillman and Graham, at Badians direction, engaged in extensive short selling of Sedona through an account Spinner and Drillman controlled at Pond Equities and accounts at another brokerage firm.  As Badian and the traders intended, the short selling depressed Sedonas stock price.  As a result, Badians client received more shares from Sedona when it exercised its conversion rights under the agreement.  This operated as a fraud on Sedona and on the market for Sedonas shares., The Commission alleges that Pond Equities violated the anti-fraud and certain record-keeping requirements of the federal securities laws in connection with its trading in Sedona.  Defendant Ezra Birnbaum, Ponds president, and Defendants Pond and Shaye Hirsch, Ponds compliance officer, failed to adequately supervise Spinner and Drillman., The Commission seeks an order permanently enjoining Badian, Spinner, Drillman, Graham and Pond from further violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws as well as other violations.

The Commissions complaint seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, disgorgement of unjust enrichment and an accounting for all investor proceeds., The Commissions Complaint names the following defendants:, , , , , , , The Commission alleges that, between April 2001 until at least May 2005, Flesher and Khalial, through their respective companies, raised over $18 million from hundreds of investors nationwide by fraudulently offering and selling the Ad Topper investments.  The Commission contends that Flesher and Khalial lured investors by representing, among other things, that the Ad Topper investment would provide at least 16% annual returns, generated from Douglas Networks sale of advertising on the Ad Topper machines.  Flesher and Khalial further represented that, after three years, investors could recoup their original Ad Topper investment by selling the machines to Douglas Networks for the original purchase price., According to the Complaint, these representations and others were false.  The Complaint alleges that, in truth, the Ad Topper investment was a Ponzi scheme, with virtually all returns to investors coming from new investor funds, not from advertising sales.  The Complaint further alleges that Douglas Networks generated only minimal advertising revenue.  The Commission also contends that Flesher and Khalial failed to tell investors that many Ad Toppers never were placed in the promised locations; that the same machine was sold to multiple investors at the same time; and that UCI had filed for bankruptcy protection during the offering.  Additionally, the Commission contends that defendants did not disclose to investors that sales agents received commissions ranging from 16% to 23%., The Complaint alleges that Sneed, through his company, was among the most prolific sellers of the Ad Topper program.  The Commission contends that Sneed solicited his insurance clients, and sought additional investors through newspaper advertisements and estate planning seminars, luring many elderly investors into the Ad Topper program.  The Commission also asserts that Sneed not only blindly repeated Flesher and Khalials misrepresentations, but also made additional misrepresentations in offering materials he prepared.  These alleged misrepresentations included false claims that Sneed had conducted considerable due diligence on the investment and found it trustworthy, and that he had invested in the program, when he had not.  The Complaint further alleges that Sneeds offering materials contain fictitious testimonials about the Ad Topper program., The Complaint charges that all Defendants conducted an unregistered securities offering in violation of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), and committed securities fraud in violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The complaint alleges that since late 2004 and as recently as March 2006, Zafar and Thawani have engaged in a pump and dump scheme to manipulate the market for at least 24 thinly traded microcap or smallcap stocks.  The defendants have made over $873,000 by purchasing the stocks, anonymously disseminating false information about the companies on popular internet message boards, and then selling the stocks at artificially inflated prices., Acting on the Commissions application for emergency relief, the Court issued a temporary restraining order that, among other things, froze the defendants assets and set a date for a hearing on the Commissions motion for entry of a preliminary injunction against further violations and other relief while the action is pending., The Commissions complaint identifies the defendants as follows:, The complaint further alleges the following facts:, After buying shares at prevailing market prices, Zafar and Thawani used online aliases to post messages touting the stock and containing phony press release excerpts or other fake news about the issuer to deceive investors.  The phony headlines concocted by the defendants include huge business contracts, mergers and strategic alliances between these little-known issuers and an array of major corporations -- such as Google, Kmart and Sun Microsystems -- and other dramatic developments designed to make the targeted stocks appear to be surefire investment opportunities.  The defendants have also preyed on fears about terrorism and international health epidemics to deceive investors.  After the London subway bombings and reports concerning a deadly bird flu virus, Zafar posted messages falsely stating that one issuer was receiving a contract from the Department of Homeland Security to improve security on New York City subways, and that another issuer was acquiring a company that produces bird flu vaccine., Zafar and Thawani are engaged in a classic internet pump and dump manipulation scheme whose basic structure is as follows:  (1) one or both of the defendants purchase shares of the issuers stock in their online brokerage accounts; (2) the defendants register multiple online identities (User IDs) with internet message board services; (3) the defendants post multiple messages attributed to their User IDs on internet message boards devoted either to the touted stock or to other, more widely followed stocks; (4) the messages contain materially false statements about the issuer and urge other investors to buy the stock; and (5) as soon as the stock price increases due to purchases spurred by the false statements, the defendants sell their shares at the inflated price for a quick profit.  After their sales, the price of the stock quickly returns to its pre-manipulation level.  These events sometimes all occur within the span of a single day., The defendants have created at least 300 different User IDs and have used them to post well over one thousand messages fraudulently touting the stock of at least 24 small-cap issuers, some of them on multiple occasions.  The defendants created these multiple online aliases in order to conceal their identities from investors and make it appear as if the same breaking news is coming from multiple independent sources.  More recently, the defendants have also targeted specific investors by posing as moderators of internet user groups devoted to low-priced stocks and sending emails to the group members while simultaneously posting false messages on different internet message boards about the same stock under different user names.  The emails have been sent out under user names such as marketgeneral and danielbknight, among others.  These emails purport to alert investors to imminent news about the stock and urge them to capitalize by buying the stock before the news is made public., The complaint alleges that by engaging in this conduct, the defendants violated antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  Specifically, the complaint alleges that Zafar and Thawani violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Section 10(b) of the Securities Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5.  The complaint seeks a final judgment (i) enjoining the defendants from violations of these provisions of the federal securities laws; (ii) ordering them to disgorge all their ill-gotten gains; and (iii) and imposing civil money penalties.  Pending a final determination of this action, the complaint also seeks a preliminary injunction against the foregoing violations and continuation of the emergency relief ordered today., The Commission acknowledges the cooperation of the United States Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2006/comp19642.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19642.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Securities and Exchange Commission v. Thomas J. Gerbasio, et al., Civil Action No. 05-1833 (E.D. Pa.).  Gerbasio consented to the Final Judgment without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions complaint, except as to jurisdiction., In the civil injunctive action filed by the Commission on April 21, 2005, the Commission alleges that from August 2002 until April 2004, Gerbasio was in charge of a New York office of Fiserv Securities, Inc. that placed tens of thousands of market timing trades for certain hedge fund customers. The complaint alleges that, from at least August 2002 until October 2003, Gerbasio defrauded hundreds of mutual funds and their shareholders by engaging in deceptive market timing practices for two hedge fund customers, with the result that thousands of market timing trades were placed that would otherwise have been rejected by the fund companies.  Specifically, the Complaint alleges that Gerbasio employed a variety of deceptions on behalf of the hedge fund customers, including misrepresenting the nature of their trades to the funds, opening dozens of accounts under different names to conceal the customers identities from the funds, entering trades in amounts designed to avoid the funds detection triggers, trading in funds less likely to detect the market timing, and advising the customers on strategies to conceal their market timing from funds that objected to and/or prohibited this trading., Under the Final Judgment, Gerbasio is permanently enjoined from violations of Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Stock</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed three settled insider trading actions against three former employees of SunSource, Inc. and the nephew of one of those individuals.  In complaints filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, the Commission alleged that Patrick I. Garvey, Diane Karaoulis, and Christopher M. Bernabei violated antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws by purchasing SunSource, Inc. stock in advance of the June 19, 2001, announcement of a merger agreement between SunSource and Allied Capital Corporation and that Kenneth Gerland violated these provisions by tipping Bernabei.  Each of the defendants, without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, has consented to the entry of a final judgment imposing injunctive and other relief., In the action against Gerland and Bernabei, the Commission alleged that, in April 2001, Gerland, who was SunSources Director of Taxes and Manager of Budgeting &amp; Performance analysis, began working on due diligence relating to the potential merger of SunSource and Allied.  As further alleged in the complaint, from April through June 18, 2001, Gerland knowingly or recklessly provided his nephew Bernabei with material, nonpublic information about SunSource in breach of the duty of trust and confidence that he owed SunSource and its shareholders.  Starting on April 18, 2001, and continuing through June 18, 2001, Bernabei purchased a total of 4,450 shares of SunSource stock based on the information provided to him by Gerland.  Following the announcement of the merger agreement, SunSources stock price rose $4.54 per share over the prior days closing price and closed at $9.50 per share on June 19, 2001.  Bernabei sold most of his SunSource shares that day, realizing trading profits of $20,670.  Bernabei has consented to the entry of a final judgment enjoining him from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, ordering him to disgorge $24,774.91 in trading profits plus pre-judgment interest, and ordering him to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $20,670.  Gerland has consented to the entry of a final judgment enjoining him from violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5 and ordering him to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $20,670., In the action against Garvey, the Commission alleged that he was a part-time consultant to SunSource who worked on due diligence for the proposed merger with Allied beginning in April 2001.  Previously, senior management of SunSource had informed Garvey that he was precluded from trading in SunSource stock because of a potential transaction that was being considered.  While working on the due diligence, Garvey purchased 400 shares of SunSource stock on June 1, 2001.  According to the complaint, Garvey knew or was reckless in not knowing that the information that he had learned about SunSources merger with Allied was material, nonpublic information and that trading in advance of the announcement of the merger agreement breached the duty that he owed to SunSource and its shareholders.  By trading in advance of the announcement, Garvey had profits of $1,740.  Garvey has consented to the entry of a final judgment enjoining him from violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, ordering him to disgorge $2,048 in trading profits plus pre-judgment interest, and ordering him to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,740., In the action against Karaoulis, the Commission alleged that she was the secretary to SunSources chief financial officer and that senior management informed Karaoulis that she was precluded from trading in SunSource stock, due to the potential transaction.   As a result of her position, Karaoulis knew of the ongoing merger negotiations between SunSource and Allied.  According to the complaint, Karaouliss spouse bought 255 shares of SunSource stock on April 12, 2001, at her direction.  The complaint alleges that Karaoulis knew or was reckless in not knowing the information that she had learned about SunSources merger with Allied was material, nonpublic information and that directing her spouse to trade in advance of the announcement of the merger agreement breached the duty that she owed to SunSource and its shareholders.  As a result of the trading in advance of the announcement, Karaoulis had profits of $1,428.  Karaoulis has consented to the entry of a final judgment enjoining her from violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, ordering her to disgorge $1,847 in trading profits plus pre-judgment interest, and ordering her to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,428., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> SEC Complaints in this Matter:,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19649.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Sonja Anticevic et al., 05 Civ. 6991 (KMW) (S.D.N.Y.)</h2>, <h2>SEC COMPLAINT CHARGES INTERNATIONAL INSIDER TRADING RING INCLUDING PERSONNEL AT MERRILL LYNCH AND GOLDMAN SACHS</h2>]","[On April 11, 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission sought leave to file a second amended complaint (“Complaint”) in its pending action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging insider trading in advance of the August 3, 2005, announcement (“Announcement”) by Reebok International Ltd. (“Reebok”) that it had agreed to be acquired by adidas-Salomon AG (“Adidas”).  The Complaint alleges widespread and brazen international schemes of serial insider trading orchestrated by two individuals — Eugene Plotkin (“Plotkin”), a research analyst in the Fixed Income division of Goldman Sachs Group (“Goldman Sachs”), and David Pajcin (“Pajcin”), a former employee of Goldman Sachs — that yielded at least $6.7 million of illicit gains., In one scheme, Plotkin and Pajcin persuaded a mergers and acquisitions analyst at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., Inc. (“Merrill Lynch”) to provide tips on upcoming mergers in return for a share of the trading profits.  In another scheme, Plotkin and Pajcin recruited two individuals to obtain jobs at a printing plant in Wisconsin, steal advance copies of <i>Business Week</i> magazine and tip Plotkin and Pajcin on the names of companies discussed favorably in the “Inside Wall Street” (“IWS”) column before the magazine became public.  Plotkin and Pajcin traded on the inside information, initially in an account in Pajcin’s name and later, in accounts in the names of others in Europe and the United States.  Plotkin and Pajcin also tipped several individuals in the United States and Europe in return for a share of their trading profits.  , In total, Plotkin and Pajcin traded in at least 25 stocks within one year based on inside information obtained through these schemes.  The Commission’s Complaint charges 13 individuals in the United States and Europe for their roles in the schemes.  This Complaint follows two prior complaints filed by the Commission in August 2005, charging insider trading in Reebok securities and successfully freezing over $6 million in trading proceeds.  , In its initial filing in this matter, on August 5, 2005, the Commission obtained a court order freezing a securities account in the name of Sonja Anticevic (“Anticevic”), a Croatian national and resident.  The Anticevic account engaged in a series of highly profitable trades in “out of the money” call options of Reebok just prior to Reebok’s Announcement.  On August 18, 2005, the Court entered a Preliminary Injunction against Anticevic which, among other relief, continues the asset freeze.  , On August 18, 2005, the Commission also filed an amended complaint seeking additional emergency relief against eight additional defendants, including residents of the United States, Croatia and Germany, trading through several domestic and off-shore accounts.  As alleged in the amended complaint, the defendants acted in concert or under a common direction in placing the Reebok trades, and collectively netted a profit of over $6 million. Among others, the amended complaint charged Pajcin, who is Anticevic’s nephew, alleging that Pajcin placed or directed some of the Reebok trades, and tipped other defendants who placed Reebok trades.  Also charged were Henry Siegel, a resident of Pomona, New York; Monika Vujovic, a resident of New York, New York; Elvis Santana, a resident of Brooklyn, New York; Zoran Sormaz, a resident of Zagreb, Croatia; Perica Lopandic, a resident of Reinbek, Germany; Ilija Borac, a resident of Zagreb, Croatia; and Certain Unknown Persons trading in an account at an Austrian broker, Direktanlage.at AG (the “Direktanlage Traders”).  , Acting on the Commissions request for emergency relief, the Court issued temporary restraining orders which, among other things, froze the proceeds of trading in Reebok securities in the domestic accounts and required the repatriation and freezing of the proceeds in the foreign accounts.  Ultimately, the Court entered a preliminary injunction against all of the defendants, and, as a result, the Commission obtained Court orders freezing over $6 million in illegal profits stemming from insider trading in Reebok securities.  , The Commission’s Complaint, today, alleges that Plotkin and Pajcin explored a variety of audacious insider-trading schemes.  Among others, Plotkin and Pajcin met with a series of individuals employed at various investment banks in an attempt to get them to provide non-public information about deals those banks were handling.  Plotkin and Pajcin also contemplated various schemes involving exotic dancers, including having them garner information from bankers while dancing, and using them to induce investment bankers to provide Plotkin and Pajcin with information.  At least two schemes were consummated:  , The Complaint alleges that Plotkin and Pajcin infiltrated the investment banking unit of Merrill Lynch, repeatedly learning of mergers and acquisitions transactions before they became public.  In exchange for a share of the illegal profits, Stanislav Shpigelman (“Shpigelman”), an analyst at Merrill Lynch, leaked confidential information to defendants Plotkin and Pajcin concerning at least six mergers or acquisitions that Merrill Lynch was working on, prior to the time the deals became public, including deals between (i) The Proctor &amp; Gamble Company and The Gillette Company; (ii) Novartis AG and Eon Labs, Inc.; (iii) Duke Energy and Cinergy Corp.; (iv) Quest Diagnostics, Inc. and LabOne, Inc.; (v) Celgene Corp. and a company considering acquiring Celgene; and (vi) Reebok and Adidas.  Plotkin and Pajcin traded on the insider information and passed the insider information on to individuals in the United States and Europe (“Traders”) who traded on it.  Plotkin and Pajcin had an agreement with the Traders, pursuant to which they were to receive a percentage of the illicit profits made by the Traders.  The Merrill Lynch Scheme yielded over $6.4 million in illicit trading profits.  , The Complaint further alleges that Plotkin and Pajcin also infiltrated one of the printing plants utilized by <i>Business Week</i>, repeatedly obtaining advance copies of the market-moving IWS column in <i>Business Week</i>.  Plotkin and Pajcin recruited two individuals — first, Nickolaus Shuster (“Shuster”), and later Juan C. Renteria, Jr. (“Renteria”) — to obtain employment at Quad/Graphics, Inc., one of four printing plants that print <i>Business Week</i> magazine, for the sole purpose of stealing copies of upcoming editions of the magazine, and calling Plotkin or Pajcin to read them key portions of IWS — a widely-read column in the magazine that generally moves the price of the securities of companies mentioned in it <a name=P24_7077></a>– prior to the time the column became available to the public.  The Complaint alleges that Shuster and Renteria provided Plotkin or Pajcin with insider information concerning at least twenty companies that were featured in the IWS column.  Plotkin and Pajcin then either traded on the IWS insider information or passed the information to some or all of the Traders, who traded on the insider information.  The <i>Business Week</i> Scheme yielded over $345,000 in illicit trading profits.  , The Commission’s Complaint names 5 new defendants — Plotkin, Shpigelman, Shuster, Renteria, and Mikhail Plotkin.  To date, the Commission has charged the following persons in this matter:, The Commission alleges that, as a result of trading in various securities on the basis of material, non-public information obtained pursuant to the Merrill Lynch Scheme or the <i>Business Week</i> Scheme, the defendants engaged in illegal insider trading in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In addition, the Commission alleges that defendants Plotkin, Pajcin, and Shpigelman violated Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14e-3 thereunder by trading in the stock of a company while in possession of material, non-public information related to a cash tender offer for such company’s stock.  Among other things, the Complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, the disgorgement of all illegal profits plus prejudgment interest, the imposition of civil monetary penalties, and orders requiring the defendants to repatriate to the United States proceeds of the fraud in accounts outside the United States., The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  The Commission also acknowledges the assistance of the Financial Supervisory Authority in Denmark, the Financial Market Authority in Austria, the Croatian Securities Commission, and the Financial Services Authority in the United Kingdom., For information about earlier developments in this matter, please see Litigation Release <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr19340.htm>No. 19340</a> (August 19, 2005) and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr19327.htm>No. 19327</a> (August 5, 2005)., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/2006/comp19650.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a><br/><img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/2006/comp19650exhibita.pdf>Complaint Exhibit A</a><br/><img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/2006/comp19650exhibitb.pdf>Complaint Exhibit B</a><br/>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19650.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

MA)</h2>, <h2>SEC Files Settled Civil Injunctive Action Against Former Biopure Corporation Executive and Board Member</h2>]","[The Commission today filed a civil injunctive action against Carl Rausch, former Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors and Senior Technology Officer of Biopure Corporation of Cambridge, Massachusetts, for his role in Biopures misleading public statements about the companys efforts to obtain FDA approval for its primary product, a synthetic blood product. The action, filed in federal district court in Massachusetts, charges Rausch, 57, of Belmont, Massachusetts, with aiding and abetting violations of the reporting provisions of the federal securities laws in connection with materially misleading statements by Biopure between April and December, 2003.  Without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, Rausch consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating certain provisions of the federal securities laws and ordering him to pay a $40,000 civil penalty., The Commissions Complaint alleges that, beginning in April 2003, Biopure received negative information from the FDA regarding its efforts to obtain FDA approval of its synthetic blood product, Hemopure, but failed to disclose the information, or falsely described it as positive developments.  Specifically, the Complaint alleges that in April 2003, the FDA placed a clinical hold barring Biopure from conducting clinical trials of Hemopure on human trauma victims in hospitals because of safety concerns about Hemopure.  As alleged, during the next eight months, Biopure failed to disclose the imposition of and reasons for the clinical hold while making public statements about its plans to obtain approval for trauma uses of Hemopure.  In addition, according to the Complaint, in July 2003 the FDA informed Biopure that it had not approved Biopures application for use of Hemopure in orthopedic surgery because of extensive and significant deficiencies in Biopures application and because of concerns about the lack of safety and efficacy of Hemopure.  Biopure, however, issued public statements and Commission filings beginning on August 1, 2003 describing the FDAs communication as good news, causing its stock price to increase by over 20%.  The Complaint alleges that Biopure continued to make misleading statements until December 2003 while simultaneously raising over $35 million from investors.  The Complaint further alleges that as the true status of Biopures efforts to obtain FDA approval gradually became public, through a series of incomplete and misleading disclosures between late October and the end of December 2003, the companys stock price plummeted almost 66% from its August 1 price.  According to the Complaint, Rausch was aware of the true status of Biopures FDA applications, yet reviewed, approved, and, in several instances, signed Biopures misleading statements.  The Commission previously filed a civil injunctive action on September 14, 2005 against Biopure and three other Biopure executives concerning their roles in this matter., Simultaneously with the filing of the Complaint, Rausch, without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from aiding and abetting violations of Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 12b-20, 13a-11 and 13a-13 thereunder, and requires him to pay a civil penalty of $40,000., For further information, see <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr19376.htm>Litigation Release No. 19376</a> (September 14, 2005)(Biopure and others charged by the Commission)., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2006/comp19651.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19651.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

AremisSoft, a public company traded on the Nasdaq market, went bankrupt in March 2002 after announcing it was unable to substantiate approximately $90 million of revenues it reported in 2000.  Subject to Court approval and without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, PKF consents to disgorge $309,048 in fees plus interest and to pay a $2 million penalty which may be distributed to harmed investors pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.  Mead consents to a $50,000 penalty.  In 2005, PKF converted to PKF (UK) LLP, a limited liability partnership., The Complaint charges that PKF became aware of information during the 2000 AremisSoft audit indicating that illegal acts had or may have occurred but did not bring that information to the attention of AremisSofts management, board of directors, or audit committee and that Mead failed to design appropriate audit procedures to determine whether AremisSoft senior management had committed fraud, violations of Section 10A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act)., The Commission also instituted and simultaneously settled combined administrative and Rule 102(e) proceedings against PKF, Mead, and Stuart John Barnsdall (Barnsdall), concurring partner on the 2000 AremisSoft audit.  PKF, Mead, and Barnsdall settled without admitting or denying the findings in the Commissions order.  The Commission found PKF and Mead engaged in highly unreasonable conduct in connection with the audit of AremisSofts 2000 financial statements that resulted in repeated violations of applicable professional standards in circumstances which each knew or should have known warranted heightened scrutiny.  It found Barnsdall engaged in unreasonable conduct that resulted in violations of applicable professional standards.  According to the Commissions order:, PKF issued an audit report, signed by Mead, containing an unqualified opinion stating that PKF had conducted its audit of AremisSofts 2000 financial statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards (GAAS), and that those financial statements were consistent with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), when each knew or should have known that the financial statements did not comply with GAAP and that the audit had not been conducted in accordance with GAAS.  In its 2000 Form 10-K AremisSoft reported $97.5 million of its $123.6 million total revenue came from two Cyprus-based subsidiaries when, in fact, the subsidiaries together had just $1.7 million in revenue for the year.  AremisSoft also claimed $33.3 million in cash at December 31, 2000, but in fact, $9.98 million was in the bank account of one its co-CEOs and $10.7 million was not received by AremisSoft until mid-January 2001;, During the 2000 audit, a PKF staff accountant alerted Mead to shortcomings of the audits being performed on AremisSofts two Cyprus based subsidiaries, particularly the lack of documented testing.  When the PKF accountant advised the PKF Cyprus partner, Pavlos Meletiou, about his concerns, especially the limited audit testing, Meletiou suggested that the testing be carried out after the audit;, In his review of the audit workpapers for one of the AremisSoft Cyprus-based subsidiaries, Mead found numerous problems, including serious deficiencies in two significant audit areas:  cash and accounts receivable.  According to his notes, the workpapers included copies, not originals, of cash confirmations, and both cash and accounts receivable confirmations were apparently not received directly by PKF Cyprus.  Moreover, inventory confirmations were provided by AremisSoft management rather than third parties.  A second PKF partner found multiple problems in the audit file related to the other AremisSoft Cyprus based subsidiary including similar problems with cash and accounts receivable;, The accounts receivable confirmations in the PKF Cyprus audit workpapers reviewed by PKF and Mead evidence additional irregularities that should have warranted heightened scrutiny.  None are originals; many have identical or similar handwriting; and, according to the dates printed on the top of each, eight of seventeen were returned on the same two dates.  The accounts receivable confirmations also were addressed to customers of AremisSoft rather than to account managers, despite the companys claim that account managers, not its end users, were indebted to AremisSoft;, PKF and Mead relied on AremisSofts system of internal controls to limit substantive testing of revenue reported by AremisSofts two Cyprus-based subsidiaries, but neither obtained sufficient understanding of the internal controls for those subsidiaries; and, Barnsdall conducted his concurring partner review the day after Mead signed and transmitted PKFs audit report for inclusion in AremisSofts year 2000 Form 10-K but backdated his sign-off to the date of the audit report., The order finds that through these actions, PKF willfully violated Section 10A of the Exchange Act and was a cause of AremisSofts violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13b2-1 thereunder; and that Mead willfully violated Section 10A(a) of the Exchange Act and was a cause of AremisSofts violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act and Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13b2-1 thereunder.  PKF and Mead each consented to the order that they cease and desist from committing and/or causing the violations charged as well as any future violations of these provisions., As part of the settlement, PKF agreed to disgorge $309,048 in audit fees plus pre-judgment interest and consented to a censure and an undertaking not to accept any audit engagements for new Commission registrant clients for one year.  Mead consented to a censure and permanent bar from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the Commissions Rules of Practice.

Dollar General Corp., et al.</i>, Civil Action No. 3:05-0283 (filed April 7, 2005)</h2>, <h2>Court Enters Final Judgment Against Former Dollar General Chief Financial Officer Brian Burr</h2>, <h2>Burr Will Pay Over $1.2 Million in Penalties, Disgorgement and Prejudgment Interest</h2>]","[On April 11, 2006, the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee entered a settled final judgment against Brian Burr (Burr), former chief financial officer and executive vice president at Dollar General Corporation (Dollar General). Burr was the only litigating defendant in the Commissions action filed on April 7, 2005 against Dollar General and several of its former officers and employees for alleged accounting fraud that overstated Dollar Generals earnings. In settling with the Commission, Burr consented, without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, to the entry of a final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay $1,204,598.17 in civil penalties, disgorgement, and prejudgment interest, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years., In its complaint the Commission alleged that, in 1999 and 2000, Dollar Generals accounting staff determined that Dollar General should have recognized $13.4 million in import freight expenses in fiscal 1999. Rather than restating prior periods, as required by GAAP, or recognizing all the expense in fiscal year 1999, Burr participated in discussions of possible ways to account for the $13.4 million in freight expenses that did not entail recognizing all such expenses in fiscal year 1999. The complaint further alleged that on February 5, 2000, Dollar Generals former controller sent a memorandum to Burr and others describing a $10 million variance in relation to freight expenses, and Dollar Generals intention to charge the $10 million 1999 shortfall at a rate of $833,000 per month during Dollar Generals fiscal year 2000. Ultimately, Dollar General recorded the shortfall in this manner. Burr knew that deferring the bulk of the expenses to fiscal year 2000 avoided the negative impact on already announced fiscal year 1999 earnings as well as year-end bonus payments to Dollar General employees, including Burr. The Commissions complaint alleges that, by deferring the freight expenses, Dollar General met certain targets, including an internal target for employee bonuses and analysts expectations for the Companys earnings per share for fiscal year 1999. If Dollar General had recognized the freight expenses in 1999, it would have fallen short of the bonus target and analysts expectations., The complaint further alleges that Burr engaged in insider trading. After Dollar General terminated Burr in February 2001, Burr and his counsel met with Dollar General senior management. At this meeting, on April 12, 2001, Burrs counsel told Dollar General management that Burr could not sign a separation agreement until he knew that certain accounting issues were addressed by Dollar General. Burr also wanted a release from the Company for any responsibility for certain accounting issues. On April 5, 2001, Burr exercised Dollar General options at $17.5360, and immediately sold 126,597 Dollar General shares at sales prices ranging from $22.50 to $22.84. Burr exercised additional Dollar General options on April 27, 2001, selling 5,000 Dollar General shares at prices from $24 to $24.02. After the Companys April 30, 2001 press release announcing accounting irregularities and the necessity for a restatement, Dollar Generals stock price dropped from its Friday, April 27, 2001 closing price of $23.00 to a Tuesday, May 1, 2001 closing price of $15.76. The complaint alleges that Burr avoided losses by his sale of Dollar General securities., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, the Court permanently enjoined Burr from violating the antifraud, internal controls, books and records and lying to auditor provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder. The Court also enjoined Burr from aiding and abetting violations of the periodic reporting, internal controls, and books and records provisions of the Exchange Act, specifically, Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder. The Court further ordered Burr to pay $1,204,598.17, comprising $494,824 in disgorgement, $143,950.17 in prejudgment interest, and civil penalties of $565,824. The Court also prohibited Burr from acting as an officer or director of a public company for five years.

(GENI), a now-defunct public company that was based in Van Nuys, California. The Commission alleges that the scheme, which occurred between September 1999 and September 2001, resulted in the misappropriation of more than $130 million, the collapse of several broker-dealers, and the largest bailout in the history of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation., According to the complaint, Ramy El-Batrawi, GENIs Chief Executive Officer at the time, and Adnan Khashoggi, with the assistance of Richard J. Evangelista, Wayne Breedon, and Kenneth P. DAngelo (a stock loan broker previously charged by the SEC and criminal authorities), developed a manipulation scheme by which they could profit from lending GENI shares (rather than selling them). The complaint alleges that El-Batrawi and Khashoggi, through an offshore entity called Ultimate Holdings, loaned approximately 15 million shares of GENI stock to Evangelistas employer at the time, Native Nations Securities, a New Jersey broker-dealer, and more than a dozen other broker-dealers in exchange for cash based upon the market value of the shares., According to the complaint, Ultimate Holdings loaned stock through Native Nations (and other broker-dealers) to Breedons employer at the time, Deutsche Bank Securities Limited in Canada, and received the current market value of the stock in cash. As GENIs stock price fluctuated, the loaned stock was marked-to-market by the broker-dealers. Ultimate Holdings received additional cash when GENIs price increased, and was obligated to return cash when the stock price dropped. By lending the shares in this manner, El-Batrawi and Khashoggi raised approximately $130 million without giving up control of the stock or depressing the market price for the stock., The complaint also alleges that the defendants inflated GENIs stock price by systematically engaging in fraudulent and deceptive practices that had the intended effect of generating additional cash proceeds from the broker-dealers participating in the stock loan transactions. Their illegal manipulative activities included reducing the supply of GENI stock to control the public float, promoting a short squeeze without disclosing to GENI shareholders that El-Batrawi and Ultimate Holdings had effectively already sold their stock through the stock loans and were attempting to prevent their stock loans from unraveling, and making trades through nominee accounts. The complaint alleges that while these activities were ongoing, El-Batrawi also was secretly compensating Courtney Smith, a well-known financial commentator, to tout GENI on television to create demand for the stock, and, in conjunction with Douglas Jacobson, GENIs chief financial officer at the time, was making false and misleading statements in periodic reports filed with the Commission., The manipulation caused GENIs stock price to increase approximately 1,400%, from a low of $1.67 per share (split adjusted) on September 1, 1999 to a high of $25 per share on June 29, 2001. After the scheme collapsed in September 2001, GENIs stock price plunged to pennies per share. El-Batrawi and Ultimate Holdings then defaulted on their obligations to repay the approximately $130 million they had obtained from the stock loans, which caused several of the broker-dealers in the stock loan chain to go bankrupt., The Commission charged El-Batrawi, Khashoggi, Ultimate Holdings, Evangelista, and Breedon with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act, in connection with the stock loan and manipulation scheme. The Commission also charged GENI, El-Batrawi, and Jacobson with violating these antifraud provisions by making false and misleading statements and material omissions in GENIs filings with the Commission; charged GENI with violating the reporting and books and records provisions of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13; and charged El-Batrawi and Jacobson with violating Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 and aiding and abetting GENIs violations of the reporting and books and records provisions. The Commission further charged Ultimate Holdings with making false or misleading statements in certain filings with the Commission, in violation of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13d-1 and 13d-2. As relief, the Commission is seeking permanent injunctions against all defendants, an accounting of the money that defendants obtained as a result of their illegal conduct, disgorgement (with prejudgment interest), and civil penalties. The Commission is also seeking to bar El-Batrawi, Jacobson, and Khashoggi from serving as officers or directors of a public company., The Commission acknowledges the cooperation of the United States Attorneys Office for the Central District of California and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter., This is the third lawsuit that the Commission has filed in connection with the GENI stock manipulation.

The three defendants are Thom A. Faria, of Needham, Massachusetts, the former president of the NEF distribution channel and senior vice president of MetLife, Stephen J. McLaughlin, of Plainville, Massachusetts, a former senior vice president of NEF, and William M. Stickney, of Hopkinton, Massachusetts, a former assistant regional vice president at NEF. Without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, McLaughlin and Stickney each consented to the entry of final judgments enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering payment of disgorgement, prejudgment interest and civil penalties, and imposing a five year officer and director bar on McLaughlin., The Commissions complaint alleges that over a period of years defendants engaged in a scheme to hide certain NEF expenses in an effort to make NEF appear more efficient than it actually was. The complaint alleges that defendants hid certain non-commission expenses by reclassifying them as commission expenses in NEFs internal books and records. According to the complaint, on more than one occasion McLaughlin and Stickney attempted to cover-up their reclassification activity, thereby hindering the ability of MetLife to discover the improper activity sooner. All told, the complaint alleges that the scheme resulted in the improper reclassification of over $100 million in NEF expenses, the direct result of which was the publication of materially false overstatements of MetLife and NEF net income in financial statements filed with the Commission., The complaint alleges that through their fraudulent conduct, defendants violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder, and Section 34(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as well as aided and abetted uncharged MetLife violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13 thereunder. The Complaint also alleges that Faria aided and abetted uncharged MetLife/NEF violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder., Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, McLaughlin and Stickney have consented to the entry of final judgments that (1) permanently enjoin them from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder, and Section 34(b) of the Investment Company Act, as well as from aiding and abetting future violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13 thereunder; (2) require them to pay civil penalties of $30,000 and $15,000, respectively; (3) require them to disgorge $35,625 and $15,800, respectively, plus pre-judgment interest in the amount of $3,822.14 and $1,695.15, respectively; and (4) as to McLaughlin, bars him from serving as an officer and director of a public company for five years., The Commission also announced today that it would not bring any enforcement action against MetLife or NEF because of MetLifes extensive cooperation in the Commissions investigation of the improper reclassifications that are the subject of the Commissions complaint. MetLifes cooperation consisted of prompt self-reporting, an independent internal investigation, sharing the results of that investigation with the government, disciplining responsible wrongdoers, and implementing new controls designed to prevent the recurrence of the improper conduct.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19656.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Alleging Billion Dollar Accounting Fraud</h2>]","[The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a settled civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Tyco International Ltd.  The Commissions complaint in that action alleges that, from 1996 through 2002, Tyco violated the federal securities laws by, among other things, utilizing various improper accounting practices and a scheme involving transactions with no economic substance to overstate its reported financial results by at least one billion dollars., The Commissions complaint alleges that Tyco inflated its operating income by at least $500 million as a result of improper accounting practices related to some of the many acquisitions that Tyco engaged in during that time.  Tycos improper acquisition accounting included undervaluing acquired assets, overvaluing acquired liabilities, and misusing accounting rules concerning the establishment and utilization of purchase accounting reserves.  The complaint further alleges that, apart from its acquisition activities, Tyco improperly established and used various kinds of reserves to make adjustments at the end of reporting periods to enhance and smooth its publicly reported results and to meet earnings forecasts., The complaint alleges that Tyco inflated its operating income by $567 million from its fiscal year 1998 through its fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2002, by means of connection fees that Tycos ADT Security Services, Inc. subsidiary charged to dealers from whom it purchased security monitoring contracts.  Because the connection fee was fully offset by a simultaneous increase in the purchase price ADT allocated to the dealers security monitoring contracts, the connection fee transaction lacked economic substance and should not have been recorded in Tycos income statement.  In 2003, Tyco restated its operating income and cash flow relating to the connection fees., The complaint further alleges that, from September 1996 through early 2002, Tyco failed to disclose in its proxy statements and annual reports certain executive compensation, executive indebtedness, and related party transactions of its former senior management.  Tyco also incorrectly accounted for certain executive bonuses it paid in its fiscal years 2000 and 2001, thereby excluding from its operating expenses the costs associated with those bonuses.  Finally, the complaint alleges that Tyco violated the antibribery provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act when employees or agents of its Earth Tech Brasil Ltda. subsidiary made payments to Brazilian officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business for Tyco., Between 1996 and 2002, as a result of these various practices, Tyco made false and misleading statements or omissions in its filings with the Commission and its public statements to investors and analysts., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, Tyco has consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), 14(a), and 30A(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, 13b2-1, and 14a-9.

(Jack) Utsick, and American Enterprises, Inc. and Entertainment Funds, Inc. and their principals Robert Yeager and Donna Yeager, alleging violations of the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws in connection with a fraudulent offering that raised over $300 million from over 3,300 investors nationwide.  The Commission has also requested the appointment of a receiver over all four corporate defendants., Simultaneously with the filing of its Complaint, the Commission also filed Consents to the entry of Judgments of Permanent Injunction and Other Relief, executed by all the defendants, with proposed judgments for entry by the District Court.  Defendants, without admitting or denying the allegations of the Complaint, consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining them from engaging in the violations set forth above, and providing for an asset freeze, repatriation order, an accounting and disgorgement, with prejudgment interest, and the imposition of civil penalties, in amounts to be determined at a future date., The Commissions complaint alleges that from at least 1998 through late 2005, the defendants sold unregistered securities in the form of loan agreements or units in special purpose limited liability companies (LLCs) to raise funds for a variety of entertainment ventures produced and/or promoted by Jack Utsick, the third-largest independent entertainment promoter in the world according to <i>Billboard Magazine</i>.  Defendants told prospective investors that their investments would earn annual returns ranging from 15% to 25% and, in some in instances, an additional 3% of the profits generated by Jack Utsick and his companies.  The investments in the LLCs or loan agreements were usually for a term of one year, and many investors rolled over their principal and purported profits from project to project.  Over the years, defendants raised funds for dozens of projects, including theatrical productions and concerts for well-known artists and groups such as Shania Twain, Elton John, Santana, The Pretenders and Aerosmith., The Complaint further alleges that, in connection with the offering, the defendants made material misrepresentations and omissions to investors about, among other things, the profitability of their investments, the use of proceeds, the payment of commissions, and the existence of state disciplinary actions.  The defendants promised annual returns of 15% to 25% were baseless.  Although the offering materials for each venture identified the particular concert or event for which funds would be used, Utsick commingled all of the funds received for the projects in two operating accounts (Worldwide or Entertainment Group), from which he paid all business and personal expenses.  Because Utsick did not maintain any separate accounts or books and records for each project, it was impossible for defendants to determine the profitability of any event.  Moreover, many of the entertainment projects Worldwide and Entertainment Group promoted or produced lost money (and at least one project was not produced) and, as a result, earlier investors were paid with monies the defendants raised from new investors., Additionally, contrary to the defendants representations that no commissions were paid in connection with the offering, Utsick paid over $7 million in undisclosed commissions to the Yeagers and others.  Utsick also used investor funds inconsistently with the purposes promised to investors.

Cal.)</h2>, <h2>SEC Seeks Civil Contempt Order Against Architect of Offering Fraud Targeting Seniors</h2>]","[On March 31, 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) filed in United States District Court for the Central District of California an application for an order to show cause why David R. Lund of Newport Beach, California should not be held in civil contempt for failing to comply with the courts preliminary injunction, order freezing assets, and other orders. According to the Commissions court papers, Lund has not complied with the courts orders freezing all of his monies and assets and prohibiting him from converting, disposing of or dissipating any of his property. According to the Commission, on December 19, 2005, three days after Lund was served with the courts asset freeze order, he applied to World Savings Bank for a refinancing of his Newport Beach, California property. When the refinancing closed on January 24, 2006, Lund converted $279,850 of the loan proceeds for his personal use. Should the court hold Lund in civil contempt, the Commission asked that the court impose a sanction sufficiently coercive to compel his compliance with the orders. Specifically, the Commission asked the court to incarcerate Lund and levy a daily fine until he complies with the orders. The Commission requested a May 1, 2006 hearing date for the contempt application., The Commission filed a complaint against Lund, his companies, Investors First Financial Services, Inc. (Investors First) and Investors Guild, Inc., and the three private offering funds Lund managed through his companies, Credit First Fund, LP, Credit First, LLC, and Credit First Income Plus, LLC (collectively, Credit First), in federal court on December 15, 2005, alleging that the defendants fraudulently induced elderly investors nationwide to purchase $10.7 million of ownership units in Credit First. The defendants represented that investor funds would be used to purchase distressed debt, which Credit First would collect or resell at a profit. The defendants also represented that Credit First would pay investors a monthly return of one to three percent on their investment from Credit Firsts operations. The Commission alleges that, in actuality, Credit First was not profitable and Lund was operating a Ponzi-like scheme by using investor monies to pay promised returns. The Commission obtained orders freezing each of the defendants assets, appointing a permanent receiver over Credit First, Investors First, and Investors Guild, Inc., prohibiting the destruction of documents, requiring accountings from the defendants, and preliminarily enjoining all of the defendants from future violations of the securities registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court found that [p]laintiff provides evidence that at least some investors were told or led to believe through omission that they would be receiving a 1% (or more) return of profits, and [d]efendants cannot overcome Plaintiffs evidence that material misrepresentations or omissions were made to investors regarding the profitability of the Funds. The SEC also seeks other relief, including disgorgement and civil penalties, against all defendants.

The complaint alleged that Dadante, an unregistered investment adviser, raised approximately $50 million dollars from at least 110 investors by offering unregistered limited partnership interests in IPOF, an unregistered investment company, and by representing to them that: IPOF used two low-risk investment strategies; he protected investor principal in a purported Goldman Sachs money market account and only used the interest earned to invest; IPOF had high historical returns; and IPOF guaranteed high periodic returns.

Without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, BNY has consented to the entry of a final judgment imposing a $250,000 civil penalty., The Commissions Complaint alleges that BNY violated Section 17A(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17Ad-17 thereunder when it failed as a transfer agent to exercise reasonable care to ascertain the correct addresses of lost securityholders.  Transfer agents are required to use reasonable care in searching for securityholders who are deemed lost after correspondence sent to them is returned as undeliverable.  Rule 17Ad-17 requires a search using at least two electronic databases at specified intervals., The Complaint alleges that, from January 1998 to September 2004, BNY failed to classify certain securityholders as lost despite the return of undeliverable correspondence.  As a result, BNY omitted approximately 14,159 securityholders from the required searches, and ultimately escheated approximately $11.5 million in assets belonging to those securityholders to various states, as unclaimed property.  In addition, coding errors affecting BNYs system used for compiling lists of lost securityholders caused BNY to omit other eligible securityholders from searches.  These securityholders were forced to pay third parties $743,112 in unnecessary fees to recover their lost assets., In a separate cease-and-desist proceeding, BNY, without admitting or denying the Commissions findings, consented to the entry of an Order requiring BNY to cease and desist from violations of Section 17A(d) of the Exchange Act and Rule 17Ad-17 thereunder.

In a complaint filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District Court of New York, the Commission alleged that Obus directed the purchase of 287,200 shares of SunSource stock in accounts of three hedge funds he managed after being tipped by Black, who had been tipped by Strickland. As a result of the trading, the three funds  Wynnefield Partners Small Cap Value L.P. (Wynn), Wynnefield Partners Small Cap Value L.P.

The three funds are named as relief defendants., In its complaint, the Commission alleged that Strickland, an employee of GE Capital Corporation, learned material, nonpublic information about the proposed acquisition of SunSource by Allied in mid-May 2001, after being assigned to work on the deal and attending a meeting with members of SunSources management. According to the complaint, shortly thereafter, Strickland called his close friend Black, who was an analyst for Wynnefield Capital, Inc., and tipped him about the upcoming merger. Black then tipped his boss, Obus, who was a founder and principal of Wynnefield Capital., The Commission also alleged that on June 8, 2001, Obus directed the purchase of a block of 287,200 shares of SunSource stock at $4.75 per share. This was the largest purchase of SunSource stock that Obus had ever made and comprised more than 99% of SunSource stock that was traded that day. The shares were deposited into accounts of relief defendants Wynn, Wynn I, and Wynn II. On June 19, 2001, SunSource and Allied jointly announced that they had signed a definitive merger agreement. SunSources stock closed that day at $9.50 per share, an increase of 91.5% over the prior days closing price. Based on the closing price, the relief defendants had profits of $1,335,700.

Shovers (Hayes former Chief Financial Officer), Jesus Bonilla-Valdez (former Vice President of the Aluminum Wheel Group (AWG), a large business unit of Hayes) and Ronald Lee Kolakowski (former President of the North American Wheel Group (NAWG), a large operating division of Hayes) participated in a multi-year accounting fraud at the company between 1999 and 2001.   As detailed below, defendants Hayes and Kolakowski have agreed to settle this matter without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint., The Commissions complaint alleges that a financial fraud took place at Hayes from fiscal year 1999 through the first quarter of 2001 and that Hayes, acting through former senior officers and employees, engaged in a fraudulent scheme to achieve corporate earnings targets and mask declining operating results.  The complaint alleges that Hayes personnel used several mechanisms to increase income and revenue fraudulently, including:  (1) inappropriately deferring operating expenses to balance sheet accounts, (2) failing to process vendor invoices, (3) understating employee fringe benefits and (4) improperly recording certain customer discounts to balance sheet accounts., The complaint alleges that, as a result of Hayes fraudulent scheme, Hayes made materially false filings with the Commission in fiscal years 1999 and 2000 and for the first quarter of 2001, including the companys  annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2001,  and the quarterly reports on Forms 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended April 30, 2000, July 31, 2000, October 31, 2000 and April 30, 2001.   The complaint alleges that Hayes former senior management directed NAWG plant personnel to engage in many of the improper accounting practices detailed above., The complaint also alleges that, upon learning of the fraudulent accounting scheme, Cucuz and Shovers made affirmative misrepresentations to the companys outside independent auditor about Hayes financial statements and caused Hayes to make Commission filings containing material misrepresentations. The complaint further alleges that Cucuz and Shovers took affirmative steps to conceal information about the improper accounting practices from Hayes outside independent auditor and Hayes Audit Committee and Board of Directors.  Finally, the complaint alleges that Cucuz and Shovers made material misrepresentations about Hayes financial condition in connection with a $300 million Rule 144A bond offering by Hayes in June 2001., In December 2001, Hayes restated its results for fiscal years 1999, 2000 and for the first quarter of 2001.  Hayes filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy due, in part, to revelations about its improper accounting practices.  Hayes emerged from bankruptcy in June 2003., The Commissions complaint alleges that by engaging in the foregoing conduct: (i) defendant Hayes violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws (Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5), as well as the reporting, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the Exchange Act (Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B), and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13); (ii) defendants Cucuz, Shovers, Bonilla-Valdez and Kolakowski violated the antifraud provisions of the Exchange Act (Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5), the internal control and books and records provisions of the Exchange Act (Section 13(b)(5) and Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1) and aided and abetted Hayes violations of the issuer reporting, books and records, and reporting provisions of the Exchange Act (Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13).  The complaint additionally charges Cucuz and Shovers with violating the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act (Section 17(a) of the Securities Act) and the provision of the Exchange Act that prohibits an officer or director from lying to auditors (Exchange Act Rule 13b2-2)., Hayes has agreed to settle the Commissions action, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, by consenting to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it from violating Securities Act Section 17(a), Exchange Act Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B), and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13.

Daniels, United States District Court Judge for the Southern District of New York, securities trader Dominick Savino (Savino) was found liable for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, and was permanently enjoined from future violations. Savino, who is a registered representative of a Connecticut broker-dealer, was enjoined from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and from violating and aiding and abetting violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

In that decision, Judge Daniels found that Savino violated his duties as a licensed securities professional by engaging in an illegal fraudulent scheme with Anthony Shen (Shen), a New York Life bond trader, to defraud New York Life that involved material misrepresentations and omissions in connection with his trades. Among other things, the District Court found that: , Savino offered and gave Shen secret payments, gifts, and gratuities in connection with their securities trades, that Savino concealed the fact that he was compensating Shen in connection with trades, and affirmatively misrepresented the nature of the consideration paid;, Savino knowingly and willingly defrauded New York Life, and intentionally failed to disclose, and intentionally concealed, the material circumstances of his trading relationship with Shen; , Savinos violations were egregious, and were repeated multiple times over the course of his relationship with Shen; and, Savino attempted to conceal his conduct and also attempted to obstruct the investigation into his conduct by, among other things, lying to his employers attorneys during their internal probe, and urging Shen to lie to conceal the scheme, and by providing untruthful statements during his deposition and while testifying at trial., The Commission has instituted public administrative proceedings against Savino in order to determine what remedial action, if any, is appropriate in the public interest in light of the permanent injunction that was entered against him by the district court.

The Commissions complaint, filed in the Western District of North Carolina, alleges that Ingles former officer and director, Anthony Federico (now deceased), provided false information to the companys accounting department in 2002 and 2003. , From his office near Atlanta, Federico negotiated refundable, upfront payments with vendors worth millions of dollars at or after the end of certain quarters. The Commission alleges that Federico drafted forms to make it look like the money was nonrefundable and for past performance and signed at least two side letters that he did not provide to Ingles accounting department. Taken by itself, Federicos misconduct accounted for more than half of the pretax income reported in quarterly reports filed in May 2002 and February 2003 and material amounts of pretax income in annual reports filed in December 2002 and 2003. The Commission alleges that Federico was able to do this in large part because Ingles had no meaningful controls over the recognition of income from upfront vendor payments during the relevant period. Ingles restated its financial statements in February 2005 to correct these and other accounting errors, and implemented internal controls to properly account for upfront vendor payments., Without admitting or denying the allegations, Ingles consented to the imposition of a court order prohibiting further violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)]; Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)] and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5]; .and Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C.

Genger, and its former chief financial officer and current senior vice president of marketing and development, Kevin Morano, for their participation in a series of fraudulent transactions that resulted in the publication of materially false financial statements by Lumenis in 2002 and 2003. Lumenis is an Israeli corporation with executive offices in New York whose stock was publicly traded in the United States. Genger is a resident of New York, New York and Morano is a resident of Pennington, New Jersey. Without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, Lumenis and Genger each consented to the entry of final judgments enjoining them from future violations of certain federal securities laws, and, as to Genger, ordering payment of a $75,000 civil penalty and imposing a five year officer and director bar., The Commissions Complaint alleges that from at least late 2001 through early 2003, Lumenis, acting through senior officers, engaged in a fraudulent scheme to inflate revenue and misrepresent other important financial metrics so as to deceive investors as to the companys true financial condition. According to the Complaint, the scheme involved the improper recognition of a series of sales transactions that resulted in Lumenis publication of materially false and misleading financial statements in six consecutive financial reporting periods, starting with those for the year ended December 31, 2001. According to the Complaint, Genger and Morano worked in concert to further the fraudulent scheme at Lumenis. The Complaint alleges Genger induced distributors and other customers to make excessive end-of-the-quarter product purchases that for various reasons should not have been included in Lumenis reported financial results, and that Genger knowingly or recklessly disregarded the fact that these transactions did not qualify for recognition as proper sales. For example, according to the Complaint, in one transaction Genger agreed that a distributor would not have to pay for products it ordered from Lumenis until the distributor had collected on certain sales orders Lumenis was to provide it. The Complaint alleges that Lumenis recognition of revenue when such a contingency arrangement existed departed from generally accepted accounting principles, and that Genger knowingly or recklessly disregarded this fact at the time the revenue was improperly recognized. The Complaint also alleges that Morano allowed Lumenis to recognize revenue and profits from a number of the improper transactions while knowingly or recklessly disregarding the various conditions that should have precluded recognition., The Complaint alleges that through their fraudulent conduct, (1) Lumenis violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13 thereunder; (2) Genger violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder, and aided and abetted Lumenis violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13 thereunder; and (3) Morano violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder, and aided and abetted Lumenis violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13 thereunder., Without admitting or denying the allegations of the Complaint, Lumenis and Genger have consented to the entry of final judgments.

The final judgments permanently enjoin defendants from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. In addition, the final judgment as to Mancuso finds him liable for disgorgement of $244,646 plus prejudgment interest of $41,220, and orders him to pay a civil monetary penalty of $120,000. The final judgments as to Barton, Belmonte, and Hourican find them liable for disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, but waive the payment of disgorgement, and do not impose civil monetary penalties, based on these defendants sworn representations in statements of financial condition and other documents and information submitted to the Commission. The defendants consented to the final judgments without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint., The Commissions complaint alleged that from early 2000 until September 2002, defendants Kimberly J. Carrella and Vincent M. Carrella directed a scheme to defraud Kimberly Securities customers. Kimberly Carrella and other Kimberly Securities brokers, including Barton, Belmonte, Hourican, and Mancuso, misrepresented, and failed to disclose, material information to investors to persuade them to open brokerage accounts at Kimberly Securities and to invest significant amounts of money. The complaint further alleged that Kimberly Carrella and the other brokers, including Barton, Belmonte, Hourican, and Mancuso, then repeatedly executed unauthorized, unsuitable trades in customer accounts, and churned accounts. This frequent trading typically depleted customers capital investments through trading losses and commission charges. Once there were no funds remaining in the customers accounts, or the customers closed their accounts, Kimberly Securities brokers lured new, unsuspecting customers into opening accounts at Kimberly Securities, and repeated the same conduct. The complaint further alleged that, through this scheme, defendants enriched themselves at their customers expense. For example, from January 2000 to September 2002, Kimberly Securities charged customers approximately $4.5 million in commissions. During the same time period, customers lost in excess of $4 million through trading losses and commission charges. , The Commission also announced today that it simultaneously instituted and settled administrative proceedings against Barton, Belmonte, Hourican, and Mancuso. Barton, Belmonte, Hourican, and Mancuso each consented to the entry of an Order, without admitting or denying its findings, pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Exchange Act, barring them from association with any broker or dealer., For information about earlier developments in this matter, see <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18860.htm>Litigation Release No. 18860</a> (Aug. 30, 2004), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr19381.htm>Litigation Release No. 19381</a> (Sept. 16, 2005), and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr19529.htm>Litigation Release No. 19529</a> (Jan. 13, 2006)., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <b>Additional Materials:</b>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19677.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

CMG was GLTs investment adviser, and Gilabert was CMGs portfolio manager.  The Commissions complaint alleges that CMG and Gilabert claimed that, under their direction, GLT would use investor funds to establish a portfolio of stocks and options, seeking returns through long-term appreciation, short-term trading, and hedging strategies.  They also claimed that GLT had generated average annual returns of 19% to 36% and that they would only receive performance-based compensation if GLT was profitable.  The complaint alleges that the defendants representations were false and misleading in that GLT actually lost $7.8 million rather than achieved the represented returns; CMG and Gilabert misappropriated nearly $1.7 million for their own personal purposes, because GLT was never profitable; the defendants also misused $4.6 million in new investor funds to pay existing investors, operating a Ponzi-like scheme; and the defendants failed to disclose that CMGs investment adviser registration was revoked in 2003 by the California Department of Corporations., The complaint, which was filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, alleges that CMG and Gilabert violated the securities registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

The Commissions complaint alleges that James N. Pratt, of Carrollton, Texas, and Timothy V. Coffin, of Huntington Beach, California, conducted a fraudulent scheme which has raised approximately $1.06 million from at least 85 investors with false representations regarding the intended investment of investor funds and projected profits. Judge Barefoot Sanders, United States District Judge for the Northern District of Texas, granted the Commissions Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and issued an Ex Parte Order Freezing Assets and Requiring an Accounting, Preservation of Documents and Authorizing Expedited Discovery, and appointed a receiver for all defendants., The Commissions complaint names the following persons and entities as defendants:, James N. Pratt, 65, of Carrolton, Texas., EFS, LLC, a Texas limited liability company., Freedom Fidelity, LLC, a Texas limited liability company, which shares offices with EFS and Pratt in Addison, Texas. , Timothy V. Coffin, 56, of Huntington Beach, California., SP&amp;V, LLC, purportedly a limited liability company, with offices at Coffins Huntington Beach, California residence., The Commissions complaint alleges that the defendants are engaged in an unregistered and fraudulent securities offering that has lured investors with false promises of astronomical investment returns. Since September 2004, the defendants have fraudulently raised approximately $1.06 million from at least 85 investors. The fraud is apparently ongoing; the defendants have taken money from investors as recently as April 25, 2006., The complaint further alleges that defendants Pratt and Coffin are orchestrating the scheme through business entities they control, including EFS, Freedom Fidelity, and SP&amp;V. The scheme involves what is commonly known as a prime bank scheme, in which almost every representation made to investors about the nature and terms of the investment is a fabrication. Investors are led to believe that phenomenal investment returns will be achieved through the trading of bank instruments. In reality, the trading program does not exist. Consequently, the defendants have failed to generate the promised returns, and, according to the complaint, they have failed to offer any explanation for the disposition of approximately one-third of the investors funds., The Commissions complaint charges that the defendants have violated Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 [15 U.S.C. §§ 77e(a), 77e(c) and 77q(a)] (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)] (Exchange Act), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5]. The Commission also seeks orders requiring the defendants to pay civil monetary penalties and to disgorge all ill-gotten gains, plus prejudgment interest thereon., Unscrupulous promoters continue to victimize the public with prime bank schemes.

From April 2004 through April 20, 2006, Martin was a registered representative doing business as First Financial Group, an unincorporated entity and was associated with a registered broker-dealer., The Complaint alleges that:, From as early as February 2005, Martin recommended to at least five and to as many as 29 customers that they sell securities, generally variable annuities, and/or that they purchase securities.  Based on Martins representations, the customers authorized the transactions; however, Martin did not invest the proceeds as authorized.  Instead, Martin submitted forged documents to the variable annuity companies surrendering the contracts and directing those companies to mail the proceeds directly to him.  The customers names were forged on the checks and the checks were deposited into a bank account in the name of First Financial Group, a fictitious name under which Martin does business.  Additionally, Martin obtained at least one check from a customer for the purpose of purchasing securities.  Martin misappropriated those funds.  Through his schemes, Martin has obtained at least $837,000 and apparently more than $2.4 million., The Complaint alleges that Martin violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Ordered to Pay Over $22 Million for Role in Accounting Fraud</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that Henry C. Yuen, the former chairman and chief executive officer of Gemstar-TV Guide International, Inc., has been ordered to pay over $22 million for his role in a scheme to defraud investors by inflating Gemstars licensing and advertising revenues. In addition, Yuen will be permanently barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company., After a three week trial in December 2005, in the Central District of California, United States District Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer found in favor of the Commission and against Yuen on all of the SECs charges. The court found that Yuen had committed securities fraud by making misrepresentations and omissions of material fact about certain Gemstar revenues, that Yuen aided and abetted Gemstars primary violations of the periodic reporting and record keeping control requirements, and that Yuen lied to Gemstars auditors. , On May 8, 2006, the court ordered Yuen to pay a total of $22,327,231 in disgorgement, penalties, and interest, and entered a permanent injunction against future securities law violations and a permanent bar from serving as an officer or director of a public company. The court found that Yuen received $10,577,692 in ill-gotten gains from his fraudulent conduct, consisting of (1) $3,022,452 in gross bonus compensation received by Yuen during the period of the fraud, and (2) $7,555,240 in excess trading profit he received by selling Gemstar stock during the period of the fraud. The court ordered Yuen to pay a civil money penalty equal to the amount of disgorgement., Gemstar is a Los Angeles-based media and technology company that publishes TV Guide magazine and an interactive program guide (IPG) for televisions that enables consumers to navigate through and select television programs. During the relevant period, Gemstar generated revenues from the IPG by licensing the technology to third parties and selling advertising on the IPG. In statements to securities analysts and the investing public, Gemstar repeatedly touted the IPG technology and IPG advertising revenues as the companys future and as the value driver of the companys stock, and downplayed expected declines in revenue from TV Guide magazine. When Gemstar announced for the first time that certain of its IPG licensing and advertising revenue may have been improperly recorded, its stock price declined by approximately 37%, causing a market loss in excess of $3 billion., The SECs complaint, filed in June 2003, alleges that from June 1999 through September 2002, Gemstar overstated its total revenues by at least $248 million to meet its ambitious projections for revenue growth from IPG licensing and advertising. The complaint further alleges that Yuen directed and approved Gemstars fraudulent recording of IPG licensing and advertising revenue and approved fraudulent disclosure documents. The complaint alleges that Yuen knew, but did not disclose, that Gemstar was improperly recognizing and reporting licensing and advertising revenue from seven companies and that he participated in fraudulently diverting revenue from one business sector to another to meet sector revenue projections. Additionally, the complaint alleges that Yuen signed false management representation letters to Gemstars auditors regarding the structure of certain transactions. , The complaint charges Yuen with securities fraud, falsifying Gemstars books and records, aiding and abetting Gemstars reporting and record-keeping violations, and making false statements to auditors, in violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19694.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The new charges add a fourteenth individual defendant, Jason Smith (Smith), age 29, a resident of Jersey City, New Jersey and a letter carrier with the U.S. Postal Service. The new charges allege that, while serving on a federal grand jury investigating Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (Bristol-Myers), Smith leaked information about the proceedings to co-defendants Eugene Plotkin (Plotkin) and David Pajcin (Pajcin), who traded in Bristol-Myers securities based on the information. By leaking the information, Smith violated grand jury secrecy rules and his oath as a grand juror., As alleged in the Complaint, beginning in early 2005, Smith was serving on a federal grand jury in the District of New Jersey convened to investigate potential accounting fraud involving Bristol-Myers and certain officers of that company. Plotkin and Pajcin set up a scheme with Smith in which Smith leaked information about the grand jury proceedings to Pajcin and Plotkin in order to enable them to trade on this non-public information. Among other things, Smith communicated to Plotkin and Pajcin that it appeared as if a high-ranking Bristol-Myers officer would be indicted, and based on that information, Plotkin and Pajcin traded in an attempt to profit on the negative information, initially in an account in Pajcins name and later, in a foreign account in the name of his aunt, defendant Sonja Anticevic (Anticevic). Plotkin and Pajcin also tipped Plotkins father, defendant Mikhail Plotkin, and defendant Henry Siegel (Siegel), in return for a share of their trading profits. Later, a day before the announcement of a deferred prosecution agreement with Bristol-Myers that did not include an indictment of the high-ranking officer, Smith tipped Plotkin and Pajcin that the grand jury had decided not to return an indictment against the high-ranking officer. Based on this tip, Plotkin and Pajcin caused various accounts to liquidate or cover their positions in an attempt to avoid losses., This Complaint follows three prior complaints filed by the Commission which charged insider trading resulting in at least $6.7 million of illicit gains from two other schemes orchestrated by Plotkin and Pajcin. In the first scheme, Stanislav Shpigelman (Shpigelman), a mergers and acquisitions analyst at Merrill Lynch, provided Plotkin and Pajcin with information about pending mergers and acquisitions deals on which Merrill Lynch was working, prior to the time such information became public in exchange for a share of the profits made from trades based on this information. In the second scheme, Plotkin and Pajcin recruited two individuals, first Nickolaus Shuster, and later Juan C. Renteria, Jr., to obtain employment at a printing plant which prints <i>BusinessWeek</i> magazine for the sole purpose of stealing advance copies of the magazine before it was distributed to the public. Plotkin and Pajcin then traded on the basis of a market moving column in the magazine and tipped others to trade in exchange for a percentage of their trading profits. In total, Plotkin and Pajcin traded in at least 26 stocks within one year based on inside information obtained through these schemes. Todays Complaint alleges that Smith provided Pajcin with some funding for Pajcins and Plotkins other insider trading schemes, and Plotkin and Pajcin agreed to provide Smith with a percentage of Pajcins trading profits based upon information derived from this scheme, as well as other insider trading schemes., To date, the Commission has charged 14 individuals located in the United States and Europe for their roles in the scheme. Todays filing adds Smith as a defendant. A description of the other defendants is available in the Commissions litigation release dated April 11, 2006, <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19650.htm>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19650.htm</a>., The Commission alleges that, as a result of trading in various securities on the basis of material, non-public information obtained pursuant to the grand jury and other schemes, the defendants engaged in illegal insider trading in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that defendants Smith, Pajcin, Plotkin, Anticevic, Siegel, and Mikhail Plotkin also violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 by virtue of their insider trading in Bristol-Myers. In addition, the Commission alleges that defendants Plotkin, Pajcin, and Shpigelman violated Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14e-3 thereunder by trading in the stock of a company while in possession of material, non-public information related to a cash tender offer for such companys stock. Among other things, the Complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, the disgorgement of all illegal profits plus prejudgment interest, the imposition of civil monetary penalties, and orders requiring the defendants to repatriate to the United States proceeds of the fraud in accounts outside the United States., The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York, the United States Attorneys Office for the District of New Jersey, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Duggan, of Vancouver, British Columbia, in connection with a stock manipulation and accounting fraud scheme that occurred between 1999 and 2002. The judgment permanently enjoins Duggan from violating the antifraud, reporting, books and records and internal accounting controls provisions of the federal securities laws. The judgment also orders Duggan to pay a $25,000 civil penalty, prohibits him from acting as an officer or director of a publicly-traded company and bars him from participating in any offering of a penny stock., The judgment against Duggan arises out of an April 21, 2005 civil action filed by the Commission against Exotics.com, Inc., a Nevada corporation based in Vancouver, British Columbia, and 12 other principal defendants and a relief defendant. The Commission alleges in its complaint that, between at least 1999 and 2002, Exotics, which was then an Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board company in the business of operating adult Web sites, was the subject of a manipulation and accounting fraud perpetrated by, among others, its officers, attorneys and outside auditors. The Commission alleges that Duggan, who during the relevant period was a certified general accountant (CGA) in Canada and the chief executive officer and a director of Exotics sole subsidiary, played a role in the scheme by, among other things, approving Exotics false reporting of $3.6 million of goodwill in its financial statements (which led to an overstatement of assets by approximately 627%) and reviewing and approving drafts of fax and e-mail spam messages sent out on behalf of the company which contained misleading financial information., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, Duggan consented to the entry of the final judgment against him. The final judgment enjoins Duggan from violating Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-13 thereunder.

The Commission alleges that Timothy M. Roberts, 36, of Longboat Key, Florida, authorized the fax promotion and reaped more than $400,000 by unloading his Infinium Labs shares in the ensuing run-up in trading volume., According to the Commission’s complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, Roberts hired a stock promoter in November 2004 to send faxes to tens of thousands of potential investors across the country.  The faxes made it appear as if Infinium Labs were on the verge of launching its flagship product, a home videogame system called the “Phantom.”  In fact, at the time of the fax campaign, Infinium Labs lacked the financial resources to overcome the significant technological and manufacturing hurdles preventing it from marketing the game system to consumers.  The faxes also included baseless stock price targets, predicting that Infinium Labs’ stock price would rise as much as 3,000% in the coming weeks, and falsely claimed that the company was headed by a developer of the Microsoft X-Box., The Commission alleges that, over the four months of the fax campaign, Roberts took advantage of the increased trading volume in Infinium Labs stock to sell approximately $422,500 of his personal stock holdings.  Many of Roberts’s stock sales went unreported to the public.  The Commission’s complaint also alleges that Roberts paid the promoter with four million shares of his own Infinium Labs stock in violation of the registration provisions of the federal securities laws., The Commission seeks to enjoin Roberts from future violations of the antifraud, stock registration, and ownership disclosure provisions of the federal securities laws.  In its complaint, the Commission requests that the District Court order Roberts to disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, impose a civil money penalty, and bar him from participating in penny stock offerings and from serving as an officer or director of a publicly-traded company.  , The stock promoter hired by Roberts, Michael O.

In connection with the scheme, the defendants reaped financial benefits by secretly entering into or approving arrangements with at least eight preferred customers allowing them to engage in frequent short-term trading to the potential detriment of other investors in the funds. In connection with certain of the arrangements, Tambone and Hussey accepted so-called sticky assets - long-term investments that were to remain in place in return for allowing the investors to actively trade in the funds. , The SEC alleges that although the defendants were responsible for and directed the firms efforts to sell the Columbia funds to investors, they did not disclose to these investors the existence of these arrangements. Indeed, quite the contrary, in connection with selling the funds, the defendants knowingly allowed Columbia Funds Distributor to disseminate prospectuses that falsely represented that the funds did not permit or were otherwise hostile to market timing or other short-term or excessive trading because of its harmful effect on the funds. Further, Tambone signed hundreds of agreements with fund purchasers in which he expressly represented and warranted that the prospectuses were not misleading. , The SEC further alleges that Tambone and Hussey aided and abetted violations by Columbia Management Advisors, which breached its duty to act at all times in the best interests of the Columbia mutual funds and to provide full and fair disclosure of all material facts to investors. Columbia Management Advisors is a registered investment adviser that manages Columbia mutual funds. Columbia Funds Distributor is a registered broker-dealer that is the principal underwriter and entity responsible for selling the funds. During the relevant period, both were subsidiaries of FleetBoston Financial Corporation. , The specific charges against the defendants in the federal court action are that they violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and aided and abetted Columbia Management Advisors Distributors violations of Section 15(c)(1) of the Exchange Act, Columbia Management Advisors violations of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and the Columbia entities violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. The SEC is seeking injunctive relief, disgorgement and civil penalties. , On February 9, 2005, the SEC had filed a complaint in the District of Massachusetts alleging claims against the defendants arising from the same conduct (Litigation Release No. 19069 (February 9, 2005)). On April 15, 2005, the defendants filed motions to dismiss the complaint. On January 27, 2006, the court (Judge Nathaniel Gorton) granted the defendants motions and dismissed the complaint without prejudice. Among other things, the court found that the defendants could not be held primarily liable under Exchange Act 10(b) or Securities Act 17(a) for misrepresentations and omissions because the statements in the prospectuses could not be attributed to them. , On March 13, 2006, the SEC sought leave to file an amended complaint, and because the dismissal constituted a final judgment under First Circuit precedent, the SEC also filed a Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) motion to vacate the judgment on March 22, 2006. The defendants opposed the motion to vacate the judgment. On May 5, 2006, the court denied the motion to vacate, rendering moot the motion to amend. The court found while the SEC may have met the standard for a motion to amend, it did not show exceptional circumstances warranting the vacation of the judgment. However, the court also indicated that notwithstanding the courts dismissal of the initial complaint, the SEC could still bring amended claims in a new lawsuit. , For additional information see <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18590.htm>Litigation Release No. 18590</a> (February 24, 2004) and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr19069.htm>Litigation Release No. 19069</a> (February 9, 2005). , <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2006/comp19708.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19708.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

As a result of its settlement with both OFHEO and the Commission, Fannie Mae will pay a total civil penalty of $400 million to the U.S. government. , The Commission filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia charging Fannie Mae with violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder; and violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act. Without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, Fannie Mae consented to the entry of a final judgment in the Commissions federal lawsuit enjoining Fannie Mae from further violations. , In its federal court Complaint, the Commission charged that, between 1998 and 2004, Fannie Mae engaged in a financial fraud involving multiple violations of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) in connection with the preparation of its annual and quarterly financial statements. These violations had the effect, among other things, of falsely portraying stable earnings growth and reduced income statement volatility, and - for year-ended 1998 - of maximizing bonuses and achieving forecasted earnings. , Specifically, in its Complaint the Commission alleged that Fannie Mae failed to comply with the accounting requirements of Statement of Accounting Standards (SFAS) 91, which requires companies to recognize loan fees, premiums and discounts as an adjustment over the life of the applicable loans. In the fourth quarter of 1998, by not recording the full adjustment required by SFAS 91, Fannie Mae understated its expenses and overstated its income by a pre-tax amount of $199 million. Managements decision to book an amount significantly less than the adjustment amount required by SFAS 91 resulted in the company not only exceeding Wall Street expectations, but also hitting the earnings per share target necessary to trigger maximum bonuses. In the periods that followed, Fannie Mae made other departures from SFAS 91, including the implementation of a SFAS 91 Policy in 2000. Fannie Maes SFAS 91 Policy used a precision threshold to determine the SFAS 91 adjustment amount the company would record. There is no support for the use of a threshold in SFAS 91. Implementation of the Policy led to misstatements of SFAS 91 amortization in all periods from the fourth quarter of 2000 through the second quarter of 2004. The Commission alleges that, on at least one occasion, Fannie Mae booked income when it was within its own Policy threshold, with the effect of meeting its earnings targets. , The Commissions Complaint also alleges that Fannie Mae failed to comply with the accounting requirements of SFAS 133, which governs the accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities. Fannie Mae disregarded the requirements of SFAS 133 and qualified transactions for certain hedge accounting treatment based on erroneous interpretations and an unjustified reliance on materiality. By failing to comply with the requirements of SFAS 133, the company failed to qualify for hedge accounting. This failure led to the company issuing materially false and misleading financial statements for the periods covering the first quarter of 2001 through the second quarter of 2004. The vast majority of the anticipated restatement of at least an $11 billion reduction of previously reported net income is a result of Fannie Maes improper hedge accounting. , In its Complaint, the Commission also alleged improper accounting practices involving the estimation and maintenance of the Loan Loss Reserve, the process of classifying the companys portfolio securities, the amortization of debt issuance costs, the consolidation of certain securitization transactions, the accounting for Dollar Rolls, and the valuation of aircraft asset-backed securities, among others. Several of the transactions, acts, practices, or courses of business alleged in the Commissions Complaint were directed and/or implemented with the knowledge or approval of Fannie Maes senior management acting within their scope of authority. , In determining to accept Fannie Maes settlement offer, the Commission considered the cooperation that Fannie Mae provided the Commission staff during its investigation. The Commission acknowledges the assistance of OFHEO in its investigation, which is continuing as to others. , <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2006/comp19710.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19710.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Pa.)</h2>, <h2>SEC Charges Frederick W. Anton III With Violating Insider Trading Laws</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) announced today that it has filed a complaint against Frederick W. Anton III (Anton) in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania alleging that Anton engaged in unlawful tipping of material nonpublic information about PMA Capital Corporation (PMA). The complaint alleges that Anton, the former Chairman of PMA, a Philadelphia based insurance company, unlawfully tipped David L. Johnson, a former PMA employee, and encouraged him to sell PMA stock prior to the November 4, 2003, public announcement that PMA would be discontinuing its payment of a common stock dividend and increasing the carried loss reserves at its reinsurance subsidiary, PMA Reinsurance (PMA Re). , The complaint further alleges that on October 31, 2003, Johnson contacted Anton regarding an adverse analyst report that Johnson had received about PMA. In response to Johnsons inquiry about the financial health of PMA, Anton replied that PMA was not doing well, referred to Johnsons large PMA holdings as having too many eggs in one basket, disclosed that PMA Re would be increasing its loss reserves and that PMA would be eliminating the payment of a common stock dividend. According to the complaint, Antons disclosure that PMA would be eliminating the common stock dividend and that PMA Re would be increasing its loss reserves revealed material information that was not publicly available at the time. The complaint alleges that although Anton considered information regarding the reserve issue and the cessation of the common stock dividend confidential issues that were likely to have a substantial impact on the stock price and the reputation of PMA, and was aware that it was company policy that material nonpublic information regarding the company should not be disclosed to the public, Anton did not tell Johnson that he expected him to keep the information conveyed in their conversation confidential or that he should not trade based on this information. , Following his discussion with Anton, and on the basis of the information he received, Johnson sold 20,000 shares of PMA stock on October 31, 2003, and 20,000 shares of stock on November 3, 2003. Further relying on the information he received, Johnson tipped his son, who, on November 2, 2003, sold 3,300 shares of PMA stock owned jointly with his wife and 3,600 shares of stock in his capacity as custodian for his daughters. All sales were in advance of the November 4, 2003, public announcement that PMA would be discontinuing its payment of a common stock dividend and increasing significantly its carried loss reserves at PMA Re. The day of the announcement, PMAs common stock closed at a price of $5.03 per share, down 62% from the prior days close of $10.00 per share. As a result of their sales of PMA stock, Johnson and his son avoided a combined $381,333 in losses. , The Commissions complaint alleges that Antons conduct violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint seeks a permanent injunction enjoining Anton from further violations of 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, a civil penalty in the amount of $1,143,999, which represents three times Johnson and his sons losses avoided, and a permanent bar against Anton prohibiting him from acting as an officer or director of any public company. , <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2006/comp19712.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19712.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Utah)</h2>, <h2>Nine Defendants Enjoined in Freedom Surf Market Manipulation Action</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that on May 4, 2006, the U.S. District Court in Salt Lake City granted the Commissions motion for summary judgment against defendants Allen Z. Wolfson, Mervyn A. Phelan, Sr. (Phelan Sr.) and John Cruickshank for violating the anti-fraud provisions, and, except for Cruickshank, the registration provisions of the securities laws. , According to the undisputed facts underlying the Courts ruling, Phelan Sr., who controlled all publicly traded shares of Freedom Surf, Inc., gave Wolfson 345,000 Freedom Surf shares at no cost. Between July and October 2000, Wolfson caused the bid price of the stock to increase from $5 to $40 by calling in consistently higher bids for his brokers to enter on the OTC Bulletin Board. Wolfson also caused the price of Freedom Surf stock to rise by calling in arranged trades of Freedom Surf stock through brokerage accounts he controlled. Cruickshank aided and abetted the manipulative activity by filing false statements, at Phelan Sr.s behest, with the National Association of Securities Dealers to get Freedom Surf stock accepted for trading. , The Court enjoined Wolfson and Phelan Sr. from violating sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17 (a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5. The Court enjoined Cruickshank from violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act. Besides enjoining the defendants, the Court ordered Wolfson to pay disgorgement of $76,562.50, prejudgment interest of $27,671, and a penalty of $110,000. The Court ordered Phelan Sr. to pay disgorgement of $73,733, prejudgment interest of $22,659; and a penalty of $110,000. The Court ordered Cruickshank to pay disgorgement of $36,895, prejudgment interest of $10,195, and a penalty of $55,000. The Court also granted the Commissions request for officer and director bars against Phelan Sr. and Cruickshank, and a penny stock bar against Phelan Sr. In a prior SEC action, Wolfson likewise received a penny stock bar. , On May 30, 2006, the Court also entered Final Judgments permanently enjoining six other defendants who had settled with the Commission without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions Complaint. According to the Commissions Complaint, four of the defendants, Salomon Grey Financial Corporation, Angelo Paul Koupas, Kyle Rowe, and Christopher Roundtree, sold Freedom Surf stock to individual investors after Wolfson had artificially inflated the price of the stock. Pursuant to a pre-arranged agreement with Koupas and Rowe, Wolfson sold a block of 25,000 Freedom Surf shares at a 50% discount (approximately $6 per share) to Salomon Grey, formerly a Dallas broker-dealer. Salomon Grey brokers, in turn, sold the stock to retail customers at prices over $12 per share, constituting excessive markups of 100% or more to the prevailing market price. Rowe set the prices for the retail trades at the time of each customers order, and Roundtree executed the trades. , Under the settlements, the Court enjoined Salomon Grey, Koupas and Rowe from violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5. Further, Salomon Grey was enjoined from violating, and Koupas and Rowe were enjoined from aiding and abetting violations of, Section 15(c)(1) of the Exchange Act. Roundtree was enjoined from violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and aiding and abetting violations of Section 15(c)(1) of the Exchange Act. In addition, the settlements provide that Koupas and Rowe are jointly and severally liable for disgorgement of $122,559 and prejudgment interest of $46,229. Further, Koupas and Rowe agreed to pay penalties of $75,000 and $50,000, respectively. Roundtrees settlement provides that he pay disgorgement of $1.00 and a penalty of $25,000. , In separate settled administrative proceedings, Salomon Grey has offered to have its broker-dealer registration revoked, and Koupas, Rowe and Roundtree have offered to be barred from association with a broker or dealer, with Roundtree having the right to reapply in one year. , Also, on May 30, 2006, the Court entered Final Judgments enjoining two other defendants, Feng Shui Consultants, Inc. and A-Z Professional Consultants Retirement Trust, Inc. The Commission alleged that these entities were controlled by Wolfson, and were used to set up brokerage accounts out of which Wolfson effected arranged Freedom Surf trades. Under the settlements, the Court enjoined these entities from violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5. The Court also barred these defendants from participating in offerings of penny stock. , On May 26, 2006, the Court also granted the Commissions motion to voluntarily dismiss defendant AZW Irrevocable Trust, another entity controlled by Wolfson with a brokerage account involved in manipulative Freedom Surf trades. AZW Irrevocable Trust is believed to be defunct. , The <i>SEC v. Wolfson</i> litigation is now complete, except for the Commissions planned distribution to injured investors. , For more information about this case, see the Commissions <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17756.htm>Litigation Release No. 17756</a>, dated September 30, 2002; <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18486.htm>Litigation Release No. 18486</a>, dated December 3, 2003; <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18230.htm>Litigation Release No. 18230</a>, dated July 14, 2003; <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18646.htm>Litigation Release No. 18646</a>, dated March 29, 2004; <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr19054.htm>Litigation Release No. 19054</a>, dated January 27, 2005; <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr19201.htm>Litigation Release No. 19201</a>, dated April 21, 2005; <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr19582.htm>Litigation Release 19582</a>, dated March 1, 2006. ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19713.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The Commission previously filed similar charges against five individuals. The most recent charges arise out of separate schemes by Jay Slesinger and Maurice Servetnick and Jay Rice in which Slesinger and Rice illegally purchased stock in the NewAlliance IPO in violation of the federal securities laws. Among other things, Servetnick negotiated an arrangement pursuant to which relief defendant Moshe Ariel purchased stock in the IPO. The SECs actions were brought in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut. , According to the Commissions complaints, the actions arise out of the April 2004 conversion of New Haven Savings Bank (NHSB), which was based in New Haven, Connecticut, from a mutual form of organization to a stock form of organization. Because mutual banks are owned by their depositors, the depositors are given first priority in receiving the shares arising out of the conversions initial public offering. The Commissions complaint against Slesinger, Servetnick, and Ariel alleges that Slesinger entered into an illegal arrangement with a depositor of NHSB pursuant to which he used the depositor to illegally purchase 195,171 shares of NewAlliance Bancshares in the IPO. The complaint also alleges that Servetnick, then a registered representative associated with a broker-dealer, initiated the arrangement between defendant Slesinger and the depositor. The complaint further alleges that Servetnick orchestrated an arrangement between relief defendant Ariel and the same depositor whereby the depositor served as a nominee to purchase 40,000 shares of NewAlliance stock for Ariel. The Commissions complaint against Rice alleges that Rice, a former registered representative associated with a broker-dealer, entered into an illegal arrangement with a depositor of NHSB pursuant to which he used the depositor as a nominee to illegally purchase 66,000 shares of NewAlliance stock in the IPO. , The Commissions complaints allege that Slesinger, Servetnick, and Rice violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Servetnick is also charged with violating Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act. Ariel was named as a relief defendant because he received proceeds of the violation and has no legitimate claim to the money. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Slesinger and Servetnick agreed to a permanent injunction and the payment of disgorgement plus prejudgment interest of $481,119 and $28,167, respectively, and a civil penalty of $120,000 and $25,885, respectively. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Ariel agreed to the payment of disgorgement plus prejudgment interest of $87,087. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Rice agreed to a permanent injunction and the payment of disgorgement plus prejudgment interest of $170,962. The issue of a civil penalty against Rice will be subject to further litigation. , Todays actions are the result of ongoing investigations by the SEC, the U.S. Attorney for the District of Connecticut, and the New Haven Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The SEC also acknowledges the assistance and cooperation of the Connecticut Department of Banking, Securities and Business Investment Division.

The Commission filed an emergency enforcement action in federal district court in Massachusetts and obtained a temporary restraining order, asset freezes, and other relief against two individuals and one corporate entity in connection with the affinity fraud. Affinity fraud refers to investment scams that prey upon members of identifiable groups, such as religious or ethnic communities, the elderly, or professional groups. , The Commissions papers charge Sanderley R. De Vasconcelos and Victor Sales with promoting a pyramid scheme known as FoneClub that targets Brazilians and Brazilian-Americans living in the area of Framingham, Massachusetts. The Commission alleged in its complaint that the defendants falsely promised members of the Brazilian community that they would earn substantial sums of money by paying approximately $2,000 to $5,000 to become members of a company referred to as the FoneClub that purportedly sells prepaid telephone calling cards through a multi-level marketing structure. However, the complaint alleged that the defendants, who have emphasized to potential investors that neither they nor the company will earn profits from the sale of phone cards, are in reality luring victims into a pyramid scheme in which its members only make money through the recruitment of new members. The complaint alleged that the defendants emphasized in their sales pitch, which was given in Portuguese, that God wanted the Brazilian community to prosper financially and that the FoneClub would provide the opportunity for it to do so. , According to the Commissions complaint, the defendants claim to have signed up about 2,000 members for their organization. De Vasconcelos is a resident of Nashua, New Hampshire. Sales lives in Framingham, Massachusetts. Universo Foneclub Corporation, which until May 1, 2006, was known as FoneClub, Inc., is located in Charlestown, Massachusetts. The Commissions complaint alleged that the defendants claim that, by paying a $1,990 membership fee to become a manager with the company or by paying $4,990 to become an executive, investors will earn the right to receive 30% of the membership fee paid by their recruits as well as a share of the companys profits. The complaint asserted that the companys website, which is in Portuguese, boasts how a member could, after twelve months with the company, earn $17,000 per month from the program. , The Commission alleged in its complaint that the defendants violated anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The Commission also alleged that the defendants violated the registration provisions of the securities laws, namely Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933. In response to the Commissions request for emergency relief, the Honorable George A. OToole, Jr., United States District Judge for the District of Massachusetts, issued a temporary restraining order prohibiting the defendants from directly or indirectly continuing to violate the federal securities laws and froze the defendants assets.

Bank für Arbeit und Wirtschaft und Österreichische Postsparkasse Aktiengesellschaft</i>, 06 CV 04222 (DC) (S.D.N.Y. filed June 5, 2006)</h2>, <h2>SEC Files Settled Action Against Major Austrian Bank for Aiding And Abetting Refco Fraud</h2>]","[The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission) today announced that, on June 5, 2006, it filed a settled civil injunctive action in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against BAWAG P.S.K. Bank für Arbeit und Wirtschaft und Österreichische Postsparkasse Aktiengesellschaft (BAWAG). The Commissions Complaint in that action alleges that BAWAG, a major Austrian bank, helped Refco Group Ltd. (Refco) conceal hundreds of millions of dollars in debt owed to Refco by an entity controlled by Refcos Chief Executive Officer, thereby aiding and abetting Refcos violations of the antifraud and periodic reporting provisions of the federal securities laws. , The Commissions Complaint alleges that, from at least February 2000 into 2005, BAWAG engaged in a series of fiscal year-end transactions with Refco and Refco Group Holdings, Inc. designed to conceal the real condition of Refcos balance sheet. In spite of its name, Refco Group Holdings Inc. (RGHI) was never a Refco subsidiary, but instead was an entity controlled by, and eventually completely owned by, Phillip R. Bennett, Refcos Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Accordingly, the RGHI receivables were related party transactions on Refcos books, and the fiscal year-end transactions aided a scheme by Refco and Bennett to move the related party receivables off Refcos books at the end of each fiscal year. The Commissions Complaint further alleges that the scheme utilized a series of short-term loans to shift the receivables temporarily to BAWAG just before the end of February each year. (Refcos fiscal year-end was the end of February.) At the end of each Refco fiscal year, the short-term loans allowed RGHI to pay off at least part of its debt to Refco. RGHI then owed a debt to BAWAG, which was secured in part by a deposit from Refco to an account at BAWAG. A few days after the Refco fiscal year-ends, the transactions were reversed so that the debt once again resided with the Bennett-controlled entity. , The Commissions Complaint also alleges that Refco made certain representations to investors and filings with the Commission that failed to disclose the RGHI receivables, including: a private offering circular used by Refco to sell senior subordinated notes in connection with a 2004 leveraged recapitalization; a Registration Statement filed with the Commission that Refco used to offer those notes publicly in April 2005; an Annual Report that Refco filed with the Commission for Refcos fiscal year ended February 28, 2005; and a Registration Statement filed with the Commission that Refco used to make its initial offering of common stock in August 2005. The federal securities laws required that each of those Refco representations and filings disclose the RGHI related party receivables. (After the August 2005 offering of common stock, Refco Inc. became the corporate successor to Refco Group Ltd. On October 17, 2005, Refco filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.) , Finally, the Commissions Complaint alleges that BAWAG had additional connections with Refco, including, for a period of time, an equity interest in Refco. Partly as a result of those connections, and while assisting Refco with its fiscal year-end transactions, former BAWAG executives understood, from at least 2002 through 2004, that Refco had misstated its balance sheet, that Bennett and BAWAG intended to cash out their Refco ownership positions, and that concealment of the RGHI receivables would increase the likelihood of Refco being sold. By the time of the February 2005 year-end transactions, the former executives knew that Refco would file a Registration Statement with the Commission for its senior subordinated notes and that the Registration Statement would not disclose the related party receivables. Accordingly, the Complaint alleges, by assisting in the fiscal year-end fraudulent scheme, BAWAG knowingly aided and abetted Refco in its deception of investors who purchased Refco securities. , Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions Complaint, BAWAG consented to the entry of a Final Judgment that will permanently enjoin it from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and from aiding and abetting violations of Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act and Rule 15d-2 thereunder. , In a related action, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York announced today that it had entered into an agreement with BAWAG not to prosecute the bank for its role in assisting Bennett in his scheme to hide the RGHI receivables and that, in connection with that agreement, BAWAG would forfeit $337.5 million, which funds will be distributed to victims of the Refco fraud. The Office also announced that BAWAG would pay at least $675 million (including the forfeited $337.5 million) to settle its non-prosecution agreement and related claims against it by the Refco bankruptcy estate. , The Commissions investigation is continuing. The Commission acknowledges the assistance and cooperation of the Office of the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, the United States Postal Inspection Service, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. , <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2006/comp19716.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19716.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The judgment enjoined Sherrill from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Sherrill consented to the entry of the judgment without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions Complaint. The court ordered Sherrill to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest and a civil penalty in the amounts of $381,400, $17,183 and $25,000, respectively, provided that the amounts ordered as disgorgement and interest will be reduced by any amount ordered as restitution in Sherrills related criminal case. , The Complaint, filed on February 9, 2005, alleged that, from approximately May 2003 through January 26, 2005, Sherrill, a registered representative of an Atlanta-based broker-dealer, perpetrated a Ponzi scheme, selling over $400,000 of promissory notes to at least nineteen investors. Under the terms of these notes, Sherrill borrowed from his investors principal amounts ranging from $4,400 to $41,000, in exchange for a promise that he would pay monthly interest of 10% per annum and return to them the notes principal at the end of the notes term of either twelve or twenty-four months. Contrary to his representations to some investors, Sherrill did not use investor funds to expand his business operations or to purchase mutual funds. Instead, he deposited most, if not all, of the note proceeds into his personal bank account, combined those proceeds with his own money, and paid his living expenses and various operating expenses of his business from the balance. Sherrill did not disclose to the investors that he paid their monthly interest by using money from new investors and that lacked the capacity to repay the principal without raising new investments. , See also: <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr19076.htm>L.

No. 06-10984-MEL)</h2>, <h2>SEC Obtains Preliminary Injunctions and Assets Freezes Against Massachusetts-Based Investment Adviser</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that it filed an emergency enforcement action today in federal district court in Massachusetts and obtained, by consent, preliminary injunctions, asset freezes and other relief against Frank J. Russo, a Massachusetts-based investment adviser and three affiliated entities in connection with a scheme to defraud investors through investments in limited partnerships. The Commissions complaint alleges that Russo, of Wakefield, Massachusetts, and his investment advisory corporation, FJR Corporation (FJR), raised at least $15 million from at least 160 investors in 12 states to invest in two limited partnerships controlled by Russo: Russo Associates Limited Partnership (Russo Associates) and Eliot Partners (Eliot Partners). , The Commissions complaint alleges that since at least 1996, Russo, FJR, Russo Associates and Eliot Partners offered and sold unregistered securities in the form of interests in the limited partnerships. The complaint alleges that Russo told investors and potential investors that they could expect returns of at least 10% and that he would only earn advisory fees if returns exceeded 10%. The complaint also alleges that Russo told some investors that their funds were being invested in bonds and other investment securities, and that the investments were safe and conservative. However, according to the complaint, Russo diverted at least $11.5 million in investor funds to a private California corporation which Russo co-founded with a college friend. The complaint further alleges that Russo is the California corporations chief financial officer and that he is one of two directors. According to the complaint, the defendants did not disclose the purported investment in the California corporation to investors in the limited partnerships. To the contrary, the complaint alleges that the defendants sent false and misleading account statements to investors reporting fictional returns in excess of 10% and making false statements concerning the investment strategies of the limited partnerships. The complaint further alleges that, when the purported investment in the California corporation proved unprofitable and illiquid, Russo began paying dividends and investor redemptions with money raised from new investors. , The Commissions complaint alleges that the defendants variously violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Section 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Section 7(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940. With the consent of the defendants, the Honorable Morris E. Lasker issued a preliminary injunction against further violations of the securities laws, an order freezing defendants assets, an order prohibiting the acceptance of additional investor funds, an accounting of assets and an order prohibiting the alteration or destruction of relevant documents, as well as other relief, against all defendants. The defendants have not admitted any of the allegations of the complaint, except as to jurisdiction. The Commission also seeks the entry of a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, plus pre-judgment interest as to all defendants and the imposition of civil monetary penalties against defendants Russo and FJR. , The Commission acknowledges Massachusetts Secretary of State William Francis Galvins Securities Division, which first alerted the Commission to Russos activities and at the same time imposed a temporary restraining order against Russo on May 25, 2006, requiring him to cease all investment advisory activities. , <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2006/comp19718.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19718.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Micatrotto, Sr. (Micatrotto), the former Chief Executive Officer, President, and Chairman of the Board of Buca, Inc. (Buca), the corporate parent of the Buca di Beppo and Vinny Ts of Boston national restaurant chains. The Commissions complaint, filed today in federal court in Minneapolis, alleges that Micatrotto received undisclosed compensation and participated in undisclosed related party transactions. , Specifically, the Commissions complaint alleges that from 2000 to 2003, Micatrotto obtained undisclosed compensation in the amount of $849,100 by improperly billing Buca for a variety of personal and non-business expenses. The complaint charges that Micatrotto improperly sought and obtained reimbursement for, among other things, $131,000 in ATM withdrawals; $127,000 in airline tickets submitted for reimbursement multiple times; the entire bill for the grooms dinner at his sons wedding; and other personal expenses, including dog kenneling and the remodeling of his homes in California, Las Vegas and Minneapolis. The complaint further alleges that, since these payments were for personal expenses, not legitimate business expenses, they constituted additional compensation to Micatrotto that should have been reflected in Bucas proxy statements. According to the Commissions complaint, Bucas proxy statements failed to disclose any of these payments as additional compensation to Micatrotto. As a result, Bucas proxy statements for this time period understated Micatrottos annual compensation by amounts ranging from 27% to 74%. , The Commissions complaint further alleges that Bucas public filings, which Micatrotto reviewed and approved, failed to disclose two related party transactions involving Micatrotto. First, Micatrotto sought reimbursement from Buca for his purchase and renovation of an Italian villa titled in Micatrottos and his wifes names. Second, Micatrotto deposited into his personal bank account a payment of $65,000 from one of Bucas vendors, even though this payment was intended as a contribution towards one of Bucas corporate conferences. , Upon the filing of the Commissions complaint, and without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Micatrotto consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Sections 10(b), 13(b)(5), and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, 13b2-1, 13b2-2, 14a-3, and 14a-9 thereunder and aiding and abetting Bucas violations of Sections 13(a), 13b(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder. Micatrotto also agreed to be barred from acting as an officer or director of a publicly-traded company and to pay disgorgement of $65,000 plus prejudgment interest and a civil penalty of $500,000. , The Commission and the United States Attorneys Office for the District of Minnesota conducted parallel investigations of this matter.

Gadel (Gadel), Bucas former Chief Financial Officer, and Daniel J. Skrypek (Skrypek), Bucas former Controller, caused various misstatements and omissions in Bucas public filings. As a result of Gadel and Skrypeks conduct, Bucas public filings understated the compensation paid to Gadel and Bucas former CEO and failed to disclose related party transactions. In addition, Gadel and Skrypek engaged in a financial statement fraud that resulted in the material overstatement of Bucas income in its financial statements. , According to the Commissions complaint, due to Gadel and Skrypeks conduct, Bucas public filings materially understated the executive compensation received by Gadel and Joseph Micatrotto, Sr. (Micatrotto), Bucas former CEO. The Commissions complaint alleges that from 2000 to 2003, Gadel received approximately $96,630 in undisclosed compensation from Buca, including reimbursements for family vacations and visits to strip clubs. The complaint also alleges that from 2000 to 2003, Gadel and Skrypek routinely approved Micatrottos inappropriate requests for reimbursement of a wide variety of personal and non-business expenses resulting in undisclosed compensation to Micatrotto of $849,100. The complaint further alleges that Gadel and Skrypek knew about and failed to ensure disclosure of a series of related party transactions totaling more than $1 million between Buca and an information technology company of which Gadel was a director and shareholder. Gadel and Skrypek also failed to ensure disclosure of a related party transaction in which Micatrotto used Bucas funds to purchase an Italian villa titled in Micatrottos and his wifes names. Finally, the Commissions complaint alleges that Gadel and Skrypek directed a scheme to meet Bucas earnings targets by improperly inflating Bucas income by nearly $12 million from 2000 to 2004 through the improper capitalization of numerous expenses. This fraudulent scheme caused Buca to overstate its annual income in amounts ranging from 18.8% to 36.9%. , The Commissions complaint charges Gadel and Skrypek with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder and aiding and abetting Bucas violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, 14a-3, and 14a-9 thereunder.

Schofield, alleging that he aided and abetted a massive financial fraud by signing and sending false audit confirmations to the auditors of U.S. Foodservice, Inc., a subsidiary of Royal Ahold (Koninklijke Ahold N.V.). Schofield was also charged with insider trading. , The Commissions complaint alleges that U.S. Foodservice personnel contacted vendors and urged them to sign and return the false confirmation letters. In some cases U.S. Foodservice pressured the vendors; in other cases they provided side letters to the vendors assuring the vendors that they did not owe U.S. Foodservice the amounts reflected as outstanding in the confirmation letters. The letters clearly stated that the confirmations were being used in connection with the annual audit and the letters directed the defendants to return the confirmations directly to the companys auditors. , Schofield, who owned and operated several companies that supplied U.S. Foodservice, aided and abetted the fraud by signing and sending to the companys independent auditors confirmation letters that he knew materially misstated the amounts of promotional allowance income paid or owed to U.S. Foodservice. The amounts misstated in the relevant confirmations were wrong by millions of dollars and, in some instances, by more than 100%. , The complaint further alleges that U.S. Foodservice engaged in a scheme to report earnings equal to or greater than its targets, regardless of the companys true performance. U.S. Foodservice inflated its promotional allowance income by at least $700 million for fiscal years 2001 and 2002 and thereby caused Ahold to report materially false operating and net income for these periods. The annual audit confirmation process at U.S. Foodservice was systematically corrupted to help keep the fraud from being discovered. , The Commissions complaint against Schofield also alleges that during February and March of 2000, after learning of material, nonpublic information about Aholds intention to acquire U.S. Foodservice, Schofield traded in the shares of U.S. Foodservice. The complaint alleges that he made illegal profits of approximately $299,206.40. , Schofield has agreed to settle the Commissions action, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder and from aiding and abetting any violation of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder. The judgment orders Schofield to disgorge illegal trading profits of $299,206.40, pay prejudgment interest of $129,820.14, and pay a civil monetary penalty of $299,206.40 for insider trading. The judgment further orders Schofield to pay a separate civil monetary penalty of $25,000 for signing false audit confirmation letters. , In a related action, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York also announced that it has filed criminal charges against Schofield for insider trading and conspiracy to falsify books and records. , The Commissions investigation is continuing.

Phillips issued a final judgment against Daniel Berardi, Jr., Thomas Hawkesworth and Randall W. Harding ordering disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties for their roles in perpetrating a Ponzi scheme based in Southern California.  The judgment orders Berardi and Hawkesworth, managing members of BBH Resources, LLC, to pay over $11 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  The judgment orders Harding, managing member of JTL Financial Group, LLC, to pay over $17 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties., On February 6, 2006, Judge Phillips issued a final judgment against Richard M. Harkless, the managing member of Mx Factors, LLC, and granted the Securities and Exchange Commission’s motion for judgment by default against issuer Mx Factors and its sales agents BBH Resources and JTL Financial.  The judgment against Harkless permanently enjoins him from future securities law violations and orders him to pay over $42 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Mx Factors, BBH Resources, and JTL Financial have been under the control of a court-appointed receiver since the Commission’s action was filed on February 26, 2004 in federal district court in Riverside, California.  , The Commission’s complaint alleged that the defendants fraudulently induced investors nationwide and in Mexico to invest in Mx Factors’ notes, which purportedly paid a “guaranteed” return of 12% in 60 or 90 days.  Mx Factors claimed that it would use the investor funds to provide its clients – construction contractors, wholesalers, and manufacturers – with accounts receivable financing, secured by the client’s assignment of its accounts receivable.  The defendants also represented that investor funds were safe because at least 70% of the receivables were backed or funded by the government.   Instead, the Commission alleged, the defendants operated a Ponzi scheme and skimmed investor funds to finance a Mexican crab fishing business, pay personal expenses, and fund overseas bank accounts., In its lawsuit, the Commission obtained an order freezing each of the defendants’ assets, an order appointing a permanent receiver over Mx Factors, BBH Resources, and JTL Financial, an order requiring Mx Factors and Harkless to repatriate assets from abroad, and preliminarily enjoining all of the defendants from future violations of the securities registration and antifraud provisions – and preliminarily enjoining defendants BBH Resources, JTL Financial, Berardi, Hawkesworth, and Harding from future violations of the broker-dealer registration provisions – of the federal securities laws, Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In June 2004, Berardi, Hawkesworth and Harding consented to permanent injunctions against future violations of the securities laws as well as permanent bars from associating with any broker dealer.  In July 2004, the court issued an order of civil contempt against and bench warrant for the arrest of Harkless for failure to comply with the court’s orders in the case., For information about earlier developments in this matter, see <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18559.htm>Litigation Release No. 18559</a> (Feb. 27, 2004) (complaint and temporary restraining order), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18619.htm>Litigation Release No. 18619</a> (Mar. 11, 2004) (preliminary injunction), and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18779.htm>Litigation Release No. 18779</a> (Jul. 12, 2004) (civil contempt).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19726.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Consequently, the Ardent Funds became illiquid and were unable to meet investor redemption requests. In October, 2005, the Commission filed a First Amended Complaint that added securities fraud claims against defendant Francis J. Saldutti, the Ardent Funds founder and investment adviser, and Douglas Ballew, Northshores former CFO. , On February 25, 2005 and March 10, 2005, the Court granted the Commissions motion for a preliminary injunction enjoining all previously-named defendants from violating the federal securities laws, freezing their assets (subject to certain limited exceptions), and appointing a receiver for defendants Northshore, SCM, and the Ardent Funds. The Courts injunctive orders, among other things, specifically granted the receiver exclusive control of Northshores bank accounts and prevented the defendants from withdrawing, transferring, or concealing any assets from these accounts. Notwithstanding the Courts injunctive orders, on two occasions in March 2005, Wildeman, at Shermans direction, invaded a Northshore safe deposit box and removed all of its contents. , Upon learning of Wildman and Shermans actions, the Commission and receiver jointly moved for contempt sanctions.

Eidson, Scientific-Atlantas Senior Vice President, have consented to the issuance of cease-and-desist Orders for their respective roles in causing Adelphias violations. , The SECs Complaint against Scientific-Atlanta, filed today in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that in or about August 2000, Adelphia requested that Scientific-Atlanta increase the price of digital cable television set-top boxes it was selling to Adelphia and pay the amount of the price increase back to Adelphia in the form of marketing support for the stated purpose of marketing the Scientific-Atlanta cable television set-top boxes. Adelphia did not use the marketing support payments to market Scientific-Atlanta cable television set-top boxes. Adelphia recorded the price increase it paid Scientific-Atlanta as a capital expense, and recognized the marketing support payments as a contra marketing expense, thereby artificially reducing its marketing expense and increasing EBITDA. The transaction did not impact Scientific-Atlantas public financial statements. , The Complaint alleges that Scientific-Atlanta was aware of a number of facts that together demonstrated that Adelphia was misusing the marketing support agreement. Those facts included, among others, (i) a retroactive price increase on set-top boxes previously delivered to Adelphia; (ii) Adelphias request for a commercially unreasonable high dollar amount in marketing support payments; (iii) repeated requests for higher levels of marketing support in later periods even though the major marketing push was to have occurred in earlier periods; (iv) knowledge that Adelphias request for the marketing support agreement was driven by its desire to obtain an accounting benefit; and (v) the inclusion of a false reason for the price increase in one of the contracts documenting the marketing support agreement. , Scientific-Atlanta, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, has consented to the entry of a final judgment, subject to court approval, that requires Scientific-Atlanta to pay $20 million in disgorgement and enjoins Scientific-Atlanta from violating and aiding and abetting any violations and any future violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder.

(Unisource).  According to the Commission, Huscher made more than $54,000 in illegal profits by buying Unisource stock after he learned of Unisources impending acquisition from a good friend who was involved in the investor consortium that acquired Unisource.  Without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, Huscher has agreed to a civil injunction for violations of the federal securities laws and to pay more than $108,000 in disgorgement and civil penalties.  He also agreed to a bar from association with any investment adviser, with a right to reapply after four years., The Commissions complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, alleges that Huscher, 52, of Chicago, Illinois, first learned of a possible Unisource acquisition through his work as a managing director at Madison Dearborn Partners, LLC and Madison Dearborn Partners, Inc. (collectively referred to as MDP).  According to the complaint, in the summer of 2002, a managing director at JP Morgan Securities Inc. (JP Morgan Securities), who was one of Huschers close friends and business associates, called Huscher to see if MDP had any interest in helping to fund the acquisition of Unisource.  The complaint alleges that, after expressing interest, Huscher agreed on behalf of MDP to keep in strict confidence all nonpublic information about Unisource.  In October 2002, MDP decided to drop out of the investor consortium.  JP Morgan Securities, however, moved ahead with the effort and, in November 2003, reached an agreement to acquire Unisource.  According to the complaint, Huschers friend at JP Morgan Securities called Huscher shortly before the announcement of the acquisition to tell Huscher that Unisource would soon be acquired by an investor consortium headed by JP Morgan Securities.  The complaint alleges that Huscher, after learning of the impending acquisition, purchased 8,000 shares of Unisource stock through his personal brokerage accounts.  The complaint further alleges that, following the announcement of the acquisition on November 24, 2003, the price of Unisource stock rose approximately 26%, yielding Huscher $54,692.25 in illegal profits., The complaint charges Huscher with trading on the basis of material, nonpublic information in violation of Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Huscher, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, agreed to the entry of a permanent injunction against future violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Huscher also agreed to pay disgorgement of $54,692.25, prejudgment interest of $7,280.38, and a $54,692.25 civil penalty.  Huscher also has consented to the entry of an order in a public administrative proceeding to be instituted by the Commission barring him from association with any investment adviser, with the right to reapply for association after four years to the appropriate self-regulatory organization, or if there is none, to the Commission pursuant to Section 203(f) of the Investment Advisers Act.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19736.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The Commissions complaint alleges that Sunray Oil Company, Inc. and its principal, Larry Stiles, conducted a fraudulent offering of limited partnership interests in the Abilene Oil &amp; Gas, LP, which raised $1.14 million from 52 investors residing in ten states and Canada.  In connection with the Abilene partnership offering, it is alleged that the defendants made material misrepresentations and omissions concerning, among other things, Sunrays and Stiles prior history in the oil and gas business, the profitability of the partnership, and the use of investor funds.  U.S. District Judge Jerry Buchmeyer granted the Commissions Motion for Emergency Relief and issued an Order:  1) freezing the defendants assets; 2) requiring an accounting; 3) preserving documents; 4) authorizing expedited discovery, and 5) appointing a receiver for all defendants., The Commissions complaint names the following entities and individual as defendants:, The Commissions complaint alleges that the defendants engaged in an unregistered and fraudulent securities offering during which they touted Sunrays 50 years of experience in the oil business, without disclosing that Sunray was only formed in 2000 and that Stiles previous oil and gas company was dissolved in bankruptcy after being assessed over $700,000 in penalties for failing to plug abandoned wells it operated in Texas.  The defendants further represented that their drilling program was so successful that Sunray, the general partner, agreed to repurchase the partnership interest after five years at a 50% profit.  Moreover, the repurchase agreement was to be funded by an Insurance Guarantee Bond or other financial instrument purchased from one of the top twenty European Banks.  In reality, according to the complaint, the company never purchased any bonds or financial instruments to fund the repurchase agreement., The complaint further alleges that Stiles, contrary to representations made to Abilene LP investors, commingled partnership funds in Sunrays operating bank account and diverted at least $247,000 for personal expenses.  Sunray also used investor funds for another undisclosed purpose - to purchase a drilling rig in the name of J&amp;L Drilling, LLC, a Texas limited liability company that is named as a defendant solely for purposes of relief.  In addition to the funds raised in the Abilene partnership offering, the complaint alleges that Sunray and Stiles received approximately $800,000 of investor funds raised in an unlawful prime bank scheme recently halted by the Commission in SEC v. EFS, LLC, et. al. (USDC N.D. Tex. No. 3-06CV0793-M (<a href=/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19689.htm>Lit. Rel. 19689</a> May 5, 2006).  In return for the EFS funds, Sunray purportedly agreed in January 2005, to assign to EFS 50% of all oil and gas interests that Sunray acquired over at least a four-year period.  Further, the complaint alleges that the defendants used Abilene partnership and EFS investor funds to acquire oil and gas leases in Taylor County, Texas, but never assigned an interest in those leases to the Abilene partnership or EFS., The Commissions complaint charges that the defendants have violated Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 [15 U.S.C. §§ 77e(a), 77e(c) and 77q(a)] and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)] and Rule 10b-5 thereunder [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5].   In addition to seeking preliminary and permanent injunctive relief against all defendants, the Commission seeks orders requiring defendants Sunray and Stiles to pay civil monetary penalties and to disgorge all ill-gotten gains, plus prejudgment interest thereon.

Yaroshinsky, a case pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The Amended Complaint adds Victor E. Zak as a defendant in the Commissions previously filed insider trading case against California drug executive Alexander J. Yaroshinsky. The Amended Complaint alleges that Zak, a resident of Newton, Massachusetts, received material non-public information from Yaroshinsky concerning the FDA staffs preliminary analysis of the carcinogenicity tests of Velac Gel, an acne drug being developed by Yaroshinskys then employer, California-based Connetics Corporation. The Amended Complaint alleges that both Zak and Yaroshinsky traded on the basis of this information. In the end, Zak profited from his illegal trading by more than $900,000 and together, Yaroshinsky and Zak benefited financially by more than $1.58 million. , The Amended Complaint alleges that on April 13, 2005, at 2:15 p.m. Yaroshinsky and other representatives of Connetics participated on a telephone call with FDA staff, during which the FDA staff told Connetics that the FDAs Executive Carcinogenicity Assessment Committee had concluded that the Velac Gel vehicle may be a tumor promoter or a carcinogen and that this is a serious issue for a topical product for the treatment of acne . Shortly after the call, Yaroshinsky called Zak, his friend and former neighbor, and told him what he had learned earlier that day from the FDA staff. Minutes later, Zak, who, prior to April 13 had maintained a 5,000 share long position in Connetics, began executing transactions that positioned him to benefit from a drop in Connetics share price. , The Amended Complaint further alleges that between April 13 and June 10, Yaroshinsky and Zak executed numerous trades. Yaroshinsky purchased put contracts in his own account and in a nominee account opened in the name of his mother-in-law and sold shares of Connetics common stock in his own account. Zak purchased put contracts, sold short Connetics shares, and sold his long position of Connetics shares. All of the trading by defendants was conducted in advance of a June 13, 2005 public announcement by Connetics stating that it had received a not approvable letter from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) concerning Velac Gel. After the announcement, Connetics stock price fell 27%. Specifically, the Amended Complaint alleges that Yaroshinsky and Zak violated Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Among other relief, the Amended Complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of all illegal profits, prejudgment interest and the imposition of civil monetary penalties. , The Commission expresses its appreciation to the Chicago Board Options Exchange for its assistance in the investigation of this matter. , For further information, see Litigation Release Nos. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr19625.htm>19625</a> (March 28, 2006) and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19636.htm>19636</a> (April 3, 2006). , <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/2006/comp19738.pdf>SEC Amended Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19738.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

(PowerLinx, formerly known as SeaView Video Technology, Inc.), a manufacturer of security products and underwater cameras that is based in St. Petersburg, Florida, its former chief executive officer, George S. Bernardich III, and its former secretary and treasurer, James R. Cox, for issuing false and misleading press releases and making false and misleading filings with the SEC at various times between 2000 and 2004. PowerLinx consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from violating Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), which are general antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. PowerLinx also consented to being enjoined from violating the periodic reporting, books and records, and internal controls provisions contained in Exchange Act Sections 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 15(d) and Rules 15d-1, 15d-11, 15d-13, and 12b-20 thereunder.

PowerLinx, Bernardich, and Cox consented to the entry of the judgments without admitting or denying the allegations in the SECs complaint. The requested relief is subject to court approval. , The complaint alleges that in September 2004, PowerLinx violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws by issuing materially misleading press releases and filing materially misleading reports with the SEC concerning a purported $23 million sales contract with a defense contractor known as Universal General Corporation (UGC), which, in fact, had no revenues, no assets, and no means to satisfy any portion of its $23 million contractual obligation to PowerLinx. According to the complaint, PowerLinx performed virtually no due diligence to determine whether UGC was legitimate and could meet its contractual obligations. Bernardich was responsible for PowerLinxs due diligence failures and for drafting PowerLinxs materially misleading press releases and SEC filings. , The complaint also alleges that during the first three quarters of fiscal year 2000, PowerLinx fraudulently recognized nearly ninety percent of its reported revenues based on fictitious camera sales by initiating consignment arrangements with numerous dealers and recording the consignment order amounts as revenue before any cameras were manufactured, shipped to the dealers, or sold to customers. During this same period, PowerLinx also issued numerous deceptive press releases that materially misrepresented the companys operations and offered glowing, but unsubstantiated, revenue and earnings forecasts. In April 2001, following a management change, PowerLinx filed with the SEC an annual report for 2000 containing a misleading restatement of revenues and other materially misleading disclosures and accounting errors. According to the complaint, the principal architect of PowerLinxs fraudulent activities during 2000 was its now-deceased former chief executive officer, Richard L. McBride. However, as further alleged, Cox was responsible for certain of PowerLinxs fraud and reporting violations and Bernardich, who had replaced McBride as chief executive officer in February 2001, aided and abetted PowerLinxs reporting violations with respect to the companys 2000 annual report. , In related SEC proceedings, PowerLinxs former independent auditors, Accounting Consultants, Inc. (Accounting Consultants) and Carol L. McAtee, CPA, have consented to the issuance of cease-and-desist orders for causing certain of the companys reporting violations, and to orders pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the SECs Rules of Practice denying them the privilege of appearing or practicing as accountants before the SEC with the right to reapply after two years. The SEC found that Accounting Consultants and McAtee had failed, in repeated instances, to comply with Generally Accepted Auditing Standards in performing their quarterly reviews and year-end audit of PowerLinxs 2000 financial statements. Accounting Consultants and McAtee consented to the issuance of the order without admitting or denying the findings in the Order. For further information, see Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34-54048 (June 27, 2006). , In addition, PowerLinxs current chief financial officer, Douglas Bauer, has consented to the issuance of a cease-and-desist order for his role in causing PowerLinxs reporting violation in connection with its April 2002 restatement of a deferred tax asset. Bauer consented to the issuance of the order without admitting or denying the findings in the Order.

Named as defendants in the complaint are AirTrac, Inc., its CEO, Charles Friend, age 64, of Fountain Valley, California, and its principal salesman, Christopher Bryan, age unknown, of Santa Monica, California., The Commissions complaint alleges that, between January 2004 and April 2005, the defendants raised nearly $1.8 million from the sale of AirTrac stock to over 200 investors nationwide through unsolicited telephone calls.  AirTrac purports to develop and market voice-activated technology that can access the Internet and check e-mail through cellular telephones and personal digital assistants.  The complaint alleges that the defendants falsely claimed that they would use most of the investor funds to develop and market AirTracs purported technology, with the remainder being spent on fundraising efforts and miscellaneous expenses.  In reality, the defendants spent much less than they represented would be spent on the purported technology and much more than had been represented on fundraising efforts, including paying approximately $140,000 to Bryan.  The complaint also alleges that Friend misappropriated approximately $270,000 for his own personal use, including lease payments on his luxury home.  According to the complaint, the defendants falsely represented that AirTrac was on the verge of signing lucrative contracts with several large, well-known telecommunications firms when, in fact, AirTrac had had, at most, only preliminary discussions with these companies.  Furthermore, the defendants falsely represented that AirTrac was preparing to conduct an initial public offering and had applied for listing its stock on a securities exchange.  In fact, AirTrac had not taken the necessary steps to conduct an initial public offering and had not applied for listing with a securities exchange., The complaint, which was filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, alleges that AirTrac, Friend, and Bryan violated the securities registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

No. 06-10984-MEL)</h2>, <h2>SEC Freezes Assets of California Corporation That Received Proceeds of Fraudulent Investment Scheme</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that on June 28, 2006, it filed an amended complaint to add Veritasiti Corporation d/b/a MediaData Corporation (Veritasiti) as a relief defendant in a previously filed enforcement action in federal district court in Massachusetts. Veritasiti has consented to the entry of a preliminary injunction that, among other things, freezes its assets. , The amended complaint names Veritasiti, a California corporation, as a relief defendant based on its receipt of proceeds from the alleged fraud perpetrated by Frank J. Russo, of Wakefield, Massachusetts. The Commissions amended complaint alleges that Russo and his investment advisory corporation, FJR Corporation (FJR), raised at least $15 million from at least 160 investors in 12 states to invest in two limited partnerships controlled by Russo: Russo Associates Limited Partnership (Russo Associates) and Eliot Partners (Eliot Partners). The amended complaint alleges that Russo told investors that their funds were being invested in bonds and other investment securities, and that the investments were safe and conservative. However, according to the amended complaint, Russo diverted at least $11.5 million in investor funds to Veritasiti, which Russo formed with a college acquaintance. The amended complaint further alleges that Russo was Veritasitis chief financial officer and that he was one of two directors. According to the amended complaint, Russo did not disclose the purported investment in Veritasiti to investors in the limited partnerships. To the contrary, the complaint alleges that he sent false and misleading account statements to investors reporting fictional returns in excess of 10% and making false statements concerning the investment strategies of the limited partnerships. The amended complaint alleges that Veritasiti has no legitimate claim to the funds and that it was unjustly enriched by its receipt of those funds. The amended complaint seeks disgorgement of those amounts plus prejudgment interest. , With the consent of Veritasiti, the Honorable Morris E. Lasker issued a preliminary injunction, which among other things, freezes Veritasitis assets, requires an accounting of assets, and prohibits the alteration or destruction of relevant documents. Veritasiti has not admitted any of the allegations of the amended complaint, except as to jurisdiction. , The Commission acknowledges Massachusetts Secretary of State William Francis Galvins Securities Division, which first alerted the Commission to Russos activities and at the same time imposed a temporary restraining order against Russo on May 25, 2006, requiring him to cease all investment advisory activities. , For further information, see Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19718.htm>19718</a> (June 6, 2006). ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19744.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Bell, Virbac’s former CEO and president, Joseph A. Rougraff, Virbac’s former CFO, and Douglas A. Hubert, Virbac’s former Veterinary Division vice president.  In its complaint, filed in the district court for the Northern District of Texas, Fort Worth division, the Commission alleges that, from late 2000 through the first half of 2003, Virbac — through Bell, Rougraff and Hubert — engaged in a fraudulent revenue inflation and expense deferral scheme.  In addition, the Commission announced the institution and simultaneous settlement of cease-and-desist proceedings brought against Virbac distributors Vedco, Inc. (“Vedco”) and Walco International, Inc. (“Walco”), and against Vedco general manager Craig S. Campbell, and Walco chairman and CEO James C. Robison, for causing certain violations by Virbac, Bell, Rougraff and Hubert., The Commission alleges in its complaint that Virbac engaged in a scheme orchestrated by Bell, and that Bell was assisted by Rougraff, Hubert, Vedco, Walco, Campbell, and Robison.  The scheme involved the improper recognition of revenue by means of channel-stuffing, or “loading” of product to distributors, by recording revenue from sham transactions, and by recording revenue from transactions occurring after period-end.  As a result of the scheme, Virbac met unrealistic revenue and earnings projections and managed to sustain the illusion of rapid growth — by fraudulently inflating its revenues and net income by as much as 9% and 694%, respectively, in a given period.  Virbac also manipulated reserves and accruals to overstate earnings.  In the process, Virbac failed to comply with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.  , In the settled civil action, Virbac, Bell, Rougraff and Hubert consented to a judgment of permanent injunction, enjoining them from violating, directly or indirectly, the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act and Exchange Act, and from aiding and abetting the reporting, recordkeeping and internal controls provisions of the Exchange Act. In addition, Bell, Rougraff and Hubert consented to be enjoined from violating, directly or indirectly, the Exchange Act’s financial record falsification, internal controls circumvention, and auditor deception prohibitions, and Bell and Rougraff consented to be enjoined from violating, directly or indirectly, the Sarbanes-Oxley certification provision., As part of the settlement of the civil action, the defendants agreed to additional remedies: Virbac agreed to undertakings to enhance its financial reporting through employee training and certification; Bell consented to an officer and director bar and agreed to pay $95,045 in disgorgement plus prejudgment interest of $15,091, and a $150,000 civil penalty; Rougraff consented to an officer and director bar and agreed to pay $26,668 in disgorgement plus prejudgment interest of $5,656, and a $100,000 civil penalty; and Hubert consented to a five-year officer and director bar and agreed to pay $19,057 in disgorgement plus prejudgment interest of $4,233, provided, however, that the Commission waive payment and not impose a civil penalty based on his sworn financial statement.  In consenting to the judgment, Virbac, Bell, Rougraff and Hubert neither admitted nor denied the non-jurisdictional allegations in the Commission’s compliant., In the settled cease-and-desist proceedings, Walco, Vedco, Robison and Campbell consented to a Commission order to cease and desist from committing or causing violations of certain antifraud provisions of the Securities Act, violations of the Exchange Act’s reporting, recordkeeping and internal controls provisions, and violations of the Exchange Act’s financial record falsification and internal controls circumvention prohibitions, and additionally, as regards Vedco and Campbell, violations of the Exchange Act’s auditor deception prohibition.  As part of its settlement with Robison and Campbell, the Commission named them in the above-referenced civil action solely for the purpose of obtaining against them the $50,000 civil penalty Robison and Campbell each agreed to pay, and the Commission filed and simultaneously settled the civil action against them.  In consenting to the cease-and-desist order, and in Robison’s and Campbell’s each agreeing to pay a civil penalty in settlement of the civil action, Walco, Vedco, Robison and Campbell neither admitted nor denied the Commission’s findings.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19746.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Burnham (Burnham), and the former Deputy CFO and Controller of Raytheon Aircraft Company (RAC), Aldo R. Servello (Servello). The SEC charged that, in periodic reports filed with the Commission from 1997 to 2001, Raytheon made false and misleading disclosures and used improper accounting practices that operated as a fraud by failing to adequately and accurately disclose the declining financial results and deteriorating business of Raytheons commercial aircraft manufacturing subsidiary, RAC. The SEC also charged that certain of these disclosures and accounting practices were undertaken with the knowledge of Burnham in 2000 and 2001 and Servello in 2000. Without admitting or denying the SECs findings, Raytheon, Burnham, and Servello agreed to settle these charges by consenting to the entry of a Cease-and-Desist Order by the Commission. , The SECs Order finds that, between 1997 and 1999, Raytheon improperly recognized revenue on RACs sale of unfinished aircraft through bill and hold sales transactions that did not comply with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. According to the SECs Order, these practices resulted in material overstatements of RACs reported annual net sales revenue and operating income in 1997 and 1998 and enabled both Raytheon and RAC to meet certain internal and external earnings targets. , The SECs Order also finds that, between 1997 and 2001, Raytheon engaged in improper disclosure and accounting practices related to RACs commuter aircraft business, including the failure to adequately disclose in the companys periodic reports material risks, trends, and uncertainties associated with the deterioration of that business line. According to the SECs Order, these practices resulted in the failure to recognize between $67 million and $240 million in losses that were inherent in a planned soft landing of the commuter aircraft line at year-end 2000, which would have reduced Raytheons 2000 profit before taxes by 8 to 27 percent. The SECs Order finds that these losses were instead improperly taken during the third quarter of 2001, when Raytheon recorded a $693 million charge related to its commuter assets after September 11, 2001. According to the SECs Order, given the charge that should have been taken at year-end 2000, Raytheons third quarter 2001 commuter loss provision was overstated by 10 to 53 percent. , The SECs Order finds that, between 1997 and 2001, Raytheon violated Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, and 13b2-1. The Order also finds that, with respect to fiscal years 2000 and 2001, Burnham violated Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act and caused Raytheons violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, and 13b2-1. Finally, the Order finds that, for fiscal year 2000, Servello caused Raytheons violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, and 13b2-1. Each respondent has agreed to cease and desist from committing or causing the violations charged as well as any future violations of these provisions. , Raytheon, Burnham, and Servello also consented to the entry of a final judgment in a related civil action filed today in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia for the purposes of awarding civil monetary penalties and disgorgement. As part of the settlement, Raytheon consented to pay a penalty of $12 million and $1 in disgorgement. Burnham and Servello agreed to pay disgorgement of certain past bonus amounts, pre-judgment interest, and penalties in the total amounts of $1,238,344 and $34,628, respectively. , The Commissions investigation as to other individuals involved in this matter is continuing. , <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2006/comp19747.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a><br/><img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/admin/2006/33-8715.pdf>Administrative Proceeding No. 33-8715</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19747.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Friedman of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia entered a final judgment against Wendy Feldman Purner, a former registered representative, based upon charges of fraud relating to her alleged misappropriation of $4,145,000 from her brokerage customers and investment adviser clients.  Purner consented, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, to the entry of the final judgment imposing a permanent injunction and ordering disgorgement of $4,145,000., The Commission filed a complaint on June 23, 2006, alleging that during the period from July 1998 through late 2001, Purner breached the trust of her brokerage customers and investment advisory clients and engaged in fraud when she misappropriated $4,145,000 from their accounts.  While associated with a registered broker-dealer and investment adviser and later at her own investment advisory firm, Purner received money from her customers and clients to invest and manage.  The Commission alleged in its complaint that Purner told her customers and clients that she would invest their money in various investment vehicles, including commercial paper, investment partnerships, and common stock.  The complaint alleged that Purner did not, however, invest her customers and clients money but rather misappropriated it or used it to conceal her withdrawals from the accounts of other customers and clients. According to the complaint, Purner concealed her fraud at the registered broker-dealer and investment adviser by creating and mailing, to her customers, false account statements that described non-existent investments and contained inflated account balances.  The complaint further alleged that while at her own investment advisory firm, Purner hid her fraud from her clients by making materially false oral representations to her clients regarding the nature and value of their investments., In September 2004, Purner pled guilty to three counts of wire fraud in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California for the same conduct alleged in the complaint and agreed to pay restitution totaling $4,145,000 to her defrauded customers and clients.  Purner is scheduled to be sentenced on November 27, 2006, and faces a period of incarceration of up to fifteen years., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, Purner consented to the entry of the final judgment which permanently enjoins her from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  In addition to the injunctive relief, Purner agreed to  pay $4,145,000 in disgorgement which will be deemed satisfied by the anticipated order of restitution in the criminal proceeding.  In the event that no order of restitution is entered in the criminal proceeding, the final judgment requires Purner to pay the entire amount of disgorgement of $4,145,000 to the Commission following the final disposition of the criminal proceeding., On June 29, 2006, based on the entry of the Courts injunction, the Commission also instituted settled administrative proceedings against Purner.

On June 27, the court entered a temporary restraining order suspending the offering and an order freezing the defendants assets.  The court also ordered the defendants to preserve documents and submit to expedited discovery.  The court set a hearing for July 7, 2006 to consider the Commissions application for preliminary injunctive relief, appointment of a receiver and the entry of orders requiring defendants to repatriate investor funds and provide an accounting., The defendants named in the Commissions Complaint are:, The Commissions Complaint alleges that Weston and IEI, directly and through sales agents, have raised at least $7.7 million from sales of the joint venture interests to over 50 investors in 16 states since June 2004.  The Commission asserts that Weston and IEI entice investors through numerous material misrepresentations and omissions, such as: that investor funds will be used only to purchase the German bonds; that IEI will buy one bond per $1,000 invested; that the bonds will be placed in a trust, interests in which will be securitized, insured, rated AAA by Standard &amp; Poors, and sold to institutional investors; and that the proceeds of the sale of these securitized interests will provide investors 100% or greater annual returns for up to thirty years., According to the Complaint, Weston and IEI have done none of these things.  Instead, the Commission contends that Weston largely has used investor money to enrich himself or for purposes unrelated to the offering.  The Complaint details, for instance, that Weston borrowed $2 million of investor proceeds to purchase and furnish a luxurious home and to fund his familys living expenses, and that he wired an additional $454,000 of investor funds to Swiss banks.  The Complaint further alleges that Weston used $100,000 of investor proceeds to pay legal expenses unrelated to the offering, sent another $415,000 to one investor as Ponzi payments, and paid undisclosed commissions of $550,000 to two sales agents.  The Commission believes that $1.6 million of the offering proceeds remain in bank accounts Weston controls and $300,000 remains in law firm accounts as retainers.  The balance is unaccounted for., Weston and IEI are charged with securities fraud under both the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  In addition to the temporary restraining order and asset freeze already granted, the Commissions Complaint seeks injunctive relief, appointment of a receiver, a repatriation order, an accounting and orders prohibiting the destruction of documents and expediting discovery.

In the civil action, the SEC names as defendants Marvin Winick, a Canadian accountant who regularly holds himself out as a consultant to U.S. public companies, Tekron, a corporation based in Ontario, Canada, and Luigi Brun, Tekrons Chief Executive Officer. Winick has agreed to settle the civil action. In the settled cease-and-desist proceedings, the SEC names as respondents Greentech USA, Information Architects, Michael Clark, former president of Information Architects, William Overhulser, former director and Chief Operations Officer of Information Architects, and Roland Breton, Greentechs president. , The Commissions complaint names Winick, Tekron and Brun and alleges that Winick provided consulting services to Tekron, Greentech, and Information Architects, with responsibility for, among other things, properly preparing and filing the issuers Commission filings. Instead, Winick created Audit Reports and Consents, which he incorporated into the issuers 2003 Forms 10-KSB without the accounting firms authorization and when, in fact, neither the accounting firm nor any other auditor had audited the issuers 2003 financial statements. According to the complaint, Winick subsequently filed Forms 10-QSB on behalf of each issuer that falsely referred to the issuers previously filed financial statements as audited. Finally, the complaint alleges that on February 28, 2005, after proceedings had been instituted to determine whether it was appropriate to suspend or revoke the registration of Tekrons securities based on its false Commission filings, Tekron filed an additional Form 10-QSB falsely referring to the prior annual period as having been audited. Brun signed and certified all of Tekrons false filings. , In settling the civil action, Winick consents, without admitting or denying the non-jurisdictional allegations in the complaint, to a judgment enjoining him from violating, directly or indirectly, the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act and Exchange Act and from aiding and abetting violations of the Exchange Acts reporting, books and records, and internal control provisions. Winick further consents to an officer and director bar, and agrees to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, disgorgement of $30,945 of ill-gotten gains, plus prejudgment interest, and to surrender 50,000 Information Architects shares he received for his consulting work. In separate administrative proceedings, Winick also consents to the issuance of an order under Rule 102(e) of the Commissions Rules of Practice, based on the entry of the injunction, suspending him from appearing or practicing before the Commission. Winick further consents, on behalf of three shell companies under his control (Gizmo Company, Smart World United, Inc., and Urban Entertainment Concepts International, Inc.), to an order issued pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Exchange Act, revoking the Commission registration of the companies securities. With respect to the other defendants in the civil action, Tekron and Brun, the Commission seeks against Brun injunctive relief, the payment of a civil penalty, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, and an officer and director bar, and against Tekron injunctive relief and disgorgement of ill-gotten gains. , In settling the cease-and-desist proceedings, Greentech and Information Architects have agreed, without admitting or denying the Commissions non-jurisdictional findings, to an order requiring them to cease and desist from violating certain of the non-scienter antifraud, reporting, books and records and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws.

The complaint charges another Efoora employee, Melvin S. Dokich, with participating in the unregistered offering and seeks an order requiring two of Groskys relatives to return money that they received from Partners Holding. , The complaint alleged the following: From at least January 2000 through at least April 2006, Efoora raised approximately $40 million by selling over 100 million shares of its stock to about 5,000 investors. Its offering was not registered with the Commission as required by the federal securities laws. Efoora, through a network of finders that included Partners Holding, also solicited investors by making a series of false or misleading statements about Efooras business, including, among other things, the amount of offering proceeds it paid to its finders and that it would be receiving FDA approval for its HIV Rapid Test and conducting an IPO by certain dates. Partners Holding was not registered as a broker or dealer at the time its salespersons sold shares of Efoora stock. Grosky drafted or approved Efooras false or misleading offering materials and controls Partners Holding. Grosky and Dokich also improperly sold Efoora stock issued in their names directly to the general public. Grosky received approximately $1 million from Efoora, Partners Holding and investors. , Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, Efoora, Partners Holding, Grosky and Dokich consented to the entry of orders preliminarily enjoining them from violating the registration provisions of the securities laws, Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), enjoining Partners Holding from violating the antifraud and broker dealer registration provisions of the securities laws, Sections 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and enjoining Grosky from aiding and abetting Partners Holdings broker dealer registration violations. The orders also provide for, among other things, a freeze on the assets of Partners Holding and Grosky, a freeze on Efooras intellectual property assets, and a freeze on certain assets of Groskys relatives. , Grosky and Dokich were indicted on May 17 in a parallel criminal proceeding.

Subsidiaries</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia charging four former employees of  subsidiaries of ABB Ltd., with violating the anti-bribery provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (FCPA).  ABB is a global provider of power and automation technologies headquartered in Zurich, Switzerland, and its American Depository Receipts are registered with the Commission and trade on the New York Stock Exchange.  All four defendants agreed to settle the charges against them, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint., The Commissions complaint alleges that the four former employees -- John Samson, a former regional sales manager for West Africa, John G. A. Munro, a former senior vice president of operations, Ian N. Campbell, a former vice president of finance, and John H. Whelan, a former vice president of sales -- participated in a scheme by offering, approving, and/or paying bribes to Nigerian government officials in furtherance of ABBs bid to obtain a $180 million contract to provide equipment for an oil drilling project in Nigerias offshore Bonga Oil Field.  According to the complaint, as a result of the defendants actions, during the period 1999 through 2001, ABB paid approximately $1 million in bribes to officials of National Petroleum Investment Management Services (NAPIMS), the Nigerian state-owned agency responsible for overseeing oil exploration and production in Nigeria.  The Commission alleges that these illicit payments -- which took the form of both cash and gifts --  were intended to induce and reward NAPIMS officials for providing ABB with confidential competitor bid information, and securing favorable consideration of ABBs bid on the Bonga contract, which ultimately was awarded to ABB in early 2001., The Commission alleges that during the tender process for the Bonga contract in 2000, Samson, the regional sales manager for West Africa, negotiated to pay six NAPIMS officials a total of $800,000 in bribes.  The Commission further alleges that Samson subsequently informed Munro and Campbell of the payments promised to the NAPIMS officials.  According to the complaint, at the direction of a senior officer (now deceased) of ABBs Vetco Gray U.S. subsidiary, Munro instructed Campbell and Samson to arrange payment to the NAPIMS officials using a local consultant as a conduit.  The complaint alleges that Campbell arranged to funnel $800,000 in bribes to the consultant under the cover of false invoices for consulting work.  The complaint also alleges that Samson personally profited from this bribery scheme by obtaining $50,000 in kickbacks from one the NAPIMS officials who received illicit payments., In addition, the complaint alleges that between 1999 and 2001, Samson arranged for Whelan to provide cash and other gifts -- including lodging and meals -- to NAPIMS officials when they visited the United States.  According to the complaint, these payments totaled more than $176,000., The Commissions complaint alleges that Samson, Munro, Campbell and Whelan each violated the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA, codified as Section 30A of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and the books and records and internal accounting control provisions of Exchange Act Section 13(b)(5) and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder.  The complaint further alleges that each defendant aided and abetted ABBs books and records and internal accounting control violations of Exchange Act Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B).  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Samson, Munro, Campbell and Whelan consented to the entry of final judgments that (1) permanently enjoin each of them from future violations of these provisions, (2) order each to pay a civil monetary penalty ($50,000 as to Samson, and $40,000 each as to Munro, Campbell and Whelan), and (3) orders Samson to pay $64,675 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest., The Commission previously filed a settled enforcement action against ABB in connection with these and other illicit payments.  See SEC v. ABB Ltd., Case No. 1:04CV1141 (D.D.C.)/Lit. Rel. 18775 (July 6, 2004).

Dick and Adams consented to the entry of the judgments without admitting or denying the allegations of the compliant filed against them. , In its complaint against Dick and Adams, the Commission alleged that from March 1999 through February 2000, Conseco and Conseco Finance made false and misleading statements about their earnings in filings made with the Commission and in public statements announcing their earnings, overstating their results by hundreds of millions of dollars. The complaint alleged that this massive overstatement occurred because Dick and Adams conducted a fraudulent scheme to avoid huge write downs, and corresponding charges to earnings, of certain assets held by Conseco Finance known as interest-only securities. The complaint alleged that Dick and Adams avoided these write downs through the use of improper accounting techniques in violation of United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.

DeBoe (DeBoe). The Commission alleged in its complaint, filed previously on March 3, 2005, that DeBoe, while employed as a registered representative at Deutsche Banc Alex Brown (Deutsche Banc, now Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.) engaged in fraudulent conduct in customer accounts and aided and abetted the fraudulent conduct in these same accounts by Peter N. Brant, a convicted felon and SEC recidivist. According to the complaint, DeBoe, a former colleague and social friend of Brant, knew of Brants conviction for felony securities fraud. The complaint alleges that DeBoe opened four new accounts at Deutsche Banc for customers referred to him by Brant. The complaint further alleges that each of the customers gave Brant trading authority and agreed to pay Brant fees for his investment advice. According to the complaint, Brants role as investment adviser and his acceptance of fees for these services violated his bar from the securities industry, which was known by DeBoe or he was reckless in not knowing. , Finally, the complaint alleges that once the accounts were opened, DeBoe gave free rein to Brant over the accounts, participated with Brant in churning the accounts, violated explicit instructions from customers, and allowed Brant to misappropriate funds from DeBoes customer accounts for Brants own use. This fraudulent conduct generated commissions for DeBoe, who before opening these accounts referred by Brant, had been a low producer who earned relatively low commission income. , Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, DeBoe consented to a final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

Malone, </i>Civil Action No. SA CV 06-661-JVS (C.D. California)</h2>]","[The Commission filed civil fraud charges today against Renaissance Asset Fund, Inc., Ronald J. Nadel, and Joseph M. Malone. The Commission’s complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, alleges that Renaissance and its principals raised over $16 million from more than 190 investors nationwide.  Many of the victims were elderly and were solicited through Jehovah’s Witnesses congregations., According to the complaint, from at least March 1999 through April 2004, the defendants raised funds for multiple purported projects, including a general fund, an outlet mall, an international currency exchange, and a Swiss bank.  Some of the purported projects did not exist, and others were unsuccessful.  The defendants misrepresented to investors that their investments would earn returns ranging from 10% to 25% in as little as four months.  The defendants also sent quarterly account statements to investors setting forth the fictitious profits their investments had purportedly earned.  Based on the representations in these account statements, many investors reinvested their principal and purported profits in other Renaissance projects.  The defendants operated Renaissance’s programs as a Ponzi scheme, paying earlier investors with funds raised from later investors.  Nadel also used investor funds to pay for lavish expenses, including country club memberships, car leases, and retail purchases.  The majority of investors in Renaissance never received the interest or return of their principal the defendants had promised., Based on this conduct, the complaint alleges that Defendants Renaissance, Nadel and Malone violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint also alleges that Nadel and Malone violated Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act.  The complaint seeks final judgments permanently enjoining the defendants from violating or aiding and abetting violations of the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws.  The Commission also seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, an accounting, and civil penalties.  , In related SEC proceedings, Senior Resources Asset Fund LLC and Kenneth Baum have consented to the issuance of cease-and-desist orders for their role in selling Renaissance investments.  The Commission ordered both Senior Resources and Baum to cease and desist from selling unregistered securities, and ordered Baum to cease and desist from acting as an unregistered broker-dealer.  Senior Resources and Baum consented to the issuance of the order without admitting or denying its findings.

Kahl, Jr., Rosa Maria Gertrude Stephan, Alfred Stephan, and Kristina Stephan based on insider trading in the stock of Worthington Foods, Inc. (Worthington). , In its Complaint, the Commission alleges that during August and September 1999, Roger Blackwell, who was a member of the board of directors of Worthington from 1993 to 1999, disclosed material, non-public information regarding Kellogg Companys (Kellogg) proposed acquisition of Worthington to Defendants John J. Kahl Jr., Gertrude Stephan, Alfred Stephan, and Kristina Stephan. The Commission further alleges that Kahl, Gertrude Stephan, and Alfred Stephan purchased Worthington common stock while in possession of, and/or using, material, nonpublic information regarding Kelloggs proposed acquisition of Worthington. According to the Commission, based on Blackwells tip, Kahl made profits of $168,315.90 from his trading in Worthington securities; Gertrude and Alfred Stephan made profits of $19,212.60 from their trading in Worthington securities. The Commission also alleges that Kristina Stephan facilitated the tipping of her parents, Gertrude and Alfred Stephan, by passing to them information about Kelloggs proposed acquisition of Worthington, which she received from Roger Blackwell. The Commission charges these defendants with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. , All four defendants have settled this action without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint. Defendant Kahl consented to a permanent injunction from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, disgorgement of all insider trading profits of $168,315.90, prejudgment interest of $58,681.21, and a civil penalty of $84,157.95.

Reyes, the former CEO, President, and Chairman of Brocade Communications Systems, Inc., and Stephanie Jensen, its former Vice President of Human Resources, alleging that the two routinely backdated stock option grants to give employees favorably priced options without recording necessary compensation expenses.  The action, which is among the first cases involving manipulation of stock option grants in violation of the federal securities laws, is the result of an 18-month investigation by the Commission., According to the Commission’s complaint, Reyes, 43, of Saratoga, Calif., and Jensen, 48, of Los Altos, Calif., regularly caused Brocade to grant “in-the-money” options (i.e., the exercise price is below the stock’s market price on the day of grant, giving the recipient an immediate paper gain) to both new and current employees between 2000 and 2004, but backdated documents to make it appear that the options were “at-the-money” (i.e., the exercise price is the same as the stock’s market price on the day of the grant) when granted, thus concealing millions of dollars in expenses from investors.  Under well-settled accounting principles applicable at the time, options granted “at-the-money” did not need to be expensed.  In contrast, options granted “in-the-money” needed to be recorded as a compensation expense.  , The complaint alleges that Reyes repeatedly used hindsight to select a date with a lower stock price from the recent past as the supposed option grant date.  To facilitate the scheme, Jensen created, or directed others to create, paperwork making it appear that the options had been granted on the earlier date.  In some instances, employment offer letters and compensation committee minutes were falsified and purported to document option grants to employees before they had even been hired by the company.  As a result of this practice, Brocade was able to give employees “in-the-money” stock options without having to recognize compensation expenses as required by accounting rules.  When these stock option abuses surfaced, Brocade was required to restate and revise its financial statements for fiscal years 1999 through 2004.  In January 2005, Brocade announced the following restatements (fiscal years):, The complaint also names Antonio Canova, Brocade’s former CFO, who is alleged to have learned of the backdating after joining Brocade.  According to the complaint, Canova was specifically warned in writing that option paperwork had been forged to enable an employee to get favorably priced options; he took no action and failed to advise Brocade’s auditors and Audit Committee.  The complaint alleges that despite this knowledge, Canova signed Brocade’s false and misleading financial statements and SEC filings.  , The Commission’s complaint, filed in federal court in San Francisco, Calif., charges Reyes, Canova, and Jensen with fraud and other violations of the federal securities laws, including the books-and-records, internal controls, misrepresentations to auditors, and Sarbanes-Oxley certification provisions., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/2006/comp19768.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19768.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Yi represented that C+ Capital would establish brokerage accounts in the clients names at Carlin Equities Corp., a registered broker-dealer, and promised to use his expertise to buy and sell stocks in the clients accounts. However, Yi did not open brokerage accounts for advisory clients, but instead deposited the clients checks into a bank account held in his name. Yi subsequently provided C+ Capitals clients fabricated with account statements, purporting to reflect their portfolio positions in accounts at Carlin. Yi attempted to forestall discovery of the fraud by offering various excuses to clients to prevent them from liquidating their holdings. , For additional information, see Litigation Release Nos. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18729.htm>18729</a> (May 28, 2004) and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18747.htm>18747</a> (June 16, 2004). ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19769.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

In January 1994, the Commissions civil action was stayed upon the request of the office of the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. , The Final Judgment permanently enjoins McCallion from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The Final Judgment orders McCallion to pay disgorgement together with prejudgment interest in the amount of $7,631. The Commission did not seek a civil penalty because the alleged wrongdoing preceded the effective date of the Securities Enforcement Remedies and Penny Stock Reform Act of 1990. (Pub. L. No. 101-429, 104 Stat. 931 (1990)). , The Commission also announced today that it issued an Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions barring McCallion from association with any broker or dealer. This order is based on the permanent injunction contained in the Final Judgment. , The civil action continues with respect to additional defendants. , <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/admin/2006/34-54196.pdf>Administrative Proceeding No. 34-54196</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19771.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

At the time, Endocare developed and distributed medical devices for use in the treatment of various types of cancers and urological ailments. , To settle the Commissions charges, which were filed in United States District Court for the Central District of California, Endocare agreed to pay a $750,000 civil penalty and to be permanently enjoined from the antifraud, reporting, recordkeeping, and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws. Endocare agreed to settle the Commissions action without admitting or denying the allegations. , The Commission also announced that Endocares senior vice president of sales, Kevin Quilty (Quilty), age 52, of Washington Crossing, Pennsylvania, and the former president of an Endocare subsidiary, Jerry W. Anderson (Anderson), age 59, of Gunter, Texas, agreed to settle Commission charges for recordkeeping and internal controls violations and (in the case of Quilty) for aiding and abetting Endocares reporting violations. Quilty agreed to a permanent injunction and to pay $23,749 in disgorgement and interest, and a $25,000 penalty. Anderson agreed to a permanent injunction and to pay a $35,000 penalty. In a separate administrative proceeding instituted by the Commission on July 19, Endocares former director of sales for the Southeast region, L. Michael Hart, age 58, of Fort Pierce, Florida, agreed to cease and desist from causing Endocares reporting and recordkeeping violations. All agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying the allegations and findings. The settlements are subject to approval by the court. , According to the Commissions complaint, Endocare engaged in improper revenue recognition practices, ranging from false sales to undisclosed side agreements, and improperly understated or deferred expenses to inflate earnings. As alleged in the complaint, Endocare reported a consistent history of record revenue growth quarter over quarter, reporting $2.8 million for the first quarter of 2001 to $11.4 million for the second quarter of 2002. The complaint alleges that, as a result of its fraudulent accounting, Endocare overstated revenue by at least 33% for the second quarter of 2002. The complaint further alleges that Endocare understated its pre-tax loss for 2001 by 20% and falsely reported pre-tax earnings for the first two quarters of 2002, rather than its actual substantial losses. , The complaint further alleges that Quilty and Anderson assisted in Endocares improper revenue practices. The complaint alleges that Quilty entered into numerous undisclosed side agreements containing contingent terms and parked product shipped to Endocare-controlled warehouses. The complaint also alleges that Anderson created fictitious customers used to purchase $1.2 million in product in September 2002. , Also according to the complaint, Endocare committed additional securities law violations in the course of investigating allegations of improper accounting raised by its acting controller. In late October 2002, after receiving the controllers allegations, Endocares audit committee retained a law firm to perform an investigation. Endocares auditors at the time, KPMG, suggested that the audit committee hire independent counsel and an independent forensic accountant to conduct the investigation. In November 2002, after reviewing the work of a forensic accountant that the audit committee had retained, KPMG informed the audit committee that it was not prepared to complete its quarterly review until an expanded internal investigation had been performed. In December 2002, KPMG informed the audit committee that it had concluded that it could no longer rely on the representations of Endocares management, and that it was withdrawing its report on Endocares financial statements for the last fiscal year. Following these events, however, in March 2003 Endocare issued a press release in which it announced that, after an independent review and investigation, the audit committee and its advisors had concluded that there was no indication of fraud or intentional wrongdoing by management. The complaint alleges that this press release was false and misleading because, first, Endocare in fact had not conducted an independent investigation, and second, its internal review had in fact revealed substantial evidence of fraud or intentional wrongdoing. , In its complaint, the Commission charged Endocare with violating the antifraud provisions, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act); the reporting provisions, Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder; recordkeeping provision, Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act; and internal controls provision, Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act. The Commission further charged Quilty and Anderson with aiding and abetting and violating the recordkeeping provisions, Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder, and additionally as to Quilty, aiding and abetting Endocares violations of reporting provisions, Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder. , The settled administrative proceeding against Hart finds that he executed side agreements containing contingent terms, in violation of above-described reporting and recordkeeping provisions of the federal securities laws. , The Commissions investigation is continuing. , <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2006/comp19772.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19772.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Hershey (Hershey), formerly of Kennett Square, PA; and Robert D. Lear (Lear), who resides in Warrington, PA and is the former Chief Financial Officer of Tremont Medical, Inc. (Tremont Medical), a medical technology company, located in Aston, PA.  The remaining defendant, Tremont Medical, is no longer doing business and, by all indications, is defunct; therefore, the Commission has dismissed the civil action as to this defendant., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Landis, Hershey, and Lear have consented to the entry of Final Judgment against them permanently enjoining each from further violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933; Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; Sections 204, 206(1), and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and Rules 204-2(a)(3) and (7) thereunder.

The Final Judgments against Landis, Hershey and Lear, as well as the dismissal of Tremont Medical, were entered on July 19, 2006., The Securities and Exchange Commission also announced the issuance of an Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Section 203(f) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions against Hershey, based on the entry of the permanent injunction.  Hershey has consented to the sanctions imposed without admitting or denying the findings contained therein, except those findings specifically identified in the Order.  The Commissions Order bars Hershey from association with any investment adviser.  Landis, formerly a registered investment adviser, during the pendency of the court proceedings and settlement negotiations, had voluntarily withdrawn its investment adviser registration., The Commissions complaint, filed June 22, 2004, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, alleged that Hershey, individually and through Landis Associates, misused client funds and breached his fiduciary duty to a wealthy client (the Defrauded Client) by investing in Tremont Medical, a privately held start up company, of which Hershey was a director and shareholder.  Hershey continued to make these investments long after it was clear that the Defrauded Clients account was Tremonts only source of capital and that these investments were worthless., The complaint charged that Hershey, acting through Landis, and with the assistance and participation of Lear, concealed the true nature of these transactions.  The resulting decline in value of the Defrauded Clients account, the complaint alleged, was further concealed when Hershey, through Landis, sent the Defrauded Client false monthly advisory statements.  As a result, the Commission alleged, the Defrauded Clients managed account was overvalued by more than $30 million.  The complaint alleged that, by the time that the Defrauded Clients account with Landis and Hershey was closed in June 2001, the account had lost nearly 70% of its value and the Defrauded Client had lost all of the money that Hershey invested in Tremont., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/admin/2006/ia-2538.pdf>Administrative Proceeding No. IA-2538</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19774.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Sonja Anticevic, et. al.</i> The Complaint identifies six individuals who engaged in insider trading through an Austrian bank, Direktanlage.at AG (Direktanlage). The individuals were previously charged as Certain Unknown Persons Trading In Reebok International Ltd. Securities In Account 34401046 At Direktanlage.at AG. , According to the Complaint, the individuals who traded through Direktanlage were: (i) Bruno Verinac (Verinac); (ii) Antun Dilber (Dilber); (iii) Anto Krsic (Krsic); (iv) Perica Lopandic (Lopandic); (v) Ilija Borac (Borac); and (vi) Zoran Sormaz (Sormaz) (collectively, the Direktanlage Traders). Verinac, age 37, a Croatian national, residing in Germany, Dilber, age 67, a Croatian national, residing in Croatia, and Krsic, age 62, a Croatian national, residing in Croatia, are named as defendants for the first time. Lopandic, Borac, and Sormaz were previously charged for their trading through other European accounts. , The complaint also identifies additional insider trading by the Direktanlage Traders based on newly-obtained information, bringing the total illicit gains netted by the insider trading ring to over $6.8 million. In total, the Direktanlage Traders netted over $445,000 of these illicit gains in trades placed in 17 different securities through Direktanlage based on material, non-public information stolen by a former investment banker employed at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., Inc. (Merrill Lynch) and two former employees at a printing plant where <i>BusinessWeek</i> magazine is printed. , This Complaint follows four prior complaints filed by the Commission that charged insider trading resulting in at least $6.7 million of illicit gains from three schemes orchestrated by defendants Eugune Plotkin (Plotkin) and David Pajcin (Pajcin). In the first scheme, Stanislav Shpigelman (Shpigelman), a mergers and acquisitions analyst at Merrill Lynch, provided Plotkin and Pajcin with information about pending mergers and acquisitions deals on which Merrill Lynch was working, prior to the time such information became public in exchange for a share of the profits made from trades based on this information. In the second scheme, Plotkin and Pajcin recruited two individuals, first Nickolaus Shuster, and later Juan C. Renteria, Jr., to obtain employment at a printing plant which prints <i>BusinessWeek</i> magazine for the sole purpose of stealing advance copies of the magazine before it was distributed to the public. Plotkin and Pajcin then traded on the basis of a market moving column in the magazine and tipped others to trade in exchange for a percentage of their trading profits. In the third scheme, Plotkin and Pajcin set up a scheme with Jason C. Smith (Smith) - who was serving on a federal grand jury in the District of New Jersey convened to investigate potential accounting fraud involving Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (Bristol Myers) - in which Smith leaked information about the grand jury proceedings to Pajcin and Plotkin in order to enable them to trade on this non-public information. In total, Plotkin and Pajcin traded in - or tipped others, including the Direktanlage Traders - in at least 27 stocks within one year based on inside information obtained through these schemes. , With todays filing, the Commission has now charged a total of 17 individual defendants, located in the United States and Europe, as participants in the insider trading ring. Descriptions of the other defendants are available in the Commissions litigation releases dated April 11, 2006, http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19650.htm, and May 11, 2006, http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19696.htm. , The Commission alleges that, as a result of trading in various securities on the basis of material, non-public information obtained pursuant to the grand jury and other schemes, the defendants engaged in illegal insider trading in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that defendants Smith, Pajcin, Plotkin, Sonja Anticevic, Henry Siegel, and Mikhail Plotkin also violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 by virtue of their insider trading in Bristol-Myers. In addition, the Commission alleges that defendants Plotkin, Pajcin, and Shpigelman violated Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14e-3 thereunder by trading in the stock of a company while in possession of material, non-public information related to a cash tender offer for such companys stock. Among other things, the Complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, the disgorgement of all illegal profits plus prejudgment interest, the imposition of civil monetary penalties, and orders requiring the defendants to repatriate to the United States proceeds of the fraud in accounts outside the United States. , The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Austrian Financial Market Authority in helping to identify the individual defendants. , For information about earlier developments in this matter, please see Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19696.htm>19696</a> (May 11, 2006), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19650.htm>19650</a> (April 11, 2006), No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr19340.htm>19340</a> (August 19, 2005) and No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr19327.htm>19327</a> (August 5, 2005). , <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2006/comp19775.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19775.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Abide, the former Director of Property Accounting for WorldCom, Inc., for his role in the WorldCom fraud and for illegally selling WorldCom stock in January and February 2002 based on information he possessed about the fraud and the companys true financial condition. Abide has agreed to settle the matter by consenting, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, to the entry of a final judgment enjoining him from violating the anti-fraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws, requiring him to pay $57,947 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest of $12,912 and an insider trading civil money penalty of $57,947. , Abide also has agreed to be suspended from practicing before the Commission as an accountant with the right to request his reinstatement after five years. , The Commissions action against Abide is its seventh civil action related to the WorldCom fraud. The complaint filed today alleges from the first quarter of 2001 through the first quarter of 2002, Abide made, and directed others to make, improper accounting entries into WorldComs depreciable asset accounts in order to conceal improperly capitalized expenses. In January and February 2002, while the fraud was being carried out by Abide and others, Abide sold 6,728 shares of WorldCom stock (99% of the WorldCom stock he owned), avoiding losses of nearly $58,000. , If the settlement is approved by the Court, Abide would be enjoined from future violations of the antifraud, reporting, books and records and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws-Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, and 13b2-1 thereunder. , The Commission also announced that it filed today Consents and proposed Final Judgments As to Monetary Relief in the Commissions civil actions in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against former WorldCom Chief Financial Officer Scott Sullivan and former WorldCom accountants Buford Yates, Jr., Betty Vinson and Troy Normand. , Sullivan consented to the entry of a final judgment holding him liable for $10 million in disgorgement, representing a retention bonus Sullivan received in 2000, and $3,591,889 in prejudgment interest. If approved by the Court, the proposed Final Judgment As to Monetary Relief, however, would waive payment of the disgorgement and prejudgment interest and would not impose a civil penalty based on Sullivans demonstrated inability to pay. In 2005, Sullivan settled the WorldCom Securities Class Action Litigation by, among other things, surrendering the proceeds from the sale of his Boca Raton, Florida home, and his WorldCom 401(k) account. In United States v. Scott D. Sullivan, 02 Cr 1144 (BSJ) (S.D.N.Y.), a parallel criminal action filed by the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Sullivan received a five year prison sentence, but was not ordered to pay restitution or a fine. , Previously, the Court issued judgments of permanent injunction against Sullivan, imposing the full injunctive relief sought by the Commission and prohibiting him from acting as an officer or director of any public company. (Litigation Release No. 18605.) Sullivan consented to the entry of the initial judgment as well, without admitting or denying any of the allegations of the Commissions complaint against him. In addition, in separate administrative proceedings, Sullivan agreed to be suspended from practicing before the Commission as an accountant. (In the Matter of Scott D. Sullivan, Rel. 33-8402, AAE Rel. 1977, File No. 3-11435.) , Yates consented to the entry of a final judgment holding him liable for $263,809 in disgorgement, representing a retention bonus and other payments Yates received in 2000, and $94,757 in prejudgment interest. If approved by the Court, the proposed Final Judgment As to Monetary Relief, however, would waive payment of the disgorgement and prejudgment interest and would not impose a civil penalty based on Yates demonstrated inability to pay. , The proposed Final Judgments As to Monetary Relief against Betty Vinson and Troy Normand, if approved by the Court, would not find Vinson or Normand liable for disgorgement since neither defendant received ill-gotten gains from their participation in the fraud. In addition, the proposed Final Judgments would not impose civil money penalties against Vinson or Normand based on their demonstrated inability to pay. , Previously, the Court issued judgments of permanent injunction against Yates, Vinson and Normand, imposing the full injunctive relief sought by the Commission and, with respect to Yates, prohibiting him from acting as an officer or director of any public company. (Litigation Release Nos. 17842 and 17883.) The three defendants consented to the entry of the initial judgments as well, without admitting or denying any of the allegations of the Commissions complaints against them.

Myers, former controller of WorldCom, Inc., in which the Court found Myers liable for approximately $1 million in disgorgement, representing bonuses Myers received during the pendency of the fraud. The Court, however, waived payment of the disgorgement due to Myerss demonstrated inability to pay, and did not impose a civil penalty. Myers consented to the entry of the judgment against him. , The Court issued a judgment of permanent injunction against Myers on November 14, 2002, imposing the full injunctive relief sought by the Commission and prohibiting Myers from acting as an officer or director of any public company. Myers consented to the entry of this initial judgment as well, without admitting or denying any of the allegations of the Commissions complaint. (Litigation Release No. 17842.) In addition, in a separate administrative proceeding filed in November 2002, Myers agreed to be suspended from practicing before the Commission as an accountant. (In the Matter of David F.

Behl, a friend and professional acquaintance of Pimplaskar, alleging that they engaged in insider trading in Pozen securities in violation of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, Pimplaskar and Behl have agreed to settle this matter by consenting to the entry of final judgments against them which impose injunctive and monetary relief. , The Commissions complaint alleges that on May 28, 2004, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) informed Pozen that it was denying the companys New Drug Application for approval of MT 100, a new migraine medication. The complaint further alleges that, upon hearing the news, Pimplaskar immediately sold his existing holdings of Pozen shares on the basis of this material, nonpublic information. The complaint also alleges that later that afternoon, Pimplaskar tipped his friend Behl. Behl, the complaint alleges, immediately proceeded to sell out his pre-existing long position in Pozen stock  and then started short-selling the stock  on the basis of this material, non-public information. , The complaint alleges that the per share price of Pozen shares fell 37% on June 1, 2004, after the company announced the FDAs decision. The complaint further alleges that Pimplaskar avoided losses of $1,392.00 by selling Pozen stock in advance of the public release of the news, and that Behl avoided losses of $35,088.08 on his long sales and realized illicit profits of $56,753.66 on his short sales, in advance of the public release of the news. , Based on the facts alleged, the Commission charged Pimplaskar and Behl with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. , Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, both defendants have agreed to settle the Commissions charges by consenting to the entry of final judgments that, if approved, would permanently enjoin both of them from further violations of the federal securities laws. In addition, the final judgment against Pimplaskar would require him to pay $1,552.69 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $33,447.31. The amount of Pimplaskars civil penalty is based, in part, on his sworn representations in his Statement of Financial Condition.

One or More Unknown Purchasers of Call Options for the Common Stock of Petco Animal Supplies, Inc.</i>, Case No. 06CV1446 DMS (LSP) (S.D. Cal.)</h2>, <h2>SEC Obtains Emergency Asset Freeze Against Purchasers of Call Options for Petco Stock Prior to Acquisition Announcement</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) announced today that on July 18, 2006, the United States District Court for the Southern District of California entered a temporary restraining order freezing assets of certain as-yet unknown purchasers of call options for the common stock of Petco Animal Supplies, Inc., and prohibiting the unknown purchasers from obtaining the options or the proceeds from the sale of the options. Petco, based in San Diego, Calif., operates over 800 retail stores around the country that sell pet food, supplies, and services. , The Commissions complaint, filed in federal court in San Diego, alleges that the unknown purchasers engaged in illegal insider trading in Petco call options shortly before the public announcement that Petco would be acquired by two private equity firms for $1.8 billion. In addition to freezing approximately $862,000 in assets, the court issued orders that provide for expedited discovery and prohibit the defendants from destroying evidence. , On Friday, July 14, 2006, before the opening of the market, Petco announced that it had entered into an agreement to be acquired by a company owned by two private equity funds. Under the acquisition agreement, the buyer agreed to pay shareholders $29 per share in cash. The $29 per share price represents a 49% premium above the $19.45 price at which Petco stock closed the previous day. The total value of the transaction, including assumed debt, is approximately $1.8 billion. , In its complaint, the Commission alleges that in late June and early July 2006, while in possession of material, nonpublic information about this acquisition agreement, one or more unknown purchasers, using financial institutions in Switzerland and England, purchased over 1,400 call option contracts for Petco stock. The options generally were out of the money, representing a bet that the price of Petco stock would rise substantially, and were set to expire within weeks of the purchase date, representing a bet that the price rise would happen soon. The complaint further alleges that the unknown purchasers illicit profit from these call options after Petcos July 14, 2006 announcement was a total of approximately $862,000 -- $482,325 for the purchaser buying through the Swiss account and $379,640 for the purchaser buying through the English account. , The Commission alleges that the purchasers in this case engaged in insider trading in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The Commission is seeking permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest thereon, and the imposition of civil penalties. , The Commission wishes to thank the Chicago Board Options Exchange for its assistance in this matter. ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19778.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The messages, which were left on telephone voicemail recording machines throughout the country, were designed to make each recipient believe the caller had dialed the number by mistake. Many of the messages were left by a woman calling herself Debbie who sounded as if she had misdialed when calling a friend to pass along a hot stock tip. , The SEC filed its complaint in the District of Columbia, charging that Mills, Mills company, Direct Results of Sweetwater, LLC, and the then husband-and-wife team of Roderic and Anna Boling were behind the broadcasting of hundreds of thousands of wrong number touts of at least six microcap stocks. The complaint alleges that Anna Boling recorded many of the messages over the phone from her Altamonte Springs home while her then husband, Roderic Boling, directed an Augusta, Georgia-based telemarketer to broadcast the messages. The complaint further alleges that Jeffrey Mills, who profited from trading in at least two of the touted stocks, paid Roderic Boling with a blue duffel bag of cash during a trip to a Gulfport, Mississippi casino. During that same trip, Roderic Boling paid the telemarketer with cash taken from that duffel bag. , In its action, the Commission seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of illegal profits with prejudgment interest, and civil monetary penalties based on each of the defendants alleged violations of antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Anna Bolings alleged aiding and abetting of those violations. , The SECs action was brought contemporaneously with a related action by the U. S. Attorneys Office for the District of Columbia in which Roderic Boling, Anna Boling, and Jeffrey Mills are charged with conspiracy, securities fraud, and seven counts of wire fraud. , The Commission first cautioned the public about these and similar messages touting microcap stocks, in an August 2004 Investor Alert, after which the Augusta telemarketer stopped broadcasting the messages.

In addition, the Court ordered Johnson to disgorge approximately $2.2 million in illicit gains and prejudgment interest and pay $125,000 in civil penalties.  In determining that a five-year injunction against violation of the securities laws was necessary and appropriate, the Court noted the repeated nature of Johnsons violations that involved three different companies over a span of several years. The Court also took into account that Mr. Johnsons current occupation as a hedge fund manager made it likely that future violations may occur., The judgment against Johnson followed a jury trial in November 2005 where the jury found Johnson liable on four counts of securities fraud for issuing false and misleading research reports about three companies that he covered.   In its complaint, the Commission had charged Johnson with failing to disclose in his research reports and statements to the media praising two impending mergers that he stood to realize substantial financial gains from the successful consummation of those mergers.

In its complaint, the Commission alleges that the defendants conducted a scheme to achieve earnings estimates by materially overstating Daisyteks earnings from 2000 through the first half of 2002.  The defendants are James R. Powell (Daisyteks former CEO and president), Ralph Mitchell (Daisyteks former CFO), Mark J. Corjay (Daisyteks former controller), E.

The scheme involved improperly recording as revenue various rebates associated with inventory ordered for the sole purpose of meeting Daisyteks earnings targets, and recording fraudulent receivables.  In the process, Daisytek failed to comply with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles., In its civil action, the Commission alleges that Mitchell and Scannell violated the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, aided and abetted violations of the Exchange Acts reporting, record keeping and internal controls provisions, and circumvented accounting controls. In addition, the Commission alleges that Mitchell lied to Daisyteks auditors, and signed false Sarbanes-Oxley certifications.  In its action, the Commission seeks from Mitchell and Scannell permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, officer and director bars, and civil penalties.  Specifically, the Commission alleges that Mitchell and Scannell violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 10b-5, and 13b2-1 thereunder, and aided and abetted violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder.

On July 25, 2006, the Honorable Berle M. Schiller, United States District Court Judge, signed a Final Judgment permanently enjoining Mersky from, among other things, violations of antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws (Final Judgment). <i>Securities and Exchange Commission v. Mersky, et al.</i>, Civil Action No. 93-5200 (E.D. Pa.). Mersky consented to the Final Judgment without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions complaint, except as to jurisdiction. , In the civil injunctive action filed by the Commission in 1993, the Commission alleges that Mersky was an officer and a principal of Amglo Industries (Amglo) and its subsidiary, Amglobal Corporation (Amglobal), and that he controlled brokerage accounts that actively traded in the securities of both companies. The complaint further alleges that, from 1988 through 1989, Mersky and others participated in a scheme to sell worthless securities of Amglo and Amglobal. According to the complaint, the price of these securities was artificially inflated through manipulative and fraudulent activities of Mersky and others. Among other things, the complaint alleges that Mersky caused Amglo to engage in a series of stock-for-stock exchanges wherein it acquired various shell companies as subsidiaries. Mersky and others falsely portrayed the shell companies as having legitimate business activities and substantial assets, creating the appearance that Amglo was a profitable, growing enterprise when it was not. The complaint alleges that the scheme to defraud collapsed in the summer of 1989, after Mersky and others distributed approximately $3.4 million of worthless securities to unwitting investors through the over-the-counter market. In January 1994, the Commissions civil action was stayed upon the request of the office of the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. , The Final Judgment, permanently enjoins Mersky from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Section 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 101 and 102 of Regulation M of the Exchange Act. He also is barred from participating in the offering of any penny stock. The Final Judgment orders Mersky to pay disgorgement together with prejudgment interest in the amount of $543,689. The Commission did not seek a civil penalty because the alleged wrongdoing preceded the effective date of the Securities Enforcement Remedies and Penny Stock Reform Act of 1990. (Pub. L. No. 101-429, 104 Stat. 931 (1990)) , The Commission also announced today that it issued an Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions barring Mersky from association with any broker or dealer.

The judgments, which were issued by the Honorable Jed S. Rakoff of the Southern District of New York and entered on July 31, 2006, prohibit Saad and Adelson from acting as officers or directors of a public company and impose permanent injunctive relief for violations of antifraud, proxy solicitation, corporate reporting, books and records and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws. Specifically, Saad and Adelson are permanently enjoined from violating, or engaging in conduct that would make them liable for violations of, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2), 13(b)(5) and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, 13b2-1, 14a-3 and 14a-9.

Both Saad and Adelson consented to the entry of the final judgments without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, which was filed on March 29, 2005. , The complaint named Saad, Adelson and five other former Impath executives as defendants: David Cammarata (Cammarata), the Chief Financial Officer, Peter J. Torres (Torres), the Vice President for Corporate Finance, Robert McKie (McKie), a divisional Vice President, Karin Gardner (Gardner), the Controller, and Kenneth Jugan (Jugan), the National Billing Director. The complaint alleges that the defendants engaged in fraudulent accounting practices to make it appear that Impath, formerly a public company that provided laboratory services used in the treatment of cancer, had made multimillion dollar profits when it had actually suffered large losses. Impath filed for bankruptcy in September 2003 and is being liquidated. The complaint further alleges that Saad, Adelson and Cammarata engaged in multiple forms of undisclosed self-dealing, including the use of corporate funds to pay for stock option exercises without obtaining board approval or making the required proxy statement disclosures. The ill-gotten gains that Saad is required to disgorge under the terms of the settlement include $352,000 in stock option exercise costs that she paid with corporate funds, as well as $990,537 in proceeds from her sales of Impath stock and a $220,000 severance payment. , In the parallel criminal case, Adelson was tried before a jury, and on February 16, 2006, he was convicted on multiple counts of conspiracy, securities fraud, and filing false reports with the Commission. On May 30, 2006, Adelson was sentenced to 42 months in prison and was also ordered to forfeit $1.2 million and to pay, on a joint and several basis, restitution of $50 million. Saad had previously pled guilty to two felony counts of solicitation of proxies with false proxy statements, and one count of failure to implement an adequate system of internal accounting controls. Saad was sentenced to three months in prison, followed by two years of supervised release, and ordered to pay a $6,900 fine. Cammarata, Torres, Gardner, and Jugan previously pled guilty to conspiracy to commit securities fraud and related counts, and in June 2006, they were each sentenced to pay, jointly and severally, restitution of $50 million. Cammarata was also sentenced to one month in prison. , Cammarata, Torres, Gardner, and Jugan previously consented to the entry of judgments in the civil case that permanently enjoin them from committing the federal securities law violations alleged in the Commissions complaint and, in the case of Cammarata and Torres, bar them from acting as officers or directors of a public company. In addition, Cammarata consented to the entry of an administrative order pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the Commissions Rules of Practice suspending him from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant. On July 28, 2006, the Commission withdrew its requests for disgorgement and civil penalties against Cammarata, Torres, Gardner, and Jugan in view of the sentences imposed on them in the criminal case. , McKie had consented to the entry of a final judgment imposing permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest and a civil penalty simultaneous with the filing of the Commissions complaint.

Vistas common stock previously traded on the NASDAQ SmallCap Market until it became listed on the NASDAQ National Market on February 13, 1996.

As a result, Johns has now been ordered to pay a total of $771,787. , Previously, on October 30, 2002, Judge Cooper issued an Order of Permanent Injunction prohibiting Johns from violating the antifraud provisions, books and records provisions, internal accounting control provisions and reporting provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 (Section 17(a)) and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), 13(b)(5) and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13-11, 13a-13 and 13b2-1 thereunder). Johns agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying the allegations in the amended complaint. , The Commissions amended complaint alleged a wide-range of securities law violations committed by Johns during 1995 and 1996. The allegations included Johns: (1) failure to conform with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) resulting in the overstatement in various filings made with the Commission of Vistas revenues, income, earnings per share, and assets during 1995 and 1996 (the misstated amounts ranged up to 83,592% and in most periods, resulted in Vista reporting income when it was, in fact, experiencing losses), (2) failure to disclose the misappropriation of $481,000 in 1996 by Vistas chairman of the board, and (3) engaging in illegal insider selling of Vista common stock during 1996. , The Commission alleged that the misstatements contained in Vistas financial statements during Johns tenure were material and caused numerous reports on Forms 10-QSB and 8-K to be false and misleading. , See also: L.R. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17044.htm>17044</a> / June 21, 2001; L.R. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17175.htm>17175</a> / October 5, 2001; L.R. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17211.htm>17211</a> / October 30, 2001; L.R. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17824.htm>17824</a> / November 1, 2002; L.R. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17566.htm>17566</a> / June 17, 2002; L.R. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18612.htm>18612</a> / March 8, 2004; L.R. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18607.htm>18607</a> / March 3, 2004. ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19784.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Koeltl, the SEC had charged that Zwick participated in a fraudulent kickback scheme in which Suncoast, a registered broker-dealer, received order flow and trades at favorable prices from an employee of New York Life Insurance Company, Inc., in exchange for cash kickbacks and gifts. , The SEC alleged that over a 15-month period in 1998 and 1999, the New York Life employee directed trades totaling millions of dollars of securities to Suncoast at prices that were off-market or more favorable to Suncoast than were otherwise available in the market. This preferential treatment was therefore detrimental to New York Life, the SEC alleged. , In exchange for the trades, the New York Life employee was paid in cash and non-cash gifts. Zwick, the SEC alleged, procured, approved, and/or encouraged a Suncoast employee to give gifts and cash kickbacks, and knowingly or recklessly approved fraudulent prices on Suncoast trades with New York Life. ODonnell, the SEC alleged in part, knowingly or recklessly executed most of the fraudulently priced New York Life trades. , The jury found Zwick liable on all counts, finding he violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and aided and abetted violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5 - general antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. The jury found ODonnell liable under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 for aiding and abetting the fraudulent price markup scheme but found ODonnell not liable on all other claims. , Previously, the Commission resolved its claims against former Suncoast principal Todd J. Cohen, dismissing its civil complaint against him upon the Commissions issuance of a settled administrative order suspending Cohen from acting in a supervisory capacity, and ordering Cohen to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest and a civil money penalty. , For further information, please see Press Release 2006-125 (July 27, 2006), Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34-54108 (July 6, 2006) and Litigation Release No. 18096 (April 21, 2003). ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19785.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Williams violated the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by making various misleading disclosures regarding the capabilities of Verdisys lateral drilling technology, the status and success of its drilling operations, and its revenues, and that former Verdisys CFO Andrew G. Wilson aided and abetted the violations. Also on July 28, 2006, the Commission entered a cease-and-desist order against former Verdisys director Eric A. McAfee, finding that he caused Verdisys to make misleading disclosures regarding its expenses and revenues. The Commission also commenced a civil money penalty action against McAfee in United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas. , Verdisys, Williams and Wilson made offers of settlement, on a neither admit-nor-deny basis, by which they consent to the entry of permanent injunctions by the United States District Court, barring future violations of the Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Williams has also offered to pay a civil money penalty of $125,000, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company. Wilson has offered to pay a penalty of $25,000, and to be barred him from serving as the officer or director of a public company for five years. , McAfee consented, on a neither admit-nor-deny basis, to the entry of the Commissions cease-and-desist order, which found that he caused violations Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. In the related penalty action filed in United States District Court, McAfee also offered to pay a civil money penalty of $25,000. , The parties to the various proceedings are: , Beginning in May 2003, according to the Commissions complaint, Verdisys issued misleading press releases which Wilson and Williams prepared and reviewed. The releases failed to disclose that the companys touted lateral drilling technology only consisted of two prototypes with no track record of substantial success and that its two major customers did not have the financial resources to support announced drilling contracts totaling $19 million. Further, statements in a press release predicting that Verdisys technology would rejuvenate a formerly prolific natural gas field in Louisiana lacked a reasonable basis in fact. In actual operations, Verdisys drilling technology proved unreliable, and no significant production ever resulted from its use. , The Commissions complaint also alleges that various reports Verdisys filed with the Commission through late 2003, which Williams and Wilson prepared and signed, made misleading disclosures. Among other things, Verdisys quarterly report for the period ended September 30, 2003, initially filed with the Commission on Form 10-QSB on November 19, 2003, overstated the companys revenues by nearly 100%. According to the complaint, Williams had wholly falsified reports of wells drilled, which resulted in false claims of revenue earned. , The Commissions cease-and-desist proceedings against McAfee found that he caused Verdisys to omit disclosure in financial statements filed with the Commission in its September 29, 2003 Form 8-K/A filing, that Verdisys had incurred a $500,000 expense in issuing stock to retain a stock promoter. The proceedings also found that McAfee caused Verdisys to file its misleading Form 10-QSB report on November 19, 2003, before Verdisys auditor had reviewed the accompanying financial statements, and without disclosing an agreement that called for Verdisys to assume substantial liabilities and which compromised a material receivable. ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19786.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Cal. filed Aug. 1, 2006)</h2>, <h2>SEC Charges Operator of Stock Picking Website With Secretly Profiting in Investment Scam</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced the filing of civil securities fraud charges against the operator of an Internet website who made more than $2.7 million in profits by secretly selling the stocks he recommended as mega bonus buys on his site, www.thestockster.com (the Stockster website). , The Commissions complaint alleges that Nicholas A. Czuczko, age 34, of Beverly Hills, Calif., routinely recommended thinly-traded penny stocks on his website while he personally planned to sell the stock into the rising price spurred by the recommendation. Czuczkos practice was to buy shares of the recommended stocks shortly before posting the selection on the Stockster website. When unsuspecting Internet visitors bought the recommended stocks and drove up the price of the shares, Czuczko sold or scalped his holdings for substantial profits without disclosing his own sales on the Stockster site. , According to the Commissions complaint, Czuczko funded an extensive Internet advertising campaign to drive traffic to the Stockster website. Between mid-December 2005 and the end of March 2006, the Commission alleges, Czuczko paid approximately $1.15 million to Internet search companies and other web advertisers. Ads for the Stockster site appeared on Google and Yahoo! in response to Internet searches for terms like stocks and investment advice, and on popular financial websites like Marketwatch.com, TheStreet.com, and The Wall Street Journal Online. Czuczkos advertising campaign proved successful, and his stock picks reliably fueled trading and price increases in the recommended stocks. , In a related scheme, the Commission charges that Czuczko touted shares of his own company, Epic Media, Inc. Epic Media, based in Los Angeles, is a development stage company with plans to publish lifestyle magazines for men and women. Czuczko is Epic Medias CEO and CFO, and chairman of the companys board of directors, as well as its majority shareholder. The Commission alleges that in early December 2005 Czuczko recommended the purchase of Epic Media stock on a website that was the predecessor to the Stockster site. After the price of Epic Media stock spiked, Czuczko sold his shares for a small profit. Czuczko did not publicly disclose those trades, among others, in stock ownership forms required to be filed with the Commission under federal securities laws. , The Stockster website included a boilerplate disclaimer that the sites unidentified officers and employees may trade in the recommended stocks. The truth, however, was that Czuczko always sold his shares as soon as his recommendation had its intended effect of increasing the price of the stock. The Stockster website provided no warning to Internet visitors that the sites operator intended-and in fact made it a regular practice-to sell the stocks at the same time that he posted buy recommendations on the site. By failing to disclose his intent to sell at the time when he made the recommendation, Czuczko was able to turn a quick profit at the expense of the investors who followed the sites advice. , The Commissions complaint, filed in federal district court in Los Angeles, seeks to enjoin Czuczko from future violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws (Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder). The complaint also seeks to enjoin Czuczko from violations of the ownership disclosure provisions of the federal securities laws (Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 16a-3 thereunder). The Commission requests that the district court order Czuczko to disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, impose a civil monetary penalty, and bar him from participating in penny stock offerings and from serving as an officer or director of a publicly traded company. , The Commission acknowledges the assistance of NASD Market Regulation with its investigation. , <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2006/comp19787.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19787.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The Final Judgment also orders Upshaw to pay disgorgement in the amount of $2,189,183.37 plus prejudgment interest in the amount of $68,438.78, but waives payment of those amounts and does not impose a civil penalty against Upshaw based upon his Sworn Statement of Financial Condition and the fact that Upshaw is currently incarcerated.

Since 2000, approximately 57,000 members of the United States military services purchased the product. The vast majority earned little or nothing on their investment. , The Commissions complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California, charged affiliated entities American-Amicable Life Insurance Company of Texas, Pioneer American Insurance Company, and Pioneer Security Life Insurance Company (together, American-Amicable), all based in Waco, Texas, with securities law violations. , American-Amicable has agreed to settle the action by paying $10 million to the approximately 57,000 military personnel who invested in the product sold as an investment known as Horizon Life. The settlement is part of a global settlement of claims brought by the Commission, state insurance regulators led by the Georgia Department of Insurance and the Texas Department of Insurance, and the United States Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The settlement with the other regulators will provide additional relief, which the other regulators value at approximately $60 million. In the agreed settlement, the company has neither admitted nor denied the Commissions allegations. Pursuant to the settlement, American-Amicable will discontinue sales of Horizon Life and will terminate the deceptive sales program, which it called the Building Success system. , Unlike insurance products legitimately offered to a wide range of potential buyers with a potential interest in the insurance features of those products, Horizon Life was targeted at military personnel who had little or no interest in insurance because they already were provided access to low-cost insurance sponsored by the government. Instead, American-Amicable represented Horizon Life to military personnel as a security and a wealth-creating investment. As a material element of its marketing, American-Amicable senior staff trained its sales agents to hold themselves out as financial advisers or financial coaches. Purporting to play that role, the sales agents then misled military personnel to believe they could become millionaires if they invested in Horizon Life. At the same time, the agents denigrated other investment alternatives, claiming that mutual funds, bank savings accounts and government bonds were not sensible investments compared to Horizon Life. , Although the written materials ultimately provided to investors apparently accurately described the Horizon Life product, the companys deceptive sales pitch did not. Contrary to the representations, the overwhelming majority of military personnel who purchased Horizon Life earned little or nothing from their investment. , The Commissions complaint charges American-Amicable with violating Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933, an antifraud statute. Without admitting or denying the allegations, American-Amicable has agreed to be enjoined from further violations of these provisions, and to pay disgorgement of $10 million, which will be distributed to the affected investors. , In related matters, Georgia Insurance Commissioner John W.

Had Kirschner sold the same quantity of shares hours later, he would have realized gross proceeds of less than $20, as these shares were then trading at less than a penny, reflecting the adjustment by the market to the issuance the stock dividend. , Specifically, the Commission charged Kirschner with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and charged Media Magic with violating Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act. Without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, Kirschner consented to the entry of an order permanently enjoining him from violating the registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. Kirschner also consented to disgorge $109,400 in ill-gotten gains, plus prejudgment interest, and pay a $55,000 civil penalty. In a related Administrative Proceeding, Kirschner consented to the entry of an order barring him from association with any broker or dealer with the right to reapply for association after five years to the appropriate self-regulatory organization.

August 9, 2006)</h2>]","[According to the Complaint, the former executives collectively realized millions of dollars of ill-gotten compensation through the exercise of illegally backdated option grants and the subsequent sale of Comverse common stock., The complaint alleges, among other things, that:, <p class=em2>Comverse is a maker of software, systems, and related services for multimedia communication and information processing applications headquartered in New York, New York., <p class=em2>Beginning in 1991, Alexander, 54, of New York, New York, repeatedly used hindsight to select a date when the closing price of Comverse’s common stock was at or near a quarterly or annual low.  Alexander later communicated this date and closing price to Sorin, 56, of New York, New York, in order for it to be used as the date of, and exercise price for, a grant of Comverse options.  Sorin, with Alexander’s knowledge, then created company records that falsely indicated that a committee of Comverse’s board of directors had actually approved the option grant on the date Alexander had “cherry-picked” when, in fact, the committee acted to make the grant on a different, and later, date.  Kreinberg, 41, of Teaneck, New Jersey, joined the scheme no later than 1998, and assisted Alexander in using hindsight to select a backdated grant date.  Kreinberg knew that company records reflected false grant dates.   , <p class=em2>Alexander and Kreinberg also created a slush fund of backdated Comverse options between 1999 and 2002 by, among other things, secretly inserting fictitious names among the names of actual Comverse employees on proposed option grantee lists which then were submitted to a committee of Comverse’s board of directors for approval.  Once the committee approved these options, Alexander, with Kreinberg’s knowledge, used the slush fund’s backdated options to recruit and retain key personnel until at least 2002.  , <p class=em2>Kreinberg instructed a Comverse employee to conceal the existence of the slush fund from Comverse’s auditors and in March 2006, after learning that a special committee of Comverse’s board would investigate the company’s option grants, Kreinberg undertook to hide the existence of the slush fund by altering records in Comverse’s electronic option-tracking system.  Alexander, Kreinberg, and Sorin also made misrepresentations to Comverse’s auditors in order to conceal the backdating scheme., <p class=em2>As a result of the scheme, Alexander, Kreinberg, and Sorin received undisclosed, in-the-money options which had an immediate intrinsic gain because the exercise price of the option was lower than the market price of the underlying common stock on the date of the grant.  Alexander realized actual gains of nearly $138 million from sales of stock underlying the exercises of backdated options that were granted during the 1991 to 2001 period.  At least $6.4 million of this gain represents the in-the-money portion of the options at the time of the grant to Alexander.  Kreinberg realized an actual gain of nearly $13 million from the sales of stock underlying the exercises of backdated options granted during the 1994 to 2001 period, with at least $1 million of this gain representing the in-the-money portion of the options at the time of the grant to Kreinberg.  Sorin realized an actual gain of more than $14 million from the sales of stock underlying the exercises of backdated options granted during the 1991 to 2001 period, with approximately $1 million of this gain representing the in-the-money portion of the options at the time of the grant to Sorin., <p class=em2>From fiscal year 2001 to 2002, Kreinberg, with Sorin’s knowledge, initiated a similar backdating scheme at Ulticom, Inc., a publicly-traded, majority-owned subsidiary of Comverse.  , Comverse and Ulticom have publicly announced that they expect to restate their historical financial results for multiple years in order to record additional, material non-cash charges for option-related compensation expenses.  , The Complaint charges the defendants with fraud and other violations of the federal securities laws, including the books and records, internal controls, lying to auditors and, as to Alexander and Kreinberg, the Sarbanes-Oxley certification provisions.

Lucarelli was acquitted on March 21, 2007 of all counts in the indictment., The Commission announced that on July 28, 2006, in a case prosecuted by the United States Attorney for the District of Connecticut, a jury in New Haven, Connecticut returned a guilty verdict against John M. Lucarelli, age 34, of Greenwich, Connecticut, on one count of conspiracy and one count of securities fraud in connection with the NewAlliance Bancshares, Inc. initial public offering (IPO). The Commission also announced that, on June 29, 2006, just prior to the start of the criminal trial, Lucarellis co-defendant, Chance M. Vought, age 56, of Quogue, New York, pled guilty to one count of securities fraud. Robert Ross and George Kundrat had previously pled guilty to related charges. , The indictment in this matter charged Vought and Lucarelli with conspiring to illegally obtain shares of NewAlliance stock. As alleged in the indictment, Vought, Lucarelli, and their co-conspirators were not eligible to obtain NewAlliance NAB stock at its $10 IPO price because they were not eligible account holders of New Haven Savings Bank (the predecessor of NewAlliance). However, Vought and Lucarelli are alleged to have participated in a scheme to purchase the stock at that $10 price by having individuals who were account holders purchase the stock for them. The Indictment alleges that, after purchasing the shares in the names of other people, the members of the conspiracy then sold the shares at a profit, which was shared among the defendants and the other members of their conspiracy. , On June 28, 2005, the Commission filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut against Vought, Lucarelli, and others based upon the same fraudulent scheme that was the subject of the current indictment.

Sarna and Nussen said that they controlled a majority of Auroras stock and that they were funding the companys operations with sale proceeds of Aurora stock. To generate additional stock sales and create trading volume in Aurora stock, Sarna and Nussen agreed to pay these individuals an amount equal to 30 percent of Sarna and Nussens stock sale proceeds as a kickback for soliciting retail customers. On June 8, 2006, Sarna and Nussen deposited 3,286,403 shares of Aurora stock into an account at the brokerage firm. On June 21 and 22, 2006, the person Sarna and Nussen believed to be associated with the brokerage firm sold 83,000 and 56,000 Aurora shares, respectively, from Sarna and Nussens nominee account to other accounts at the brokerage firm. On July 3, 2006, Sarna and Nussen received the sale proceeds of $25,000, and on July 6, 2006, Sarna and Nussen paid a $7,500 kickback to the former stock promoter. , Beginning on July 14, 2006, the Commission temporarily suspended trading in the securities of Aurora for ten business days pursuant to Section 12(k) of the Exchange Act because of possible manipulative conduct occurring in the market for the companys stock.

According to the Complaint, defendants have defrauded hundreds of investors of over $50 million by promising returns of 100% or more within 60 days. The Complaint alleges that defendants have been telling investors that these extraordinary profits were to be generated in part by helping an unnamed Saudi Arabian prince move gold from Israel through Luxembourg to the United Arab Emirates. In reality, according to the Complaint, although some money has been paid out to investors, these funds appear to have come from new investor money, and substantial amounts of investor funds have been transferred to bank accounts controlled by the proposed defendants and relief defendants. Defendants have characterized the purported gold transaction to religiously devout investors as deistically inspired and divinely guided. , The amended complaint adds DJM, LLC, Financial MD, Inc., Financial MD and Associates, Inc., Global Village Records, La Vie DArgent, Daniel J. Merriman, and Millie Stultz as defendants and Wing NGA Lau, a/k/a Adienne Lau as a relief defendant. According to the complaint, even after the original defendants were enjoined from continuing to violate the federal securities laws, they continued their fraud by soliciting additional money into this scam. To circumvent the asset freeze, certain defendants created a new company, Global Village Records, and then used the bank accounts of companies owned by Daniel J. Merriman to forward money from investors. Millie Stultz promoted the alleged scheme even after learning of the SECs complaint. The Commission and Global Village Records have also stipulated to the entering of a preliminary injunction against Global Village Records. For their roles in the alleged scheme, the SEC charges the new defendants along with the old defendants Tri Energy, Inc., Marina Investors Group, Inc., H &amp; J Energy Company, Lowell Decker, Robert Jennings, Henry Jones and Arthur Simburg with violations of Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and violations of, and aiding and abetting violations of, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Mikus, the former chief executive officer and chairman of the board of Endocare, Inc., and John V. Cracchiolo, Endocares former chief financial officer and chief operating officer, for orchestrating a financial fraud perpetrated on the investing public in 2001 and 2002.  At the time, Endocare, based in Irvine, Calif., developed and distributed medical devices for use in the treatment of various types of cancers and urological ailments., The Commissions complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana, Calif., alleges that Mikus, age 40, of Irvine, Calif., and Cracchiolo, age 50, of Gardnerville, Nev., significantly overstated Endocares income by booking false sales, engaging in improper revenue recognition practices, and improperly understating or delaying the recognition of expenses in order to inflate Endocares earnings.  The complaint further alleges that, during conference calls with Wall Street analysts, Mikus and Cracchiolo misled investors about the number of procedures that had been performed using Endocares devices.  According to the complaint, the procedure numbers were critical to Endocare because these numbers reflected the present and future market acceptance for Endocares devices., The complaint alleges that, as a result of the fraudulent accounting, Endocare overstated net revenue by at least 16% for 2001, 17% for the first quarter of 2002, and 33% for the second quarter of 2002.  Additionally, Endocares financial statements understated its pre-tax loss for 2001 by 20%, and falsely reported pre-tax earnings for the first two quarters of 2002, rather than properly reporting substantial pre-tax losses., The complaint further alleges that Mikus and Cracchiolo approved a press release announcing the termination of Endocares acting controller for conduct materially injurious to the company after the acting controller had raised questions about Endocares accounting practices.  The complaint alleges that the press release was misleading because it was issued one week after Endocare had disclosed that the companys independent auditors, KPMG LLP, had concluded that KPMG could no longer rely on the representations of management, which included Mikus and Cracchiolo.  As alleged in the complaint, the press release falsely implied that Endocare had terminated the bad actors responsible for KPMGs concerns.  The complaint also alleges that Mikus approved another misleading press release in which Endocare announced that, after an independent investigation, the audit committee had concluded that there was no indication of fraud or intentional wrongdoing by management.  The complaint alleges this statement was false and misleading because, first, the company in fact had not conducted an independent investigation, and second, an internal review had in fact revealed substantial evidence of fraud or intentional wrongdoing., The Commission charged Mikus and Cracchiolo with violating the antifraud provisions, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; the record-keeping and internal controls provisions, Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder; and the false statements to auditors provision, Rule 13b2-2 of the Exchange Act.  Mikus and Cracchiolo were also charged with aiding and abetting Endocares violations of the reporting provisions, Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder; the record-keeping provision, Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act; and the internal controls provision, Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act., The Commission seeks permanent injunctions against Mikus and Cracchiolo, an order that they repay their ill-gotten gains, civil monetary penalties, and an order barring them from serving as officers or directors of publicly-traded companies., The Commission previously filed settled actions against Endocare, its senior vice president of sales, Kevin Quilty, and the former president of an Endocare subsidiary, Jerry W.

The Honorable Florence-Marie Cooper,<b> </b>United States District Judge<b> </b>for the Central District of California, issued an order appointing a temporary receiver over the companies controlled by James and freezing assets., According to the Commission’s complaint, since at least January 2004, James, through JWJA, has solicited investors with direct mail invitations to free dinner seminars focusing on retirement planning.  As alleged in the complaint, the invitations include statements such as “Retirement Secrets of the Rich: What your Accountant and Stockbroker don’t want you to know.”  The complaint further alleges that the invitations and seminars claim JWJA will help investors retire “in just seven short years” by investing their IRA funds “to take advantage of the booming real estate market” and “to produce double-digit returns.”    , As alleged in the complaint, investors are falsely told that their funds will be used for profitable real estate transactions that will provide returns, which at times were represented to be as high as 24%.  The complaint alleges that the defendants offered and sold promissory notes and, later, interests in limited liability companies.  , The Commission’s complaint alleges that, throughout 2004 and 2005, defendants did not purchase any real estate or real estate related assets from which to pay investor returns.  Additionally, the complaint alleges that the defendants misrepresented to investors that their investments would be secured by real property or by monies owed to JWJA from real estate transactions.

Pillor, former Senior Vice President for Sales and Marketing and member of the Board of Directors of InVision Technologies, Inc., a manufacturer of explosive detection machines used in airports. , The Commissions complaint, filed in federal district court in San Francisco, alleges that Pillor aided and abetted InVisions failure to establish adequate internal controls to prevent the company from violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), in violation of Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and that he indirectly caused the falsification of the companys books and records, in violation of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1. Simultaneous with the filing of the Commissions complaint, Pillor agreed, without admitting or denying the allegations, to pay a $65,000 civil penalty and to entry of a permanent injunction against future violations, in settlement of the matter. , In February 2005, InVision settled related charges by the Commission by paying $1.1 million in disgorgement and penalties and agreeing to a Commission order to cease and desist from future FCPA violations. In December 2004, InVision paid $800,000 in penalties to settle similar charges brought by the U.S. Department of Justice. , As described in the Commissions complaint, during the period from late 2001 through June 2004, InVision completed sales to airports in China, the Philippines, and Thailand. In the course of these transactions, Pillor received e-mail messages from his Asian regional sales manager that suggested that InVisions overseas sales agents and distributors intended to make improper payments or other gifts to foreign government officials, in violation of the FCPA. InVision subsequently paid invoices to its agents and distributors in China and the Philippines and improperly recorded the payments as legitimate business expenses. , InVisions FCPA violations occurred, in part, because the company lacked adequate internal controls to detect and prevent such conduct. For example, InVisions sales department provided only informal training about the FCPA to its employees and foreign agents.

Walsh, was sentenced by the Honorable K. Michael Moore, United States District Court Judge for the Southern District of Florida, to a federal prison sentence of 57 months and ordered to pay criminal restitution in the amount of $2.6 million. Both Walsh and John Abresch, former principals of Discovery Capital, Inc., a Coral Springs broker-dealer formerly registered with the Commission, were convicted after pleading guilty to violations of the federal securities laws in connection with their role in a boiler room operation that fraudulently induced investors in the U.S. and Europe to invest millions. Abreschs sentencing is scheduled for September 11, 2006. , In connection with the fraudulent Discovery Capital offering, Walsh was convicted of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, mail fraud and securities fraud (18 U.S.C. § 371), and securities fraud (15 U.S.C. §§ 78j(b) and 78ff(a), 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5). Walsh was also convicted of one count of making false statements to the Commission (18 U.S.C. § 1001(a)(2)), in connection with the Commissions on site examination of Discovery Capital in 2002. Specifically, Walsh lied in writing to examiners in response to their questions during the examination. , In March 2002, the Commission brought an emergency action against Walsh and Abresch, charging them with violations of the antifraud and registration violations of the federal securities laws in connection with Discovery Capitals fraudulent securities offering. In that action, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida issued a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze to halt the on-going offering of securities by Discovery Capital. The District Court also appointed a receiver, Michael I. Goldberg, over Discovery Capital. The Commissions Complaint alleged that from at least June 2001 through the filing of the action, Discovery Capital raised approximately $2.7 million through the use of a network of primarily unlicensed sales agents using high pressure sales tactics and making misrepresentations about, among other things, Discovery Capitals growth, its affiliations with well-known brokerage firms and other institutions, and the safety of the investments. The Complaint further alleged that Walsh misappropriated investor proceeds through the use of an off the books account in the name of Discovery Capital. , In October 2002, by consent, the District Court permanently enjoined Walsh and Abresch from violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and enjoined Discovery Capital from further violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b), 15(c) and 17(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 10b-5, 15c1-2, 15c3-1, 17a-3, 17a-4, 17a-5, and 17a-11 thereunder. In October 2002, the Court further ordered Abresch to disgorge over $500,000, but waived payment of all but $195,000 and did not impose a civil money penalty based on Abreschs sworn financial statement and other information submitted to the Commission. In January 2003, the Court ordered Walsh to pay over $500,000 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest and imposed a $90,000 civil penalty. Subsequently, in March and April 2003, the Commission barred Walsh and Abresch, respectively, from association with a broker or dealer, and in March 2003, the Commission revoked the registration of Discovery Capital. , For further information, see Litigation Release Nos. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17420.htm>17420</a> (March 19, 2002), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17813.htm>17813</a> (October 29, 2002), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17812.htm>17812</a> (October 29, 2002), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17914.htm>17914</a> (January 7, 2003), and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr19610.htm>19610</a> (March 16, 2006). ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19804.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The couple pocketed more than $1 million in proceeds as a result of the scam. , The Commissions complaint alleges that Jeffery Steven Stone of Greenwich, Connecticut, and his wife, Janette Diller Stone, using entities they controlled, acquired massive amounts of WebSky stock under false pretenses, hired stock promoters to hype the stock in false spam emails, and then dumped their shares into the unsuspecting market. Stone is a recidivist securities law violator, having been convicted of fraud in a prior market manipulation scheme and found liable in civil proceedings by the Commission. , According to the complaint, Stone and Diller bought 288 million shares from WebSky based on false promises that the shares were being acquired for investment purposes and not as a means of distributing shares to the public. Within days, the two began selling the shares to third parties. Stone and Diller also engineered a spam email campaign that falsely portrayed WebSky - a start-up Internet company with virtually no revenues or profits - as having a successful joint venture in Argentina that would result in over $40 million in annual revenues. In reality, WebSkys CEO had forbidden them from sending the spam email and informed them that WebSkys Argentina deal was no longer viable. , The complaint alleges that, as a result of Stone and Dillers fraud, WebSkys stock price soared by over 300% on trading volume almost 20 times greater than normal, after which Stone and Diller sold their WebSky shares. Combined with proceeds from other stock sales during the scheme, Stone and Diller received more than $1 million in proceeds. , The Commission also brought charges against WebSky and its CEO, Douglas Haffer, of Oakland, California, for selling WebSky shares in a subsequent transaction to an entity controlled by Stone and Diller without registering the transaction or securing an exemption from registration. Subject to court approval, WebSky and Haffer have agreed to settle the action, without admitting or denying the allegations, by disgorging the $35,000 received in the sale and consenting to a permanent injunction against future violations of the registration provisions of the federal securities laws. Haffer also has agreed to pay a $25,000 civil penalty. , The complaint, filed in federal court in New York, New York, charges Stone and Diller with violating the antifraud, registration, and other provisions of the federal securities laws.

This had the effect of falsely increasing the companys gross profit margins, and in some instances, net income. As a result of their misconduct, DHB materially misstated key financial information in filings with the SEC and in public statements. , According to the SECs complaint, Schlegel, of Eastport, N.Y., and Hatfield, of Pompano Beach, Fla., regularly overstated the value of DHBs inventory by fraudulently increasing inventory quantities, labor costs, overhead costs, and the amount of raw materials used in DHBs products. The complaint alleges that together Hatfield and Schlegel also transferred millions of dollars of expenses from cost of goods sold to research and development costs to materially increase the companys gross profit. The complaint further alleges that Schlegel falsely inflated DHBs $60 million charge against earnings taken in the third quarter of 2005 to mask her and Hatfields fraudulent conduct. Schlegel is alleged to have lied to DHBs auditors and provided fake inventory schedules and other documents to conceal the fraud. , The complaint also alleges that during the period of their fraudulent conduct, Schlegel and Hatfield collectively profited by over $8.2 million from the cashless exercise of warrants and sale of over 400,000 DHB shares. Schlegel and Hatfield sold these shares at the end of 2004 at the height of DHBs stock price and before the public knew about the misrepresentations in DHBs filings and public statements. , The Commissions complaint charges Schlegel and Hatfield with violating Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder, and aiding and abetting DHBs violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13 thereunder.

According to the Information, as managing partner, Conway made numerous misrepresentations to investors, including that the hedge fund would follow a specific investment strategy devised in part by Conway. The Information alleges that, in fact, Conway, the sole trader for the fund, ceased using the promised investment strategy without notice to, or the approval of, the investors. In addition, according to the Information, in order to hide this deviation from the promised strategy, Conway created and distributed false documentation for the purpose of inducing investors to transmit additional investment monies, concealing the true status of the hedge fund account and its trading history, and causing existing investors to leave their funds under Conways management. Conway received a fee for his management of the investment funds.

To induce these sales, Defendants made numerous oral and written false and misleading statements, including that: (i) One Wall Street would soon conduct an initial public offering; (ii) E*TRADE Financial Corporation  was negotiating to merge with One Wall Street; and (iii) One Wall Street would use the investment proceeds for marketing to create exposure for the company, to acquire distressed financial research companies, to expand into international markets, and to expand the companys information technology infrastructure.

However, according to the complaint, the developer and others lied to investors about how bond proceeds would be used to acquire land for the project; falsely claimed that a prominent investment bank was involved in providing additional private financing for the project; falsely claimed that the project was already fully leased to a Triple A credit-rated company; and failed to disclose kickbacks to several of the offering participants.

Fuqua (Fuqua), 46, and Fuquas alter ego, Commission-registered investment adviser KHF Advisors, LLC (KHF Advisors). The Complaint alleges that, from at least January 2003 until late 2005, Fuqua engaged in a fraudulent scheme to misappropriate money from his investment advisory clients. Fuqua engaged in much of his alleged fraudulent activity through KHF Advisors, an investment advisor he created and controlled. , According to the Complaint, Fuqua and KHF Advisors were fiduciaries of their investment advisory clients and, as such, owed their clients a duty of honesty, undivided loyalty, fair-dealing and full disclosure. Several of Fuquas clients gave him discretionary authority over their money with the caveat that he not put their money in high-risk investments. These clients included 401(k) employee retirement plans and a widowed mother-of-two under court order to conservatively invest the estate of her late husband on behalf of her children. , The Complaint alleges that, instead of investing his investment advisory clients money according to their instructions, Fuqua engaged in a fraudulent scheme to misappropriate client money to pay his own personal and business expenses, and to repay money he had misappropriated from other clients. To facilitate his fraudulent scheme, Fuqua created two investment vehicles which were little more than tools for Fuqua to access his clients money. Fuqua funneled client money through these investment vehicles and into bank accounts that he alone controlled. He then used the client money transferred into these bank accounts to repay other clients wanting to redeem their investments, to pay business expenses and to siphon over $200,000 to pay a multitude of personal expenses, such as supermarket, pharmacy, and jewelry store bills. The Complaint further alleges that Fuqua was able to continue his scheme unchecked by deceiving his clients into believing their investments retained their value. He did so by, among other deceptive actions, inflating the share prices and account balances on his clients account statements. , The Complaint alleges that the defendants violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5. The Complaint additionally alleges that the defendants violated Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers Act), and that Fuqua aided and abetted KHF Advisors violations of the Advisers Act.

Although Ferguson ultimately did not bid on Noland, the price of Noland shares increased by more than 50 percent after another suitor publicly announced its winning bid in April 2005.

John Surgent, et al., Civil Action No. 04-60493-CIV (S.D. Fla.) (JIC). All three defendants settled the charges without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint. , The Commission also announced today that on July 24, 2006, the Commission prevailed in its motion for summary judgment against John Surgent, the primary architect of the Orex manipulation scheme. The Court found Surgent liable for securities fraud and violations of the registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933. The Court enjoined him from future violations of the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws, permanently barred him from participating in the offering of any penny stock and permanently barred him from acting as an officer or director of any public company. The Court reserved for a later hearing a determination of the monetary sanctions to be imposed against Surgent. Previously, Surgent was convicted in a related criminal proceeding (U.S. v. Surgent, # 04-cr-0364 (JG) (EDNY)) for securities fraud and money laundering, sentenced to a term of fourteen years incarceration, and ordered to pay $1.7 million in victim restitution. , The Commissions complaint in this matter, filed on April 16, 2004, alleged that from March through July 1999, the defendants used false promotional materials and classic boiler-room tactics to sell approximately $6 million of Surgents unregistered securities. The complaint alleged that Surgent, a recidivist securities law violator and disbarred attorney, controlled the majority of Orex stock and  together with Heminger, the companys nominal president  created and distributed promotional materials that falsely portrayed Orex as an active, established mining company with mines and a revolutionary gold extraction process. In truth, the complaint alleged, Orex neither owned any mines nor possessed any mining equipment. The complaint also alleged that the gold extraction process that formed the cornerstone of the Orex promotional campaign had never been tested or implemented on a commercial basis. , The complaint further alleged that Vitale and Puccio  working as brokers at a boiler room operating out of the Pompano Beach, Florida office of Preferred Securities Group, Inc.  engaged in various sales practice abuses while selling Orex stock, made false and misleading statements about Orex, failed to make the required penny stock disclosures to customers concerning Orex, and otherwise engaged in a variety of fraudulent and deceptive conduct. , The final judgment against Heminger permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws, permanently bars him from participating in any penny stock offering, and bars him, for a period of ten years, from acting as an officer or director of any public company. The judgment further orders Heminger to disgorge $18,000, an amount representing his ill-gotten gains and pre-judgment interest thereon, as well as $7,000 in civil penalties. The judgment did not impose a penalty in excess of $7,000 based on Hemingers sworn financial statement and other information submitted to the Commission. , The final judgments against Vitale and Puccio permanently enjoin each of them from future violations of the antifraud, registration, and penny stock disclosure provisions of the federal securities laws, permanently bar each of them from participating in any penny stock offerings, and order each of them to pay $40,025 in disgorgement plus pre-judgment interest and $60,000 in civil penalties.

The judgment permanently enjoins Ziller from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. It also prohibits him for five years from acting as an officer or director of any issuer of securities registered with the Commission and permanently bars him from participating in an offering of penny stock. Ziller was also found liable for disgorgement of $333,086, representing monies gained as a result of the conduct alleged in the Commissions complaint, and prejudgment interest of $121,035.34, for a total of $454,212.34. The order waives payment of the disgorgement and prejudgment interest based on his sworn financial statement and other information submitted to the Commission. , The Commissions complaint alleges that during 2000 and 2001 Ziller and the other defendants violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. Defendants issued a series of fraudulent press releases as part of a scheme to falsely portray Platforms business activities and support its stock price. Platforms claimed to have an aerial system, the ARC System, for transmitting cellular telephone calls and other types of electronic data, using either fixed-wing aircraft or a blimp to carry transmission equipment. Platforms used these press releases to convince investors to purchase its stock and to support its share price on the secondary market. The complaint further alleges that the Defendants intentionally misled investors for the purpose of unlawfully making a profit themselves. During this period, they were profiting from payments they received from the company, from illegal stock sales into the secondary market, and/or from stock sales made directly to investors. Ziller consented to the final judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint. ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19824.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Biopure Corporation, et al.</i>, Civil Action No. 05-11853-PBS (D.

The final judgment against Biopure, entered on September 5, 2006, permanently enjoins it from violating antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and requires the company to retain an independent consultant to review Biopure=s disclosure, compliance and other policies and procedures. The final judgment against Kober, entered on September 8, 2006, permanently enjoins Kober from aiding and abetting violations of the reporting provisions of the federal securities laws and orders her to pay a $40,000 civil penalty. , The Commission=s Complaint, filed September 14, 2005, alleges that, beginning in April 2003, Biopure received negative information from the FDA regarding its efforts to obtain FDA approval of its synthetic blood product Hemopure but failed to disclose the information, or falsely described it as positive developments. Specifically, the Complaint alleges that in April 2003, the FDA placed a clinical hold barring Biopure from conducting clinical trials of Hemopure in trauma settings such as emergency rooms, because of safety concerns about Hemopure. As alleged, during the next eight months, the company concealed the imposition of the clinical hold while making public statements about its plans to obtain approval for trauma uses of Hemopure. In addition, according to the Complaint, in July 2003 the FDA informed Biopure that it had not approved Biopure=s application for use of Hemopure in orthopedic surgery, and instead conveyed serious concerns about whether the materials Biopure had submitted in support of its application were reliable and questioning the safety of Hemopure. According to the Complaint, Biopure, however, issued public statements beginning on August 1, 2003 describing the FDA=s communication as good news, causing its stock price to increase by over 20%. The Complaint alleges that Biopure continued to make misleading statements until December 2003. During this period, Biopure raised over $35 million from investors. The Complaint further alleges that as the true status of Biopure=s efforts to obtain FDA approval gradually became public, through a series of incomplete and misleading disclosures between late October and the end of December 2003, the company=s stock price plummeted almost 66% from its August 1 price. , To settle the Commission=s charges, Biopure consented, without admitting or denying the allegations of the Complaint, to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it from committing future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (ASecurities Act@) and Sections 10(b) and 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (AExchange Act@) and Rules 10b 5, 12b 20, 13a 11 and 13a 13 thereunder and requiring the company to retain an independent consultant to conduct a comprehensive review of its disclosure, compliance and other policies and procedures designed to prevent and detect federal securities violations of the nature described in the Complaint. Biopure is required to adopt the recommendations of the consultant. Kober consented, without admitting or denying the allegations of the Complaint, to entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining her from aiding and abetting future violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-11 and 13a-13 thereunder and imposing a civil penalty in the amount of $40,000.

(AA Capital), a Chicago-based investment adviser managing more than $194 million for six union pension funds, and its president, John A. Orecchio (Orecchio). The Order temporarily restrains AA Capital from violations of the antifraud and books and records provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers Act), temporarily restrains Orecchio from aiding and abetting specific antifraud provisions of the Advisers Act, freezes the defendants assets, requires defendants to give an accounting, prohibits document destruction, and permits expedited discovery. In addition, on September 12, the Commission obtained an order appointing a receiver over AA Capital. , In its complaint, which was filed on September 8, the Commission charged that AA Capital and Orecchio misappropriated at least $10.7 million from AA Capitals advisory clients. According to the complaint, AA Capital principally invests its clients assets in several private equity funds managed by affiliates of AA Capital. The complaint alleges that, under Orecchios direction, between May 2004 and October 2005, AA Capital withdrew at least $5.7 million from its client trust accounts in more than 20 separate installments and sent the client funds to various accounts Orecchio designated, including those of a Michigan horse farm owned by Orecchio and a company that manages a Detroit strip club. The complaint further alleges that Orecchio told AA Capitals CFO that the withdrawals were needed to reimburse him for what he claimed was a miscalculation of taxes he owed relating to at least one of AA Capitals affiliated private equity funds. The Commissions complaint also alleges that, during 2005, AA Capital misappropriated at least $5 million in client funds to cover the shortfall between its revenues and its operating expenses. The complaint further alleges that AA Capital misrepresented the nature of the withdrawals by sending monthly account statements to its advisory clients that falsely characterized the withdrawals as capital calls on the clients existing investments. , According to the complaint, members of AA Capitals senior management knew of Orecchios misappropriations and AA Capitals own misappropriations by early 2006, but continued to incur large expenses. The complaint alleged that Orecchio submitted more than $4.3 million in travel and entertainment expenses in 2006, including $1 million for political contributions, hundreds of thousands of dollars for private plane rentals, and $120,000 to entertain clients at the Super Bowl. The complaint further alleged that AA Capital had paid more than $2 million in 2006 to payees designated by Orecchio, purportedly in lieu of travel and entertainment expense reimbursement, including more than $1 million to the company managing the Detroit strip club and $610,000 to the Michigan horse farm. At the time the Court entered its Order, AA Capital had access to client trust accounts that held more than $68 million as of July 31, 2006. , The complaint alleged that, by the above conduct, AA Capital violated Sections 204, 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rules 204-2(a)(1), 204-2(a)(2), 204-2(a)(6), and 206(4)-4 thereunder and that Orecchio aided and abetted AA Capitals violations of Sections 206(1) and 206(2).

Martin was ordered to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest and a civil penalty in the respective amounts of $5,130,835.21, $124,593.79 and $250,000. Martin was ordered to pay the above amounts within 10 business days from the entry of the final judgment. , The complaint alleged and the Court found that from February 2005 through May 2006, Martin recommended to many customers that they sell variable annuity contracts that they owned and within a short time purchase new variable annuity contracts with higher principal amounts. Martin also recommended that his customers invest the proceeds from the sale of their variable annuity contracts in a money market fund or in a closed-end fund for a short time prior to purchasing the new variable annuity contracts. Based on Martins representations, the customers authorized the transactions; however, Martin did not invest the proceeds as authorized. Instead, Martin submitted forged documents to the variable annuity companies surrendering the contracts and directing those companies to mail the proceeds directly to him. Martin forged his customers names on the checks and deposited them into a bank account in the name of First Financial Group, a fictitious name under which Martin conducted business. Additionally, Martin obtained some of the checks from customers for the purpose of purchasing securities. Martin misappropriated those funds, and used the funds to pay business and personal obligations.

Indigenous Global Development Corporation, et al.</i>, United States District Court for the Northern District of California, Civil Action No. C-06-5600-JCS</h2>, <h2>SEC Files Fraud Charges Against San Francisco-Based Microcap Company</h2>]","[<i>San Francisco, September 13, 2006</i> - The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed securities fraud charges against Indigenous Global Development Corporation (IGDC) alleging that it, along with its chief executive officer, Deni G. Leonard, raised more than $2 million from investors through a series of materially false and misleading statements about IGDCs purported natural gas business. IGDC, based in San Francisco, Calif., promoted itself as the first public company in the United States majority-owned by Native Americans and continually hyped its progress on strategic initiatives which it claimed would provide a better future for Native American communities. IGDC in fact was teetering on the brink of extinction. It never earned any revenue, had no significant assets, and was dependent on funding from investors. It is now essentially defunct, according to the Commissions complaint. , The Commission alleges that to continue attracting investors, IGDC and Leonard made a series of false statements in press releases and SEC filings about IGDCs ability to purchase gas from indigenous peoples in Canada at a discount and then resell that gas into the United States for a significant profit. These statements were designed to keep investors falsely believing that IGDC was poised to reap millions from its natural gas program. For example, IGDC in 2004 falsely promoted a Canadian companys agreement to attempt to buy natural gas on its behalf by describing the agreement as a contract that allowed IGDC to purchase and sell 90 billion cubic feet of natural gas from Canada into the United States in the next fiscal year. The Canadian company, however, had no gas to sell to IGDC. In 2005, IGDC embellished the terms of preliminary agreements with two Canadian indigenous groups to explore the purchase and sale of their natural gas by falsely claiming the groups already had agreed to sell it natural gas worth $9 to $15 million. IGDC also misrepresented its ability to pay for the natural gas. In 2005, for example, IGDC exaggerated an investment groups preliminary interest in purchasing products from IGDC by falsely telling the public it had obtained a $100 million investment for its energy programs. , The Commissions complaint, filed in federal court in San Francisco, charges that IGDC and Leonard violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder. It also charges that Leonard violated Rule 13a-14 under the Exchange Act. The Commission seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, civil money penalties, and injunctive relief against both defendants, and seeks to bar Leonard from participating in an offering of penny stock and from serving as an officer or director of a public company. , In a separate action today, the Commission temporarily suspended trading in the securities of IGDC due to the lack of current and accurate information about the company because it has not filed periodic reports with the Commission since the quarter ended March 31, 2005. The temporary suspension began at 9:30 a.m. EDT and will terminate at 11:59 p.m. EDT on Sept. 26, 2006. Brokers and dealers should be alert to the fact that, pursuant to Rule 15c2-11 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, at the termination of the trading suspension, no quotation may be entered relating to the securities of IGDC unless and until the broker or dealer has strictly complied with all of the provisions of Rule 15c2-11. The Commission also has instituted administrative proceedings to determine whether it should revoke the registration of IGDCs securities based on its failure to make required periodic filings with the Commission., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2006/comp19829.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19829.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

It has a class of securities that is registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and that trades on the New York Stock Exchange. Brown has agreed to settle the charges against him, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint. , The Commission alleges in its complaint that Brown, a former supervisory employee in Willbross Nigerian and Latin American operations, participated in three separate schemes to bribe foreign officials. First, the complaint alleges that, in February and March 2005, Brown procured $1 million on behalf of a Willbros affiliate and delivered that money as partial payment of previously-made commitments to Nigerian government officials and to employees of the operator of a joint venture majority owned by an arm of the Nigerian government. He also assisted, according to the complaint, in the payment of an additional $550,000 that was also used to satisfy the earlier commitments. Second, Brown, in return for the granting to Willbros of a $3 million contract, knowingly assisted a scheme to pay a $300,000 bribe to officials of an oil and gas company owned by the government of Ecuador and its subsidiary. Finally, Brown knowingly assisted a long-running scheme in which employees of Willbros affiliates used fabricated invoices to procure cash from the companys administrative headquarters in Houston that was used to, among other things, bribe Nigerian tax and court officials. , The Commission alleges that, through these activities, Brown violated Sections 13(b)(5) and 30A of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder. In addition, the complaint alleges that Brown aided and abetted violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B) and 30A of the Exchange Act.

Subsidiary</h2>]","[On September 14, 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a settled civil action in Dallas federal court against Billy David Deaton, the former CEO of Image Entry, Inc., a data entry services provider with its principal office in London, Kentucky. Image Entry is a wholly owned subsidiary of Dallas-based Sourcecorp, Inc., whose common stock previously traded on the Nasdaq National Market but which now is privately owned. , Sourcecorp acquired Image Entry in 2001 from Deaton and members of his family. As part of the acquisition, Sourcecorp entered into employment agreements with Deaton providing, among other things, that Deaton would receive an annual bonus, over a three-year earn out period, tied to Image Entrys performance against certain earnings criteria. The Commission alleges that Deaton managed a scheme to overstate Image Entrys earnings so that he could increase the amount of this earn out bonus. The Commissions complaint describes an alleged scheme to inflate Image Entrys earnings from 2001 through the first quarter of 2004 by (1) recognizing unearned revenue from state and federal government data entry contracts, (2) prematurely recognizing revenue from a federal government data entry contract that Image Entry had not yet been awarded, and (3) diverting various Image Entry expenses to other companies Deaton owned to reduce Image Entrys expenses and increase its earnings. The Commission contends that Deatons alleged misconduct artificially inflated Image Entrys earnings and, by extension, his earn out bonus. Moreover, because the allegedly inflated figures were included in Sourcecorps publicly reported consolidated financial results, the Commissions complaint asserts that Sourcecorps earnings were materially overstated. , Without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, Deaton has consented to entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder, and aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder. As part of the settlement, Deaton also will be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and will pay a $240,000 civil penalty. Because Deaton already repaid his earn out bonus to Sourcecorp, plus additional costs incurred by the company, the Commission does not seek disgorgement from Deaton. , The Commissions investigation is continuing. ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19834.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

According to the Commission, in February and March 2005, Kayser altered the companys records to make it appear that the company had less unpaid inventory than was actually the case. As part of the scheme, Kayser hid unpaid invoices in her office, concealing them from the companys auditors. As a result of this conduct, Kayser caused Excelligence to report operating income for the 2004 fiscal year that was fraudulently inflated by nearly 10%. , The Commissions complaint charges Kayser with violations of the antifraud provisions of the securities laws (Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder) as well as other violations including lying to accountants (Rule 13b2-2 under the Exchange Act) and filing false certifications with the Commission (rule 13a-14 under the Exchange Act). , Simultaneously with the filing of the complaint, Kayser has agreed to settle the charges, without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations.

The Commission alleges that Doral Financial overstated income by approximately $921 million or 100 percent on a pre-tax, cumulative basis between 2000 and 2004.  The Commission further alleges that accounting irregularities enabled the company to report an apparent 28-quarter streak of record earnings and facilitated the placement of over $1 billion of debt and equity.  Since Doral Financials accounting and disclosure problems began to surface in early 2005, the market price of the companys common stock plummeted from almost $50 to under $10, thereby reducing equity market value by over $4 billion., According to the Commissions complaint, Doral Financial improperly accounted for the purported sale of non-conforming mortgage loans to other Puerto Rican financial institutions in two respects.  First, Doral Financial improperly recognized gain on sales of approximately $3.9 billion in mortgages to FirstBank Puerto Rico, a wholly owned banking subsidiary of First BanCorp.  These transactions were not true sales under generally accepted accounting standards because of oral agreements or understandings between Doral Financials former treasurer and former director emeritus and FirstBank senior management providing recourse beyond the limited recourse established in the written contracts.  Second, Doral Financial senior management significantly overvalued interest-only strips retained by the company in its mortgage loan sale transactions.  The Commission further alleges that Doral Financial managed earnings through a series of contemporaneous purchase and sale transactions with other Puerto Rican financial institutions totaling approximately $847 million., The Commissions complaint, which was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges Doral Financial with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20 13a-1 and 13a-13.

In addition, the Court granted in the Order the Commissions request, as against the defendants, for the repatriation of any offshore funds., The Commission alleges in its complaint that from as early as March 2004 through at least October 2005, Assemi, Clyman, Friedrich, and Klion (collectively, the Seaforth Principals) fraudulently raised approximately $18 million from nearly 70 - mostly elderly - investors located in several states.  The Seaforth Principals enticed investors to purchase limited partnership interests in Seaforth Meridian with offering materials and oral representations that falsely represented and omitted material information regarding investment strategies and risk of loss, the financial controls over investor funds, and the background, experience, and expertise of the Seaforth Principals.  Specifically, the Commission alleges that the Seaforth Principals misled investors about the supposed conservative nature of the Seaforth Meridian investment strategy while, in fact, sending almost 75% of the funds raised to two highly suspect, offshore funds.  The Commission also alleges that the Seaforth Principals funneled more than $600,000 to themselves without having adequately accounted for Seaforth Meridians profits or losses.

Lefford with illegal insider trading in the securities of Sports Entertainment Enterprises, Inc. (SPEA) while in possession of material, nonpublic information concerning his former employers corporate acquisition of SPEA., The Commissions complaint alleges that at the time of his unlawful insider trading, Lefford, age 44, was employed as the house manager for the South Hampton, New York residence of Robert F. X. Sillerman, a leading entertainment industry entrepreneur.  In the summer of 2004, Sillerman was in the process of acquiring a controlling interest in SPEA, then a dormant public shell company, to use it as the vehicle for acquiring and exploiting the commercial rights to Elvis Presleys name and likeness, which he was negotiating to obtain from the Presley estate.  Lefford found out about Sillermans acquisition of SPEA from one or more of the several deal-related documents that were faxed between Sillermans office in Manhattan and his South Hampton residence that summer.  Within minutes of faxing Sillermans signed authorization for the SPEA acquisition back to Sillermans office, Lefford bought 5,000 shares of SPEA stock at 12 cents per share.  The price of SPEA stock shot up by over 9,000 % after Sillermans acquisition of SPEA and the Presley deal were both announced in December 2004, and Lefford made $48,525 in total profit on his $600 investment when he later sold all his SPEA stock.  Leffords use of the confidential information he obtained about the SPEA acquisition to trade securities for his own benefit breached an express duty of trust and confidence that he owed to Sillerman under a written confidentiality agreement that covered all information that Lefford learned about, among other things, Sillermans business and financial affairs., The Commissions complaint charges Lefford with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

(USGN), a developmental stage penny stock company, its former chief executive officer, John D. Robinson, and the companys former chief financial officer, Julie E. Seaman. Robinson, age 51, of Alvarado, Texas, is alleged to have violated the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws by causing the Arlington, Texas public company to issue materially misleading press releases regarding the companys purported defense and homeland security products. The complaint also alleges that Robinson, USGN, and Seaman, age 46, of Granbury, Texas, violated the registration provisions in connection with the offer and sale of approximately 3.1 million shares of USGN common stock for approximately $1.4 million. , According to the complaint, between March 2003 and January 2004 (the relevant period), Robinson authorized USGN to issue five press releases which contained materially misleading statements about the companys supposed development and seemingly imminent sale of several products intended for defense and homeland security applications. For example, in April 2003, a press release announced that the company had received orders from two commercial airlines to purchase USGNs reinforced cockpit door. In fact, according to the complaint, the company had merely received non-binding letters of intent from the two airlines, neither of which ever resulted in actual sales by USGN. The complaint also alleges that during relevant period, USGNs common stock, which was quoted on the Over the Counter Bulletin Board and the Pink Sheets, rose in price from $0.10 or less to more than $1.22 per share on an average daily volume of approximately 1 million shares. , The complaint also alleges that during that during the relevant period, Robinson and Seaman publicly sold approximately 3.1 million shares of USGN common stock for total proceeds of approximately $1.4 million. The shares were issued to Robinson and Seaman in lieu of cash salary and were offered and sold pursuant to several Form S-8 registration statements filed with the Commission. Contrary to the provisions of Form S-8, it is alleged that the defendants utilized approximately $500,000 of the stock sale proceeds to fund the operations of USGN. Accordingly, the complaint alleges that the defendants violated the registration provisions. , USGN has consented to the entry of an order permanently enjoining it against future violations of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933.

James N. Stanard, Martin J. Merritt And Michael W. Cash</i>, (S.D.N.Y. Civ. 06 CV 7736 (GEL))</h2>, <h2>SEC Sues Three Individuals in Accounting Fraud Case</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that it filed an enforcement action in federal district court in the Southern District of New York against James N. Stanard and Martin J. Merritt, the former CEO and former controller, respectively, of RenaissanceRe Holdings Ltd. (RenRe), and also against Michael W. Cash, a former senior executive of RenRes wholly-owned subsidiary, Renaissance Reinsurance Ltd.  In its complaint filed today, the Commission alleges that Stanard, Merritt, and Cash structured and executed a sham transaction that had no economic substance and no purpose other than to smooth and defer over $26 million of RenRes earnings from 2001 to 2002 and 2003.  In partial settlement of the Commissions claims, without admitting or denying the allegations, Merritt consented to the entry of an antifraud injunction and other relief., In its complaint, the Commission alleges that Stanard, Merritt and Cash committed fraud in connection with a sham transaction that they concocted to smooth RenRes earnings.  The complaint concerns two seemingly separate, unrelated contracts that were, in fact, intertwined.  Together, the contracts created a round trip of cash.  In the first contract, RenRe purported to assign at a discount $50 million of recoverables due to RenRe under certain industry loss warranty contracts to Inter-Ocean Reinsurance Company, Ltd. in exchange for $30 million in cash, for a net transfer to Inter-Ocean of $20 million. RenRe recorded income of $30 million upon executing the assignment agreement.  The remaining $20 million of its $50 million assignment became part of a bank or cookie jar that RenRe used in later periods to bolster income., The second contract was a purported reinsurance agreement with Inter-Ocean that was, in fact, a vehicle to refund to RenRe the $20 million transferred under the assignment agreement plus the purported insurance premium paid under the reinsurance agreement.  This reinsurance agreement was a complete sham.  Not only was RenRe certain to meet the conditions for coverage; it also would receive back all of the money paid to Inter-Ocean under the agreements plus investment income earned on the money in the interim, less transactional fees and costs., RenRe accounted for the sham transaction as if it involved a real reinsurance contract that transferred risk from RenRe to Inter-Ocean, when in fact, the complaint alleges, each of these individuals knew that this was not true.  Merritt and Stanard also misrepresented or omitted certain key facts about the transaction to RenRes auditors.  As a result of RenRes accounting treatment for this transaction, RenRe materially understated income in 2001 and materially overstated income in 2002, at which time it made a claim under the reinsurance agreement.  It then received as apparent reinsurance proceeds the funds it had paid to Inter-Ocean and that Inter-Ocean held in a trust for RenRes benefit., On Feb. 22, 2005, RenRe issued a press release announcing that it would restate its financial statements for the years ended Dec. 31, 2001, 2002 and 2003.  On March 31, 2005, RenRe filed its Form 10-K for the year ended Dec. 31, 2004, which contained restated financial statements for those years.  Stanard signed and certified the Form 10-K.  Both the press release and the Form 10-K attributed the restatement of the Inter-Ocean transaction to accounting errors due to the timing of the recognition of Inter-Ocean reinsurance recoverables.  These statements were misleading.  In fact, the transaction contained no real reinsurance and the Companys restated financial statements accounted for the transaction as if it had never occurred.  In short, the entire transaction was a sham, and the Company failed to disclose that fact and misrepresented the reasons for the restatement., The Commissions complaint charges Stanard, Merritt and Cash with securities fraud in violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5(a), (b) and (c) of the Exchange Act; with violating the reporting, books-and-records and internal control provisions of Exchange Act Section 13(b)(5) and Rule 13b2-1; and with aiding and abetting RenRes violations of Exchange Act Sections 10(b), 13(a) and 13(b)(2) and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5(a), (b) and (c), 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13.  In addition, the complaint charges Stanard and Merritt with violating Exchange Act Rule 13b2-2 for making materially false statements to RenRes auditors and charges Stanard with violating Exchange Act Rule 13a-14 for certifying financial statements filed with the Commission that he knew contained materially false and misleading information.  The complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, if any, plus prejudgment interest, civil money penalties, and orders barring each defendant from acting as an officer or director of any public company., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, Merritt has consented to a partial final judgment that, upon entry by the court, will permanently enjoin him from violating or aiding or abetting future violations of the securities laws, bar him from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and defer the determination of civil penalties and disgorgement to a later date., In addition, Merritt has agreed to a Commission administrative order, based on the injunction, barring him from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant, under Rule 102(e) of the Commissions Rules of Practice.

Osterhout and Prosperity Network, Inc. d/b/a Prosperity Automated System</i>, Civil Action No 1:06-CV-2318 (N.D. Ga., filed September 27, 2006)</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it has filed a Complaint and Application for Emergency Relief in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia to halt an ongoing pyramid-scheme fraud by William M. Osterhout (Osterhout) of Citrus Heights, California and his company Prosperity Network, Inc. (PNI), also located in Citrus Heights, California.  In the Complaint, the Commission charges that, since at least July 2005, Osterhout and PNI, an entity he controls, have conducted an unregistered and fraudulent offering of securities through the sale of membership interests in the so-called Prosperity Automated System (PAS) - a supposed web-based marketing portal that Osterhout and PNI have claimed to investors will generate substantial passive income with [n]o prospecting, [n]o advertising, and [n]o selling.  In fact, PAS is nothing more than a fraudulent pyramid-scheme that is destined to collapse and leave the vast majority of investors with substantial losses.  The Complaint alleges that the defendants, using a series of approximately 25,000 interconnected PAS websites, have sold more than $15 million in PAS memberships to more than 5,000 individual investors., The Complaint further alleges that in order to purchase a PAS membership, prospective investors submit their personal information into an existing PAS website and agree to be contacted by a PAS team leader, who then directly solicits the investor.  Investors who choose to purchase PAS memberships receive the following: (1) their own unique replicated PAS website that automatically offers PAS memberships to additional prospective investors; and (2) the services of PAS team leaders to solicit new prospective investors.  The proceeds from an investors first sale of a PAS membership must be paid to an earlier investor; thereafter, PAS investors retain commissions for each subsequent sale of PAS memberships to new investors while directing part of the sales proceeds to PNI.  Although PAS can purportedly be used to market goods and services in addition to PAS memberships, PAS is designed to generate returns for existing investors based almost entirely upon the sales of new PAS memberships to downline investors.  As there are a finite number of prospective investors who could ultimately choose to invest in PAS by purchasing a membership, PAS is a pyramid-scheme that will collapse when there are no further investors, leaving the majority of downline investors with losses., The Complaint also alleges that Osterhout and PNIs conduct violated Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In the Complaint and Application for Emergency Relief, the Commission seeks a temporary restraining order, preliminary and permanent injunctions, an accounting, asset freeze, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest and civil penalties against Osterhout and PNI., The litigation remains pending as to all parties., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2006/comp19848.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19848.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The complaint further alleges that, as part of the channel stuffing scheme and to prevent imminent product returns, Cotton caused Lantronix to loan funds to a third party to purchase Lantronix product from one of its distributors.

Graycort Financial, LLC (Graycort) agreed to settle the charges by disgorging its improper trading profits and paying a $100,000 penalty., , The Commissions complaint alleges that Graycort violated Rule 105 of Regulation M, a Commission rule that prohibits covering certain short sales with shares obtained in a public offering.  Such practices are prohibited because they distort the market, potentially allowing traders to lock in profits while driving down the price of the security., , According to the complaint, Graycort violated Rule 105 on two separate occasions in 2005.  Graycort sold short the stock of public companies Nutrisystem, Inc. and Perini Corporation, and then purchased shares in the companies public offerings at prices below its previous short stock sales.  Graycort next entered into a series of offsetting stock purchase and sale transactions in the open market.  The Commission alleges that these transactions had no legitimate economic purpose or substance and served merely to disguise the fact that Graycort used offering stock to cover its short sales in violation of Rule 105.

(U.S. Gas) and four current and former principals of the company. The Commission alleges that between March 2002 and August 2003, U.S. Gas, acting through Larry Webman and Mel Webman, its undisclosed principals, Donald E. Secunda, its former chief executive officer, and Douglas W. Marcille, its then-chief financial officer, raised more than $6.8 million from investors in a series of unregistered offerings of securities. The defendants used telemarketers to offer and sell securities to approximately180 investors throughout the United States, many of whom were senior citizens. U.S. Gas is a start-up company in the business of providing natural gas to customers in the New York metropolitan area. , The Commissions complaint alleges that U.S. Gas, through the Webmans, Secunda and Marcille, made material misstatements and omissions to investors in the various offerings. More specifically, U.S. Gas, Larry Webman, Mel Webman, and Secunda misrepresented to investors in two of the offerings that U.S. Gas would register an initial public offering and that its stock would trade publicly, which would translate to generous returns for investors. In addition, they falsely represented to investors in three of the securities offerings that investors should expect to receive annual returns ranging from 25% to 50% for decades. Moreover, U.S. Gas, through the Webmans, Secunda, and Marcille, failed to disclose to investors that excessive commissions were being paid to the boiler room telemarketers out of the offering proceeds, and made misrepresentations to investors in one of the offerings regarding the amount of management fees that would be paid out. According to the complaint, Mel Webman, with the help of Larry Webman and Secunda, also misappropriated monies raised in one of the offerings. , The Commissions complaint also alleges that the proposed defendants violated the registration provisions of the federal securities laws by failing to file registration statements in connection with the offerings. The complaint further alleges that Larry Webman and Mel Webman acted as unregistered brokers of securities, and that U.S. Gas committed issuer reporting violations for failing to make required periodic filings with the Commission. , The Commissions complaint, filed in federal court in Miami, charges U.S. Gas with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Sections 10(b) and 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Rules 10b-5, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder; charges Larry Webman and Mel Webman with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; charges Secunda with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and charges Marcille with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act. , Without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, U.S. Gas, Secunda and Marcille each have consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins each from future violations of the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws. U.S. Gas also has agreed to pay disgorgement of $771,673, plus prejudgment interest thereon, of which all but $167,000 is waived based upon U.S. Gass sworn representations of its inability to pay. Secunda has also agreed to pay disgorgement and a civil money penalty in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date, and has consented to permanent officer and director, and penny stock bars. Finally, Marcille also has agreed to pay disgorgement of $1 and a civil money penalty of $40,000. , Larry Webman and Mel Webman have not settled to the Commissions action. The Commission is seeking against the Webmans permanent injunctions from future violations of the above-mentioned provisions of the securities laws, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, civil money penalties and orders barring them from participating in any offering or sale of a penny stock. , In a separate action on September 26, 2006, the Commission revoked the registration of U.S. Gass securities based on its failure to make required periodic filings with the Commission. ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19852.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

According to the complaint, Rhodes invested only $3.9 million of the funds raised from investors in securities and made a net profit of only $224,000 on the invested funds.  Undisclosed to the investors, Rhodes misappropriated and misused as much as $13.3 million of investor funds to pay his personal and business expenses and to pay $6.3 million to other investors.

Action No. SACV 06-943 JVS (ANx) (United States District Court for the Central District of California) (Judge Selna)</h2>, <h2>SEC Sues Ex-President of California Mortgage Firm For Running $30 Million Ponzi Scheme</h2>]","[On October 6, 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a settled securities fraud action in the United States District Court for the Central District of California against Salvatore Favata (Favata), the former President of National Consumer Mortgage, LLC (NCM), an Orange County, California company that purportedly brokered residential mortgages. The Commissions complaint alleges that from 2001 through 2006, Favata, acting through NCM, operated a massive Ponzi scheme, which raised more than $30 million from over 200 investors by offering rates of return from 30-60 percent on the investment. In fact, investor funds were used to pay Favatas gambling debts in excess of $10 million, personal debts and monthly living expenses, including leased luxury vehicles, lavish house parties and community music festivals. , Without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions complaint, Favata consented to the entry of final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws. Specifically, Favata consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Section 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Sections 10(b), 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Exchange Act, Favata has also consented to the entry of an administrative order permanently barring him from associating with any broker or dealer in the future. , The Commissions complaint also alleges that Favata solicited investors in face-to-face settings, including church gatherings and investment seminars and persuaded mortgage refinance clients to take cash out of their refinancing and use that cash to invest in NCM investment notes. Favata falsely told potential investors that NCM would loan investor funds to homeowners who could not qualify for traditional mortgages. Investors were also told that the return on the notes would stem from the interest NCM received on the mortgage loans. Favata further claimed that the notes were guaranteed by the real estate securing the underlying residential loans and that NCM only lends on properties that have a 65 percent or lower loan to value ratio ensuring a low default rate and the investors principal in the event of a foreclosure. Favata went so far as to represent that NCM maintained deeds of trust for the real estate securing the investments. , On the same day the Commission filed its complaint, the U.S. Attorneys office for the Central District of California filed an information and plea agreement in which Favata agrees to plead guilty to one count of mail fraud, to pay restitution in excess of $20 million, and to forfeit his residence in connection with the same scheme. Pursuant to the plea agreement, Favata faces a possible 60-month prison sentence. , The Commission would like to acknowledge the assistance and cooperation of the United States Attorney for the Central District of California, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of the United States Trustee for the Central District of California in the investigation of this matter. , <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2006/comp19861.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19861.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Markovitz, a former trader at Millennium Partners, L.P. (Millennium), a New York-based hedge fund. In October 2003, the Commission instituted partially settled administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings against Markovitz based on his late trading of mutual funds at Millennium. At that time, the Commission issued an order, with Markovitzs consent, barring him from associating with an investment adviser. , The Commissions complaint alleges that Markovitz violated the Commissions bar order. From November 2004 to May 2006, Markovitz, with two unnamed individuals, formed an offshore investment adviser, and proceeded to conduct the business of the investment adviser, including communicating and meeting with investors and prospective investors and placing buy and sell orders, from New York City, in violation of the Commissions investment adviser bar. Through this conduct, Markovitz willfully and intentionally violated (i) the order barring him from association with an investment adviser and (ii) Section 203(f) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, which prohibits persons subject to investment adviser bars from violating those bars. , Without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, Markovitz has consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating certain orders issued in the Commissions administrative proceeding and Section 203(f) of the Investment Advisers Act and ordering him to disgorge $50,000 and pay a civil penalty of $120,000. , Today, the Commission also issued an order, on consent, in its administrative proceeding against Markovitz that requires him to disgorge $1 and pay a $400,000 civil penalty for his late trading conduct. From 1999 to 2003, while employed as a hedge fund trader at Millennium, Markovitz engaged in late trading on behalf of Millennium. Late trading violates the federal securities laws related to the price at which mutual fund shares must be bought or sold and defrauds innocent investors in those mutual funds by giving to the late trader an advantage not available to other investors. Markovitz consented to the issuance of the administrative order without admitting or denying the findings therein. , For further information see Release Nos. <a href=/litigation/admin/33-8298.htm>33-8298</a> and <a href=/litigation/admin/2006/33-8748.pdf>33-8748</a>., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2006/comp19862.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19862.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The Court waived amounts of disgorgement and prejudgment interest against defendant Nancy McMichael based on her sworn representations in her Statement of Financial Condition, and did not impose civil penalties. No disgorgement or penalties were imposed against defendant James Lamar McMichael based upon his criminal conviction, incarceration and a $20 million restitution judgment in a related criminal case. The defendants consented to the entries of the judgments without admitting or denying any of the allegations of the Commissions complaint. , The complaint alleged that from October 1998 until May 2003, the defendants orchestrated, directed and controlled the fraudulent and unregistered offer and sale of approximately $33 million of securities issued by PhyMed and Healthcare Preferred to more than 500 investors in at least 23 states. According to the complaint, PhyMed developed and operated pain management clinics and Healthcare Preferred claimed to be a financial services consultant. The complaint further alleged that the defendants made misrepresentations and omissions of material fact to investors through the PhyMed securities offerings concerning the likely investments returns, the use of investor funds, and risks of the investment, among other things.

ONeal (ONeal). Pinnacle is a Georgia limited liability company with its principal place of business in Atlanta, Georgia. The complaint alleges that ONeal founded Pinnacle and serves as its managing member. The Court subsequently entered an order freezing the defendants assets, appointing a receiver for Pinnacle and investor partnerships controlled by Pinnacle, imposing a preliminary injunction against the defendants enjoining future violations of the registration and antifraud provision of the federal securities laws, and providing other relief. The defendants consented to the order without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. , The complaint alleges that, from October 2005 through the present, Pinnacle and ONeal have operated a Ponzi scheme and raised at least $30 million from more than 2,000 investors located in thirty-three states and two foreign countries. Specifically, the complaint alleges that Pinnacle fraudulently offered and sold interests in real estate development partnerships through a nationwide advertising campaign. Pinnacle also sold notes to some investors. According to the complaint, Pinnacle promised investors a 25% return in 45 (or later 60) days and a second 25% return, and the return of investor capital, after 90 days. Pinnacle represented that the profits would be earned by the respective partnership purchasing foreclosed real estate, making minor repairs and reselling the property within 45 to 60 days. In fact, without disclosure to investors, Pinnacle itself purchased property from third parties and sold it to its investor partnerships at high mark ups. The exorbitant returns promised to investors were generated by the respective partnership selling the property to other investor partnerships controlled by Pinnacle. , The Complaint alleges that the defendants have violated the registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2006/comp19864.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19864.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Lipshutz, Former Enron Vice President, Simultaneously Settles Charges</h2>]","[On October 12, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Jerry Kent Castleman, former Enron executive and accountant, and Cheryl I. Lipshutz and Kathleen M. Lynn, former Enron executives, with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and aiding and abetting Enrons violations of the reporting, record-keeping and internal controls provisions.  As alleged in the Commissions complaint, Castleman, Lynn and Lipshutz, along with others, engaged in a fraudulent transaction to manipulate Enrons publicly-reported earnings, which resulted in Enron filing materially false and misleading financial statements in the companys annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal years ended December 31, 1999 and 2000, and in the companys quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the third quarter of fiscal year 1999, the first three quarters of fiscal year 2000, and the first two quarters of fiscal year 2001., Specifically, the Commissions complaint alleges, among other things, that Enron sold an interest in a troubled power project in Cuiaba, Brazil to a related party called LJM Cayman, LP (LJM1), controlled by Enrons then Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Fastow (the selldown).  Through the selldown, Enron South America (ESA), an Enron subsidiary, deconsolidated its interest in the project and Enron recognized earnings from related gas supply contracts.  Enron and ESA needed these earnings to meet earnings estimates for the third and fourth quarters of 1999.  In conformity with relevant accounting rules, deconsolidation and recognition were not appropriate because the seller (Enron) did not transfer to the buyer (LJM1) the usual risks and rewards of ownership, in that the selldown included an oral side agreement that LJM1 would not lose money on its Cuiaba investment (the side agreement).  The side agreement was neither memorialized in the deal documents nor disclosed to Enrons auditor.  In 2001, to satisfy the side agreement, Enron bought back LJM1s interest without reversing the previously (and improperly) recognized earnings (the buyback).  In addition, Enron paid LJM1 a profit despite the poor economics of the project., As alleged in the complaint, Castleman and Lipshutz negotiated and documented the selldown, and Castleman and Lynn negotiated and documented the buyback.  The complaint alleges that the defendants knew or were reckless in not knowing of the existence of the side agreement and that it was not included in the deal documents.  They also knew, according to the complaint, that the Cuiaba project was troubled and that Enron was incurring significant costs to keep it going.  The complaint alleges that the defendants knew or were reckless in not knowing that the purpose of the selldown was to improperly deconsolidate the project and manufacture earnings from related gas supply contracts.  In early drafts of the deal documents, rejected by Enrons independent auditor, Castleman and Lipshutz attempted to structure the selldown so that LJM1 would assume no transactional risk.  Castleman and Lynn negotiated and documented the buyback in which Enron paid LJM1 a profit of over 13% for temporarily parking the interest, even though the value of the interest had decreased significantly over time due to the problems with the project.  The complaint alleges that Castleman, Lipshutz and Lynn knew or were reckless in not knowing that the side agreement violated Enrons desired accounting treatment.  According to the complaint, Castleman also concealed the undocumented side agreement from Enrons independent auditor and knew that Enron did not reverse the previously (and improperly) recognized earnings at the time of the repurchase., The complaint further alleges that by engaging in the above-described conduct, Castleman, Lynn and Lipshutz violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5 and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder, and aided and abetted Enrons violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Castleman violated Rule 13b2-2 of the Exchange Act.  The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement with prejudgment interest and penalties from each of the defendants, as well as an order barring Castleman from serving as an officer or director of a publicly-traded company., Simultaneously with the filing of the complaint, Lipshutz, without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating the identified provisions, and orders her to pay disgorgement of $20,000, prejudgment interest of $7,150 and a penalty of $25,000.  The Commission intends to have the disgorgement and civil penalty amounts paid into a court account pursuant to the Fair Fund provisions of Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 for ultimate distribution to victims of the fraud., The Commissions investigation is continuing., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2006/comp19865.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19865.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Digges represented to the salespeople, and through them to investors, that these obligations were assured, and that he would maintain a reserve fund to cover six months of monthly lease payments and a sinking fund to cover the eventual repurchase of the terminals.

(CNS) and GlaxoSmithKline plc (Glaxo).  The Commission also applied for emergency relief that included an asset freeze to prevent the defendants from removing the proceeds from sales of the options beyond the jurisdiction of the Court.  The Honorable Eduardo C. Robreno, United States District Judge, Eastern District of Pennsylvania, issued a Temporary Restraining Order freezing over $650,000 in sale proceeds and ordering the Unknown Purchasers to appear before the Court on October 20, 2006, to show cause why the Court should not enter a preliminary injunction extending the asset freeze and other ancillary relief entered in the Temporary Restraining Order until a final adjudication of the case may be made on the merits., In its complaint, the Commission alleges that the Unknown Purchasers purchased near-term, out-of-the money call option contracts for the common stock of CNS through foreign accounts held at U.S. broker-dealers.  The foreign accounts were omnibus accounts in the names of Zürcher Kantonalbank (Zurich Cantonal Bank) and Credit Suisse, and were held at U.S. broker-dealers National Financial Services LLC and Swiss-American Securities, Inc., respectively.  The Commission also alleges:, Between September 27 and October 2, 2006, Unknown Purchasers bought a total of 1186 out-of-the-money CNS call option contracts.  These purchases represented approximately 67% to 100% of the daily volume of the various CNS options series on the days purchased., The Unknown Purchasers trading coincided with key non-public and confidential events leading up to the announcement that Glaxo would acquire CNS.  Specifically, Glaxo was one of several companies contacted by investment bankers on behalf of CNS in August 2006.  After Glaxo had executed a confidentiality agreement, Glaxo was invited to submit a binding offer for CNS by September 29, which it did.  On October 2, the CNS Board met to review the offers, and Glaxo was informed that it was one of two finalists and that it should submit a best and final offer by October 4., On Monday, October 9, 2006, before the opening of the New York securities markets, CNS and Glaxo announced the execution of an agreement whereby Glaxo would acquire CNS for a price of $37.50 per share - a 31% premium over the closing price of CNS stock on Friday, October 6.  On the date of the announcement, CNS shares closed at $36.72 - a 28.5% increase over the closing price of CNS stock on Friday, October 6., On October 9 and 10, 2006, following the announcement of the merger between CNS and Glaxo, the Unknown Purchasers sold the CNS options in both accounts and realized net profits of approximately $651,895., In the pending lawsuit, the Commission alleges that the unknown defendants engaged in illegal insider trading in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5. The complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, the disgorgement of all illegal profits, and the imposition of civil monetary penalties., The Courts Temporary Restraining Order freezes the proceeds generated through the insider trading of CNS call options in the U.S. brokerage accounts.  In addition, the Order requires the Unknown Purchasers to identify themselves, provides for expedited discovery, prohibits the defendants from destroying documents, and permits alternative means of service of process., The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Chicago Board Options Exchange in the investigation of this matter.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19867.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Specifically, Riverstone improperly recognized revenues on sales transactions that involved side agreements with purchasers, under which the customers payment for Riverstone product was contingent upon resale or the purchaser was granted full return, exchange, or cancellation rights. Due to the defendants actions and omissions, the side agreements were concealed from Riverstones outside auditors. Riverstone reported almost $30 million of fraudulent revenues as a result of these contingent sales, causing revenue overstatements in four fiscal quarters ranging between 14.3 and 23.1 percent.

Strategy X is not registered and does not file reports with the Commission. According to the Commissions application and supporting papers, its staff is investigating, among other things, the basis for certain statements in Strategy X press releases and statements made about Strategy X directly to investors by persons purporting to act on behalf of the company and whether those statements were false and misleading. The investigation also concerns transactions involving large amounts of unrestricted Strategy X stock that have not been registered with the Commission. , According to the Commissions application, Lewis and Dabney are officers of Strategy X, and Nelson is a consultant who purportedly provides investor relations services to the company. On January 19, 2006, the Commission issued investigative subpoenas to Lewis and Dabney in the course of its investigation into possible violations of the antifraud and securities registration provisions of the federal securities laws. The subpoenas required Lewis and Dabney to produce documents relevant to the investigation and to appear before the Commission staff for testimony. The Commission alleges that, despite a number of postponements in order to accommodate Lewis and Dabney, as of the date of its application, they failed to produce all of the subpoenaed documents and failed to appear for testimony. The Commission further alleges that, on August 24, 2006, it issued an investigative subpoena to Nelson requiring him to produce documents relevant to the investigation and to appear for testimony. As of the date of its application, Nelson failed to produce any of the subpoenaed documents and failed to appear for testimony. According to the Commissions application, Lewis, Dabney, and Nelson have no valid justification for their failure to comply with the subpoenas, and court orders are necessary to compel them to produce the subpoenaed documents and to appear for testimony. , A hearing on the Commissions application has not yet been scheduled. ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19870.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

According to a Second Superceding Indictment filed by the USAO, from approximately March 2003 to around February 2004, Rafferty, acting as a consultant to UMDA, participated in promoting and selling its stock to potential investors.  According to the Second Superceding Indictment, Rafferty solicited investors to invest in UMDA through the use of material misrepresentations and omissions of material facts, some of which are described below., According to the Second Superceding Indictment, Rafferty conspired to commit wire fraud and committed wire fraud by causing investors to wire transfer monies in furtherance of the fraudulent scheme described above., The SEC filed its emergency action against Rafferty, Gallo, Frederick Hornick, Jr., and UMDA on March 23, 2004.  On that same day, Judge Daniel T.K. Hurley, U.S. District Judge for the Southern District of Florida, issued various emergency orders against the defendants, including temporary restraining orders, asset freezes, and other emergency relief. The SECs complaint charged UMDA, Gallo, Rafferty, and Hornick with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Hornick with violating Section 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act. Those sections and rules prohibit certain transactions in securities not registered with the Commission, prohibit fraud in the offer and sale, and in connection with the purchase and sale, of securities, and prohibit sales of securities by unlicensed brokers or dealers., Gallo and Hornick consented to a Judgment of Permanent Injunction and Other Relief (Judgments) in the SECs case, without admitting or denying the allegations of the SECs complaint.  The Judgments were entered on July 2, 2004, and June 8, 2004, respectively., On July 13, 2004, the USAO filed an indictment charging Gallo with securities fraud, wire fraud, and mail fraud, and charging Gallo and Rafferty with conspiracy to commit securities fraud. On July 26, 2004, Gallo pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud., UMDA consented to a Judgment of Permanent Injunction and Other Relief (Judgment) in the SECs case, without admitting or denying the allegations of the SECs complaint.  The Judgment, which was entered on July 7, 2005, enjoins the company from violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Additionally, the Judgment provides for disgorgement and the imposition of a civil penalty in amounts to be determined by the Court upon the SECs motion., The SEC appreciates the efforts of the United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of Florida in this matter.,  ]"

Judge Lenard entered a Final Judgment as to Defendant Donald E. Secunda on October 3, 2006, an Amended Final Judgment as to Defendant U.S. Gas &amp; Electric, Inc. (U.S. Gas) on October 13, 2006 and a Final Judgment as to Defendant Douglas W. Marcille on October 23, 2006. Defendant U.S. Gas was enjoined from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Sections 10(b) and 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Rules 10b-5, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder. The Court ordered disgorgement and prejudgment interest against U.S. Gas but waived payment of all but $167,000 and did not impose a civil penalty based on inability to pay. Defendant Secunda was enjoined from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and was ordered to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest and a civil penalty in an amount to be determined later by the Court.

The Defendants consented to the entries of the judgments against them without admitting or denying any of the allegations of the Commissions Complaint. , The Complaint alleged that between March 2002 and August 2003 U.S. Gas, acting through Secunda, the companys former chief executive officer, Marcille, its then-chief financial officer, and co-defendants Larry Webman and Mel Webman, raised more than $6.8 million from investors in a series of unregistered offerings of securities. The defendants used a boiler room of telemarketers to offer and sell securities to approximately 180 investors throughout the United States, many of whom were senior citizens. The Commissions complaint alleged that U.S. Gas, Larry Webman, Mel Webman, and Secunda misrepresented to investors in two of the offerings that U.S. Gas would register an initial public offering and that its stock would trade publicly, which would result in generous returns for investors. In addition, they falsely represented to investors in three of the securities offerings that investors should expect to receive annual returns ranging from 25% to 50% for decades. Moreover, U.S. Gas, through Secunda, Marcille, and the Webmans, failed to disclose to investors that excessive commissions were being paid to the boiler room telemarketers out of the offering proceeds, and made misrepresentations to investors in one of the offerings regarding the amount of management fees that would be paid out. According to the complaint, co-defendant Mel Webman, with the help of Secunda and Larry Webman, also misappropriated monies raised in one of the offerings. , The Commissions complaint also alleged that U.S. Gas, Secunda and Marcille violated the registration provisions of the federal securities laws by failing to file registration statements in connection with the offerings. The complaint further alleged that U.S. Gas committed issuer reporting violations by failing to make required periodic filings with the Commission. , Litigation of the charges against Larry and Mel Webman in this matter continues. ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19882.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Clark, of Edina, Minnesota, was charged with causing Health Risk Management, Inc. (HRMI) to file materially false financial statements. Clark consented to the entry of the judgment pursuant to a settlement with the Commission. , In its complaint, the Commission alleged that in August 2000, Clark negotiated a $1.85 million settlement on behalf of HRMI and its wholly owned Medicaid HMO to settle an arbitration dispute with one of the HMOs healthcare providers. According to the complaint, Clark sought to hide the full amount of the settlement expense by recasting $1.35 million of the settlement as a pre-paid retainer for consulting services. The complaint alleges that HRMI never needed the consulting services and never received them. The complaint further alleges that Clark booked the $1.35 million payment as an asset rather than as a settlement expense, causing HMRI to file materially false financial statements with the Commission for the second and third quarters of 2000. The complaint also alleges that Clark failed to inform HRMIs outside auditors about the consulting agreement and the true amount of the settlement. , Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, Clark consented to a Final Judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2, and from aiding and abetting HRMIs violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-13.

Treadway, the former top executive of the PIMCO equity mutual funds, agreed to a settlement that resolves the SECs charges against him for defrauding mutual fund investors by approving an undisclosed market timing arrangement. In June 2006, a federal court jury found Treadway liable for committing securities fraud, breaching his fiduciary duty, and other violations of the securities laws. The Commission has filed Treadways consent to final judgment with the federal district court handling this case. , During the period of his misconduct, Treadway, age 59, of New York, New York, was the CEO of PIMCO Advisors Fund Management LLC, a registered investment adviser; the CEO of PIMCO Advisors Distributors LLC, a registered broker-dealer; and the chairman of the board of trustees of the PIMCO Funds: Multi-Manager Series. , Treadway agreed to pay a total of approximately $572,000 in disgorgement, interest, and civil penalties, and to be permanently enjoined from future violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, from breaching his fiduciary duty, from making false statements in mutual fund prospectuses, and from serving as an officer or director of any registered investment company for one year. Treadway also consented to the issuance of an SEC order, based on the entry of the injunction in the federal court action, which bars him from associating with any investment adviser, with the right to reapply after one year. , Randall R. Lee, Regional Director of the SECs Pacific Regional Office in Los Angeles, said, The essence of this case is that all investors in a mutual fund -- large or small, wealthy or not -- are entitled to a level playing field. The sanctions against Stephen Treadway, on the heels of the jurys unanimous verdict finding that he betrayed the trust of ordinary investors, are a fitting culmination to our case. , The Commissions complaint, filed in May 2004, alleged that Treadway defrauded investors by approving, but not disclosing, an arrangement that allowed Canary Capital Partners LLC to market time certain of the PIMCO funds. Treadway approved this trading arrangement in approximately January 2002, before Canarys trading started, and despite knowing that the disclosures in the funds prospectus represented to investors that the funds discouraged and restricted market timing. Treadway did not disclose his knowledge of the Canary market timing deal to the board of trustees until approximately September 2003, when Canarys trading activities were being investigated by government authorities. From February 2002 to April 2003, Canary engaged in over 100 round-trip transactions in an aggregate amount of over $4 billion in several PIMCO mutual funds pursuant to the special market timing arrangement that Treadway approved. , The final judgment against Treadway, which is subject to approval by United States District Judge Victor Marrero, permanently enjoins Treadway from future violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) and Rules 10b-5(b) and 10b-5(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Section 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and Section 34(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940. Treadway is also enjoined from breaching his fiduciary duty within the meaning of Section 36(a) of the Investment Company Act. The judgment further orders Treadway to pay disgorgement of $261,215, prejudgment interest of $49,304, and a civil penalty of $261,215. , Previously, in June 2006, Kenneth W. Corba, the former chief executive officer of PIMCO Equity Advisors LLC, the investment sub-adviser for several of the PIMCO funds, settled the SECs charges before trial. In September 2004, PIMCO Advisors Fund Management LLC, PIMCO Equity Advisors LLC, and PIMCO Advisors Distributors LLC paid a total of $50 million to settle the Commissions fraud charges arising from Canarys market timing activity. ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19888.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

IShop distributed offering memoranda and other documents to investors that misrepresented, and failed to disclose, material information concerning iShops business operations.

Roberts, U.S. District Court Judge for the District of Columbia, entered Final Judgments against Hubert A. Jeffreys, Timothy F. Bell and Tracy A. Edwards for the fraudulent offer and sale of stock of Earthboard Sports USA, Inc., a privately held, Costa Mesa, California-based manufacturer of all-terrain skateboards. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, the defendants agreed to separate settlements which, among other things, prohibit Earthboard founder and president Jeffreys from serving as an officer or director of a publicly traded company and bar Bell and Edwards from association with any broker or dealer. On April 18, 2006, Jeffreys was sentenced to 41 months imprisonment and ordered to pay $2,037,900 in restitution in a parallel criminal action. , In its complaint filed February 24, 2005, the Commission alleged that between April 1998 and March 2003, Jeffreys raised approximately $5.1 million from at least 66 individuals and entities in an unregistered offering of Earthboard stock. Jeffreys, along with Bell and Edwards, two registered representatives recruited by Jeffreys to sell shares, enticed investors to purchase Earthboard shares using a number of materially false claims. Of greatest significance, they told prospective investors that Vans Inc., a Nasdaq-traded footwear company, planned to acquire Earthboard in a one-for-one share exchange that would generate a windfall of as much as $24 for each dollar invested in Earthboard stock. In reality, Vans never had any dealings of any kind with Earthboard; Jeffreys made up the acquisition in order to fraudulently induce investors to purchase Earthboard stock. The Commissions complaint furthermore alleged that Bell and Edwards misappropriated investor funds earmarked for investment in other private placement stocks. , Without affirming or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, Jeffreys consented to the entry of a Final Judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The Final Judgment also prohibits Jeffreys from serving as an officer or director of any public company. In light of Jeffreys 41 month prison sentence and order to pay $2,037,900 in restitution in the criminal case, the Final Judgment dismisses the Commissions disgorgement, prejudgment interest and penalties claims against him. See USA v. Jeffreys, Crim. Action No. 05-CR-184 (C.D. Cal.). The Commission dismissed its claims against Earthboard as it is no longer in existence. , Earthboard stock salesmen Bell and Edwards, without affirming or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, each consented to the entry of a Final Judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The Final Judgment against Bell finds him liable for disgorgement of $401,302 plus prejudgment interest of $105,918, but based on his inability to pay as documented by sworn financial statements and other documents he submitted to the Commission, orders payment of $20,000 plus post-judgment interest, waives the balance for which he is liable, and does not impose a civil penalty. Likewise, Edwards Final Judgment finds him liable for disgorgement of $91,517 plus prejudgment interest of $24,154, but based on his inability to pay as documented by sworn financial statements and other documents he submitted to the Commission, orders payment of $15,000 plus post-judgment interest, waives the balance for which he is liable, and does not impose a civil penalty.

Cal., October 30, 2006</h2>, <h2>SEC Charges Former McAfee, Inc. Financial Officer with Fraud</h2>]","[On October 30, 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against Eric G. Borrmann, a former senior financial officer for McAfee, Inc., formerly known as Network Associates, Inc.  The complaint charges that Borrmann aided and abetted a multimillion dollar financial fraud at McAfee from mid-1999 until his departure from the company in July 2000.   The complaint further charges that Borrmann traded in the securities of McAfee while in possession of material, nonpublic information concerning the financial fraud and that his profits from the illegal trading were approximately $314,517., Simultaneously with the filing of the complaint, Borrmann has consented, without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, to the entry of an order permanently enjoining him from violating, directly or indirectly, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, which are the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  Borrmann also has consented to the entry of an order that bars him for five years from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  The order further requires Borrmann to pay $757,563, consisting of $314,517 in disgorgement of his unlawful trading profits, $128,529 in prejudgment interest thereon, and a civil penalty of $314,517., The Commissions complaint alleges that mid-1999 until his departure in July 2000 Borrmann held various senior financial positions at McAfee, including serving as McAfees treasurer, and was responsible for all financial planning and investor relations at the company.  During that period, Borrmann routinely assisted other senior McAfee executives in calculating and forecasting the companys quarterly and yearly financial performance.  Through regular meetings with McAfees senior executives and managers, Borrmann learned of certain fraudulent schemes that McAfee was using during 1999 and 2000 to inflate its revenues.  In the second quarter of 2000, Borrmann assisted McAfees executives and senior managers in the preparation and dissemination to investors of false and misleading information about McAfees financial results, including its inflated revenues and earnings., The complaint further alleges that, after his resignation from McAfee, Borrmann engaged in insider trading when, during the period from July through September 2000, he sold McAfee securities while in possession of material, nonpublic information concerning the fraud and McAfees deteriorating financial condition.  Later, on December 26, 2000, after years of employing fraudulent schemes to inflate its reported revenues, McAfee stated in a press release that its sales for the fourth quarter 2000 would be only $55 million, dramatically lower than the companys earlier prediction of $245 million.  The news sent Network Associates stock price down sharply and slashed more than $1 billion from the companys market capitalization.  By trading in advance of the fourth quarter 2000 earnings announcement, Borrmann realized unlawful profits of $314,517., On October 31, 2003, McAfee restated its financial results to correct for, among other things, the fraudulent accounting and sales practices that had inflated McAfees revenue and earnings during 1998 through 2000.  Focusing on the second quarter of 2000 alone, the period during which Borrmann assisted in compiling the financial information that was relayed to investors and analysts in McAfees earnings press release and subsequent conference calls, the effect of the October 2003 restatement on McAfees financial statements was dramatic.  Revenues of $233.7 million as reported in the second quarter of 2000 earnings release were reduced to $158.6 million, a forty-seven percent overstatement.  Similarly, previously reported net income of $11.4 million was restated as a loss of $101.3 million, or a decrease of nine hundred and eighty-nine percent., The Commissions action against Borrmann is its fifth civil enforcement action related to the accounting fraud at McAfee.  Previously, the Commission filed civil actions against McAfee, Inc. (Litigation Release No. 19520), McAfees former Chief Financial Officer Prabhat Goyal (Litigation Release No. 18748), and two former Controllers Terry Davis (Litigation Release No. 18189) and Evan S. Collins (Litigation Release No. 18986)., The Commission acknowledges the assistance and cooperation of the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Northern District of California and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.,  ]"

In addition, the Commission settled with the former Chairman of Spiegels Board of Directors, Michael Otto, and a former director, Michael Crusemann, and former CEO Martin Zaepfel in connection with the decision to withhold Spiegels required financial reports to avoid issuance by its outside auditor of a going concern opinion., The Commission alleges in its complaints that Moran, Sievers, Zaepfel, Cannataro and Steele improperly increased inter-company fees between Spiegels retail subsidiaries and Spiegels bank subsidiary, which had the effect of hiding the deteriorating performance of the companys credit card receivables portfolio.  Spiegel was thus able to benefit improperly from the securitization of that portfolio., The Commission also alleged that former Directors Otto and Crusemann and former CEO Zaepfel all participated in the decision to not file Spiegels 2001 Form 10-K and first quarter 2002 Form 10-Q on a timely basis.  Prior to the deadline for the filing of the Form 10-K, Spiegels outside auditor informed the company that a going concern opinion would accompany the filing unless Spiegel was able to resolve its underlying financial problems.  When it failed to resolve those problems by the April 15, 2002 deadline, the company improperly elected to withhold its filing rather than make the required disclosures to the investing public., In light of the above, the Commission alleged that Moran, Sievers, Zaepfel, Cannataro and Steele violated Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and violated and aided and abetted violations of various books and records and financial reporting provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Judge Glasser will determine Kumars restitution obligation at a later hearing. Kumar, 44, pled guilty to eight felonies, including securities fraud, obstruction of justice, and perjury, on April 24, 2006, two weeks before a scheduled trial. Kumar admitted fraudulently inflating the quarterly revenue and earnings of Computer Associates by keeping open the companys books past quarter-ends in order to give the appearance that the company had met or exceeded quarterly revenue projections, when, in fact, Computer Associates performance had fallen short of those goals. , The indictment charged that in 1999 and 2000, under Kumars oversight and direction, over $2 billion in revenue were manipulated to prop up the price of the stock. Kumar also admitted obstructing the governments investigation by providing false explanations for the fraudulent accounting practices to the companys lawyers, with the intent that those lawyers would repeat those false explanations to the government, and by lying himself to federal investigators to conceal the fraud scheme.

The complaint further alleges that in the offerings, the offering price was usually set at a discount to the last reported sale price of the stock before the pricing of the offering. As alleged in the complaint, by short selling just prior to pricing, Solar Group often sold shares short at prices higher than the price it would later pay for the shares in the offering.

According to the Commission, Edward Ehee, 43, of Oakland, defrauded investors in the Compass West Fund, LP, Viper Founders Fund, LP and Viper Investments, LP diverting much of the money towards mortgage and car payments, vacations, and personal bank accounts. Among other things, the Commissions complaint alleges that although the Viper Founders Fund essentially ceased operations by late 2002, Ehee was continuing to raise money as recently as May 2006, using bogus account statements and phony financial reports showing millions of dollars in non-existent fund assets to lure new investments., The federal district court for the Northern District of California issued an order Wednesday morning freezing the assets of Ehee, the investment advisory firms he controls, and the funds, as well as the assets of Ehees wife, brother, and father, all of whom received thousands of dollars of investors money from Ehee., According to the Commissions complaint, Ehee told investors that their money would be placed into the funds managed by the two fund management companies he controlled, where it would be invested in accord with various securities trading strategies. In fact, according to the Commission, significant sums were obtained long after Ehee had closed the Viper Funds brokerage accounts and ceased any investment activity. Instead, Ehee converted money invested in Viper and Compass to personal use. In addition, as in a classic Ponzi scheme, Ehee used money raised from new investors to pay off previous investors. In order to conceal his fraud and induce further investments, Ehee provided investors with account statements showing that their money was safe and continuing to generate positive returns. In addition, Ehee provided one investor in early 2006 with supposedly audited financial statements showing the Viper Founders Fund held over $18 million in assets and had 10% annual returns. Yet, according to the Commission, by that time the fund was essentially defunct. Ehee even fabricated an audit opinion letter from an accounting firm that had never actually audited the fund., The Commissions Complaint, filed in federal district court in San Francisco, seeks to enjoin Ehee, Compass Fund Management, and Viper Capital Management from future violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws (Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Advisers Act). The Complaint also seeks to enjoin Ehee and Compass Fund Management from future violations of the federal securities laws governing reports filed with the Commission (Section 207 of the Advisers Act). The Commission requests that the district court order Ehee, Compass Fund Management and Viper Capital Management to disgorge their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and to impose a civil monetary penalty.

Solow, 45, a former registered representative, alleging that, during 2003, Solow engaged in a fraudulent trading scheme involving inverse floating rate collateralized mortgage obligations (inverse floaters), a highly complex, risky, and volatile type of mortgage-backed security derivative.  At that time, Solow was a registered representative associated with Archer Alexander Securities Corp. (Archer Alexander), a registered broker-dealer, and was based in Boca Raton, Florida.  The Commissions complaint further alleges that, during the same period, Solow sold inverse floaters to retail customers for whom they were unsuitable investments., According to the Commissions Complaint, Solow fraudulently evaded trading restrictions imposed on him by Archer Alexander and entered into numerous non-riskless principal transactions in which he secretly bought new issues of inverse floaters worth millions of dollars from other dealers for settlement at later dates without getting prior authorization from or informing Archer Alexanders chief executive officer.  The value of these proprietary positions far exceeded Archer Alexanders available net capital, thereby exposing the firm to substantial risk without its knowledge.  To conceal the true nature of his trades, Solow made, or caused to be made, numerous misrepresentations and omissions to Archer Alexander, including falsified trade tickets that made it appear that he had bought and sold blocks of inverse floaters on the same day, and thus on a riskless principal basis.  Archer Alexander, unaware of the actual circumstances of these transactions, paid Solow millions of dollars in compensation during 2003 for inverse floater trades that he carried out pursuant to this fraudulent scheme., The Commissions complaint further alleges that during 2003 Solow sold inverse floaters to retail customers with conservative to moderate investment objectives for whom they were unsuitable investments, and made material misrepresentations and omissions to these customers when doing so., The Commissions complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, alleges that by engaging in this conduct, Solow violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities law, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.

Without admitting or denying the allegations of civil contempt made by the Securities and Exchange Commission, Jones consented to the entry of the finding of civil contempt. To purge his contempt, Jones agreed to an amended preliminary injunction with a broader prohibition of conduct. In particular, Jones is permanently enjoined from any involvement in, or conduct facilitating or relating in any way to, investing or soliciting investment in any program purporting to involve coal or a coal mine operation, an international gold transaction, or an international banking transaction, with or from any participant, officer, director, or investor in Tri Energy Inc., H&amp;J Energy Inc., La Vie DArgent, Global Village Records, or Marina Investors Group, Inc., The contempt finding was based upon the SECs evidence that, after the Court entered a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, Jones continued to solicit and obtain money from investors in an ongoing affinity fraud and Ponzi scheme involving Tri Energy, Inc. According to the evidence, Jones established a new business called Global Village Records (GVR) in May of 2005. GVR appeared to be operating in place of Jones other businesses Marina Investors Group, Inc. and MIG Records, whose accounts were subject to an asset freeze due to the fraud. According to the evidence, Jones opened a new bank account in the name of GVR, which he used to receive additional funds from Tri Energy investors. The evidence also shows that Jones caused at least $500,000 from a Tri-Energy investor to be sent to one of Jones performers under the pretense that the performer was really an attorney for the gold transaction., The SECs complaint alleges that the gold transaction was a fraud that Jones and others used to defraud hundreds of investors of over $50 million by promising returns of 100% or more within 60 days. The SECs complaint alleges that Jones and other have been telling investors that these extraordinary profits were to be generated in part by helping an unnamed Saudi Arabian prince move gold from Israel through Luxembourg to the United Arab Emirates. In reality, according to the Complaint, although some money has been paid out to investors, these funds appear to have come from new investor money, and substantial amounts of investor funds have been transferred to bank accounts controlled by the proposed defendants and relief defendants. Defendants have characterized the purported gold transaction to religiously devout investors as deistically inspired and divinely guided., For their roles in the alleged scheme, the SEC charged Jones and the other defendants with violations of Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and violations of, and aiding and abetting violations of, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Shortly thereafter, the shell company changed its name to World Information Technology, Inc., issued more than 13.8 million shares to entities controlled by Morgans Group, and appointed Morgan as its CEO and Chairman. In order to increase the price of World Information stock, Morgan made false and misleading statements in public filings and press releases about World Information. For example, Morgan falsely stated that World Information had received a firm commitment for $20 million in funding. Morgans false and misleading statements significantly increased World Informations stock price. For example, World Informations stock price increased from an average price of $2.245 to $4.527 per share following Morgans interview with an on-line marketing firm in which he made false statements about World Informations funding. Morgan also failed to disclose his beneficial ownership and control of World Information stock. In order to create demand for World Information stock, Morgan arranged to pay brokers kickbacks to sell World Information stock to customers. Morgan paid Dicapua, a consultant engaged to promote securities among brokers, approximately $117,500. Dicapua then paid Sirianni, a stock broker for a registered broker-dealer, approximately $75,800 to solicit purchases of World Information stock from his customers and to purchase shares in his own account.

Richards, 41, pled guilty to eight felonies, including securities fraud, obstruction of justice, and perjury, on April 24, 2006, two weeks before a scheduled trial. Richards admitted fraudulently inflating the quarterly revenue and earnings of Computer Associates by keeping open the companys books past quarter-ends in order to give the appearance that the company had met or exceeded quarterly revenue projections, when, in fact, Computer Associates performance had fallen short of those goals. , The indictment charged that in 1999 and 2000, with Richards participation, over $2 billion in revenue were manipulated to prop up the price of the stock. Richards also admitted to committing perjury during subpoenaed testimony before the Commission staff to conceal the fraud scheme. Richards co-defendant, Sanjay Kumar, Computer Associates former Chairman and CEO, also pled guilty to eight felonies on April 24, 2006, and was sentenced by Judge Glasser on November 2, 2006, to serve 12 years and pay an $8 million fine. Five other of Richards co-conspirators previously entered guilty pleas, agreed to cooperate with the prosecution and are awaiting sentencing: David Kaplan, David Rivard, Lloyd Silverstein, Steven Woghin and Ira Zar. , The Commission previously filed civil injunctive actions against Richards, the above-named former Computer Associates executives and Computer Associates itself.

Willey also agreed to a five years bar from serving as an officer and director of a public company., The Commissions complaint, which was filed with the United States District Court for the District of Columbia in July 2004, charged Willey with insider trading in the securities of Capital One.  According to the complaint, the examiner in charge of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors examination of Capital One advised Willey in April 2002 that the Fed was likely to downgrade Capital Ones supervisory assessment, and that such a downgrade would result in some form of supervisory action including a possible Memorandum of Understanding (MOU).  The complaint alleges that, without informing other members of senior management or the Capital One Board of Directors of this material information, Willey engaged in a series of transactions in Capital One stock and options in May 2002 and obtained substantial profits.  Shortly thereafter, the Fed informed other senior officials at the bank of its intentions and a trading ban was put in place.  The Fed finalized its supervisory assessment of Capital One in July 2002, determining that it would require an MOU as its supervisory action.  On July 16, 2002, after the market closed, Capital One issued a press release announcing the MOU.  Capital Ones stock price plummeted 40% after the disclosure., Without admitting or denying the allegations, Willey has agreed to settle the Commissions enforcement action by consenting to a final judgment that imposes a permanent injunction prohibiting him from violating Sections 10(b) and 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 16a-3 thereunder, ordering that he pay $801,434 disgorgement plus $218,180 in prejudgment interest and an insider trading penalty of $801,434, and imposing a five year officer and director bar.

The indictment charges that McNaughton raised at least $17 million from approximately 200 investors through the sale of unregistered securities in the form of notes under the name of The Haven Equity Company. The indictment further charges that McNaughton fraudulently guaranteed an annual return of 10% to 35% on the investment and told investors that they would receive their returns in the form of monthly interest payments. According to the indictment, McNaughton also told investors that he would send their money to a trader and friend in Ontario, Canada, who would use a trading strategy to generate the guaranteed returns. However, rather than investing the funds, McNaughton used investor funds to, among other things, pay purported interest and principal to existing investors and pay his personal expenses., On June 23, 2004, the Commission filed a Complaint against McNaughton and obtained a temporary restraining order and asset freeze against him.

The Court ordered civil money penalties, disgorgement, and prejudgment interest against each of the Webmans in amounts to be determined later by the Court. The Court also ordered penny stock bars against each Defendant., The complaint in this matter alleged that between March 2002 and August 2003 U.S. Gas, acting through Larry Webman, Melvin Webman, and the other co-defendants, raised more than $6.8 million from investors in a series of unregistered offerings of securities. The Defendants used a boiler room of telemarketers to offer and sell securities to approximately 180 investors throughout the United States, many of whom were senior citizens. The complaint alleged that U.S. Gas, Larry Webman, Melvin Webman, and others misrepresented to investors in two of the offerings that U.S. Gas would register an initial public offering and that its stock would trade publicly, which would result in generous returns for investors. In addition, they falsely represented to investors in three of the securities offerings that investors should expect to receive annual returns ranging from 25% to 50% for decades. Moreover, U.S. Gas, through the Webmans and others, failed to disclose to investors that excessive commissions were being paid to the boiler room telemarketers out of the offering proceeds, and made misrepresentations to investors in one of the offerings regarding the amount of management fees that would be paid out. According to the complaint, Melvin Webman, with the help of Larry Webman, also misappropriated monies raised in one of the offerings., In addition to alleging antifraud charges, the Commissions complaint also alleged that Larry and Melvin Webman violated the registration provisions of the federal securities laws by failing to file registration statements in connection with the offerings.

Dawson, the president and sole shareholder of BMG and Ethan Thomas, targeted primarily elderly investors living on Long Island, and advised these clients to surrender existing variable annuity policies, mortgage their residences, and transfer the proceeds to Ethan Thomas for Dawson to manage through BMG, his investment advisory firm. In connection with Dawsons advisory services, Dawson made materially false and misleading statements to his clients about their investments and the use of their funds. Dawson promised between a 12 and 15 percent guaranteed return on each investment, and he assured clients that he would arrange to pay their mortgages and/or pay monthly returns on the investments. To the extent that the 12 to 15 percent return exceeded the clients mortgage obligation, Dawson promised that excess return would be accrued in the clients account. As recently as October 25, 2006, Dawson (through BMG) assured investors in writing that their accounts contained a certified balance of the initial funds entrusted to him plus the guaranteed interest. Rather than investing the money as promised, Dawson abused his clients trust and misappropriated, and is continuing to misappropriate, their funds for his own use. Dawson withdrew over $100,000 of his clients funds for his own benefit. At the same time, Dawson failed to make investors mortgage payments as he had promised. During the past month, because some investors received notices that their mortgages were not being paid, they complained to Dawson, who has since refused to return their calls and closed BMGs office., The Complaint charges the Defendants with violating Section 17 (a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Papa was the chief executive officer, chief financial officer, secretary, and/or chairman of the board of directors of Papa Holdings and certain restaurant subsidiaries. Papa acknowledged that a large portion of the money raised to open new restaurants was instead transferred to operating subsidiaries to fund operations at existing restaurants, which were losing money. In the plea agreement, Papa also admitted that he misled investors about the amount of commissions paid on stock sales, the financial health of his companies, and the security of the investment., The Commissions complaint alleged that from November 1995 to January 1999, Papa and Papa Holdings raised over $21 million from about 1,300 investors in several unregistered stock offerings for Papa Holdings and four restaurants subsidiaries. According to the Commissions complaint, Papa and Papa Holdings failed to disclose sales commissions of 30% to 48% and misrepresented that money from the restaurant subsidiaries offerings would be used to develop open new restaurants, when in fact the money was used to pay for losses at existing restaurants.

According to the Commission’s complaint, in furtherance of the scheme, the Defendants:  (i) caused China Energy to purchase Starway at an excessive price to facilitate the issuance of large quantities of China Energy shares to entities controlled by Chiu; (ii) caused China Energy to obtain a NMS listing by artificially creating a shareholder base and falsely representing to Nasdaq that the company had met its minimum shareholder requirement; (iii) issued false press releases concerning China Energy’s NMS listing; (iv) created artificial demand for China Energy stock by engaging in manipulative trading and entering into secret deals to give free China Energy stock to shareholders willing to purchase China Energy in the open market; and (v) concealed the fact that Chiu controlled both the company and the company’s public float. , In addition, according to the Commission’s complaint, China Energy, Chiu, and others engaged in illegal unregistered sales by gifting shares to more than 400 persons as part of the fraudulent Nasdaq listing scheme and by improperly issuing S-8 stock to promoters engaged in capital raising activities and consultants who performed no services., The Commissions complaint charges China Energy, Chiu, Sim, J. Zhao, Li, and New Solomon with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, charges China Energy, Chiu, Sim, and J. Zhao with violating Sections 5(a) and (c) of the Securities Act of 1933, and seeks permanent injunctions prohibiting future violations of the securities laws, disgorgement, and civil penalties.  With respect to Chiu, Sim, J.

The Commission alleges that these accounts realized millions in proceeds from the fraudulent scheme by receiving and selling thousands of shares of China Energy stock., For prior Commission actions related to this matter, see Release Nos. 34-53839 (May 19, 2006) (suspending trading in China Energy’s securities); 34-54503A (September 26, 2006) <a name=P12_4001></a>(suspending trading in China Energy’s securities), and 34-54502 (September 26, 2006) (instituting administrative proceedings against China Energy pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Exchange Act to determine whether to revoke or suspend China Energy’s securities due to its failure to make periodic filings)., The Commission would like to acknowledge the assistance afforded by the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission in this matter.

Baer, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Health Enhancement Products, Inc. (HEPI), a nutraceutical company based in Tempe, Arizona, and Howard Baers son, Kevin C. Baer, a former Executive Vice President of HEPI., In the complaint, the Commission named the following defendants:, In its complaint, the Commission alleges the following. In the fall of 2003, Howard Baer obtained control over a majority of the common stock of HEPI and became HEPIs CEO. Howard Baer, with the assistance of Kevin Baer, then disseminated materially misleading information about HEPI and the companys primary product, ProAlgaZyme, a purported natural dietary supplement, in press releases and the companys annual, quarterly, and current public filings. For instance, in a January 20, 2004 press release, HEPI announced that the biochemistry department of Arizona State University (ASU) had conducted an independent study that concluded that . . . ProAlgaZyme . . . possesses fibrinolytic properties, required in the breakdown of pathological fibrin gel, thus decreasing the risk of a stroke or heart attack. This representation was false. In fact, the ASU scientists did not conclude that ProAlgaZyme reduced the risk of a stroke or heart attack., While HEPI was issuing these misleading press releases, Howard Baer executed numerous trades in the companys stock to ensure that the price and trading volume increased. HEPIs stock price increased from approximately $0.01 per share in October 2003 to $7.54 per share in February 2004. Howard Baer profited from his fraudulent conduct. During the relevant period, Howard Baer sold over 390,000 shares of HEPI stock, primarily in an account in his wifes name, for proceeds of more than $1,349,000., The Commission also announced that on November 29, 2006, the United States District Court for the District of Arizona entered final judgments against Howard Baer and Kevin Baer on their consent. The final judgments permanently enjoin Howard Baer and Kevin Baer from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5. The final judgment also permanently enjoins Howard Baer from violating Rule 13a-14 of the Exchange Act, and from aiding and abetting violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13. In addition, the final judgments direct Howard Baer to pay disgorgement of $1,349,592.81 plus prejudgment interest of $88,734.60, and direct Howard Baer to pay a civil penalty of $120,000 and Kevin Baer to pay a civil penalty of $25,000. Further, the final judgments prohibit Howard Baer from acting as an officer or director of any public company, and bar Kevin Baer from serving as an officer or director for five years. Finally, the final judgment as to Howard Baer prohibits him from participating in the offering of a penny stock. Howard Baer and Kevin Baer consented to the final judgments without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint., Additionally, on December 4, 2006, the Commission instituted a settled cease-and-desist proceeding against HEPI. In the cease-and-desist proceeding, the Commission finds that HEPI issued a number of materially misleading press releases, and made materially false statements (and omissions) in its public filings, as part of a fraudulent scheme to inflate HEPIs stock price. The Commission simultaneously settled these proceedings against HEPI. HEPI consented to the entry of an Order, without admitting or denying its findings, ordering HEPI to cease and desist from violating Sections 10(b) and 13(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2006/comp19936.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19936.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Vinson, a Fort Worth attorney, and Clyde R. Parks, a Dallas attorney, for their roles in a fraudulent scheme involving the common stock of Moliris Corp. (Moliris), now known as Digifonica International, Corp. Vinson, who was enjoined in a previous SEC action (See L.R. 17011, May 21, 2001), has consented to full relief., According to the SECs complaint, after Vinson and Parks gained control of Moliris in October 2003, then a dormant public shell, Vinson embarked upon a scheme to enrich himself at the expense of Moliriss shareholders. The SEC alleges in its complaint that Vinson publicly represented, and fostered the impression, that he had transferred his ownership in Moliris to Parks  Vinsons personal lawyer and periodic business partner  resigned as president and a director of Moliris, and installed Parks as Moliriss chief executive officer, when, in fact, neither Vinson nor Parks had carried through on any of these actions. According to the complaint, Vinsons aim in orchestrating the scheme was to benefit from an artificially inflated price for Moliris stock, and that to secure that benefit, Vinson concealed his continuing control of Moliris, his SEC disciplinary background and his prior bankruptcies. Specifically, the SEC alleges that Vinson was responsible for Moliriss filing Commission reports and issuing press releases that fraudulently concealed his control of the company and fraudulently inflated Moliriss business prospects, and that Vinson provided false and misleading information to market makers to induce them to quote Moliriss stock on the OTC Bulletin Board., According to the complaint, Parks, in contrast, had little or no involvement with Moliris other than his signing and certifying, through August 2005, each of Moliriss Commission filings. The SEC alleges that the scheme enabled Vinson to misappropriate funds from Moliriss bank accounts, and facilitated Vinsons and Parkss unjust enrichment upon sales of their Moliris stock., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Vinson consented to a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder, and from aiding or abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13, imposing on him an officer-and-director bar and a penny stock bar, and directing him to pay disgorgement of $200,597, plus $29,321 in prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $200,000. Vinson also consented to the issuance of a Commission order pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the Commissions Rules of Practice, suspending Vinson from appearing or practicing before the Commission., The SEC alleges in its complaint that Parks violated Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder, and aided and abetted violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.

During the relevant time period, the defendants failed to inform the public about the material changes to the ID/IQ contract, failed to correct prior false statements, and continued to misrepresent the contract by asserting that it was in full force and effect and worth C$200 million. Only after a new CEO took over at BEI did the true facts come to light, which were disclosed in a July 2004 press release., The SECs complaint charges BEI with violating Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-16 thereunder. The complaint charges the individual defendants with violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and aiding and abetting the companys violations. In addition, the complaint charges Stern with violating Exchange Act Rule 13a-14 for certifying a false and misleading report filed by BEI pursuant to Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002., BEI, Bennett, and Griffiths, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, each consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining them from violating or aiding and abetting violations of the provisions they allegedly violated. Bennett agreed to pay a $120,000 civil penalty, Griffiths agreed to pay a $50,000 civil penalty, and both Bennett and Stern agreed to be barred from acting as an officer or director of a public company for a period of ten years., The SEC staff gratefully acknowledges the assistance of the Ontario Securities Commission, the Environmental Protection Agencys Office of the Inspector General and the Army Corps of Engineers in the investigation of the facts leading to this action.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19943.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

(PEC), a Fairfax, Virginia based government information technology services entity., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint Lloyd, Udler, and Miller consented to entry of a final judgment which imposes permanent injunctions, disgorgement, with prejudgment interest and civil penalties against each defendant., The Commissions complaint alleges:, Lloyd, Udler, and Miller engaged in two separate instances of insider trading in PEC securities. On March 13, 2003 PEC announced that it expected reduced financial results for the first quarter 2003 and the year ending December 31, 2003 (the March 2003 Announcement).

Pursuant to the Order, and without admitting or denying the findings contained therein, except those findings specifically identified in the Order, Smith has consented to a 12 month suspension prohibiting him from associating or seeking to become associated with any investment adviser., The Commissions complaint alleges that officers and principals of AIM, including Smith, leveraged client assets in violation of investment advisory agreements by purchasing derivatives that caused excessive leverage without client knowledge, and then concealing the unauthorized trading in client accounts.  As a result of the fraud, the complaint further alleges that clients suffered more than $415 million in losses, when, as the market steadily declined through the spring and early summer 2002, the portfolios began underperforming the S&amp;P 500, Smith and other officers and principals escalated their use of leverage in a failed attempt to recover lost performance.

The Complaint alleges that Franklin set up an internet website, Red Hot Stocks, to tout stocks that he would acquire cheaply (through private offerings, open market purchases and consulting fees). According to the Complaint, Franklin then sold those shares after their price increased following overly optimistic and misleading profiles on the companies which appeared on the Red Hot Stocks website. The Complaint alleges that Wolanyk operated Red Hot Stocks, authored and distributed the profiles and also owned and sold some of the stocks that were touted.

The Commission alleges that, between August 28 and October 13, 2006, Grand Logistic and Gashichev made $353,609 in unlawful profits by conducting at least 25 separate manipulations, involving the securities of at least 21 companies., Acting on the Commissions request, the Court today issued a temporary restraining order which, among other things, freezes the defendants assets and orders the repatriation of funds taken out of the United States., The Commissions complaint alleges that, to effect his pump and dump manipulations, Gashichev purchased shares of small, thinly-traded companies, with low share prices, through an online trading account he opened in the name of Grand Logistic at an Estonian financial services firm that has an omnibus account at a U.S. broker-dealer through which the defendants traded. Often within minutes of the purchase, Gashichev used electronically stolen usernames and passwords to gain unauthorized Internet access to one or more online brokerage accounts (the intruded accounts) for the sole purpose of pumping up the price of the stock he had just purchased at lower prices. He also used electronic means to hide his identity, and mask the means by which he intruded into accounts., The complaint further alleges that, without the knowledge or consent of the victimized accountholders, and using the victims own funds, Gashichev placed orders through these intruded accounts to purchase large blocks of the same stock at artificially inflated prices  often many times the volume of his initial purchases. These purchases created buying pressure and the false appearance of legitimate trading activity, which caused the price of the stock to greatly increase. Gashichev then sold, at a profit, the shares he had earlier purchased in the Grand Logistic account. The share prices of the manipulated stocks invariably fell sharply, and the victims suffered losses in their accounts., The Commissions complaint alleges that the defendants violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and, as permanent relief, seeks permanent injunctions against future violations, disgorgement of all ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties., The SECs Office of Investor Education and Assistance has issued an investor alert, which is available on the SECs website, that provides tips for avoiding becoming a victim of an intrusion.

(FBR), a registered broker-dealer, in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that FBR, in connection with a Private Investment in Public Equity (PIPE) offering:  (i) failed to establish, maintain and enforce policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent the misuse of material, nonpublic information; (ii) unlawfully traded while aware of material, nonpublic information; and (iii) conducted unregistered sales of securities., The Commissions complaint alleges that in September 2001, FBR entered into an investment banking relationship with CompuDyne Corporation (CompuDyne) whereby FBR agreed to serve as placement agent for a PIPE offering by CompuDyne.  FBRs policies and procedures regarding the handling of material, nonpublic information were not appropriately tailored to the nature of FBRs business, in connection with serving as a placement agent for a PIPE offering, and were not enforced by FBR, its former Co-Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer, Emanuel Friedman, or its former Director of Compliance, Nicholas Nichols, during the CompuDyne PIPE offering.  These deficiencies in FBRs policies and procedures contributed to FBRs misuse of material, nonpublic information.  In particular, FBR engaged in unlawful insider trading by selling short CompuDyne securities in FBRs market making account while aware of material, nonpublic information regarding the PIPE offering and prior to its public announcement.  FBR and Friedman also conducted unregistered sales of securities in connection with the PIPE offering.  In particular, FBRs head trader, consistent with Friedmans prior trading directions, bought and sold short CompuDyne securities in its market making account when there was not a resale registration statement in effect for the PIPE shares and covered its net short position with CompuDyne shares FBR bought from its own customers, who purchased their shares in the PIPE offering., The complaint further alleges that FBR profited by $343,773 as a result of its improper trading in its market making account before the public announcement of the PIPE offering.  FBR profited by an additional $97,831 as a result of its unregistered sales of securities relating to the PIPE offering.  FBR further profited from the underwriting fee of $1,764,000 that CompuDyne paid to FBR for its placement agent services., The Commissions complaint also alleges that FBRs short selling of CompuDyne shares prior to the public announcement of the PIPE offering violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, pursuant to Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, Friedman is liable as a controlling person for FBRs violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5.  The complaint also alleges that FBR violated Section 15(f) of the Exchange Act by failing to establish, maintain and enforce policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent the misuse of material, nonpublic information.  The complaint alleges that, pursuant to Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, Friedman and Nichols are liable as controlling persons for FBRs violations of Section 15(f) of the Exchange Act.  The complaint further alleges that FBR and Friedman violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act by short selling CompuDyne shares prior to the effective date of the resale registration statement for the PIPE shares and covering those short sales with the shares they purchased from FBRs customers, who acquired their shares in the PIPE offering., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, FBR consented to the entry of a final judgment, subject to the courts approval, in which it is:  permanently enjoined from further violations of Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act and Sections 10(b) and 15(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and ordered to pay disgorgement of its trading profits and placement agent fees, plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties totaling $3,755,839.

The complaint alleges that Yarick violated or aided and abetted violations of the anti-fraud, record-keeping, internal controls and reporting provisions of the federal securities laws by misleading IBC investors about the adequacy of the companys workers compensation reserves and, consequently, the companys earnings., According to the SECs complaint, related to IBCs fiscal 2004 second and third quarters, Yarick disregarded workers compensation liabilities estimates provided by IBCs insurance consultant, on which IBC historically had relied to set its workers compensation reserve.  Instead, Yarick used obsolete information that he had been advised was unreliable to set IBCs quarterly workers compensation reserve for these quarters.  Accordingly, IBC failed to account for its workers compensation reserve in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.  The complaint further alleges that, as a result of Yaricks conduct, IBC filed financial statements in its Forms 10-Q for the fiscal 2004 second and third quarters that understated IBCs reserves by at least $30 million.  Consequently, IBC materially overstated its pre-tax income in its Form 10-Q for the period ended November 15, 2003, and its cumulative fiscal third quarter pre-tax income in its Form 10-Q for the period ended March 6, 2004., Yarick, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, consented to the entry of a permanent injunction by the United States District Court enjoining him from violating Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, 13b2-1, 13b2-2 thereunder and aiding and abetting violations of Sections13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 12b-20, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder.

In reality, however, Credit First was not profitable, and the defendants were making monthly returns of capital to investors., Lund, without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the antifraud and securities registration provisions of the federal securities laws (Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder).  Lund also agreed to disgorge his ill-gotten gains from the Credit First offerings in the amount of $309,170, to pay prejudgment interest in the amount of $11,809.71, and to pay a $120,000 civil penalty.  Previously, on February 13, 2006, the Court appointed a permanent receiver over the entity defendants.  Pursuant to the judgment entered against Lund, he will turn over all of his ill-gotten gains to the court-appointed Receiver.  The Commission moved the court to establish a Fair Fund pursuant to Section 308 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and to include Lunds penalty in that Fund to be paid to and managed by the court-appointed Receiver., On December 20, 2006, the Commission also issued an Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (Order) against Lund.  The Order bars Lund from association with any broker or dealer with the right to reapply after five years.  Lund consented to the Order without admitting or denying any of the allegations in the civil injunctive action., The Commissions case is pending against the company defendants., For more information see <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr19497.htm>LR-19497</a>, (December 16, 2005); <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr19565.htm>LR-19565</a>, (February 15, 2006).,  ]"

Power and Edward Federman, two former executives of Tyco International Ltd. The Commissions complaint alleges that Power and Federman designed and implemented fraudulent accounting practices at Tyco and thereby violated the antifraud and record-keeping provisions of the federal securities laws and aided and abetted Tycos violations of the antifraud, reporting, and record-keeping provisions. The complaint alleges that Richard J. Skip Heger, a third former Tyco executive, violated the record-keeping provisions of the federal securities laws and aided and abetted Tycos violations of the reporting and record-keeping provisions., The Commissions complaint alleges that Power and Federman inflated Tycos operating income by hundreds of millions of dollars through the use of a sham transaction. In that transaction, Tyco charged authorized dealers of Tycos ADT Security Services, Inc. (ADT) subsidiary a dealer connection fee whenever the company purchased security monitoring contracts from them. However, the connection fee was fully offset by a simultaneous increase in the purchase price ADT allocated to the dealers security monitoring contracts. Thus, the transaction lacked economic substance. No additional money changed hands as a result of the dealer connection fee transaction. The sham transaction was designed by Power immediately following Tycos 1997 merger with ADT Ltd. Federman subsequently defended the transaction when concerns were raised in meetings with Tycos independent accountant. His defense was successful, and the income inflation from the transaction continued unabated. The complaint alleges that the transaction inflated Tycos operating income by $567 million from the companys fiscal year 1998 through its fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2002., The complaint alleges that Power and Federman further inflated Tycos operating income by means of fraudulent acquisition accounting, including the pre-acquisition reduction of asset valuations and overstatement of liabilities in connection with several of Tycos most significant business acquisitions. In addition, Federman engaged in the improper use of accounting reserves to enhance Tycos reported financial results, directing the reversal of reserves at Tycos fiscal year-end to offset an unanticipated $40 million compensation expense., Heger was responsible for the financial results of the Tyco division that included the companys security monitoring business. He approved division financial results that he knew, or was reckless in not knowing, had been inflated by the sham transaction and improper acquisition accounting and that had been enhanced or smoothed by the improper use of reserves., The complaint alleges that Power and Federman violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder, and aided and abetted Tycos violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder. The complaint alleges that Heger violated Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1 and aided and abetted Tycos violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder. The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement with prejudgment interest thereon, and penalties from each of the defendants, as well as an order barring Power and Federman from serving as an officer or director of a public company., Heger, without admitting or denying the complaints allegations, has consented to the entry of a proposed final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1 and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder, and ordering him to pay disgorgement of $300,000, prejudgment interest of $100,000, and a penalty of $50,000. The Commission intends to have any disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and penalty amounts paid into a court account pursuant to the Fair Fund provisions of Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, for ultimate distribution to victims of the fraud., See Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17722.htm>17722</a> / September 12, 2002; Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17896.htm>17896</a> / December 17, 2002; Exchange Act Release No. <a href=/litigation/admin/34-48328.htm>48328</a> / August 13, 2003; Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19657.htm>19657</a> / April 17, 2006; Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19678.htm>19678</a> / May 1, 2006., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2006/comp19953.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19953.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Velasco, a former broker at Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. (DBSI), alleging that he and his customers deceptively market timed mutual funds., The Commission named the following defendant: , In its complaint, the Commission alleges the following. Velasco defrauded mutual funds by engaging in deceptive market timing. Specifically, from approximately March 2003 through September 2003, Velasco utilized deceptive practices to circumvent mutual funds restrictions on his market timing customers trading. For example, various mutual funds identified Velascos customers as market timers, and then rejected the customers trades. In response, Velasco opened new accounts for the customers, who then used the new accounts to continue market timing the same mutual funds that had previously rejected the customers trades. Through this conduct, Velasco concealed the true identity of his customers and misled mutual funds into believing that the subsequent trades were for different DBSI customers whose trading had not been blocked. Velasco earned significant commissions from his customers who engaged in market timing. At the same time, these customers market timing trading harmed the mutual funds in which they traded., The complaint seeks a final judgment permanently enjoining Velasco from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5, as well as disgorgement of his ill-gotten gains and prejudgment interest, and the imposition of civil monetary penalties. Velasco has consented to the entry of a final judgment in this action, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint., In a related matter, on December 21, 2006, the Commission instituted a settled administrative and cease-and-desist proceeding against DBSI finding that it failed to supervise Velasco, and that it permitted one customer to engage in late trading in mutual funds., The Commission would like to acknowledge the assistance of the New York Attorney General in this matter., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2006/comp19954.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>; <a href=/litigation/admin/2006/34-54993.pdf>Administrative Proceeding No. 34-54993</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19954.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Mangan, Jr.</i>, Civil Action No. 06-CV-531 (W.D.N.C.)</h2>, <h2>SEC Charges Former Registered Representative and Hedge Fund Manager John F. Mangan, Jr., With Unlawful Insider Trading and Unregistered Sales of Securities in Connection With CompuDyne Pipe Offering</h2>]","[On December 28, 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) filed a complaint against John F. Mangan, Jr. (Mangan) in the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina alleging that Mangan committed unlawful insider trading by short selling securities of CompuDyne Corporation prior to the public announcement of a private investment in public equity (PIPE) offering. The complaint also alleges that Mangan engaged in unregistered sales of securities. At the time of the relevant conduct, Mangan was a registered representative of Friedman, Billings, Ramsey &amp; Co., Inc. (FBR), a registered broker-dealer and the placement agent for the PIPE offering. Mangan executed his alleged illegal trades through the account of HLM Securities, LLC (HLM), which was an account of his business partner, Hugh L. McColl, III (McColl III)., The Commissions complaint alleges that in the fall of 2001, Mangan, on the basis of material, nonpublic information concerning the PIPE offering, and in breach of duties of trust and confidence, traded in CompuDyne stock in advance of the public announcement of the CompuDyne PIPE offering and its terms. As a result of his unlawful insider trading, Mangan reaped $56,937 in ill-gotten gains., The complaint further alleges that after the public announcement of the PIPE offering, Mangan continued short selling CompuDyne stock. After the resale registration statement became effective, Mangan used the shares that HLM obtained in the PIPE offering to cover all of the short sales. By short selling CompuDyne securities before the effective date of the resale registration statement for the CompuDyne PIPE shares, and covering the short sales with the shares HLM received from the PIPE offering, Mangan effectively sold HLMs PIPE shares prior to their registration. As a result of Mangans unregistered sales of CompuDyne stock, he obtained an additional $121,933 in ill-gotten gains. Mangan split the profits he earned from his improper trading with McColl III., The Commissions complaint alleges that Mangans short selling of CompuDyne shares prior to the public announcement of the PIPE offering violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint further alleges that Mangan violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act by short selling CompuDyne shares prior to the effective date of the resale registration statement for the PIPE shares and covering those short sales with the shares HLM purchased in the PIPE offering. The complaint also alleges that the Commission has named McColl III solely as a relief defendant in that action, in connection with his receipt of trading profits from Mangan., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, McColl III has consented to the entry of a final order, subject to the courts approval, requiring McColl III, solely as a relief defendant, to pay a total of $115,643., The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the NASD with respect to this matter., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2006/comp19955.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19955.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"
