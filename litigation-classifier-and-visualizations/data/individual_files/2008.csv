Drucker and Ronald Drucker, and relief defendant William Minerva. The judgments follow the jury verdict on December 3, 2007 in favor of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission finding the defendants liable for insider trading in the stock of NBTY, Inc. Mitchell Drucker is the former associate general counsel of NBTY, Inc., a nutritional supplements manufacturer and retailer, and his father, Ronald Drucker, is a former New York City police detective. The Commission had charged that, while Mitchell Drucker was a lawyer at NBTY, and had learned that NBTY was about to announce lower than expected quarterly earnings, he and his father sold their holdings of NBTY stock just before the negative announcement. Collectively, the defendants avoided $197,243 in losses by selling in advance of the announcement., The judgment against defendant Mitchell Drucker permanently enjoins him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and bars him from serving as an officer and director of any public company. The judgment also orders defendant Mitchell Drucker to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest totaling $201,146, to pay, and be jointly and severally liable with his father, defendant Ronald Drucker for, disgorgement and prejudgment interest totaling $74,411, and to pay, and be jointly and severally liable with his friend, relief defendant William Minerva for, disgorgement and prejudgment interest totaling $11,577. Finally, the judgment orders Mitchell Drucker to pay a civil penalty of $394,486, representing two times the combined ill-gotten gains obtained by defendants Mitchell Drucker and Ronald Drucker, and relief defendant Minerva., The judgment against defendant Ronald Drucker permanently enjoins him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay, and be jointly and severally liable with his son, defendant Mitchell Drucker for, disgorgement and prejudgment interest totaling $74,411., The judgment against relief defendant William Minerva orders him to pay, and be jointly and severally liable with his friend, defendant Mitchell Drucker for, disgorgement and prejudgment interest totaling $11,577., In making findings for the judgments, United States District Judge Colleen McMahon issued on December 20, 2007, her Decision On Relief, in which she found, among other things, that Mitchell Drucker perjured himself during the trial. That same decision stated, among other things, that the Court is convinced, by the brazenness of his misconduct and by his cocky refusal to own up to it, that this attorney [Mitchell Drucker] — who was supposed to be NBTYs policeman, and who demonstrated utter indifference to both the law and to his client — is not fit to participate in the governance of any public company.

James E. Koenig</i>, Civil Action No. 02 C 2180 (N.D. Ill. Dec. 21, 2007) (Judge Andersen).</h2>, <h2>Final Judgment Entered Against James E. Koenig, Former CFO of Waste Management, Inc.</h2>]","[On December 21, 2007, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois entered final judgment against defendant James E. Koenig, the former CFO of Waste Management, Inc. after a jury found that he committed 60 securities laws violations in a five-year period.  The final judgment follows an 11-week jury trial in 2006 that resulted in a verdict in the SECs favor against Koenig on all charges.  The jury found Koenig liable for securities fraud, falsifying company books and records, lying to auditors, and aiding and abetting the companys violations., The final judgment, which followed a two-day bench trial on remedies before U.S. District Court Judge Wayne R. Andersen, permanently bars Koenig from acting as an officer or director of a public company, enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws, and requires him to pay more than $4 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. , The Commission alleged in its complaint that, beginning in 1992 and continuing into 1997, Koenig and others engaged in a systematic scheme to falsify and misrepresent Waste Managements financial results with profits being overstated by $1.7 billion.  According to the complaint, the scheme was accomplished through false and misleading disclosures and a variety of non-GAAP accounting practices designed to defer current period expenses whenever possible.  For example, the company manipulated its calculation of depreciation expense by repeatedly extending the useful lives and overstating the salvage value of its trucks and containers, thus reducing periodic depreciation expenses.  The company also failed to write off impaired assets carried on its balance sheet, improperly capitalized interest and other current period expenses, understated its income tax expenses, under-accrued reserves, misapplied acquisition accounting principles, and improperly reversed reserves into income.  All of these practices boosted current period earnings by reducing current period expenses.  The fraud resulted in a restatement in February 1998, which at the time was the largest restatement in history., On December 3, 2007, the Court issued a memorandum opinion and order that set forth the findings that formed the basis for the final judgment.  See SEC v. Koenig, 2007 WL 4277439 (N.D. Ill. Dec. 3, 2007).  The judgment permanently bars Koenig from acting as an officer or director of a public company and enjoins him from violating, or aiding and abetting violations of, Sections 10(b) and 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 promulgated thereunder, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.  The judgment additionally enjoins Koenig from aiding and abetting violations of Section 13(b)(2)(A) of Exchange Act, and from violating Exchange Act Rules 13b2-1 and 13b2-2.  The judgment also requires Koenig to pay $4,156,034 in total, comprised of $831,500 in disgorgement for Koenigs ill-gotten earnings-based performance bonuses, together with prejudgment interest thereon in the amount of $1,246,517, and a civil penalty in the amount of $2,078,017., Previously, the Commission reached settlements with the Companys outside public accountants Arthur Andersen, and four of its former partners.  Settlements were also reached in litigation with the founder and four other top officers of Waste Management.

The complaint seeks relief against two individuals and six entities under their control. The complaint alleges that defendants Coadum Advisors, Inc. (Coadum), Mansell Capital Partners III, LLC (Mansell), James A. Jeffery (Jeffery), Thomas E. Repke (Repke), Coadum Capital Fund 1, LLC (Coadum 1), Coadum Capital Fund II, LP (Coadum II), Coadum Capital Fund III, LP (Coadum III) and Mansell Acquisition Company LP (MAC) engaged in fraud in conjunction with a series of four securities offerings which began in early 2006. Two of the offerings are ongoing, and approximately $30 million has been raised from approximately 150 investors. The complaint also alleges that Jeffery of Ontario, Canada and Repke of Holladay, Utah, control the entities and are directing the offerings., The Complaint alleges that the defendants falsely represent to investors that they will receive a return of from 3 to 6% per month, misrepresent that their principal is protected and never leaves the escrow account; and fail to disclose that the defendants have made loans to themselves from the investor proceeds. However, in reality, the defendants have transferred the majority of the funds to Exodus Equities, Inc. (Exodus) a Malta based investment platform which in turn appears to have placed the funds in the Exodus Platinum Genesis Fund, Ltd. (Exodus Platinum Fund), a Bermuda hedge fund which has yet to begin operation, and in Pre-REIT convertible bonds which have yet to provide any return. Furthermore, the complaint alleges that the defendants have falsely represented in monthly account statements to investors that they have earned approximately 4% per month, and that all or most of their principal is in escrow. Finally, the complaint alleges that, without disclosure to investors, Coadum and Mansell have also borrowed in excess of $3 million of, or against, the investors funds and have disbursed approximately $5 million to related parties., The Complaint alleges that all defendants violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that defendants Coadum, Mansell, Jeffery and Repke further violated, Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers Act) [15 U.S.C. 15 U.S.C. §§ 80b-6 (1) and (2)]., The Commission also announces that the Honorable Orinda D.

The Court concluded that Michel, a registered representative with Wachovia Securities, LLC, violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 by repeatedly trading on material, non-public information in the securities of Blue Rhino Corp. (Blue Rhino) in the week leading up to Blue Rhinos February 9, 2004 merger announcement with Ferrellgas Partners, LP., In its 61-page opinion, the Court found that a long-time friend of Michels (who was a co-defendant in the case who had previously settled) tipped Michel about Blue Rhinos merger negotiations in a telephone call on the night of January 29, 2004. The Court found that the following morning, having conducted minimal research on the stock and having ignored it after reading a magazine article about it just four months earlier, Michel began a six-day buying spree for himself, his relatives and his customers in which he bought $1.4 million of Blue Rhino stock., The opinion also found that several other individuals had received the same information as Michel on the night of January 29 or shortly thereafter, all of whom were friends or relatives of a business partner of one of Blue Rhinos directors, and all made unusually large and unexplained purchases of Blue Rhino in the week before the merger. The judge found that based on the close relationships among the individuals involved, a series of unusual telephone calls on January 29 and 30, the unusually large purchases of Blue Rhino that followed almost immediately, and numerous shifting, contradictory and implausible or inadequate explanations of the purchases, Michel and the other individuals had engaged in insider trading., The Court permanently enjoined Michel from violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, and ordered him to pay disgorgement of $277,881, representing profits gained from his illegal insider trading, and prejudgment interest of $68,307. The Court reserved jurisdiction to set an appropriate civil penalty., The Commission also sued four other defendants, all of whom had previously settled, leaving Michel as the only defendant to go to trial.

Behrens was previously a principal at a broker-dealer registered with the Commission. According to the Complaint, the defendants fraudulently raised approximately $6.5 million from approximately 20 investors, including senior citizens. The Complaint further alleges that the defendants offered promissory notes to investors falsely claiming that the interest payable on the notes, approximately 9% interest per annum, would be generated from lending investors money to others at a higher rate of interest. The actual uses to which the monies were put were allegedly not disclosed to investors.

The broker, Justin M. Paperny, age 36, of Studio City, California, agreed to settle the charges, without admitting or denying the allegations, by consenting to a permanent injunction and agreeing to pay disgorgement with prejudgment interest and a civil penalty in amounts to be determined., The Commissions complaint alleges that, from 2002 through 2004, Paperny participated in a fraudulent offering of limited partnership interests in a hedge fund, the GLT Venture Fund, L.P., which raised $14.1 million from 42 investors. The complaint alleges that Paperny was GLTs broker and that he falsely told GLT investors that GLT had access to highly sought after initial public offerings and achieved high average yearly returns. In reality, GLT had no access to hot IPOs and suffered substantial losses because of its hedge fund managers poor trading and his misappropriation of investor funds. The complaint also alleges that Paperny knew that GLTs fund manager made similar false claims to investors but that Paperny nevertheless aided and abetted the hedge fund managers fraud. Specifically, the complaint alleges that Paperny arranged for new GLT investors to place their funds in GLT through UBS Financial and executed thousands of GLTs securities trades, using funds of GLT and its investors who, Paperny knew, were being defrauded by the fund manager. In exchange, Paperny received approximately $220,000 in commissions and in additional payments from the hedge fund manager., To settle the Commissions charges, Paperny consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the securities registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

Without admitting or denying the allegations, Raben and Borchard agreed to a settlement including monetary penalties., The Commissions complaint, filed in federal district court in San Francisco, alleges that Borchard learned about the potential acquisition plans of PwC clients through his position in the Transaction Services Group, where he handled financial due diligence for clients interested in mergers or acquisitions. On six separate occasions in 2006, Borchard told his friend and co-worker Raben about these confidential plans. Raben then used the information to trade before the news was released to the investing public. The pairs scheme continued until October 2006, when it was uncovered by PwCs Office of General Counsel, which referred the matter to the Commission and cooperated with the SEC staffs investigation., According to the Commissions complaint, Raben netted unlawful trading profits of more than $20,000 by buying stock ahead of public announcements disclosing the acquisitions and then selling his shares.

The Commissions complaint alleges Russ engaged in a fraudulent scheme to control the prices at which he purchased and sold options on an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) by placing unauthorized orders in online brokerage accounts designed to match orders in his own account. , The complaint further alleges that between August 23, 2006, and September 19, 2006, Russ electronically stole and used usernames and passwords to gain unauthorized Internet access to online brokerage accounts for the sole purpose of entering purchase or sell orders that were executed opposite orders that he had placed in his own online accounts.  Russ engaged in a pattern of purchasing four series of thinly traded options contracts on iShares Lehman Aggregate Bond Fund (AGG) and subsequently selling the contracts the same day at inflated prices that did not reflect the true economic value of the options contracts.  More specifically, the complaint alleges that Russ placed orders to buy AGG options contracts in his own online trading accounts at low prices.  Around the same time, without the accountholders knowledge and using the victims own funds, Russ also purchased AGG options contracts in the intruded accounts.  Russ then placed orders to sell the AGG options contracts in the intruded accounts matching the orders entered in his accounts.  Once the trades were executed, Russ placed orders to sell the options contracts in his accounts at inflated prices, and placed matching orders to buy the options contracts in the intruded accounts., The complaint alleges that since AGG options were so thinly traded, Russ was able to control the prices at which he purchased and sold the options, allowing him to earn guaranteed profits - sometimes as high as sixteen-times the prices at which he had purchased the options contracts.  As a result of his fraudulent scheme, Russ realized at least $88,465 in unlawful profits and caused losses of at least $339,929 in the intruded online accounts.  The online brokers have made the intruded accountholders whole by taking the losses themselves., The Commissions complaint alleges Russ violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of all ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties., The Commissions Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has previously issued an investor alert, available on the Commissions website, which provides tips for avoiding becoming a victim of an online intrusion.

Kennedy, Jr., U.S. District Judge for the District of Columbia, entered a temporary restraining order and granted other emergency relief against recidivists Gerald H. and Marie A. Levine (the Levines), and ordered them to appear on February 20, 2008 to determine whether the court should enter a preliminary injunction against them for engaging in ongoing securities fraud.  The Court also ordered the Levines to show cause why they should not be held in civil contempt of court for violating the terms of a prior securities fraud judgment against them.  The Court decreed that, should the Levines fail to comply with the order or fail to appear at the February 20 hearing, they could be subject to a warrant for their arrest., The Court issued its order in response to the Commissions motion contending that the Levines are in contempt for failing to pay more than $445,000 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest as required by the final judgment of securities fraud entered against them on June 6, 2007 (June 6th judgment), and for committing new acts of securities fraud in violation of that judgments antifraud injunction.  As part of its order, the Court also froze the Levines assets, ordered them to account for and repatriate investor funds, and appointed a temporary receiver for various companies controlled by the Levines, among other things., The Court found that the Commission had made a prima facie case of securities law violations by the Levines.  In its motion, the Commission contends that the Levines are involved in the ongoing fraudulent sale of the shares of several thinly-capitalized issuers traded in the grey market.  Shares traded in the grey market have no active market makers.  These issuers are Avitech LifeSciences, Inc., Biomaxx Systems, Inc., Evolution Global Capital Partners, Inc., Green Machine Development Corp., and Xiiva Holdings, Inc.  The Commission has previously suspended trading in each of these stocks in separate administrative actions.  (Links to the suspension orders are listed below.)  The Commission alleges that the Levines have misappropriated over $1.4 million of investor funds, using four alter-ego companies to perpetrate the securities fraud.  Those alter-ego companies are Wire to Wire, Inc., The Delaware Escrow Company, Euro Escrow, and Public Highway, Inc. (the alter-ego companies).  The Commission also contends that innocent investors are being told materially false and misleading statements about these issuers.  For example, the Commission alleges that investors have been told that Avitech would soon be offering a cure for HIV/AIDS, that Evolution is developing properties with several prominent building companies, and that Green Machine owns mining concessions in Africa that are about to be purchased by a prominent mining company.  The Commission contends that all of these statements are false.  The Commission also contends that, in connection with these ongoing fraudulent sales, the Levines have failed to disclose several materially misleading facts to investors, including the Levines involvement in the sale of these securities, that a judgment of securities fraud has already been entered against them, and that they are defendants in yet another civil enforcement action accusing them of securities fraud.  Specifically, as to this last point, on April 17, 2007, the Commission sued the Levines for securities fraud in the action entitled SEC v. Gerald Harold Levine, et al., 2:07-CV-00506 LDG/RJJ (the Nu Star case), currently pending in U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada., In his order, Judge Kennedy did the following, among other things:  temporarily restrained the Levines from further acts in violation of the antifraud injunction contained in the June 6th judgment, as well as from any activities in any way related to the purchase or sale of any penny stock, any stock traded in the grey market, or any stock quoted on the Pink Sheets, LLC, without prior leave of the Court; froze the Levines assets, whether in their own names or in the names of the alter-ego companies; ordered the Levines to account for their assets and stock transactions, whether in their own names or in the names of the alter-ego companies; ordered the repatriation of all funds moved offshore by the Levines or their alter-ego companies; ordered expedited discovery and the preservation of evidence; and appointed a temporary receiver for the alter-ego companies.  The Court ordered the receiver to:  take immediate possession of all assets held by the alter-ego companies; take immediate possession of, and change the locks on, all offices used by the alter-ego companies; enter the home of the Levines to remove all assets of, and computers used by, the alter-ego companies; receive all mail of the alter-ego companies; investigate the manner in which the alter-ego companies conducted business; and institute legal proceedings on behalf of the investors of Avitech, Biomaxx, Evolution, Green Machine and Xiiva who sent funds to the alter-ego companies.

Rather than maintain the confidentiality of the information, Raza used it for his own benefit by buying Align securities before the settlement agreement became public., The Commissions complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, alleges that OrthoClear (a private company) and Align (a public company) were engaged in contentious litigation.  In September 2006, OrthoClears CEO contacted Raza and other board members to seek their approval of a highly-confidential settlement under which OrthoClear would cease competing against Align in the transparent teeth-aligner market.  According to the complaint, two days later Raza began making large purchases of Align call options (securities that would increase in value if Aligns stock price rose) and common stock.  Indeed, Razas option purchases represented nearly half of the Align option trading volume for September 22.

McKelvey understood that backdating options to coincide with low closing prices for Monster stock without recognizing a compensation expense was contrary to accounting rules and contrary to representations in Monsters SEC filings., McKelvey caused Monster to misrepresent in its periodic filings and proxy statements filed with the Commission that all stock options were granted at the fair market value of the stock on the date of the award, when that was not the case. McKelvey also caused Monster to file materially misstated financial statements with the Commission in its Forms 10-K and 10-Q that did not recognize compensation expense for the companys stock option grants, as required by generally accepted accounting principles. As a result, Monster overstated its aggregate pretax operating income by approximately $339.5 million, for fiscal years 1997 through 2005. Although McKelvey did not receive backdated options, he benefited from the scheme by granting backdated options to four individuals that he personally employed, including three pilots and a mechanic., Under the settlement, McKelvey will be permanently enjoined from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 10(b), 13(b)(5) and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, 13b2-1, 13b2-2 and 14a-9, and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13.

The Court entered a Revised Final Judgment of Permanent Injunction, Disgorgement, Prejudgment Interest and Civil Penalties against both AirTrac and Friend., According to the Commission’s Complaint, AirTrac had purported to develop and market voice-activated applications that allowed users to access the Internet and check e-mail through cellular telephones and personal digital assistants. The Commission also alleged that between January 2004 and April 2005, the defendants offered and sold AirTrac stock and raised nearly $1.8 million from over 200 investors nationwide.  The company failed to register the securities with the Commission., The district court found that the sales of AirTrac stock were unregistered and that no applicable exemption from registration was available for their sale, either under federal law or California state law.  The Court also found that the defendants made three separate false misrepresentations to AirTrac investors. First, defendants falsely represented that Airtrac was only weeks away from conducting an Initial Public Offering (“IPO”).  Second, the defendants falsely told investors that the company was on the verge of very lucrative contracts with several major telecommunications companies.  Third, Friend and AirTrac misrepresented to investors the use of proceeds raised from investors.  The Court found that each of these misrepresentations was material.  The Court also found that Defendant Friend had acted as an unregistered broker in selling the AirTrac stock.  In granting summary judgment in favor of the Commission on all counts, the Court found that the defendants had failed to raise a genuine of material fact which would have precluded summary judgment., The Court enjoined AirTrac and Friend from future violations of Section 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act”) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.

Stanton of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered final judgments on consent against Aimsi and Fields that enjoined them from violating Sections 17(a) of the Securities  Act  of  1933  and  10(b)  of  the Securities Exchange  Act  of  1934  and  Rule  10b-5  thereunder, and which also prohibit Fields from acting as an officer or  director of a public company.  The judgment against Aimsi requires it to pay disgorgement of $169,000 and prejudgment interest of $33,423.62, but payment was waived for the amount exceeding $50,525.51, and civil penalties were not imposed, based on Aimsis defunct status.  The judgment against Fields requires him to pay disgorgement of $350,000 and prejudgment interest of $63,572.13, but payment was waived for the amount exceeding $62,035, and civil penalties were not imposed, based on Fields sworn representations of his financial condition.  The Commission also announced that it has dismissed its claims against Relief Defendants China Global Distribution Corp., Wonderland Capital and BP International., The Commission filed its action on an  emergency basis on May 16, 2005,  alleging  that Aimsi, Fields and the other defendants engaged in a deliberate pump and  dump  scheme  to  defraud  investors,  in which  Defendants acquired a substantial stake in the shares of Aimsi, orchestrated  a  fraudulent promotional campaign to drive up  the  price  and  trading  volume  of Aimsis stock, and then sold their shares at a substantial  profit  to the investing public after their plan succeeded. The Complaint alleges that before the Commission suspended trading in Aimsis stock on Dec. 15, 2004, the defendants earned illicit trading profits of at least   $3.1 million. In connection with the  Commissions  filing  of  the Complaint, it also obtained a temporary restraining order that,  among other  things,  froze  defendants  assets.  The   Complaint   charges violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities  Act  of  1933,  Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of  1934,  and  Rule  10b-5.  The Commission litigation is pending against the remaining defendants.,  ]"

Convicted for their role in the scheme were Daniel William Heath, 51, formerly of Chino Hills, California, Denis Timothy OBrien, 53, formerly of Yorba Linda, California, and Heaths father, John William Heath, 81, formerly of Covina, California. Daniel Heath was found guilty on 400 felony counts, OBrien on 70 felony counts, and John Heath on 52 felony counts. In 2004, the Riverside County District Attorneys Office arrested and charged them with committing securities fraud, elder abuse, grand theft, money laundering, tax fraud, and conspiracy, all under California law. Larre Jaye Schlarmann, 52, formerly of Carlsbad, California, was also arrested, pleaded guilty to securities fraud, elder abuse, money laundering, and tax fraud, and was sentenced to serve 15 years in state prison., Daniel Heath faces a maximum of 117 years in state prison, OBrien 37 years, and John Heath 28 years. Sentencing hearings are scheduled for John Heath on February 22, OBrien on February 27, and Daniel Heath on March 21, 2008., In April 2004, the Commission filed a complaint against Daniel Heath and his entities, and OBrien, alleging they fraudulently induced elderly investors through free lunch seminars to invest in secured notes that paid a guaranteed return. The court appointed a permanent receiver over the Heath entities. Final judgments of permanent injunction and other relief were entered against Heath and OBrien enjoining them from violating the antifraud, securities registration, and broker-dealer registrations provisions of the federal securities laws for their role in the scheme. The judgments ordered Heath and OBrien to disgorge to the receiver their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest. The Commission then instituted administrative proceedings against Heath and OBrien barring them from association with a broker or dealer. Heath and OBrien consented to the entry of the final judgments and administrative orders without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations and findings. In September 2007, the Commission instituted administrative proceedings against Martin S. Duffield, 52, of West Covina, California, and Raul A. Jordan, 52, of Pasadena, California, for violating the antifraud, securities registration, and broker-dealer registrations provisions for their role in the scheme. Duffield was barred association with any broker or dealer and Jordan was barred from association with any broker or dealer, with the right to reapply for association after five (5) years to the appropriate self-regulatory organization, or if there is none, to the Commission. Duffield and Jordan were ordered to disgorge ill-gotten gains to the receiver plus prejudgment interest. Duffield and Jordan consented to the entry of the orders without admitting or denying the Commissions findings., Administration of the court-order receivership over the Heath entities will continue., The Commission wishes to acknowledge and thank the Riverside County District Attorneys Office for their assistance in this matter., For further information, see Litigation Release Nos. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18689.htm>18689</a> (May 3, 2004), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18703.htm>18703</a> (May 11, 2004), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18724.htm>18724</a> (May 24, 2004), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18777.htm>18777</a> (July 9, 2004), and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr19287.htm>19287</a> (June 28, 2005), and Administrative Proceeding Release Nos. <a href=/litigation/admin/34-51473.pdf>34-51473</a> (April 4, 2005), <a href=/litigation/admin/34-51922.pdf>34-51922</a> (June 24, 2005), and <a href=/litigation/admin/2007/33-8838.pdf>33-8838</a> (September 5, 2007).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20438.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Tex.)(January 28, 2008)</h2>, <h2>Commission Files Settled Action Against Former Arthur Andersen Partner in Connection With the Audits of Enrons Financial Statements</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) today announced the filing and simultaneous settlement of a civil action against a former Arthur Andersen LLP (Andersen) partner in connection with the audits of Enron Corp.s financial statements. David B. Duncan, former global engagement partner for the Enron engagement, consented to a settled civil injunctive action charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, and to a related administrative proceeding permanently suspending him from appearing or practicing before the Commission. Duncan settled without admitting or denying the allegations or findings in the Commissions Complaint and Order., Duncan consented to the entry of a permanent injunction enjoining him from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. In its Complaint against Duncan, the Commission alleged that, for the years 1998 through 2000, Duncan was reckless in not knowing that the unqualified audit reports he signed on behalf of Andersen were materially false and misleading. The Complaint also alleged that the Fraud Risk Assessment questionnaires prepared by the engagement team and reviewed by Duncan documented that Enron used highly aggressive accounting  practices and entered into unusual year-end transactions that posed difficult substance over form questions. In addition, an internal Andersen document prepared each year by Duncan and others on the engagement team noted that Enrons use of complex form over substance and related party transactions created an extreme or very significant financial reporting risk., Despite these risks, Duncan failed to exercise due professional care and the necessary skepticism required under Generally Accepted Auditing Standards (GAAS) to ensure Enrons financial statements were presented in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). For example, Duncan failed to ensure that the engagement team audited certain transactions known as the Prepays, Nahanni and the Raptors in accordance with GAAS and failed to ensure that Enron properly presented and disclosed the transactions in its financial statements. Duncan, as the global engagement partner for the Enron audits, was ultimately responsible for determining whether an unqualified opinion should be issued within the auditors report. As such, when he issued unqualified audit opinions indicating Andersens audits of Enrons financial statements for the years 1998 through 2000 were conducted in accordance with GAAS, and that Enrons financial statements were presented, in all material respects, in accordance with GAAP, he made material misstatements or omissions in Andersens auditors reports that were filed with Enrons 1998, 1999, and 2000 Forms 10-K. As a result of his conduct, Duncan violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Duncans settled civil injunctive action is subject to court approval., Duncan also consented to an order under Rule 102(e) of the Commissions Rules of Practice (Rule 102(e)) permanently suspending him from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant, based on the anticipated entry of an injunction against him, pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3)., In related administrative proceedings, three other Andersen partners, Thomas H. Bauer, Michael M. Lowther and Michael C. Odom, consented, without admitting or denying the Commissions findings, to settled administrative proceedings which found that they had each engaged in improper professional conduct in connection with their Enron work, and each was denied the privilege of appearing or practicing before the Commission., The Commissions investigation is continuing., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2008/comp20441.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>, SEC Orders in this matter: <a href=/litigation/admin/2008/34-57211.pdf>Thomas Bauer</a>, <a href=/litigation/admin/2008/34-57210.pdf>Michael Lowther</a> and <a href=/litigation/admin/2008/34-57209.pdf>Michael Odom</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20441.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

(Stinger) and Robert F. Gruder (Gruder). Stinger is a Nevada corporation based in Tampa, Florida. Gruder, who resides in Tampa, is the president of Stinger., The Complaint alleges that from October 2004 through March 2005, Stinger and Gruder made a series of material misrepresentations and omissions regarding Stingers flagship stun gun product. According to the Complaint, the misrepresentations consisted of press releases and direct mailings to thousands of law enforcement officers and agencies, suggesting that Stinger was manufacturing, selling and shipping its stun gun. In fact, the product was still in the development phase. The Complaint further alleges that the misrepresentations also consisted of statements on the Stingers website and/or in industry publications that indicated Stingers stock was trading on NASDAQ, when in fact it was not. The Complaint also alleges that Stinger and Gruder misrepresented that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) certified Stingers stun gun, even though the ATF offers no such certification. According to the Complaint, these misrepresentations caused a spike in the trading volume and price for Stingers shares once it began publicly trading in November 2004. On November 12, 2004, the first full day of trading, Stingers stock price rose by 340%, from $1.25 to $5.50.

The alleged tip originated with David Li Kwok Po (David Li), who served on the Dow Jones board of directors.  David Li is the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Bank of East Asia and a member of Hong Kongs Legislative Counsel and Executive Committee., On May 8, 2007, the Commission filed an emergency action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Kan King Wong (K.K.

(Stinger), formerly United Consulting Corporation (UCC) to persons who resold the stock to the public via quotation in the Pink Sheets.  The Complaint further alleges that at no time during the stock sales was a registration statement in effect or filed by Stinger or UCC, and no valid exemption from registration was available for these entities.  The Complaint also alleges that on or about September 23, 2004, Murrell represented to Stingers counsel that his son controlled UCC at the time of both private sales to obtain a legal opinion that the shares sold in both transactions should be issued without restrictive legend.  In fact, Murrell controlled UCC at the time of both private transactions.  The Complaint further alleges that, as a result of the fraudulent sales transactions by Murrell and others, 181,000 Stinger shares were sold through the Pink Sheets during the first two weeks of public trading, which represented approximately 18% of Stingers public float, and generated net sales proceeds of over $1.044 million., On February 4, 2008, the Honorable Lee Yeakel, United States District Judge for the Western District of Texas, entered a final judgment against Murrell, enjoining him from future violations of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933.

Rodda was charged by the SEC in 2004 with aiding and abetting a massive financial fraud orchestrated by senior officers at Peregrine Systems, Inc., a San Diego software company that has since been acquired by Hewlett-Packard Company.  According to the SECs complaint, Rodda knowingly signed four sham software license agreements that allowed Peregrine to improperly record approximately $22 million in revenue.  Rodda has agreed to pay an $80,000 financial penalty to settle the SECs charges., According to the SECs complaint, Rodda and eight other defendants fraudulently inflated the product revenues Peregrine reported in SEC filings and elsewhere from its fiscal year 2000 through the third quarter of its fiscal year 2002.  In February 2003, Peregrine restated its financial results for 11 quarters, reducing previously reported revenue of $1.34 billion by more than $507 million., The sham software license agreements signed by Rodda made it appear that Peregrine had actually sold software to end-users through Roddas employer, KPMG Consulting.  In fact, based on oral side agreements with a Peregrine executive, Rodda knew that his firm would have no payment obligation on the software license agreements.  The Commission also alleges that Rodda helped Peregrine conceal the true nature of one of these agreements from Peregrines auditors at Arthur Andersen when he signed a false audit confirmation., Rodda pleaded guilty in November 2004 to criminal charges brought by the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of California.  He pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, wire fraud, bank fraud and falsification of the books, records and accounts of a public corporation.

The Commissions complaint alleges that many of VesCors investors were senior citizens who invested substantial portions of their savings or mortgaged their homes to pay for the investments., The complaint alleges the defendants engaged in a fraudulent, unregistered offering of notes by VesCor-related companies, all of which were controlled by Southwick. The defendants allegedly promised annual returns of 8% to 24% , with the returns being generated by profits from VesCors real estate projects. The complaint further alleges that the defendants made material misrepresentations concerning those real estate projects and operated a Ponzi scheme in which newly invested funds were often used: (1) to pay the promised returns to earlier investors, (2) to fund Southwicks and his familys living expenses and (3) to pay the operating expenses of the VesCor enterprise. Southwick allegedly made a variety of misrepresentations to investors, including: (1) invested funds would be used to develop specific real estate projects; (2) the real estate developments were highly profitable, and (3) the investment risk was nonexistent or extremely limited because investments were secured by recorded property interests or were highly collateralized. Finally, the complaint alleges that, contrary to VesCor and Southwicks representations, investor funds were used in whatever manner Southwick chose, VesCors real estate projects were not profitable and VesCors operations were insolvent and could not continue operating without continually obtaining new investor money., It is alleged that through this conduct the defendants violated Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Brommer, who resides in Jamestown, North Carolina, provides investor relations services., The Complaint alleges that from February to August 2004, SMPP issued a series of materially false and misleading press releases concerning the market readiness of SMPPs kiosk systems and its capital raising efforts.  According to the Complaint, those misrepresentations included touting a series of bogus funding agreements claiming SMPP would distribute 50 million restricted shares to four entities in exchange for $41.8 million.  The Complaint alleges that SMPP did not have a market-ready product and had received a mere $1.25 million of the $41.8 million capital touted in the press releases.  According to the Complaint, these misrepresentations drove up SMPPs stock price from $.10 per share on February 2 to a high of $4.50 on June 10.  The Complaint also alleges that the distribution of those restricted shares significantly increased the total number of outstanding shares, enabling Pratt to sell much more stock than he otherwise would have been permitted under the securities regulations.  The Complaint alleges that Pratt sold over 320,000 shares into the artificially-inflated market for a total profit of $628,947.  The Complaint also alleges that Brommer, who was hired to provide investor relations services for SMPP, made misleading statements vouching for SMPP and Pratt.  The Complaint alleges that Brommer had no independent basis in vouching for SMPP, but rather had a significant, undisclosed financial motive for his support of SMPP - his own receipt of 50,000 shares as compensation.  The Complaint alleges that Brommer profited nearly $25,000 by selling SMPP shares during this time., The Complaint alleges that SMPP, Pratt, and Brommer violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and that Pratt and SMPP violated of Section 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933.

In both its administrative order and federal court complaint, the Commission charged that, from at least 2001 through 2005, Pioneer made over $137,400 in improper cash payments to employees of the Indian government in order to have its competitive bids for government business granted or considered.  As a result of being awarded contracts in 2005, Pioneer realized profits of $259,000.  In connection with the improper payments, Wabtec failed to keep accurate books and records, and failed to devise and maintain effective internal accounting controls., As a result of the conduct described above, the Commission charged that Wabtec violated Sections 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B) and 30A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Wabtec consented to the ordered relief without admitting or denying either the findings contained in the Commissions administrative order, or the allegations of the Commissions complaint.

(TWCO).  The complaint alleges that TWCO engaged in a scheme to defraud mutual funds through, among other conduct, late trading.  Between January 2001 and September 2003, TWCO accepted thousands of orders from its hedge fund customers to trade mutual funds after 4:00 p.m. ET, but executed the trades as though they had been received prior to 4:00 p.m. ET.  This illegal conduct generated significant revenues for TWCO and harmed mutual fund investors by diluting the value of their investment.  Mark Barbera (Barbera), TWCOs chief financial officer, sought capacity that could be used for mutual fund trading.  Additionally, Barbera was present for parts of various discussions between TWCO partners and officers where the practice of submitting trades after 4:00 p.m. ET was discussed.  Further, Barbera approved using TWCO assets to trade mutual funds through a proprietary account, which subsequently traded on the basis of news and market conditions after the market close, but those trades were priced at that days net asset value.  The CEO of TWCO generally placed the trades in the proprietary account, and Barbera monitored the TWCO proprietary account for net capital purposes.  As a result of his conduct, Barbera violated Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act)., The complaint seeks as relief a final judgment directing Barbera to pay a civil money penalty pursuant to Section 20(d) of the Securities Act.  Barbera consented, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, to the entry of a final judgment directing him to pay a civil penalty of $60,000.  [SEC v. Mark Barbera, Civil Action Number 08 CV 1538 (MGC) (S.D.N.Y.)] (LR-20458)., In a separate administrative proceeding, the Commission issued an Order Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions Pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Section 9(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, and Instituting a Cease-and-Desist Proceeding Pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Section 9(f) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, Making Findings and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist Order as to Mark Barbera (Order).  The Order finds that Barbera willfully violated Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act, and caused violations of Section 15(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 22c-1, as adopted under Section 22(c) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (Investment Company Act).  The Order directs Barbera to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act, from causing any violations and any future violations of Section 15(c) of the Exchange Act, and from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Rule 22c-1, as adopted under Section 22(c) of the Investment Company Act.  Further, the Order suspends Barbera from association with any broker or dealer, and prohibits Barbera from serving or acting as an employee, officer, director, member of an advisory board, investment adviser or depositor of, or principal underwriter for, a registered investment company or affiliated person of such investment adviser, depositor, or principal underwriter, for a period of six (6) months.

Kohler was the former chief financial officer of Mutual Benefits and is a licensed certified public accountant. Ziegler served as Mutual Benefits regulatory counsel., The Commissions complaints charge Khan and Kohler with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and further charge Khan with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.

Phillip R. Bennett</i>, 08 CV 1631 (GEL) (S.D.N.Y. filed February 19, 2008)</h2>, <h2>SEC Charges Former Refco CEO Phillip R. Bennett With Orchestrating Refco Fraud</h2>]","[The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission) today filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Phillip R. Bennett, the former chairman and chief executive officer of Refco Inc. and its corporate predecessor, Refco Group Ltd. (together, Refco). The Commissions complaint alleges that Bennett orchestrated a scheme that periodically concealed hundreds of millions of dollars owed to Refco by a private entity that Bennett controlled. The public revelation of Bennetts scheme in October 2005, two months after the companys initial public offering of common stock, caused hundreds of millions of dollars in losses to Refco shareholders. The complaint also alleges that Bennett directed practices that artificially inflated Refcos financial results. As a result, the complaint alleges, Bennett violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, and 15d 14, and aided and abetted Refcos violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 15(d) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 15d-2 and 15d-13., According to the complaint, from at least 1998 to October 2005, Bennetts scheme periodically concealed debt owed to Refco by Refco Group Holdings, Inc. (RGHI), a non-Refco entity that Bennett controlled. The debt was primarily the result of trading losses and operating expenses that Refco transferred over time to RGHI. Refco utilized a series of short-term loans that temporarily transferred the debt to third parties immediately prior to the ends of Refco fiscal periods. A few days after the fiscal periods ended, the transactions were reversed, and the debt was transferred back to RGHI. The Commissions complaint alleges that Bennett directed the fiscal period-end transactions and took certain actions to implement them, including executing many of the documents used in those transactions., The Commissions complaint also alleges that Bennett instituted practices that artificially inflated Refcos reported financial results in 2005. The practices involved Refco recording fictitious interest income and income from sham foreign exchange transactions. The inflation of financial results was undertaken by Bennett to make Refco more attractive to potential investors., The Commissions complaint further alleges that, in 2005, Refco filed with the Commission and provided to investors registration statements and periodic reports that contained materially false and misleading misstatements and omissions. The filings failed to disclose the debt and the period end transactions, and some of the filings reported income that had been fraudulently inflated. Bennett signed the registrations statements and periodic filings while knowing, or reckless in not knowing, that the filings were materially false and misleading. Moreover, Bennett explicitly certified the accuracy of the disclosures and financial statements in the periodic filings., The complaint seeks a permanent injunction enjoining Bennett from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, and 15d 14, and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 15(d) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 15d-2 and 15d-13. The complaint also seeks payment by Bennett of unjust enrichment that he received as a result of his actions, with prejudgment interest thereon, and imposition of civil money penalties against him pursuant to Section 20(d) of the Securities Act and Section 21(d)(3) of the Exchange Act., In a related action, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York announced February 15, 2008, that Bennett has pleaded guilty to all twenty counts of a superseding indictment previously returned against him and charging him with conspiracy, securities fraud, making false filings with the Commission, wire fraud, making false statements to Refcos auditors, bank fraud, and money laundering, for his actions in connection with the Refco fraud., The Commission acknowledges the assistance and cooperation of the Office of the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, the United States Postal Inspection Service, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission., The Commissions investigation is continuing., See also Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19716.htm>19716</a> (June 5, 2006); Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20402.htm>20402</a> (December 18, 2007); and Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20405.htm>20405</a> (December 19, 2007)., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2008/comp20460.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20460.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Oil for Food Program — Company Agrees to Pay Over $6.5 Million in Civil Penalties, Disgorgement of Profits, and Prejudgment Interest</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed Foreign Corrupt Practices Act books and records and internal controls charges against Flowserve Corporation (Flowserve) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Flowserve is a Texas-based manufacturer of pumps, valves, seals, and related automation and services to the power, oil, gas, and chemical industries. The Commissions complaint alleges that from 2001 through 2003, two of Flowserves subsidiaries entered into a total of twenty contracts in which $646,488 in kickback payments were made and another $173,758 were authorized in connection with sales of industrial equipment to Iraqi government entities under the U.N. Oil for Food Program (the Program). The kickbacks were characterized as after-sales service fees (ASSFs), but no bona fide services were performed. The Program was intended to provide humanitarian relief for the Iraqi population, which faced severe hardship under international trade sanctions. The Program allowed the Iraqi government to purchase humanitarian goods through a U.N. escrow account. The kickbacks paid by Flowserves subsidiaries diverted funds out of the escrow account and into an Iraqi slush fund. The contracts submitted to the U.N. did not disclose that the illicit payments were included in the inflated contract prices., According to the Commissions Complaint:, A French Flowserve subsidiary, Flowserve Pompes, entered into fifteen Program contracts involving kickback payments of $604,651. Flowserve Pompes agreed to, but did not ultimately make, an additional $173,758 in improper ASSF payments under four additional contracts. Delivery under these four contracts had not been completed by the time of the U.S. invasion of Iraq in March 2003. Senior officials at Flowserve Pompes, including the subsidiarys President, developed two different false cover stories to conceal the ASSF kickback payments. The companys internal accounting records falsely indicated that Flowserve Pompes paid a Jordanian agent a ten percent fee on each contract to cover the cost of installing and commissioning the equipment. In reality, the agent provided no such services. The contract documents that Flowserve Pompes sent to the U.N. for approval painted a different, but equally false, picture. These documents omitted any reference to after sales services or related installation fees. Instead, to cover the cost of the illicit ASSF payments, the companys U.N. contracts inflated the unit price of each piece of equipment without disclosing the price increases, or the reason for them, to the U.N. Flowserve Pompes also signed a side letter to the Iraqi ministry to pay the ten percent, and failed to disclose the letter to the U.N. Knowing that the kickback payments had to be received before the goods would be allowed across the border, Flowserve Pompes paid its agent immediately. The agent then made the kickback payment by depositing cash into an Iraqi-controlled account in Jordan., Flowserves Dutch subsidiary, Flowserve B.V., entered into one contract involving an ASSF kickback payment of $41,836. The contract was for the supply of water pump spare parts to the Iraqi government-owned South Gas Company. In August 2001, officials of Flowserve B.V. met with the companys agent and were advised that the agent would have to pay a ten percent kickback on the transaction on Flowserve B.V.s behalf, for which the agent would need reimbursement. Flowserve B.V.s controller chose to conceal the payment by increasing the cost of the purchase order by ten percent and passing the difference back to the agent. In September 2001, Flowserve B.V. agreed to pay a supplemental commission — euphemistically labeled a special project discount — to the agent to cover the amount of the kickback. Upon receiving its supplemental commission payment, the agent paid the ten percent kickback to the South Gas Company on Flowserve B.V.s behalf., Flowserve either knew or was reckless in not knowing that illicit payments were either offered or paid in connection with these transactions. Flowserve failed to maintain an adequate system of internal controls to detect and prevent the payments. Flowserves accounting for these transactions failed properly to record the nature of the companys payments. The companys books falsely characterized the ASSF payments either as payments for services actually performed or as agent commissions., Flowserve, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, ordering it to disgorge $2,720,861, in profits, plus $853,364 in pre-judgment interest, and to pay a civil penalty of $3,000,000. Flowserve will also pay a $4,000,000 fine pursuant to a deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice, Fraud Section. Flowserve B.V. will enter into a criminal disposition with the Dutch Public Prosecutor pursuant to which it will pay a fine., The Commission considered remedial acts promptly undertaken by Flowserve and the cooperation the company afforded the Commission staff in its investigation.

In order to attract investors, Defendants created phony press releases that boasted of sales that never in fact occurred, and published an offering memorandum that misrepresented, among other critical facts, that CCT owned the rights to the product, which in fact it did not. Defendants also failed to disclose to investors that they had established a separate Clean Care entity, Clean Care Systems, LLC (Systems), through which the Company raised additional funds by representing that Systems was the exclusive North American distributor of the very same self-cleaning toilet seat. Defendants also did not tell investors in CCT or Systems that their funds were commingled to suit the defendants needs. Nazon and Varughese were not registered as or associated with a registered broker or dealer but nevertheless engaged in cold-calling to sell Clean Care Securities to the public and were paid exorbitant undisclosed commissions based on their success in selling Clean Care Securities., The Commissions complaint, filed in the Southern District of New York, charges that the defendants violated Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder by conducting an unregistered offering of securities and making material misrepresentations and omissions to investors.

Colls was held jointly and severally liable for the disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and she also made a sworn representation of financial condition. Donlan and Colls were ordered to pay the disgorgement by turning over to WFI all assets related to the fraud, including bank and brokerage accounts, retirement accounts, and real property., The Commissions first amended complaint alleged that between November 2002 and November 2003, Donlan abused his position as WFIs stock options administrator to issue and transfer over 700,000 shares of WFI stock and stock options to a brokerage account.

In reality, according to the complaint, the press releases claiming that the motor device produced more energy than it consumed failed to include the professional engineers limitations, namely that the efficiency lasted only a few moments and that they were unable to duplicate the results in subsequent tests.  Additionally, GMC and Brace never contacted, much less negotiated with, an S&amp;P corporation, or any other company, regarding the sale of the companys technology.   According to the complaint, GMCs false press releases artificially pumped up the companys share price and trading volume and helped GMC raise more than $2 million from investors through illegal unregistered stock offerings, which provided GMCs only source of revenue., The Commissions complaint charges that the defendants violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) by conducting an unregistered offering of securities and making material misrepresentations and omissions to investors.   The Commissions complaint seeks a final judgment permanently enjoining defendants from further securities laws violations, ordering defendants to disgorge their ill-gotten gains, and assessing civil penalties.  The complaint further seeks an order barring Brace from serving as an officer or director of a public company and from participating in any offering of a penny stock., On March 8, 2006 the Commission temporarily suspended trading in GMCs securities (Release No. 53442) and instituted administrative proceedings against GMC for failure to make its required periodic filings (Release No. 53448).  On April 5, 2006, the Commission issued a settled order deregistering GMCs securities, finding the company had failed to file the required reports of a publicly traded company (Release No. 53601).

Howard, the former chief executive and acting chief financial officer of AXM Pharma, Inc., based in Las Vegas, Nevada. The Commissions complaint, filed in federal district court in Las Vegas, alleges that Howard, age 65 and a resident of Las Vegas, improperly directed AXM to overstate its revenues by over 700 percent for the quarter ended June 30, 2005., According to the complaint, Howard directed AXM to overstate its reported revenue of $3.2 million by approximately $2.8 million. The complaint alleges that the overstated revenue resulted from sales to distributors in Asia in which the distributors had a right to return the goods and were not obligated to pay for them until they re-sold the goods. Further, the complaint alleges that Howard knew that at least a portion of the goods had not been delivered to the distributors. The complaint further alleges that these sales failed to meet several of the fundamental criteria for revenue recognition under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. In addition, the complaint alleges that Howard caused AXM to falsely report quarterly net income of approximately $179,000, when in fact AXM had a net loss of approximately $1.46 million for the quarter. , The Commissions complaint further alleges that Howard misled investors about AXMs revenue and earnings in the companys quarterly and current reports filed with the Commission, in press releases, and in a conference call with investors and analysts. The complaint also alleges that Howard falsely certified the companys quarterly report, made false statements to AXMs independent accountant in connection with the quarter review, and caused AXMs violations of the internal controls and books and records provisions of the securities laws., The complaint seeks a permanent injunction against Howard from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-11, and 13a-13.

Russo, a defendant in a previously-filed Commission enforcement action, was sentenced in U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts to 18 years in prison to be followed by 3 years of supervised release. Russo pleaded guilty to charges of investment adviser fraud and mail fraud in a hearing just prior to his sentencing. The criminal charges relate to the investment fraud allegations in the Commissions civil action. The Commissions action was filed in June 2006. Russo was indicted on April 27, 2007., In addition to his jail sentence, Russo was ordered to pay $20 million in restitution to defrauded investors and to pay a $500,000 fine. The Court ordered forfeiture of Russos residence and other assets. Russo entered a guilty plea to charges that from 1982 through 2006, he misrepresented to investors that they could expect above average positive returns, and that their investments would be safe. In fact, according to prosecutors, he did not invest his victims money as promised, lost more than $20 million in investor funds, and in order to conceal the losses and his misrepresentations, and to induce victims into further investments, Russo generated false account statements that reflected inflated balances and gains that did not exist., The Commission had previously filed an emergency enforcement action against Russo and three related entities on June 6, 2006 in U.S. District Court in Massachusetts alleging violations of the registration and anti-fraud provisions of the securities laws. The Commission obtained, by consent, preliminary injunctions, asset freezes and other relief against Russo and the three entities on that date.

Duncan, Hendrix M. Montecastro, and Maurice E. McLeod, operating through Murrieta, California-based Pacific Wealth Management, LLC (PWM) and Murrieta-based Stonewood Consulting, Inc., promised investors financial freedom within three years in exchange for control over their finances.  The defendants offered investors securities in the form of investment contracts to purchase and maintain investment homes on behalf of investors.  The complaint further alleges that James Duncan raised $1.2 million in a separate offering of preferred membership units in Total Return Fund, LLC, to approximately 20 investors.  The complaint alleges that the proceeds raised in both offerings were commingled and used to run a Ponzi-like scheme that fell apart in late 2006., The Commissions complaint further alleges that between October 2004 and June 2006, the defendants solicited investors using investment seminars and referral partners, one of which was a member of the Air Force who solicited his fellow servicemen.  As alleged in the complaint, the defendants falsely represented to investors that their funds would be invested in real estate, stocks, foreign currency, precious metals, and various other investments, and that the earnings on such investments would help make the mortgage payments on the investment homes purchased on their behalf.  The complaint alleges that, instead of investing client funds as promised, the defendants operated a Ponzi-like scheme by using new investor money to make the mortgage payments on previously purchased investment homes., Further, the complaint alleges that the defendants failed to disclose several key facts about the purchase of the investment homes, including that the defendants charged exorbitant real estate transaction fees financed by the investors, and that the defendants submitted false mortgage loan applications on behalf of investors.  The complaint also alleges that Duncan, who was touted as a financial genius, failed to disclose his prior securities laws violations., Finally, the complaint alleges that Duncan and Total Return Fund misrepresented how investor money would be used.  Specifically, the complaint alleges that while the Total Return Fund offering documents stated that 95% of investor funds would go towards the purchase of real estate, business assets, or accounts receivable, in fact, investor funds were used to pay returns to prior investors, and were used as part of the PWM fraud., The Commissions complaint alleges that the defendants violated the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933.  The complaint also alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Commission seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, and civil penalties against each of the defendants.  The complaint also names Christopher J. Oetting, Anthony M.

The Commission alleges that from at least 1997 through 2003, Ballys financial statements were affected by more than two dozen accounting improprieties, which caused Bally to overstate its originally reported year-end 2001 stockholders equity by nearly $1.8 billion, or more than 340%.  The Commissions complaint further alleges that Bally understated its originally reported 2002 net loss by $92.4 million, or 9341%, and understated its originally reported 2003 net loss by $90.8 million, or 845%.  As a result, the Commission alleges that Bally violated the antifraud, reporting, books and records, and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws., According to the Commissions complaint, Bally fraudulently accounted for three types of revenue it received from its members:  initiation fees, prepaid dues, and reactivation fees; additionally, Bally fraudulently accounted for its membership acquisition costs.  These frauds account for $1.2 billion of the $1.8 billion overstatement of Ballys originally reported year-end 2001 stockholders equity.  In addition, Ballys accounting for more than 20 other revenue or expense items failed to conform to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.  These failures account for the remaining $600 million of the $1.8 billion overstatement of Ballys originally reported year-end 2001 stockholders equity., The Commissions complaint, which was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, charges Bally with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13.

Prior to the enactment of the Fair Fund provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the SEC was required to send financial penalties from its enforcement actions to the U.S. Treasury, instead of to the investors harmed by corporate misconduct. As a result of the Act, however, checks were mailed to 80,964 investors, with an average distribution amount of $566., The Xerox Fair Fund resulted from SEC actions brought in 2002 and 2003 against Xerox Corporation, five of its officers, Xeroxs independent audit firm (KPMG, LLP) and five KPMG accountants who held senior positions on the Xerox engagement. Among them, the defendants paid more than $46 million to settle SEC charges that they caused Xerox to make materially false and misleading statements in SEC filings. (Ten million dollars of the total amount was paid by Xerox to the U.S. Treasury before the Fair Fund provisions were enacted.), Judge Denise Cote, of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, approved the methodology used to calculate the amounts paid to Xerox investors injured by the fraud.

The jury found former Applix CEO Alan C. Goldsworthy not liable for any securities law violations. The verdict followed a four week trial in Boston, Massachusetts before the Honorable Judith Dein, United States Magistrate for the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts., The Commissions complaint, filed on January 4, 2006, alleged that Goldsworthy, Hilger and former Applix Director of World-Wide Operations Mark E. Sullivan participated in two fraudulent revenue recognition schemes, causing Applix to report inflated revenue and understated net loss figures for the year ended December 31, 2001 and for the quarter ended June 30, 2002. , The jury found that Hilger violated section 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act); that he falsified Applixs books and records in violation of Rule 13b2-1 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act); and that he knowingly aided and abetted Applixs filing of a false form 8-K in violation of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act.

Sullivan, a resident of Bridgewater, Massachusetts, consented to the judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint., The Commission also issued an order instituting a settled administrative proceeding against Sullivan pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the Commissions Rules of Practice, based on the entry of the injunction against him.

The complaint alleges that the defendant, a retired business owner, purchased securities of Valley Forge on the basis of material nonpublic information concerning a merger between Valley Forge and Synergetics, Inc.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, Manne has consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from engaging in the violations set forth below, and ordering him to pay disgorgement of $85,601, plus prejudgment interest of $13,315, and a civil penalty of $85,601., The Commissions complaint alleges that Synergetics, a privately held corporation, developed and manufactured microsurgical instruments and devices.  Valley Forge, now known as Synergetics USA, Inc., manufactured electrosurgical equipment and instrumentation.  Valley Forges common stock was traded on the Boston Stock Exchange and quoted on the NASDAQ SmallCap Market until the completion of the merger with Synergetics.  On May 3, 2005, Valley Forge and Synergetics jointly announced an agreement to merge the two companies.  On that day, Valley Forge common stock closed at $2.30 per share, an increase of 23 percent over the previous day., The complaint alleges that Valley Forge and Synergetics began discussions concerning a possible merger in July 2003.  In May 2004, a Valley Forge director who later became Valley Forges chief operating officer (hereinafter Chief Operating Officer), became the principal negotiator for Valley Forge in connection with the merger discussions.  Manne and the Chief Operating Officer have had a close personal and professional relationship for more than 30 years and Manne knew, during the relevant time period, that the Chief Operating Officer was a Valley Forge director and that he had access to confidential information about the merger negotiations., The complaint also alleges that, in February 2005, the Chief Operating Officer resigned from Valley Forges board of directors to become the companys chief operating officer, and asked Manne if he would be interested in replacing him on Valley Forges board.  He told Manne that Valley Forge was involved in discussions with several potential sale or merger partners, including Synergetics, and that, as a director, Manne would be involved in these matters.  Manne agreed to keep this information confidential and not to trade on it.  Nevertheless, between February 14, 2005 and May 3, 2005, in breach of a duty of trust and confidence he owed to the Chief Operating Officer, Manne misappropriated material nonpublic information concerning the merger negotiations for his own use, and purchased 105,680 shares of Valley Forge common stock in 45 trades on 34 separate days.  Although Manne did not sell his shares immediately after the merger announcement, as a result of his unlawful trading Manne realized potential profits of $85,601., The Commissions complaint alleges that by his conduct, Manne violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement together with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty against Manne., The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the National Association of Securities Dealers (now known as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority) with respect to this matter., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2008/comp20474.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  ]"

Jenkins)(D.Ut. filed March 4, 2008)</h2>, <h2>Hedge Fund Adviser and Principals Charged in $60 Million Investment Fraud</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced the filing of an enforcement action against a Salt Lake City investment adviser and three of its principals for making undisclosed subprime and other high-risk investments which resulted in the near total asset losses of two hedge funds managed by the adviser., The SEC charged Thompson Consulting, Inc., Kyle Thompson, David Condie and Sherman Warner with violations of the antifraud provisions of the securities laws by engaging in much riskier trading strategies than those described to investors, several of whom were seniors.  The Commission alleges that Thompson, Condie and Warner managed the hedge funds investment strategy and also made sales presentations to potential investors in which they emphasized the safety of Thompson Consultings investment strategy.  The Commissions complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Utah, also alleges that Thompson Consultings deviations from its stated investment policy resulted in substantial losses to both the hedge funds and an individual client.  Among those departures from its stated strategy were failed investments in options on the stock of a subprime lender.  The complaint further alleges that the defendants improperly transferred money from the hedge funds to the account they managed for the individual client to make up for the individuals losses., The Commissions complaint alleges that from March through August 2007, Thompson Consulting, in an attempt to attain promised returns of 3% a month, embarked on progressively riskier trading strategies in an attempt to increase returns without disclosing the change in strategy.  The Commission alleges that in early March 2007, Thompson Consulting wrote options on the stock of New Century Financial Corp., a subprime lender, for the accounts of the hedge funds, sustaining substantial losses when the price of the underlying stock collapsed later that month.  According to the Commissions complaint, the same investment had been made on behalf of one of Thompson Consultings individual investors.  In order to make up for the losses suffered by that investor, Thompson Consulting allegedly transferred $3 million improperly from one of the hedge funds to the individuals account., In an effort to recoup earlier losses by the hedge funds, the Commission alleges, in July and August 2007, Thompson Consulting invested virtually all the hedge funds assets in unhedged options on the VIX, the CBOEs volatility index.  Virtually all these assets were lost when the securities markets dropped sharply in mid August.  According to the Commissions complaint, from July 31 to August 17, 2007, the net asset value of the hedge funds fell from approximately $54 million to approximately $200,000., The Complaint seeks to enjoin Thompson Consulting, Thompson, Condie and Warner from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940; payment of disgorgement and prejudgment interest and the imposition of civil penalties.

Tullos, the former vice president of human resources at Broadcom Corporation, for her participation in a five-year scheme to backdate stock options granted to Broadcom employees and officers., As a result of this scheme, Broadcom restated its financial results in January 2007 and reported an additional $2.22 billion in compensation expenses — the largest restatement to date arising from stock option backdating., The Commission charged Tullos with participating in a scheme at Broadcom from 1998 to 2003 to backdate stock option grants to coincide with the dates of low closing prices for the companys stock, resulting in grants of in-the-money options to Tullos and numerous individuals. The SECs complaint alleges that Tullos communicated false grant dates within the company and provided spreadsheets of stock option allocations for the backdated grants to Broadcoms finance and shareholder services departments, knowing that they would use such information to prepare Broadcoms books and records and periodic filings with the SEC. As a result, the complaint alleges that Tullos contributed to Broadcoms misrepresentations in these filings that no compensation expense was required for the stock option grants. Tullos personally benefited from the backdating scheme because she received and exercised backdated stock options that were in-the-money by more than $1.2 million., Under the settlement, Tullos agreed to pay more than $1.3 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, which will be offset by the value of her exercisable stock options that Broadcom cancelled. She agreed to pay a civil penalty of $100,000. Tullos also will be permanently enjoined from violations of Section 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder, and aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder.

The complaint further alleges that Jenson engaged in another undisclosed related party transaction when he sold RKM Partners, an inoperative Merisel subsidiary, to defendant TDH Enterprises for just $1,000 although the subsidiary held over $952,000 in assets., The Commissions complaint further alleges that Jenson misrepresented or failed to disclose the related party nature of those transactions in Merisels Form 10-Q, an earnings press release, various Forms 8-K, and a proxy statement.  Jenson also failed to account properly for the $2.6 million loss resulting from the asset sale to D&amp;H Services in a Merisel earnings press release and in a Form 8-K that announced Merisels earnings., The complaint alleges that, as a result of his conduct, Jenson committed securities fraud and that, in carrying out and covering up his fraud, Jenson falsified Merisels books and records, circumvented its internal controls, signed a false certification as to the accuracy of Merisels Form 10-Q, made false and misleading statements and omissions to Merisels auditors, and solicited proxies by means of a misleading proxy statement.

The complaint alleges that Beahm unlawfully traded in the securities of Del, while in possession of material non-public information, one week prior to the announcement on July 2, 2004, that Church &amp; Dwight (C&amp;D) and a second company had reached a definitive agreement to acquire Del. According to the complaint, at the time, Beahm had been retained as a consultant by C&amp;D, his former employer, to assist it in its acquisition of Del and had participated directly in C&amp;Ds efforts to acquire Del. After trading Beahm tipped his friend and former C&amp;D supervisor Crilly, and based on that tip Crilly traded in Del securities.

Frederick, charging them with violations of the broker-dealer registration and antifraud provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  On March 5, 2008, U.S. District Judge Dana M. Sabraw of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California found that the SEC had made a prima facie showing that Tuco and Frederick have engaged in, and will continue to engage in future violations, of the broker-dealer registration and antifraud provisions of Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, appointed a temporary receiver as a monitor over Tuco, and issued orders against the defendants for accountings, expedited discovery, and prohibiting destruction of documents. , According to the SEC’s complaint, the defendants provided securities day-trading capability to Tuco’s over 250 traders who had approximately $10.2 million invested in Tuco.  They permitted traders to day-trade securities in Tuco’s own brokerage accounts at registered broker-dealers through sub-accounts created at Tuco for each trader.  The complaint alleged that Tuco provided traders with services unavailable at a registered broker-dealer.  As alleged in the complaint, they allowed traders to day-trade without meeting the $25,000 minimum equity requirement under NASD regulations for such trading.  The SEC’s complaint also alleges that for each $1 in the trader’s sub-account, Tuco and Frederick allowed the traders at Tuco to use up to $20 of Tuco’s equity, which has been invested by other traders, to purchase securities (20:1 buying power).  NASD and NYSE regulations, however, only allow a day-trader to have 4:1 buying power.  , The SEC’s complaint also alleged that Tuco received transaction-based compensation for its members’ trading, and Tuco’s traders conducted substantial day-trading through Tuco’s brokerage accounts both in dollar amounts and number of trades.  As a result, Frederick earned substantial commissions on the trading as the registered representative for the Tuco principal accounts at the registered broker-dealer.  The complaint alleged that Frederick then used substantial amounts of his commissions to pay Tuco’s operating expenses.  , The complaint also alleged that the defendants’ inaccurately reported to the traders their equity balances.  Specifically, the complaint alleged that as of December 31, 2007, Tuco and Frederick had used about $3.62 million of the traders’ approximately $10.2 million total equity to pay Tuco’s expenses and to cover trader losses and that as of January 31, 2008, approximately a $1.35 million shortfall remained.  As alleged in the complaint, Tuco and Frederick failed to disclose those details or that Tuco and Frederick’s recovery of the shortfall in the traders’ equity is dependent on Frederick’s recovering the funds from third parties.  , In its complaint, the SEC also seeks against Tuco and Frederick preliminary and permanent injunctions against future violations of the broker-dealer registration and antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, disgorgement, and civil penalties, and against Tuco, a permanent receiver.   , <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2008/comp20480.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20480.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The complaint also alleged that Cornerstone failed to disclose the potential effects that necessary adjustments to its accounts, once they were quantified, would have on its reported income; and its inability to properly consolidate accounts of its various divisions in light of the subsidiarys accounting problems. The complaint further generally alleged that Cornerstone issued a September 28, 2001 press release that concealed the nature of write-offs related to the verification of accounts, falsely claiming that the write-off resulted from the sale of certain business units rather than from a divisions failure to properly record its accounts for several reporting periods.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20483.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Barkouras is the CEO and largest shareholder of privately-held MyPrint, a technology, print and fulfillment company located in Irvine, California., The Commissions complaint, filed today in federal district court in Orange County, alleges that Barkouras, age 47, of Newport Beach, California, traded on the basis of confidential information about the FDAs approval of Mentors silicone-gel filled breast implants.  Barkouras had access to this sensitive information through MyPrints role to store and ship Mentors breast implant starter kits containing marketing materials for physicians.  Barkouras purchased Mentor securities just hours before Mentors public announcement of the FDA approval.  The complaint alleges that Barkouras even tipped a family member, who traded ahead of the announcement.  Barkouras and his relative realized illegal profits of $80,295 from their trades., The Commissions complaint alleges that MyPrint received confidential information about the FDA approval so it could immediately begin shipping the starter kits.  According to the complaint, on the morning of Mentors public announcement, a MyPrint employee emailed Barkouras about the FDA approval stating: Buy Mentor stock Now $$.  Further, the complaint alleges that while Barkouras cautioned the employee about the confidentiality of the information, he was purchasing 543 Mentor call options on the morning of Nov. 17, 2006-just ahead of the public announcement.  After the market closed that day, Mentor made the announcement about the FDA approval.  On the first trading day after the announcement, Mentors stock price increased by more than 10 percent and its trading volume increased 650 percent.

The Commission also charged Woolfs and Genglers corporations, Hands On Capital, Inc., and Lashaico, Inc. The Commissions complaint alleges that Woolf and Gengler made false and misleading statements in televised infomercials and investor workshops to dupe investors into believing they would make extraordinary profits trading securities if they purchased TMTT products and services. TMTT — a unit of Whitney Information Network, Inc., a publicly traded company based in Cape Coral, Florida — conducts nationwide investor workshops that purport to teach investors the secrets to making money in the stock market. Woolf and Gengler, both residents of Utah, misrepresented, among other things, their own success trading securities as well as the success rate of others who purchased TMTT packages that consisted of securities trading mentoring, software and classes., The Commissions complaint alleges that during workshop presentations made between approximately 2003 and 2006 — some of which were captured on videotape — Woolf and Gengler used lies and misrepresentations in order to sell expensive TMTT packages of personal mentoring, software and classes for prices ranging from approximately $11,000 to $40,000. According to the Commissions complaint, Woolf and Gengler appeared in television infomercials portraying themselves as successful former TMTT customers. The complaint also alleges that at the workshops, Woolf and Gengler expanded on their false claims about their success as securities traders. They misrepresented to audiences that they themselves had purchased personal mentoring, classes and software to learn to trade, and quickly profited by trading securities. Woolf targeted retirees, among others. Gengler urged investors to liquidate their retirement accounts to follow TMTT strategies. Through false stories of their own success and false claims of a 96.5% success rate for TMTT students who purchased personal mentoring, courses and software, Woolf and Gengler convinced investors that they too would make money in the stock market if they followed TMTTs trading strategies that emphasized options trading and short-term swing trading., In fact, the Commission alleges, Woolfs and Genglers tales of trading success were not true. In reality, they are unsuccessful traders whose wealth came not from trading securities but from selling expensive TMTT packages. Woolfs and Genglers claims about a 96.5% success rate of others who purchased certain TMTT packages and followed TMTTs trading strategies also had no basis in fact. The complaint alleges that Woolf reaped approximately $4 million from selling TMTT packages, and Gengler made approximately $2.25 million., The Commissions complaint alleges that Woolf, Gengler, Hands On Capital, Inc., and Lashaico Inc. violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

In connection with these phony offers, Roxford, and in some cases HRR, made misrepresentations to the public regarding the existence of financial backers or banks that supposedly were interested in financing the tender offers, even though Roxford and HRR did not have any financial backing nor independent means of financing the acquisitions.  Roxford and HRR publicized the phony offers through press releases, internet message board postings, and in at least one filing with the Commission.

The Commission charges that Cole made over $500,000 in illegal profits by using material, nonpublic information concerning revenue and order shortfalls at Diebold to trade Diebold securities., The Commissions complaint alleges that on September 15, 2005, shortly after learning from his sales manager that revenues and orders in the Diebolds North American regional bank business were significantly below target, Cole began purchasing hundreds of soon-to-expire Diebold put options contracts, at a total cost of $70,110, anticipating that Diebold would lower its earnings forecast and the price of Diebold stock would fall.  As alleged in the complaint, on September 21, 2005 -- one day after Cole completed purchasing these Diebold put option contracts -- Diebold announced that it was lowering its earnings forecasts, primarily because of a revenue shortfall in the companys North American regional bank business.  After this public announcement, Diebolds stock price dropped sharply, closing at $37.27 per share, which was a 16% drop from the previous days closing price of $44.13.  Cole immediately sold the Diebold put option contracts for $579,190, realizing illicit profits of $509,080 (a 700% return)., The Commission alleges that by engaging in illegal insider trading, Cole violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Commissions complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of illicit trading profits with prejudgment interest, and civil monetary penalties., The Commission wishes to thank the Philadelphia Stock Exchange for its valuable assistance in this matter., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2008/comp20494.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  ]"

Reynolds, Jason Wynn, Carlton Fleming, and their companies Bellatalia, LP, Wynn Industries, LLC, and Thomas Wade Investments, LLC based on their roles in distributing the common stock of Beverage Creations, Inc. The Honorable A. Joe Fish of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas entered a temporary restraining order (TRO) that temporarily enjoins defendants from violating Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933. The TRO also temporarily enjoins defendants Jason Wynn and Wynn Industries, LLC from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Additionally, the TRO freezes the promoter defendants assets and temporarily prohibits them from participating in any offering of penny stock. , The SECs lawsuit, filed on March 13, also names as a defendant Beverage Creations, Inc., a Minneapolis, Minnesota company, alleging fraud as well as violations of the registration provisions of the federal securities laws. According to the complaint, Beverage Creations sold stock to the promoter defendants and then took steps to facilitate the promoters prompt resale of the stock to the public without full disclosure. The stock promoters allegedly engaged in manipulative trading to create demand and push the price of the stock up. In addition, the SEC alleges that Jason Wynn and Wynn Industries pumped Beverage Creations stock through promotional mailers and spam e-mail. While Wynn Industries disclosed in the mailer that it received stock, it did not disclose that it intended to sell that stock into the artificially inflated market created by its own activities. The promoters sold their shares at a profit of at least $2.4 million. Finally, the SEC alleges that, in a press release on February 21, 2008, Beverage Creations falsely disclaimed any relationship to Jason Wynn or Wynn Industries, even though it had sold more than $3 million shares of stock to Wynn Industries. The SEC alleges that, by these activities, all defendants violated Section 5 of the Securities Act, and Wynn, Wynn Industries, and Beverage Creations violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. , In addition to the emergency relief already obtained, the SEC is seeking preliminary and permanent injunctions and civil penalties against all defendants and disgorgement of ill-gotten gains and penny stock bars from the promoter defendants.

Bilotti Concerning Deceptive Market Timing Practices</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that the U.S. District Court in Massachusetts entered a final judgment against Marc J. Bilotti, a defendant in a civil injunctive action brought by the Commission. The Commissions complaint charged that Bilotti, 37, of Charlestown, Massachusetts, defrauded mutual fund companies and the funds shareholders in order to place in market timing trades on behalf of his customers at Prudential Securities, Inc. The District Courts order, entered March 3, 2008, permanently enjoins Bilotti from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities law and orders Bilotti to pay a penalty of $20,000. In a separate related action, the SEC issued an Order barring Bilotti from associating with any broker, dealer or investment adviser, with a right to reapply after three years., In the District Court action, the Commissions complaint alleged Bilotti, a registered representative at the Boston branch office of Prudential Securities from 1999 to 2003, defrauded mutual fund companies and the funds shareholders in order to engage in market timing. Bilotti knew that the fund companies monitored activity in their funds and imposed restrictions on excessive trading, the complaint alleged. To conceal his own identity and the identities of his customers, Bilotti used numerous registered representative identification numbers and opened customer accounts under fictitious names, the complaint alleged. His use of multiple accounts and identification numbers was intended to, and did, make it more difficult for the fund companies to detect their clients market timing, thus misleading the fund companies to process transactions they would otherwise have rejected, the complaint alleged. The Courts injunction bars Bilotti from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder., Bilotti consented to the issuance of the final judgment in the District Court action without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, and consented to the Commissions Order without admitting or denying its findings., For further information, please see: Litigation Release Numbers <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18784.htm>18784</a> (July 14, 2004), and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18444.htm>18444</a> (November 4, 2003).

DiBella, the former Majority Leader of the Connecticut State Senate, and his consulting firm, North Cove Ventures, L.L.C. for their roles in aiding and abetting then Treasurer of the State of Connecticut, Paul J. Silvester in a fraudulent investment scheme. Pursuant to the scheme, Silvester had invested $75 million in state pension funds with Thayer Capital Partners, a Washington, DC-based private equity firm, and arranged for Thayer to pay DiBella a percentage of the investment, though he did not do work to justify the payment., The court ordered DiBella to disgorge $374,500 (the amount of his ill-gotten gains from the scheme) and to pay $307,127.45 in prejudgment interest. In addition, the Court imposed a penalty of $110,000. The Court declined to enter a permanent injunction or an officer-and-director bar against DiBella., The Commissions Complaint alleged that, beginning in November 1998, Silvester requested that Thayer, through its chairman, Frederic V. Malek, hire DiBella. Thayer agreed to retain DiBella and to pay him a percentage of the state pension funds total investment with Thayer, even though DiBella had no prior involvement with the transaction. The Complaint also alleged that Silvester increased the amount of the pension funds investment with Thayer by at least $25 million (to a total of $75 million) solely to secure a larger fee for DiBella., On May 18, 2007, after a seven-day trial, a jury found DiBella and North Cove liable for aiding and abetting Silvesters intentional violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the negligent violations by Malek, Thayer and its affiliates of Section 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

Esposito and Gregory A. King; Anscott Industries, Inc., a microcap company headquartered in Wayne, New Jersey; and Jack R. Belluscio, Anscotts chairman and chief executive officer. The Commission charges that Esposito, King, Belluscio and Anscott participated in a fraudulent touting scheme of Anscott stock., The complaint alleges that in April 2003, Esposito orchestrated a reverse merger between Anscott (then a private company) and Liquidix, Inc., a public shell company which, after the merger, changed its name to Anscott. According to the complaint, Belluscio, on behalf of Anscott, issued 4 million shares of Anscott stock to Esposito as compensation for arranging the reverse merger and for future stock promotion work. The complaint further alleges that Belluscio, on behalf of Anscott, filed a fraudulent Form S-8 registration statement with the Commission for the 4 million shares of Anscott issued to Esposito, which improperly enabled Esposito to sell these shares to the public during the fraudulent touting scheme., As alleged in the complaint, after the reverse merger and the issuance of shares to Esposito, Esposito paid King, another penny stock promoter with whom Esposito had worked previously, to prepare and disseminate materially false and misleading tout sheets promoting Anscott stock. The Commission alleges that these tout sheets — crafted to appear like independent investment newsletters and entitled the <i>Wall Street Bulletin</i> — recommended Anscott as a strong buy, and were disseminated to the public through fax spamming from late May 2003 through July 2003., According to the complaint, these tout sheets, which King prepared and Belluscio reviewed, contained materially false and misleading representations about Anscotts products, business affiliations, and projected revenues. The complaint further alleges that these tout sheets failed to disclose, among other information, that Esposito, who was paid by the company to promote Anscott stock, was paying King to prepare and disseminate these newsletters, and that Esposito was selling his Anscott stock during the touting scheme contrary to the <i>Wall Street Bulletins</i> strong buy recommendation and price targets., During the touting campaign, the price of Anscotts stock rose from around $1.40 a share in mid-May 2003, to a high of $4.59 a share on July 11, 2003. The complaint alleges that during this time, Esposito sold over 1.6 million shares of Anscott stock into the market, realizing over $5 million in illicit profits., By engaging in the conduct set forth in the complaint, the Commission alleges that:, The Commissions complaint seeks: (1) permanent injunctions and civil penalties against each of the defendants; (2) disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, with pre-judgment interest, from Esposito, King and Belluscio; (3) penny stock bars against Esposito and King; and (4) an officer and director bar against Belluscio., In addition, the Commission also today instituted an administrative proceeding against Anscott pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Exchange Act, to determine whether to suspend or revoke the registration of each class of Anscotts securities., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2008/comp20499.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20499.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Frederick, from future violations of the broker-dealer registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. Tuco and Frederick consented to the entry of the permanent injunctions without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions complaint., According to the Commissions complaint, the defendants provided securities day-trading capability to Tucos over 250 traders who had approximately $10.2 million in reported equity balances at Tuco. They permitted traders to day-trade securities in Tucos own brokerage accounts at registered broker-dealers through sub-accounts created at Tuco for each trader. The complaint alleged that Tuco provided traders with services not permitted at a registered broker-dealer. As alleged in the complaint, the defendants allowed traders to day-trade without meeting the $25,000 minimum equity requirement under NASD regulations for such trading. The complaint also alleges that for each $1 in the traders sub-account, Tuco and Frederick allowed the traders at Tuco to use up to $20 of Tucos equity, which had been invested by other traders, to purchase securities (20:1 buying power). NASD and NYSE regulations, however, only allow a day-trader to have 4:1 buying power., The Commissions complaint also alleged that Tuco received transaction-based compensation for its traders securities transactions, and Tucos traders conducted substantial day-trading through Tucos brokerage accounts both in dollar amounts and number of trades. As a result, Frederick earned substantial commissions on the trading as the registered representative for Tucos main accounts at a registered broker-dealer. The complaint alleged that Frederick then used substantial amounts of his commissions to pay Tucos operating expenses., The complaint also alleged that the defendants inaccurately reported to the traders their equity balances. Specifically, the complaint alleged that as of December 31, 2007, Tuco and Frederick had used about $3.62 million of the traders approximately $10.2 million total equity to pay Tucos expenses and to cover trader losses and that as of January 31, 2008, approximately a $1.35 million shortfall remained. As alleged in the complaint, Tuco and Frederick failed to disclose those details or that the traders recovery of the shortfall in the traders equity was dependent on Fredericks efforts., The judgment was entered by the Honorable Dana M. Sabraw, United States District Judge for the Southern District of California. The judgment permanently enjoins Tuco and Frederick from future violations of Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The judgment also freezes Tucos assets, appoints a permanent receiver over Tuco, and prohibits the destruction of documents. The judgment further orders Tuco and Frederick to pay disgorgement with prejudgment interest and civil penalties in amounts to be determined.

Carey &amp; Co., a manager of real estate investment trusts (REITs), and two of W.P. Careys senior executives for paying undisclosed compensation to a brokerage firm that sold the REITs to investors. W.P. Carey did not disclose the payments to the broker-dealer, as it was required to do in the REITs offering documents, and misrepresented the payments in the REITs periodic filings., REITs are entities that invest in different kinds of real estate or real estate related assets such as office buildings, retail stores, and hotels. The SEC complaint names as defendants W.P. Carey &amp; Co.; John J. Park, formerly the chief financial officer of W.P. Carey, until yesterday a managing director of strategic planning at W.P. Carey and currently an employee in charge of strategic planning; Claude Fernandez, formerly the chief accounting officer and currently a managing director of W.P. Carey; and Carey Financial, LLC, a broker-dealer subsidiary of W.P. Carey., To settle the SECs charges, W.P. Carey agreed to pay approximately $30 million — approximately $20 million in disgorgement and interest and $10 million in penalties. Parks settlement includes a five-year bar from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and a $240,000 penalty. Fernandezs settlement includes a two-year suspension from appearing before the Commission as an accountant and a $75,000 penalty., The SECs complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, makes several allegations., <b>Undisclosed Broker-Dealer Compensation:</b> Between 2000 and 2003, W.P. Carey paid nearly $10 million in undisclosed compensation to a broker-dealer that sold shares of W.P. Careys REITs to the public. The arrangement benefited not only the broker-dealer, but also W.P. Carey, because the broker-dealers sales of the REIT shares increased the management and other fees that W.P. Carey received. Although W.P. Carey received the benefits of this arrangement, W.P. Carey paid the broker-dealer by using nearly $10 million in cash assets of the affiliated REITs., W.P. Carey did not disclose the payments to investors. W.P. Carey, through Park and Fernandez, also requested sham invoices from the broker-dealer as a means to conceal the payments and circumvent applicable regulatory limitations on compensation to broker-dealers. By circumventing this limitation, W.P. Carey indirectly collected an excess of $6.4 million in fees and reimbursements from the REITs above what was legally permissible., <b>Undisclosed Payment for Proxy Solicitation Services:</b> In 2002, W.P. Carey proposed to merge two of its affiliated REITs, subject to approval by shareholders of the REITs. W.P. Carey caused the two REITs to pay $100,000 to a broker-dealer, which had sold the REITs shares to investors, to solicit shareholder votes in favor of the merger. In the registration statement and proxy materials for the merger, W.P. Carey failed to disclose the $100,000 payment that Park authorized to the broker-dealer for proxy solicitation services., <b>Unregistered Offering:</b> In 2002 and 2003, W.P. Carey and Carey Financial offered and sold more than $235 million of one of the affiliated REITs shares without a registration statement being in effect, in violation of the registration provisions of the federal securities laws., <b>Other Disclosure Failures:</b> W.P. Carey also failed to comply with other disclosure requirements. In filings with the Commission, W.P. Carey failed to disclose the bankruptcy of a company at which a W.P. Carey senior executive was previously the CFO. In addition, prior to 2004, the majority of executive officers and directors of the affiliated REITs failed to file forms required under Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the REITs annual proxy statements and reports falsely stated there were no Section 16(a) delinquent filings., The defendants agreed to settle the Commissions charges without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint. W.P. Carey agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud, reporting, proxy, books and records, and registration provisions of the federal securities laws — namely, Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, and 14a-9. W.P. Carey also agreed to pay a $10 million civil penalty and to pay $19,978,612.37 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest. The entire disgorgement and prejudgment interest will be distributed to the affected REITs. Carey Financial agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating Section 5(a) of the Securities Act., Park agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b), 13(b)(5), and 14(a) of the Exchange Act, and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, 13b2-1, and 14a-9, and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13. Park also agreed to consent to a bar from acting as an officer or director of any public company for two years, and to pay a civil penalty of $240,000. Fernandez agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act, Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, and Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1, and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13. Fernandez also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $75,000. Fernandez has also consented to the issuance of an SEC Order based on the entry of the injunctions that will suspend him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an accountant for two years., All of the settlements are subject to court approval.

In a related case, on September 17, 2007, the Commission filed a complaint in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, alleging that, over the past four years, Paloma repeatedly passed himself off to principals of private, cash-strapped companies as a legitimate financier, persuading company principals to issue to Paloma-affiliated entities large controlling blocks of stock, which were then resold in unlawful public offerings., According to the Commissions complaint, Paloma repeatedly circumvented the registration requirements of the federal securities laws in order to obtain large blocks of purportedly free trading shares.  With the free trading shares in hand, Paloma coordinated manipulative trading to artificially inflate the value of each issuers stock while also creating the appearance of an active trading market.  Paloma then coordinated the dissemination of millions of false and/or misleading blast fax and spam e-mails touting the companies shares.  Paloma realized profits of some $2,155,000 by dumping shares of the microcap issuers into the public market at prices artificially inflated by his manipulative trading and spam campaigns. The Commission alleged that Paloma carried out versions of this scheme using the shares of Courtside Products, Inc., Latin Heat Entertainment, Inc., Xtreme Technologies, Inc., PokerBook Gaming Corp., Commanche Properties, Inc., TKO Holdings Ltd. and Motion DNA Corp., In the Commissions action, Paloma consented to the entry of a final judgment (1) permanently enjoining him from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; (2) imposing a penny stock bar against him; and (3) directing that he disgorge $2,155,034 in unlawful profits, plus prejudgment interest of $364,265., Additional information can be found in <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20269.htm>Litigation Release No. 20269</a> (September 6, 2007); and Securities Act of 1933 Release No. 8892 (February 7, 2008).,  ]"

Ralph Gregory Gibbs</i>, Civil Action No. 3:08 CV 174(E.D.VA.)</h2>, <h2>SEC Files Settled Fraud Charges Against West Virginia Man Who Operated a Nationwide $21 Million Ponzi Scheme</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced the filing of a settled civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia against Ralph Gregory Gibbs, a resident of New Haven, West Virginia, who operated an offering fraud and Ponzi scheme.  The Complaint alleges that since at least April 2005 through February 2007, Gibbs, doing business as Golden Summit Group, raised approximately $21 million from at least 150 investors in at least 25 states through the offer and sale of securities.  Based on Gibbs promises that they would receive large returns on their investments and guaranteed returns of their principal, a significant number of the investors, many of whom were elderly, retired or otherwise living on limited incomes, liquidated their retirement savings or obtained home equity loans to invest the money with Gibbs., Simultaneous with the filing of the Commissions action, the U.S Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Virginia, announced that Gibbs pleaded guilty to criminal charges related to this conduct., The Commissions Complaint further alleges that in exchange for their investments in Golden Summit Group, Gibbs promised to pay investors interest of 3-5% monthly (up to 60% annually) and guaranteed that investors would not lose their principal.  Gibbs further represented that, due to his unique trading expertise, he could generate these exceptional returns by pooling investor funds and subsequently using those funds to trade currencies on the Foreign Exchange Market (Forex).  Gibbs, however, from the outset, operated a Ponzi scheme, which effectively created the illusion for investors that they were investing in a profitable trading program rather than a fraudulent scheme.  As part of this scheme, Gibbs made numerous material misrepresentations and omissions to investors concerning, among other things, the nature of the purported investment, the risks of investing, the use of the investors proceeds, the source of the investors returns, and his current and previous trading performance., The Commissions Complaint also alleges that of the approximately $21 million he raised from investors, Gibbs deposited only approximately $8.1 million into his Forex trading account, where he subsequently lost over $6.3 million of investor funds through his trading of currencies.  To conceal these losses, Gibbs used the cash flow generated from new investments, approximately $7.5 million, to pay existing investors the returns that he promised them.  He also misappropriated over $2.9 million of investor money to pay for his own personal expenses, including $1.14 million for a new, custom-built home.  As a result of this conduct, the Complaint alleges that Gibbs violated Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder., Simultaneous with the filing of the Complaint, and without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, Gibbs consented to the entry of a final judgment, subject to the Courts approval:  permanently enjoining him from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act, and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; ordering Gibbs to pay disgorgement, plus prejudgment interest thereon, totaling $21,421,418; but based upon Gibbs representations in his sworn statement of financial condition, waiving payment of all but the monies and assets Gibbs placed into a constructive trust for investors, namely $4,142,493 in cash, plus accumulated interest, two real estate properties and certain personal property; not imposing a civil penalty based upon his sworn representations in his statement of financial condition; and ordering the appointment of a receiver to assume control of the constructive trust for liquidation and ultimate distribution to the injured investors.The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Virginia, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, the West Virginia State Auditors Office, and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission., The Commission has provided information warning investors about High Yield and other offering frauds.

Oil for Food Program — Company Agrees to Pay Over $12.6 Million in Civil Penalties, Disgorgement of Profits, and Interest</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed Foreign Corrupt Practices Act books and records and internal controls charges against AB Volvo in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. AB Volvo is a Swedish company that provides commercial transport solutions, including trucks, buses and construction equipment. The Commissions complaint alleges that from 1999 through 2003, two of AB Volvos subsidiaries and their agents and distributors made approximately $6,206,331 in kickback payments, and authorized additional payments of $2,388,419 in connection with their sales of humanitarian goods to Iraq under the United Nations Oil for Food Program (the Program). The kickbacks were characterized as after-sales service fees (ASSFs), but no bona fide services were performed. One of Volvos subsidiaries also made other types of illicit payments to Iraq. The Program was intended to provide humanitarian relief for the Iraqi population, which faced severe hardship under international trade sanctions. The Program allowed the Iraqi government to purchase humanitarian goods through a U.N. escrow account. The kickbacks paid by AB Volvos subsidiaries diverted funds out of the escrow account and into Iraqi-controlled accounts at banks in Jordan., According to the Commissions Complaint:, Between November 2000 and July 2001, AB Volvos subsidiary, Renault Trucks SAS, entered into at least eighteen contracts under the Program to supply trucks. Renault Trucks then sub-contracted commercial bodybuilders to outfit the trucks with trailers or superstructures, commonly referred to as bodies, to tailor the trucks to the Iraqi ministries specifications. In order to mask its payment of ASSFs, Renault Trucks devised a scheme in which the bodybuilders facilitated the ASSF payments to Iraq. The bodybuilders added the cost of the ASSF into their bodybuilding costs and submitted the total cost to Renault Trucks for payment. The bodybuilders then passed the ASSF payments to Iraq. Internal documents discuss the fact that had Renault Trucks made the payments in its own name, we would have been caught red-handed. One bodybuilder signed side letters to pay the ASSF on Renaults behalf, and agreed to send Renault an invoice for the ASSF so that Renault would have paperwork to cover the scheme. ASSFs of $5,103,941 were paid, and another $1,255,922 was authorized but not paid., Prior to Iraqs imposition of ASSF payments, one of AB Volvos subsidiaries was paying kickbacks to obtain business. From October 1999 to July 2000, Volvo Construction Equipment International (VCEI) entered into four contracts under the Program in which more than $103,000 in kickbacks were paid to Iraqi ministries. On two contracts, illicit payments between 5% and 11.27% of the contract value were paid. An internal VCEI document discussed the extra trips VCEI staff had to make to Iraq in order to make the payments, and the possibility of having to give more than just payments. On one contract, VCEI documents indicate that VCEI gave its Jordanian Agent a total of $15,950 as the commitment to the third party whom support us and VOLVO to gain orders in the said ministry. In addition, VCEI internal documents show that $19,000 was given to the Jordanian Agent to purchase a car for the Ministry of Interior. VCEI did not disclose the payments or the car to the U.N., After Iraq began imposing ASSFs, VCEI or its distributors entered into five additional contracts. VCEI employees learned of the demands for ASSF payments when VCEI employees visited Iraq in November 2000. In an internal memorandum discussing the trip, the employees noted that the ASSF demand appears to be a clear violation of the UN Embargo Rules that we are expected to participate in. In an e-mail, VCEI personnel discussed the need for handling the ASSF payments with utmost discretion. On the first contract, VCEI inflated the U.N. contract price by ten percent, but did not disclose the ASSF to the U.N. VCEI then entered into a backdated agency agreement with its Jordanian Agent, who invoiced VCEI for its commission on the sale, including reimbursement of the ASSF payment. VCEI changed its method of doing business for future contracts in an effort to distance itself from the ASSF payments. VCEI made the Jordanian Agent its distributor, which allowed the Jordanian Agent to purchase vehicles directly from VCEI, and in turn sell directly to the U.N. at inflated prices. Thus, VCEI was no longer the party named on the U.N. contracts, but rather, the Jordanian Agent was the named party. With VCEIs knowledge, the Jordanian Agent made ASSF payments on these contracts. The Jordanian Agent did not have the infrastructure that normally would have been required by VCEI for its distributors, and VCEI did not enter into any written distributorship agreement. VCEI sold its products at a price that ensured the Jordanian Agent would have enough spread to enable the agent to make the ASSF payments. According to a U.N. report of an interview of the Jordanian Agent, the agent admitted that he personally paid kickbacks on behalf of VCEI. VCEI also used a Tunisian distributor to facilitate additional sales of its products to Iraq, and reduced its prices to the distributor to enable the distributor to make the ASSF payments. In total, VCEI or its distributors authorized more than $2.2 million in ASSF payments., AB Volvo either knew or was reckless in not knowing that illicit payments were either offered or paid in connection with these transactions. AB Volvo failed to maintain an adequate system of internal controls to detect and prevent the payments and its accounting for these transactions failed properly to record the nature of the payments. AB Volvo, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, ordering it to disgorge $7,299,208, in profits plus $1,303,441 in pre-judgment interest, and to pay a civil penalty of $4,000,000. AB Volvo will also pay a $7,000,000 penalty pursuant to a deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice, Fraud Section. Volvo is not the company that currently makes the Volvo brand car., The Commission considered remedial acts promptly undertaken by AB Volvo and the cooperation the company afforded the Commission staff in its investigation.

If convicted, Lauer faces a maximum sentence of 20 years and a $250,000 fine for each count of wire fraud and five years and a $250,000 fine for the conspiracy count. The Indictment also seeks forfeiture of properties obtained, directly or indirectly as a result of the alleged criminal violations., The Indictment alleges that from at least October 1999 through July 2003, Lauer, as founder and primary manager, formed and directed several hedge funds, collectively known as the Lancer Group hedge funds, to manipulate the month-end closing prices of shares of thinly-traded shell companies securities, to falsely overstate the value of the Lancer Groups holdings. According to the Indictment, Lauer purchased large quantities of restricted stock at pennies per share in private transactions and then purchased small amounts of the same securities for the Lancer Group to drive up the price by the end of the trading day. Lauer then falsely valued the securities held by the Lancer Group, including the restricted shares, at the much higher closing price, to pump-up the performance fees paid to the management companies, attract new investors to buy into the hedge funds, and induce current investors in the hedge funds., The Indictments allegations are based on the same conduct underlying the Commissions July 8, 2003, Complaint against Lauer in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. The Commission charged Lauer with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and as control person for Lancer Group under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act.

When it ultimately became impossible to continue concealing the companys inability to meet its own earnings guidance, Biovail actively misled investors and analysts about the reasons for the companys poor performance., Biovail settled the Commissions charges and will pay a $10 million penalty. Four current or former Biovail senior executives still face SEC charges: former chairman and chief executive officer Eugene Melnyk; former chief financial officer Brian Crombie; current controller John Miszuk; and current chief financial officer Kenneth G. Howling., The Commissions complaint alleges that in October 2003 Biovail and some of its executives schemed to deceive investors and analysts by falsely attributing nearly half of Biovails failure to meet its third quarter 2003 earnings guidance to a truck accident involving a shipment of one of Biovails products. Led by Melnyk, Biovail intentionally misstated both the effect of the accident on Biovails third quarter earnings as well as the value of the product involved in the truck accident. The accident, in fact, had no effect on third quarter earnings., The Commissions complaint also alleges three accounting schemes that affected reporting periods from 2001 to 2003., The Commissions complaint alleges that each of Biovails fraudulent accounting schemes had a material effect on Biovails financial statements for the relevant quarters and years and was engineered by Biovails senior management in order to inflate Biovails reported earnings. Biovail management also intentionally deceived the companys outside auditors as to the true nature of the transactions. The truck accident misstatements were intended to mislead investors about the significance of Biovails failure to meet its own earnings guidance., According to the Commissions complaint, Melnyk violated shareholder disclosure provisions by failing to include in his Schedule 13D filings Biovail shares held by several off-shore trusts that Melnyk controlled. Because Melnyk exercised both investment and trading authority over the shares in the trusts, Melnyk was a beneficial owner of the securities and was required to disclose that ownership in his Schedule 13D filings with the Commission., The Commission seeks a final judgment permanently enjoining all defendants from future violations of the Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5; Melnyk, Crombie, Miszuk, and Howling from aiding and abetting violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5; Biovail from violating Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-16; Crombie and Biovail from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act); Crombie from violating Rule 13a-14; Melnyk from violating Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13d-1 and 13d-2; Crombie and Miszuk from violating Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-16; and ordering them to pay civil penalties and disgorgement of any ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest.

In the lawsuit, the Commission alleged that from June 2001 through June 2002, these defendants participated in a scheme to inflate Riverstones publicly-reported net revenues through improper revenue recognition on contingent sales (SEC Lit.

Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions Complaint, the Defendants consented to entry of the Interlocutory Judgment prohibiting them from committing future violations of the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws.  The Commission may file a future application with the Court to determine monetary relief in the form of disgorgement, plus prejudgment interest, and an appropriate civil penalty., The Complaint, filed on August 13, 2007, charges Inter Global Technologies, Inc. (IGT) and Michael E. Tomayko with selling unregistered securities and misleading investors in connection with the offer and sale of IGT securities.  According to the Complaint, from about January 2004 until at least Fall 2006, Tomayko, age 59, of Irving, Texas, raised at least $14.5 million from over 900 domestic and international investors through a fraudulent, unregistered offering of preferred stock and joint venture interests in IGT, a Texas corporation., The Complaint alleges that Tomayko and IGT lured new investors and induced additional investment from existing ones by claiming to own three valuable licenses to construct Indonesian oil refineries and promising huge returns once the refineries were financed and built.  Tomayko repeatedly told investors that IGT would imminently receive funding for construction of the refineries from sources such as letters of credit or other bank instruments provided by a wealthy contact in Indonesia; a hidden vault filled with gold bullion controlled by Indonesian tribal elders; and investments by the Saudi royal family.  The Defendants represented that investor funds would be used to maintain IGTs Indonesian refinery licenses and procure financing to build the refineries., In reality, the Commission alleges, the Defendants claims were baseless.  Tomaykos schemes to finance the Indonesian refinery were based on dubious and unverified information, and the promised financing has never materialized.  Indeed, Tomayko used false bank and other documents to bolster his claims to investors that financing for the refineries was imminent.   Contrary to Defendants representation, Tomayko used millions of dollars of investor funds to pay his personal expenses and support his lavish international lifestyle, and he squandered millions more, without due diligence, chasing financing in Indonesia.

McDuff and Lancaster then created a materially false and misleading Private Placement Memorandum (PPM) for the Lancorp Fund, and between at least March 2003 and July 2005, Reese, McDuff and Lancaster offered and sold interests in the Lancorp Fund with false promises concerning the permissible investments, the payment of commissions, and the payment of management fees.

The defendants named in the Commissions Complaint are:, The Commissions Complaint alleges that the defendants, directly and through sales agents, have raised at least $17.9 million from September 2006 through February 2007 from the sale of SDOs to at least 182 investors located primarily in Texas, with additional investors in Wisconsin. Most of WFGs customers were elderly or seeking to invest retirement funds.  WFG investors were lured into purchasing SDOs through a series of misrepresentations and omissions that portrayed SDOs to be a higher-yielding, but equally safe, alternative to bank CDs.  For instance, the defendants offering materials asserted that SDOs were insured or reinsured by Lloyds of London and The Republic Group.  WFGs offering materials also represented that WFG would keep investor funds separate and apart from its property and would use investor funds for limited, specially enumerated purposes, such as creating or purchasing automobile financing receivables or placing the funds in government securities or highest-quality corporate bonds., The Commission alleges, however, that these representations are materially false and misleading.  For instance, the Commission contends that the SDOs are not insured as represented, if at all.   Indeed, according to the Complaint, the Lloyds and Republic Group insurance provides only miniscule coverage at best.  Moreover, as detailed in the Complaint, the defendants misused investor funds.  The Complaint alleges, for example, that defendants did not maintain investor funds in separate accounts and placed only a fraction of the funds in the investment vehicles disclosed to investors.  Instead, defendants allegedly have used millions of dollars to purchase the majority interest in an electric power company and fund its operations, to buy and develop residential real estate, and to buy unauthorized investment vehicles, such as a life settlement contract., The defendants are charged with securities fraud under Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and with conducting an unregistered offering under Section 5 of the Securities Act.

PCMs advisory client, Pentagon Special Purpose Fund, Ltd., obtained approximately $62 million in illicit profits through this scheme, at the expense of U.S. mutual funds and their shareholders.  The Commission named the Pentagon Fund as a relief defendant., The Commissions complaint names the following defendants/relief defendant:, The Commissions complaint alleges the following.  From approximately June 1999 through September 2003, PCM actively traded U.S. mutual funds through Pentagon Funds accounts at numerous broker-dealers in the United States.  PCM and Chester routinely engaged in late trading of U.S. mutual funds.  PCM placed orders on behalf of the Pentagon Fund, to buy, redeem, or exchange mutual fund shares after the 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time (ET) market close while still receiving the current days mutual fund price.  This illegal practice enabled Pentagon Fund to profit - at the expense of other shareholders in the U.S. mutual funds - from market events that occurred after 4:00 p.m. ET, but that were not reflected in the price that Pentagon Fund paid for the mutual fund shares., PCM and Chester also used deceptive techniques to market time U.S. mutual funds.  For example, PCM opened numerous accounts for the Pentagon Fund at various U.S. broker-dealers, and split Pentagon Fund trades among these multiple accounts to hide the extent of the Pentagon Funds trading from mutual fund companies.  PCM also used multiple accounts so that when a U.S. mutual fund detected market timing and informed the Pentagon Fund to stop, PCM would simply transfer funds to a new Pentagon Fund brokerage account that the U.S. mutual fund was unaware of, and Pentagon Fund would then resume market timing the same mutual fund., PCM, Chester, and the Pentagon Fund benefited from this late trading and deceptive market timing scheme at the expense of the U.S. mutual funds and their shareholders.  Pentagon Fund earned illicit profits of approximately $62 million.  PCM and Chester obtained ill-gotten gains, including performance and management fees for managing the Pentagon Fund., As a result of this conduct, PCM and Chester violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and violated, or aided and abetted violations of, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5.

The complaint alleges that Milne and Nolan carried out the fraud through a series of interlocking three-party transactions, structured as minor sale-leasebacks, to allow URI to recognize revenue prematurely and to inflate profits generated from the sales.  As a result of the fraud, URI materially overstated its financial results in its Forms 10-K for fiscal years 2000 and 2001, and its Forms 10-Q for the periods ended June 30, 2001 and March 31, 2002, as well as in other public releases., The complaint further alleges that shortly after URI announced 2001 and 2002 year-end results, Milne sold approximately $38 million of URI stock that he owned, knowing that the companys announced financial results were materially overstated., The Commissions complaint alleges that, as a result of his actions, Milne violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder, and aided and abetted URIs violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.

With assistance from a transfer agent and an attorney, allegedly CMKM fraudulently issued hundreds of billions of shares of purportedly unrestricted stock to John Edwards, the schemes mastermind, and his nominees, as well as to the nominees of Urban Casavant, the companys chief executive officer.  The Commission alleges that as Casavant generated demand for CMKM stock through fraudulent promotion of the company, Edwards, Casavant, and their nominees sold their shares into the public markets for at least $64.2 million in profit, much of which was paid to Casavant to support his extravagant lifestyle.  Allegedly, Edwards profited by about $26.4 million from sales through a single broker-dealer, Casavant profited by about $31.5 million, and Casavants nominees profited by about $6.3 million., The Commissions complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada, alleges that, from January 2003 to May 2005, CMKM improperly issued up to 622 billion shares of purportedly unrestricted stock.  According to the complaint, these issuances were based in large part on both written authorizations and attorney opinion letters prepared by Brian Dvorak, CMKMs lawyer, which were often facially inadequate, suspect, and inconsistent.  Allegedly, based on these faulty documents, CMKMs transfer agent, 1st Global Stock Transfer LLC, and its owner, Helen Bagley, issued stacks of stock certificates without restrictive legends.  Edwards, his nominees, Kathleen Tomasso and Anthony Tomasso, and Casavants nominees, James Kinney and Ginger Gutierrez, then allegedly deposited the certificates with various broker-dealers and sold the shares into the market.  NevWest Securities Corporation and its employees, Anthony Santos, Sergei Rumyantsev, and Daryl Anderson, are alleged to have sold more than 259 billion shares of CMKM stock for Edwards, despite numerous red flags indicating a massive unregistered distribution.  Meanwhile, Casavant allegedly generated investor interest in CMKM by using false press releases, Internet chat boards, and funny car race events across the country.  The complaint alleges that this promotion was extremely successful, and about 40,000 investors purchased CMKM stock during the period of the fraud without knowing that Casavant ran the company from his house in Las Vegas, and that CMKMs primary activity was to issue and promote its own stock., The Commission charged CMKM, Casavant, Edwards, Gutierrez, Kinney, the Tomassos, 1st Global, Bagley, NevWest, Anderson, Rumyantsev, Santos, and Dvorak with violating Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 by participating in an unregistered distribution of securities.  The Commission also charged CMKM and Casavant with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In addition, CMKM is alleged to have violated Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and Casavant is alleged to have violated Rule 13b2-1 under the Exchange Act.  Finally, the Commission charged Casavant with aiding and abetting CMKMs violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, as well as violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1 and 13a 13 thereunder for which CMKM was previously found liable in an administrative proceeding., The Commission seeks a permanent injunction against all defendants.

According to the Commissions complaint, the defendants conducted their entire online account intrusion scheme over the Internet and concealed their identities by, among other things, fraudulently opening brokerage accounts in the names of individuals who responded to a job advertisement on the Website Craigs List., According to the Commissions complaint, beginning in February 2007, the unknown traders posted an advertisement on Craigs List for a job with a fictitious Latvian brokerage firm, AWE Trading, Inc.  Individuals who responded to the advertisement provided their personal information, including social security numbers and dates of birth to AWE via the Internet for purported company background checks. The complaint further alleges the unknown traders actually used the personal information they collected from the individuals to open securities trading accounts online with Interactive Brokers LLC without the individuals knowledge., The Commissions complaint further alleges that, on multiple occasions between March 8 and April 24, 2007, the unknown traders gained unauthorized, online access to accounts held by customers of various retail brokerage firms.  They purchased and sold at least 18 securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ.  The unknown traders simultaneously bought and sold the same securities in the accounts they opened fraudulently, profiting from the change in trading volume and stock prices generated by the unauthorized transactions., The Commissions complaint charges the unknown trader defendants with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by engaging in the complex securities account intrusion scheme. The complaint also seeks a final judgment permanently enjoining the unknown traders from further violations of the securities laws and ordering them to repatriate assets of the fraudulent scheme they hold outside the U.S., to disgorge their ill-gotten gains, and to pay civil money penalties.   The Commissions complaint identifies Interactive Brokers, which fully cooperated in the staffs investigation, as a relief defendant because it currently holds cash and securities related to the scheme.

(filed April 7, 2008)</h2>, <h2>SEC CHARGES FIVE FORMER SAN DIEGO CITY OFFICIALS WITH FRAUD IN CONNECTION WITH CITY MUNICIPAL SECURITIES OFFERINGS</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Michael T. Uberuaga, the former San Diego City Manager, Edward P. Ryan, the former Auditor &amp; Comptroller, Patricia Frazier, the former Deputy City Manager for Finance, Teresa A. Webster, the former Assistant Auditor &amp; Comptroller, and Mary E. Vattimo, the former City Treasurer, with fraud in connection with the City’s false and misleading financial statements in five 2002 and 2003 bond offerings., According to the SEC’s complaint, these five former officials knew that the city had been intentionally under-funding its pension obligations so that it could increase pension benefits but defer the costs.  They were aware that the city would face severe difficulty funding its future pension and retiree health care obligations unless new revenues were obtained, pension and health care benefits were reduced, or city services were cut.  They specifically knew that the city’s unfunded liability to its pension plan was projected to dramatically increase, growing from $284 million at the beginning of fiscal year 2002 to an estimated $2 billion by 2009, and that the city’s liability for retiree health care was another estimated $1.1 billion.  The SEC’s complaint alleges that the officials violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder by failing to disclose these and other material facts to rating agencies or to investors in bond offering documents and continuing disclosures.  The complaint seeks a final judgment permanently enjoining the officials from further violations of the securities laws and ordering them to pay civil penalties., The Commission’s complaint, filed in federal district court in San Diego, alleges the following.  Uberuaga signed the closing letter for one of the bond offerings, falsely certifying that it was accurate and did not contain any misleading statements.  Ryan signed letters falsely representing that the city’s audited financial statements included in the securities offerings were accurate.  Frazier regularly reviewed and revised the false and misleading disclosure documents, and signed the closing letter for two of the five bond offerings.  She falsely certified that the disclosures were accurate and did not contain any misleading statements.  Additionally, she reviewed and made presentations to the rating agencies.  Webster reviewed the city’s financial statements that contained some of the false and misleading disclosures, and Vattimo participated in drafting the city’s false and misleading disclosures.  Additionally, Vattimo and Webster both knew that in 2003, the rating agencies had concerns about the city’s growing pension obligations and that those obligations could negatively affect the city’s credit rating.  Nevertheless, they withheld material facts from the rating agencies.  , The Commission previously entered an order sanctioning the City of San Diego for committing securities fraud by failing to disclose to the investing public important information about its pension and retiree health care obligations in the sale of its municipal bonds in 2002 and 2003.  To settle the action, the city agreed to cease and desist from future securities fraud violations and to retain an independent consultant for three years to foster compliance with its disclosure obligations under the federal securities laws.  , The Commission also previously filed a settled civil injunctive action against the outside auditors for the City of San Diego and its pension system, Thomas J.

Nasser. The complaint alleges that HAL and Nasser orchestrated a scheme to defraud mutual funds in the United States and their shareholders through late trading and deceptive market timing. HALs advisory client, Headstart Fund Ltd., obtained approximately $198 million in illicit profits through this scheme, at the expense of U.S. mutual funds and their shareholders. The Commission named the Headstart Fund as a relief defendant., The Commissions complaint names the following defendants/relief defendant:, The Commissions complaint alleges the following. From approximately September 1998 through September 2003, HAL actively traded U.S. mutual funds through Headstart Funds accounts at numerous broker-dealers in the United States. HAL routinely engaged in late trading of U.S. mutual funds. HAL placed orders on behalf of its client, the Headstart Fund, to buy, redeem, or exchange mutual fund shares after the 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time (ET) market close while still receiving the current days mutual fund price. This illegal practice enabled Headstart Fund to profit — at the expense of other shareholders in the U.S. mutual funds — from market events that occurred after 4:00 p.m. ET, but that were not reflected in the price that Headstart Fund paid for the mutual fund shares., HAL and Nasser also used deceptive techniques to market time U.S. mutual funds. For example, HAL opened numerous accounts on behalf of Headstart Fund at various U.S. broker-dealers, and split Headstart Fund trades among multiple accounts to keep the size of the trades below a certain threshold that mutual funds monitored in order to conceal the extent of Headstart Funds trading from U.S. mutual fund companies. HAL also used multiple accounts so that when a U.S. mutual fund company detected Headstart Funds market timing and informed the U.S. broker-dealers through whom the trades had been placed to stop, HAL would simply transfer funds to a new brokerage account of which the U.S. mutual fund company was not yet aware, and then resume market timing within the same U.S. mutual fund company., HAL, Nasser, and Headstart Fund benefited from this late trading and deceptive market timing at the expense of other shareholders in the U.S. mutual funds. Headstart Fund earned illicit profits of approximately $198 million from its late trading and deceptive market timing of U.S. mutual funds. HAL and Nasser obtained ill-gotten gains from the late trading and deceptive market timing scheme through, among other things, their receipt of performance and management fees for managing the Headstart Fund., As a result of this conduct, HAL and Nasser violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and violated, or aided and abetted violations of, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5. The complaint seeks as relief a final judgment: (i) permanently enjoining HAL and Nasser; (ii) ordering HAL, Nasser, and the Headstart Fund to disgorge their ill-gotten gains and to pay prejudgment interest; and (iii) imposing civil money penalties against HAL and Nasser., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2008/comp20524.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20524.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Purporting to act pursuant to a registration exemption under Regulation E of the Securities Act of 1933, these defendants structured a public offering in a manner that generated excess and unlawful proceeds and as a result, the offering failed to qualify for the Regulation E exemption. Further, these defendants fraudulently deprived the public of material information about Compass Capitals and others roles as underwriters for the offering and how the underwriters were compensated for distributing 21st Centurys securities. , In particular, the Commission alleges Compass Capital and its affiliates, including Lefkowitz and Hopf, bought shares at an undisclosed discount from 21st Century, with a view to distributing them in a public offering, thereby acting as undisclosed underwriters for 21st Centurys public offering. As a result, the offering raised more than $5 million in a twelve-month period, the maximum amount permitted under Regulation E. The unregistered sales of 21st Centurys shares therefore violated the Securities Acts registration requirements., The complaint further alleges that Romney, Dumble, and Traveller violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws by publishing materially false and misleading statements by 21st Century and that Dahl, Dumble, and Traveller aided and abetted 21st Centurys reporting, record-keeping, and internal controls violations. 21st Century reported false and materially misleading valuations and descriptions of several of its portfolio investments and failed to devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to assure that only authorized transactions were executed and that transactions were recorded accurately. , The Commissions complaint also alleges that Lefkowitz and Compass Capital each acted as a broker and dealer in connection with 21st Centurys public offering, although neither Lefkowitz nor Compass Capital was registered with the Commission as a broker-dealer, The Commission seeks a final judgment permanently enjoining defendants Lefkowitz, Dumble, Romney, and Traveller from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule l0b-5 thereunder; permanently enjoining defendants Romney and Traveller from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act; permanently enjoining defendants Compass Capital, Lefkowitz, Romney, and Hopf from violating Section 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act; permanently enjoining defendants Compass Capital and Lefkowitz from violating Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act; permanently enjoining defendants Dumble, Traveller, and Dahl from violating Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 (Dumble, Traveller, and Dahl), 13a-1 (Traveller and Dahl), 13a-11 (Dumble), and 13a-13 (Dumble, Traveller, and Dahl); permanently enjoining defendant Traveller from violating Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1; permanently enjoining defendants Dumble, Romney, and Dahl from violating Rule 13a-14 of the Exchange Act, enacted as part of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; permanently enjoining defendants Compass Capital and Lefkowitz, from violating Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13d-1; and ordering all of the defendants to pay civil penalties and disgorgement of any ill-gotten gains. , The Commission also seeks entry of an order barring Dumble, Romney, and Traveller from serving as officers or directors of any public company, and barring all defendants from participating in any future offerings of penny stock., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2008/comp20525.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20525.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The defendants include a former stock loan trader employed at JP Morgan Chase Bank (Chase), three so-called finders with whom he schemed and the two entities through which they perpetrated the fraud.  In its complaint, the Commission alleges that the defendants conspired to misappropriate Chases lending profits on a series of April 2003 stock loans made by Chase to Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein Securities LLC (DKW), and in doing so pocketed $1.2 million from their unlawful scheme., The defendants named in the Commissions complaint are:, <b>Robert Durant</b>, age 42, resides in Milford, Connecticut.  From 1994 through July 2003, Durant was a stock loan trader at Chase.  After leaving Chase, Durant worked briefly for a registered broker-dealer but is no longer employed in the securities industry., <b>Robert Johnson</b>, age 44, resides in Somers, New York.  From March 1999 through October 2004, Johnson purported to perform stock loan finding services through Tyde, Inc. (Tyde), which he formed in 1999.  Johnson currently holds series 7 and series 63 securities licenses., <b>Lori Caporicci</b>, age 39, resides in Staten Island, New York.  From 2001 through at least July 2003, she purported to perform stock loan finding services through Tyde as an independent contractor.  From 1989 through 1999, Caporicci worked as a stock loan trader for several broker-dealers., <b>James Bennett</b>, age 65, resides in New Port Richey, Florida.  From 1993 through April 2004, he purported to perform stock loan finding services through Bearcat Financial Services, Inc. (Bearcat), which he formed in 1993., <b>Tyde, Inc.</b> is a New York corporation with a business address in New York, New York.  Tyde is owned and controlled by Johnson., <b>Bearcat Financial Services, Inc.</b> is a Florida corporation with a business address in New Port Richey, Florida.  Bearcat is owned and controlled by Bennett., The Commissions complaint specifically alleges as follows:  Durant, a stock loan trader then employed by Chase, schemed with so-called stock loan finders Johnson, Caporicci, and Bennett to misappropriate the bulk of Chases profits on a series of stock loan transactions involving Italian securities.  As a result of the defendants scheme, DKW paid Bearcat, a stock loan finder firm owned by Bennett, sham finder fees out of the interest payments that DKW owed to Chase.  From May 2003 through June 2003, the defendants caused DKW to pay Bearcat a total of approximately $1.2 million in sham finder fees in connection with the loans.  Using off-shore and other nominee accounts, defendants Durant, Bennett, Johnson and Caporicci later split the sham finder fees among themselves.  Neither Bearcat nor Tyde, the firm through which Johnson and Caporicci conducted their stock loan finder business and perpetrated the fraud, performed any finding services at all on these loan transactions.  Under the terms of the loan transactions as originally recorded, all of the money paid to the defendants was to go to Chase, but Durant, pursuant to the scheme, later altered Chases stock loan records and caused DKWs records to be altered so as to drastically reduce the amount of interest payable to Chase — from an average of 7.15% down to 0.25% on each of the seven loans — and divert the balance to Bearcat., All 6 defendants are charged with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and, in the alternative, with aiding and abetting certain of each others violations of the above provisions of the federal securities laws.

(Capital Institutional Services), for defrauding Fidelity and its advisory clients. The complaint alleges that, between July and September 2003, the defendants defrauded Fidelity and its advisory clients by gaining access to confidential trading information stored on Fidelitys internal order database, by learning that Fidelitys advisory clients, including the Fidelity mutual funds, were purchasing and intended to continue purchasing a substantial amount of the common stock of Covad Communications Group, Inc. (Covad), by using that confidential information concerning Fidelitys pending securities orders to trade on and ahead of Fidelitys securities orders for the stock of Covad, by failing to disclose to Fidelity and its clients that they were trading on and ahead of those orders, and by profiting thereby., According to the Commissions complaint, Donovan accessed Fidelitys internal order database on approximately 107 occasions and obtained confidential information that Fidelity was purchasing and intended to continue purchasing for its advisory clients a substantial amount of Covad common stock. The complaint further alleges that Donovan requested authorization from Fidelity to trade Covad stock in his personal account during the same period, and was denied. According to the complaint, during the above-mentioned period, Donovan viewed Fidelitys pending Covad orders using the internal order database, communicated with Hinkle, disclosed confidential trading information of Fidelity and its advisory clients, and, shortly thereafter, Hinkle purchased the stock. In addition, the Commissions complaint alleges that after viewing Fidelitys orders and being denied permission to buy Covad stock, Donovan caused purchases of the stock to be made in the account of his mother, who is a resident of Marblehead, Massachusetts. According to the complaint, profits accrued to both Hinkle and Donovans mothers account when they sold out positions in Covad in the weeks following the purchases., The Commissions complaint alleges that Donovan and Hinkle violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Stummer alleging illegal trading in the common stock of Ryans Restaurant Group (Ryans), a restaurant company operating more than 340 restaurants in the Southern and Midwest United States.  The settlement is subject to Court approval., The Commissions complaint charges Stummer with violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder by fraudulently obtaining material, non-public information about the impending acquisition of Ryan and then using that information to trade Ryans securities.  The Commission complaint alleges that on July 21, 2006, Stummer and his family arrived at the New York home of his brother-in-law for an annual weekend gathering.  At this time his brother-in-law served as director of the private equity firm advising the acquiring company on the impending Ryans transaction.  During the weekend visit, Stummer snuck into the brother-in-laws bedroom office, where, secretly and without permission, he accessed his brother-in-laws bedroom office computer.  By correctly guessing his brother-in-laws password, Stummer deceptively gained unauthorized access to the private equity firms computer network and read several confidential and nonpublic emails relating to the Ryan transaction., The Commissions complaint further alleges that Stummer used the information he fraudulently obtained to buy 5,500 shares of Ryans on July 21, and July 24, 2006.  Shortly following the public announcement of the acquisition of Ryans on July 25, 2006, Stummer sold his entire position realizing a total profit of $22,351.17.  On the day of the announcement, the closing price for Ryans shares increased 40 percent from the prior days close, reaching a high of $15.70., Without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, Stummer consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The Commissions complaint charged that Mondschein reaped illegal profits by secretly selling the names and other confidential personal information of over 500 of his customers to six different insurance agents. The final judgment, entered on April 14, 2008, permanently enjoins Mondschein from violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and from aiding and abetting any violations of Rules 4(a), 5(a), and 10(a)(1) of Regulation S-P. The final judgment also orders Mondschein to disgorge all of his ill-gotten gains of approximately $53,000, plus prejudgment interest of approximately $4,680, and to pay a penalty of $45,000. In a separate related action, the SEC issued an Order barring Mondschein from associating with any broker or dealer, with a right to reapply after five years. Finally, the Court granted the SECs motion to dismiss relief defendant UNCI from the litigation with prejudice. Accordingly, the pending litigation has now been concluded., In the District Court action, the Commissions complaint alleged that Mondschein, a former Antioch, California stockbroker, sold his customers confidential personal information as sales leads solely to enable insurance agents to solicit these customers, many of whom had already purchased fixed or equity-indexed annuity products, to buy additional annuity products. The complaint further alleged that Mondschein never disclosed to any of these customers that he intended to sell, and did sell, their confidential personal information to insurance agents, and further alleged that he affirmatively misled his clients as to the nature of his compensation arrangements and relationships with the various insurance agents. According to the complaint, virtually all of Mondscheins customers were senior citizens., Mondschein consented to the issuance of the final judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, and consented to the Commissions Order without admitting or denying its findings., For further information, please see Litigation Release Number <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20386.htm>20386</a> (December 6, 2007)., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/admin/2008/34-57680.pdf>Administrative Proceeding 34-57680</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20531.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

As a result of the fraud, Broadcom restated its financial results in January 2007 and reported more than $2 billion in additional compensation expenses. Broadcom has agreed to settle the matter by consenting to pay a $12 million civil penalty and be permanently enjoined., In a complaint filed in the Central District of California, the SEC alleges that from June 1998 to May 2003, Broadcom, acting through its top officers, backdated the dates on which stock options were granted to executives and employees. Broadcoms Chairman and Chief Technology Officer and its former CEO sat on the two-member option committee that had authority to approve options to employees and all but the most senior executives, whose grants were to be decided by two independent directors comprising Broadcoms compensation committee., The SEC alleges that the option committee approved as many as 88 grants during the relevant period, but for many of these grants there was no meeting or decision made by the committee on the dates the grants were supposedly approved. Instead, Broadcoms former CFO allegedly selected many of the grant dates retroactively based on a comparison of Broadcoms historical stock prices, and the two option committee members allegedly concealed the backdating by signing false committee written consents stating that the grant had been approved as of the retroactive date. Through backdating, Broadcom made it appear that the options were granted at times corresponding to low points of the closing price of Broadcoms stock — despite the fact that the purported grant date bore no relation to when the grant was actually approved. This resulted in artificially and fraudulently low exercise prices for those options. In addition, the complaint alleges that the top officers — not the compensation committee — decided on option grants to Broadcoms executives and used hindsight to select the dates for them. According to the complaint, Broadcoms general counsel directed the preparation of false board and compensation committee consents to conceal some of these grants., The SEC further alleges that, as a result of the backdating scheme, Broadcom avoided reporting $2.22 billion in compensation expenses during the relevant period and thus overstated its income from between 15% to 422% and understated its loss from between 16% to 38%. The unrecorded compensation expenses and hidden backdating practices led Broadcom to provide false and misleading disclosures to its shareholders in filings with the SEC through 2005., Without admitting or denying the SECs allegations, Broadcom has agreed to settle the charges by consenting to a permanent injunction against further violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13, and 14a-9 thereunder. Broadcom also has agreed to pay a civil monetary penalty of $12 million. , Broadcoms settlement is subject to approval by the court.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20532.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

(TriCapital), an investment adviser registered with the Commission and located in North Bethesda, Maryland., Freedman pled guilty to an information from the United States Attorney for the District of Maryland, which charged that, between 2002 and 2004, Freedman defrauded clients of TriCapital. For example, between March 2002 and June 2003, Freedman took more than $300,000 from a trust account he controlled on behalf of a client, purportedly to make 19 transactions for stock purchases that were not in fact made. On June 14, 2004, Freedman also wrote a $5,000 check, drawn on the trust account, and made payable to the Washington Asset Group, a company owned by Freedman., In addition, according to the information, on August 2, 2002, another client of TriCapital established a living trust account. In March 2004, Freedman falsely told the client that the money was in securitized notes. In fact, $1.2 million of the clients funds had been wired to an account in the name of the Washington Asset Group. Freedman used the money to write a check for $1,048,545 to pay off a third TriCapital client whose account Freedman had largely dissipated; reimburse the trust account $45,000 for monies used by Freedman for his personal benefit; and write a check for $13,500 to purchase an automobile., On December 5, 2007, the Commission filed a civil action in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland against Freedman, based on the same conduct.

Berliner, a Wall Street trader formerly associated with Schottenfeld Group, LLC, with securities fraud and market manipulation for intentionally disseminating a false rumor concerning The Blackstone Groups acquisition of Alliance Data Systems Corp. The Commissions complaint alleges that on November 29, 2007 — approximately six months after Blackstone entered into an agreement to acquire ADS at $81.75 per share — Berliner drafted and disseminated a false rumor that ADSs board of directors was meeting to consider a revised proposal from Blackstone to acquire ADS at a significantly lower price of $70 per share. The Commission alleges that this false rumor caused the price of ADS stock to plummet, and that Berliner profited by short selling ADS stock and covering those sales as the false rumor caused the price of ADS stock to fall., According to the complaint, Berliner disseminated the false rumor through instant messages to traders at brokerage firms and hedge funds. Shortly thereafter, the news media picked up the story. As alleged in the complaint, heavy trading in ADS stock ensued, and within thirty minutes the false rumor had caused the price of ADS stock, which had been trading at approximately $77 per share, to plummet to an intraday low of $63.65 per share — a 17% decline in the share price. According to the complaint, the false rumor had such a significant impact on trading in the securities of ADS that day that the New York Stock Exchange temporarily halted trading in ADS stock. Later in the day, ADS issued a press release announcing that the rumor was false and by the close of trading, the price of ADS stock had recovered. Over 33,000,000 shares of ADS were traded that day — more than twenty times the previous days trading volume., By engaging in the foregoing conduct, the complaint alleges, Berliner violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 9(a)(4) and 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Hyatt, Jay Johnson and Hyatt Johnson Capital, LLC</i>, Civil Action No. 1:08-CV-2224 (N.D. Ill.)(Lindberg, J.)</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) announced that on April 18, 2008, the Honorable William J. Hibbler of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, acting as emergency judge, issued an ex parte order for emergency relief (the Order) against Defendants Jason R. Hyatt (Hyatt), a resident of St. Charles, Illinois, Jay Johnson (Johnson), a resident of Downers Grove, Illinois, and Hyatt Johnson Capital, LLC (HJ Capital), a privately-held company headquartered at Downers Grove, Illinois. The Order, among other things, imposed an asset freeze on all assets under the control of Defendants Hyatt and HJ Capital., The Commission earlier that day filed a civil injunctive complaint alleging that Defendants Hyatt, Johnson and HJ Capital, from approximately 2003 through 2007, while acting as unregistered broker-dealers and investment advisers, offered and sold to investors membership shares in at least ten Limited Liability Corporations (LLCs) controlled and managed by HJ Capital (the HJ Capital LLCs). The Defendants promised to use investor funds to purchase securities sold by LLCs managed by BCI Aircraft Leasing, Inc. (BCI) on behalf of the HJ Capital LLCs. In reality, according to the Complaint, at least $5.4 million was misappropriated, among other thing, to operate a Latin-themed restaurant in Chicago named De La Costa and to pay for Defendant Hyatts personal expenses, including numerous mortgage payments and substantial home improvements for two homes, as well as at least $155,000 worth of art and antiques, a Maserati, a Mercedes, a Hummer H2, a Yukon Denali, and other vehicles., The Complaint alleges that, as a result of their conduct, the Defendants violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 15(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder., Specifically, the Complaint alleges that, from approximately 2003 through approximately 2007, the Defendants raised at least $24.5 million from approximately 120 investors in at least twelve states. The Complaint also alleges that the Defendants represented to investors that the BCI LLCs would use investor funds, along with other sources of funds, to purchase commercial aircraft on lease to commercial airlines. In connection with the sale of a promissory note for approximately $2 million (the Promissory Note), the Defendants represented to an individual investor that his funds would be invested in a joint venture between BCI and HJ Capital called Chicago Aviation Partners, which would use the funds to purchase a group of commercial aircraft., The Complaint alleges that, unbeknownst to HJ Capital investors, from July 2006 to March 2007, Defendant Hyatt, through Defendant HJ Capital, misappropriated nearly $1.6 million in investor funds for his personal use. In addition, the Complaint alleges that Defendant Hyatt, through Defendant HJ Capital, misappropriated the $2 million from the Promissory Note investment to fund the startup costs of a Latin-themed restaurant in Chicago named De La Costa, which Hyatt co-owned with several other partners. According to the Complaint, when Defendant Johnson became aware of Hyatts misappropriation of this $2 million investment, Johnson chose to participate in a scheme with Hyatt to cover up his fraud, diverting at least $2.4 million that belonged to other investors to repay the note investor, thereby concealing the past misappropriation., The Complaint also alleges that, from 2003 to 2006, Defendant Hyatt, through Defendant HJ Capital, misappropriated nearly $1.8 million of investor funds in the form of undisclosed commissions from BCI in connection with the capital invested by HJ Capital LLCs in BCI offerings. BCI paid these commissions out of the investor funds it received from HJ Capital. According to the Complaint, Defendant Johnson knew or was reckless in not knowing that Hyatt was receiving undisclosed commissions, and yet failed to disclose this fact, and made other misleading statements to investors, in connection with subsequent offers or sales of securities., The Complaint also alleges that, unbeknownst to HJ Capital investors, BCI and its owner and CEO Brian Hollnagel (Hollnagel) had been defrauding investors by, among other things, failing to use investor funds to purchase aircraft as represented (sometimes never purchasing aircraft at all), misappropriating investor profits in certain LLCs in order to fund other unrelated purchases on behalf of BCI, and using some investors funds to make payments to other investors as purported returns., The Complaint alleges that the Defendants Hyatt, Johnson and HJ Capital falsely assured investors that, as part of their management of the HJ Capital LLCs, they had performed and would continue to perform due diligence regarding BCIs use of investor funds. Contrary to their representations, the Defendants did little, if anything, to verify the legitimacy of the BCI offerings. In fact, according to the Complaint, the Defendants received records indicating that BCI was diverting HJ Capital investor funds for improper uses, specifically, diversion to undisclosed, materially different BCI LLCs. Defendants thus knew or were reckless in not knowing of BCIs improper diversion of investor funds. Despite this, the Defendants failed to either adequately review or take action to follow up on these red flags. The Defendants also failed to disclose this information to HJ Capital investors., Previously, on August 13, 2007, the Commission brought an emergency enforcement action in the U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois, against BCI and Hollnagel.

At the time of the alleged misconduct, Boshell was an outside disinterested director of a Dallas-based business development company (BDC) and Pochopien was a shareholder of a Chicago-based law firm. The Commission alleges that Boshell and Pochopien engaged in unlawful insider trading in the securities of Laserscope in advance of a public announcement on June 5, 2006 that Laserscope would be acquired by American Medical Systems Holding, Inc. (American Medical)., In its complaint, the Commission alleges that, in May 2006, Boshell and Pochopien purchased Laserscope securities based on material, non-public information regarding the acquisition of Laserscope by American Medical. The Commission alleges that Boshell was made aware of the acquisition during a routine board meeting of the Dallas-based BDC approximately a month before the public announcement. The Commission alleges that Pochopien was made aware of the acquisition approximately a month before the public announcement when his law firm was hired by American Medical to conduct a due diligence review of the Laserscope acquisition. On the day of the announcement, Laserscopes common stock closing price of $30.65 was 43% higher than the proceeding day closing price of $21.41. By selling their Laserscope stock, Boshell profited $85,750 and Pochopien profited $134,970., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Boshell and Pochopien have agreed to settle the Commissions charges by consenting to the entry of final judgments that would: (i) permanently enjoin them from further violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; (ii) order them to pay $85,750 and $134,970, respectively, in disgorgement; (iii) order them to pay $11,381 and $17,914, respectively, in prejudgment interest; and (iv) order them to pay civil penalties of $85,750 and $134,970, respectively., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2008/comp20541.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20541.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Charles Norton sat on the board of directors of Community Bancorp and had access to sensitive information about the acquisition through his attendance at Community Bancorp board meetings.  The complaint alleges that Charles Norton tipped Chad Norton, who traded ahead of the announcement.  Charles and Chad Norton realized illegal profits of $35,064.71 from the trades., According to the SECs complaint, Charles Norton learned confidential information about Community Bancorps acquisition of Valley Bancorp at a May 2006 Community Bancorp board of directors meeting and later informed his son about the acquisition.  Chad Norton traded based on that inside information, buying 7,000 Valley Bancorp shares between May 16, 2006 and the June 28 announcement.  On the first trading day after the announcement, Valley Bancorps stock price increased more than 13 percent, and its trading volume increased 2,885 percent.  In July 2006, Chad Norton sold the Valley Bancorp shares for a profit of $35,064.71., To settle the SECs charges, Charles and Chad Norton have consented, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, to a final judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, to pay $38,433.72, representing the disgorgement of their illegal trading profits and prejudgment interest, and each to pay a civil penalty of $35,064.71.

Treacy and former controller Anthony Bonica participated in a scheme that began in 1997 to fraudulently backdate stock options to coincide with the dates of low closing prices for the New York-based companys common stock., The SEC is alleging that this scheme resulted in grants of in-the-money options to numerous individuals without Monster properly describing its options practices in its public filings or properly accounting for these options in its financial statements.  As a result of their conduct, Monster misrepresented that all stock options were granted at the fair market value of the stock on the date of the award, when that was not the case.  Monster also filed materially misstated financial statements with the SEC in its Forms 10-K and 10-Q that did not recognize compensation expense for the companys stock option grants, as required by generally accepted accounting principles.  As a result, Monster overstated its aggregate pre-tax operating income by approximately $339.5 million for fiscal years 1997 through 2005., The SECs complaint further alleges that Treacy and Bonica personally benefited from the fraudulent scheme by receiving and exercising backdated grants of in-the-money options., The SEC is charging Treacy with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b), 13(b)(5), 14(a) and 16(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, 13b2-2, 14a-9 and 16a-3 thereunder, and for aiding and abetting Monsters violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13.

Ala., filed April 30, 2008)</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil action today in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama against Birmingham Mayor Larry Langford, William Blount, and Albert LaPierre.   The SECs complaint alleges that while Langford served as president of the County Commission of Jefferson County, Alabama (County Commission), he accepted more than $156,000 in undisclosed cash and benefits over the course of two years from Blount, the chairman of Blount Parrish &amp; Co, Inc.   Blount Parrish is a broker-dealer based in Montgomery, Alabama., According to the SECs complaint, Langford selected Blount Parrish to participate in every Jefferson County municipal bond offering and security-based swap agreement transaction during 2003 and 2004, earning Blount Parrish over $6.7 million in fees.   Moreover, the SEC alleges, Langford and Blount concealed the payment scheme by using their long-time friend, LaPierre, an Alabama registered political lobbyist, as a conduit.   The case is the SECs first enforcement action involving security-based swap agreements., The SECs complaint alleges that prior to Langfords election to the County Commission, Blount Parrish had not received any municipal bond business from Jefferson County for years.  After Langford won the primary election in 2002 for the County Commission, however, Blount began making payments and conferring other benefits to Langford, funneling funds through LaPierre.  The SEC alleges Blounts efforts were rewarded because Langford, who served as president of the County Commission from November 2002 to November 2007, selected Blount Parrish to participate in $6.4 billion of Jefferson County bond offerings and swap agreement transactions from March 2003 to December 2004.  Blount Parrishs fees for these transactions comprised over 70% of the firms annual revenue during the relevant period, according to the SECs complaint., The SEC alleges that of the five municipal bond offerings at issue, Blount Parrish participated as lead or co-underwriter on three municipal bond offerings, and as a remarketing agent on a fourth bond offering.  In connection with all five bond offerings, Langford signed the official statements, which were intended to disclose material information to investors, on behalf of Jefferson County.  In its role as underwriter or remarketing agent as to four of the bond offerings, Blount Parrish reviewed the official statements and distributed those materials to investors in connection with its sale of these securities.  The official statements did not disclose Blounts payments to Langford., The SEC further alleges that Langford directed that Blount Parrish be included in four security-based swap transactions, including a $1.5 billion transaction which was the largest swap transaction in Jefferson Countys history.  Langford signed letter agreements with the counterparties to the swap transactions representing that Jefferson County had requested and approved fee payments to Blounts firm for services to Jefferson County in connection with the swap transactions.  Other than the swap counterparties, the fees Blount Parrish received on these swap transactions were substantially larger than those received by other professionals on the deals.   However, according to the SECs complaint, neither Langford nor Blount disclosed to Jefferson County Blounts payments to Langford., The complaint charges Langford, Blount and Blount Parrish with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; Blount and Blount Parrish for violations of Section 15B(c)(1) of the Exchange Act and Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board  Rules G-17 and G-20; and LaPierre with aiding and abetting Blount and Blount Parrishs violations.  The complaint seeks judgments against each defendant providing for permanent injunctions, disgorgement with prejudgment interest and a civil money penalty.   The SEC previously prevailed in subpoena enforcement actions filed against Langford and Blount, both of whom had refused to either testify or assert a valid privilege when questioned about these payments during the SECs investigation.

(“McCann”) and the Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. (“IPG”).  The Commission alleged that McCann committed securities fraud when it misstated its financial results by failing to expense properly intercompany charges.  IPG negligently failed to address the intercompany problems at its largest subsidiary, McCann.  IPG also violated the reporting, internal controls and books and records provisions of the securities laws in connection with a variety of issues that were reflected in various restatements IPG issued from August 2002 through September 2005 totaling more than $600 million.  IPG and McCann agreed to settle the Commission’s charges, and McCann agreed to pay a $12 million civil penalty., The Commission’s complaint named the following defendants., The Commission also brought settled charges against Salvatore LaGreca and Brian Watson (in a separate complaint) for their role in failing to reconcile intercompany accounts that resulted in the 2002 restatement.  , The Commission’s complaints alleged the following:,  From August 2002 through September 2005, IPG issued numerous restatements that together totaled more than $600 million.  The restatements corrected misstatements in IPG’s financial statements that emanated from numerous substantive areas in a variety of geographic regions, and reflected conduct ranging from inaccurate books and records and lack of internal controls to fraud. , Initially, in the Fall of 2002, IPG restated its financial results in an amount of $181 million for the period 1997 to 2002.  The largest component of this restatement (approximately $101 million) was attributable generally to the fact that McCann recorded as receivables intercompany charges that should have been expensed.  McCann officers and employees, including LaGreca and Watson, failed to ensure McCann reconciled its intercompany accounts for at least six years.  At times, LaGreca and Watson purposely delayed reconciling intercompany accounts because they knew a reconciliation would result in write-offs that would interfere with McCann’s efforts to hit internal annual profit targets.  Because McCann never fully reconciled its intercompany accounts and failed to expense properly intercompany charges, McCann’s financial results were inaccurate.  By 2002, McCann’s intercompany accounts were misstated by approximately $101 million.  As LaGreca and Watson knew, IPG then incorporated McCann’s financial results in IPG’s consolidated financial statements.  , IPG’s financial management negligently ignored indications McCann was improperly accounting for intercompany transactions.  Accordingly, IPG negligently ignored the risk that McCann’s results were materially misstated, with the result that IPG’s own financial results were materially misstated., IPG’s financial reporting problems were not resolved in 2002.  In September 2005, IPG again restated its pre-tax income for the years 2000 through 2003, and the nine months ended 2004, in the amount of $420 million.  According to the complaint, a large portion of this restatement was related to $199 million of improperly recognized revenue related to Agency Volume Bonifications (AVBs) and other vendor discounts and credits that IPG took in violation of its contracts with certain of its clients.  The 2005 restatement was necessary because there had been a substantial breakdown of internal controls at IPG, and its numerous subsidiaries, including McCann., IPG filed numerous Forms 10-K, Forms 10-Q, Forms 8-K, and registration statements that contained misrepresentations due to the intercompany issues, the AVB issues, and the various other issues that were reflected in the 2002 and 2005 restatements.  For example, in its 2002 Form 10-K, IPG reported net income of $99.5 million.  This figure, however, was improperly inflated by $82.8 million, and IPG’s actual income, as reflected in the restatements, was only $16.7 million (a 496% overstatement)., IPG, McCann, LaGreca and Watson settled the Commission’s charges without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaints.  IPG agreed to consent to a final judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13 thereunder, McCann agreed to consent to a final judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of Sections Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and aided and abetted IPG’s violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13.  McCann also agreed to pay a $12 million penalty and $1 in disgorgement for its role regarding intercompany accounts resulting in the 2002 restatement., LaGreca and Watson agreed to settle this matter by consenting to final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and from aiding and abetting violation of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13.  LaGreca and Watson also agreed to pay a civil penalty, in the amounts of $25,000 and $50,000, respectively, and to disgorge all gains derived from their violative conduct plus pre-judgment interest, in the amounts of $46,947 and $17,325, respectively., In related administrative proceedings, LaGreca consented to an order under Rule 102(e) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice suspending him from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant for five years based on the entry of an injunction against him., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/2008/comp20547-lagreca.pdf>SEC Complaint re: LaGreca</a><br/><img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/> <a href=/litigation/complaints/2008/comp20547-ipg.pdf>SEC Complaint re: IPG</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20547.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The SEC sued Las Vegas-based Gold-Quest International and its principals, David M. Greene, age 54, John Jenkins, age 62, and Michael McGee, age 52, all residents of Las Vegas, NV, for allegedly running a Ponzi scheme and misappropriating investor funds. The Honorable Lloyd D. George, United States District Court Judge for the District of Nevada, issued an order freezing assets and appointing a temporary receiver over Gold-Quest and its affiliates., The SECs complaint, filed in federal court in Las Vegas, alleges that since May 2006, the defendants have raised and misappropriated more than $27.9 million from more than 2,100 investors in the United States and Canada. The complaint further alleges that, undisclosed to investors, the defendants paid more than $19.1 million as returns to other investors in this Ponzi scheme. According to the SECs complaint, Gold-Quest and its owners claim they are not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States or Canada because they are members of the Little Shell Nation Indian tribe, purportedly headquartered in North Dakota. However, the Little Shell Nation is not in fact recognized as a sovereign tribe or nation., In its lawsuit, the SEC obtained an order (1) freezing the assets of Greene, Jenkins, and McGee; (2) freezing and repatriating the assets of, and appointing a temporary receiver over, Gold-Quest and its affiliates; (3) preventing the destruction of documents; and (4) temporarily enjoining Gold-Quest, Greene, Jenkins, and McGee from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

According to the complaint, each issuer provided offering materials to investors that stated it would pay approximately 12% in sales commissions to brokers selling the securities and that the remaining funds will be used for corporate purposes. The complaint further alleges that the issuers, with the knowledge of the CEOs and the issuers lawyer, paid Bryant, who acted as an unregistered securities broker, undisclosed commissions of 25% to 30%, thereby substantially reducing the amount of funds available for business purposes., Without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, the settling defendants consented to final judgments that: (1) permanently enjoin Braunberger, Masuda, Matson, Hyperbaric, Bryant, and Comco from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; (2) permanently enjoin Marotta from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; (3) permanently enjoin Bryant from future violations of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act; (4) bar Bryant from participating in any future offering of penny stocks; (5) order Masuda to pay a $25,000 civil penalty; (6) order Matson to pay a $25,000 civil penalty; and (7) find Marotta liable for $264,000 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $163,379; however, based on the representations in Marottas sworn financial statements the judgment waives payment of disgorgement except for $50,000 and $328.12 in post-judgment interest and does not impose a civil penalty.

Rather than report compensation expenses to shareholders, as required at the time for these in-the-money options, Marvell backdated the options to dates with lower stock prices, and falsely represented that the options had been granted at-the-money (at market price) on earlier dates., Marvell and Dai settled the SECs charges without admitting or denying the allegations and will pay financial penalties of $10 million and $500,000, respectively., According to the SECs complaint, filed in federal district court in San Jose, the scheme allowed Marvell to overstate its income by $362 million from its fiscal years 2000 through 2006.  The SEC alleges that Dai, acting as Marvells Stock Option Committee, routinely reviewed lists of Marvells historical stock prices and picked the date with the lowest (or one of the lowest) stock prices since the previous grant date.  This date would then be communicated to Marvell personnel as the date on which the Stock Option Committee had purportedly met and authorized the option grant.

On April 15, 2008, and March 11, 2008, the court entered the judgments against defendant Alfred Peeper and relief defendants Oriental New Investments, Ltd. (ONI), and Orienstar Finance, Ltd. (OFL) in two civil enforcement actions brought by the Commission.  In its complaints, the Commission charged that Peeper, ONI, and OFL were involved in complex schemes to manipulate the common stocks of AbsoluteFuture.com (AFTI) and Wamex Holdings, Inc. (WAMX), respectively.  According to the complaints, the manipulation schemes occurred from July 1999 through June 2000 and employed false and misleading press releases and manipulative trading techniques.  Among other things, the judgments ordered Peeper, ONI, and OFL to disgorge trading profits totaling $12,869,543 and to pay prejudgment interest totaling $8,017,919.48., The complaint in SEC v. Wamex Holdings, Inc., et al. was filed on October 11, 2001, and named 22 defendants, including Peeper, and four relief defendants, including ONI and OFL.  The April 15, 2008 judgment against Peeper permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws - namely, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also ordered that Peeper, ONI, and OFL are jointly and severally liable to pay disgorgement totaling $9,096,298, representing their trading profits in the WAMX scheme, plus prejudgment interest of $5,667,130.92, for a total of $14,763,428.92.  In addition, Peeper was ordered to a pay civil money penalty of $110,000 and was permanently barred from participating in an offering of penny stock, including engaging in activities with a broker, dealer, or issuer for purposes of issuing, trading, or inducing or attempting to induce the purchase or sale of any penny stock.  Previously, in October 2002, July 2004, and March 2007, the Commission obtained default judgments in the WAMX litigation against 20 of the 21 other defendants and both of the other relief defendants.  The litigation is continuing as to the remaining party, defendant Eugene Geiger., The complaint in SEC v. Absolutefuture.com, et al. also was filed on October 11, 2001, and named 12 defendants, including Peeper, and four relief defendants, including ONI and OFL.  The March 11, 2008 judgment against Peeper permanently enjoins him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also ordered that Peeper, ONI, and OFL are jointly and severally liable to pay disgorgement totaling $3,773,245, representing their trading profits in the AFTI scheme, plus prejudgment interest of $2,350,788.56, for a total of $6,124,033.48.  In addition, Peeper was ordered to pay a civil money penalty of $110,000.  Previously, in January 2003, February 2003, and October 2004, the Commission obtained default judgments in the AFTI litigation against 10 of the 11 other defendants and one of the two other relief defendants.  The litigation is continuing as to the remaining parties, defendant Eugene Geiger and relief defendant VJV, Inc., The Commission alleged in its complaints that Peeper, a financier residing in Spain, participated in the schemes by purchasing large blocks of AFTI and WAMX stock at undisclosed discounts through trades prearranged with co-defendant Edward A. Durante.  According to the complaints, relief defendants ONI and OFL, which are Hong Kong corporations with offices in Switzerland and Spain, were unjustly enriched by Peepers illegal trading of AFTI and WAMX stock in their brokerage accounts, which he controlled.  The complaints alleged that the transactions were manipulative in nature because they were misleadingly reported to the market and created a false impression of the trading volume and the demand for AFTI and WAMX shares.  Overall, the manipulation schemes increased AFTIs stock price from a low of $0.21 per share in December 1999 to a high of $6.00 per share in March 2000, and increased WAMXs stock price from a low of $1.375 per share in December 1999 to a high of $19.50 per share in February 2000., For additional information, see Litigation Release Numbers <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17177.htm>17177</a> (October 11, 2001), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17178.htm>17178</a> (October 11, 2001), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17180.htm>17180</a> (October 11, 2001), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17602.htm>17602</a> (July 9, 2002), and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18004.htm>18004</a> (February 27, 2003).,  ]"

All three defendants reside and practice medicine in the Ft. Lauderdale, Florida area., The SECs complaint concerns illegal trading in the shares of two unrelated companies. In the first, the complaint alleges that Zachariah breached his fiduciary duty to IVAX and its shareholders only a few months after being appointed to serve as a company director. IVAXs then-chairman and CEO called Zachariah and other IVAX directors on July 6, 2005 after agreeing with the then-CEO of Teva Pharmaceuticals Ltd. on preliminary terms for Teva to acquire IVAX. Within minutes of that call, and even though IVAX was in a blackout period during which the company forbade officers and directors from trading in IVAX stock, Zachariah placed the first of four separate IVAX stock purchase orders that he made in his online brokerage account that day. Zachariah purchased 35,000 shares of IVAX stock at a cost of approximately $730,000., The SEC further alleges that Zachariah later unlawfully tipped his brother, M. Zachariah, who purchased 2,000 shares of IVAX stock at a total cost of approximately $46,000 on the last trading day before IVAX announced on July 25, 2005 that Teva would acquire it. , According to the SECs complaint, Zachariahs IVAX stock purchases were not the first time that he engaged in illegal trading while in possession of non-public information. He also misappropriated material, non-public information about Sarasota, Fla.-based Correctional Services Corporation, which operated correctional and detention facilities., The SECs complaint alleges that from May through July 2005, Zachariah bought over $200,000 worth of Correctional shares and his brother and close friend, Nassberg, each made multiple purchases of Correctional stock in the week leading up to a public announcement on July 14, 2005, by The GEO Group, Inc., that it would acquire Correctional. Zachariah, a GEO consultant, obtained material, non-public information about a GEO-Correctional deal either from his consulting relationship or from one or more of the GEO insiders with whom he had a familial or other close, personal relationship. Zachariah supplied the inside information to his brother and Nassberg, who purchased approximately $162,000 worth and $32,000 worth of Correctional stock, respectively., The SEC alleges that the defendants violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

In June 2005, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Hurley consented to a partial resolution of the case, agreeing to entry of a judgment enjoining him from violating or aiding and abetting violations of the antifraud, recordkeeping, internal controls, and other provisions of the federal securities laws (Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-11, 13a-13, and 13b2-1) and to be permanently barred from acting as an officer or director of any public company., In the Commissions complaint filed against Hurley in June 2005, the Commission alleged that prior to aaiPharmas 2003 fiscal third quarter end, Hurley arranged fraudulent sales transactions with customers to create the illusion that aaiPharma had met or exceeded its sales goals for the quarter.

The complaint further alleged that in the fourth quarter of 2003, Hurley arranged a fraudulent sales transaction with an aaiPharma customer. According to the complaint, although the transaction gave the customer the right to return the product, aaiPharma falsely recorded it as a final sale.

Pa.)</h2>, <h2>Thomas J. Gerbasio and Beacon Rock Capital Sentenced in Criminal Action Charging Deceptive Market Timing</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) announced today that Beacon Rock Capital LLC (Beacon Rock), a hedge fund located in Portland, Oregon, and Thomas J. Gerbasio (Gerbasio), a former registered representative with a registered broker-dealer based in Philadelphia, have been sentenced in connection with the first U.S. criminal case brought against a hedge fund for deceptive market timing. On May 7, 2008, Judge Eduardo C. Robreno of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, sentenced Gerbasio to one year and one day in prison, two years of supervised release, and ordered him to pay a fine of $7,500. Judge Robreno further sentenced Beacon Rock to three years of probation, and ordered the hedge fund to forfeit $475,905 and to pay a fine of $600,000., The criminal action began with an Information filed on March 20, 2007, by the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, charging Beacon Rock and Gerbasio with securities fraud. According to the Information, from December 1999 through November 2003, Gerbasio, while associated with two brokers registered with the Commission, provided brokerage services to Beacon Rock. The Information charged that the primary purpose of this relationship was to permit Beacon Rock, whose primary trading strategies involved market timing, to evade and circumvent controls implemented by mutual funds seeking to restrict market timing or other excessive trading. Gerbasio and others at his direction, engaged in a number of deceptive and fraudulent practices designed to conceal the identity of Beacon Rock and the nature of its trading activity, resulting in more than 26,000 Beacon Rock market timing trades. The U.S. Attorney charged Beacon Rock and Gerbasio with, and the defendants pled guilty to, securities fraud in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) [15 U.S.C. §78j(b)] and Rule 10b-5 thereunder [17 C.F.R. 240.10b-5]., In the civil injunctive action filed by the Commission on April 21, 2005 against Gerbasio and another defendant, the Commission alleged that from at least August 2002 until October 2003, Gerbasio defrauded hundreds of mutual funds and their shareholders by engaging in deceptive market timing practices for two hedge fund customers, with the result that thousands of market timing trades were placed that would otherwise have been rejected by the fund companies. On March 30, 2006, the U. S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania entered a Final Judgment by consent, permanently enjoining Gerbasio from violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §78j(b)] and Rule 10b-5 thereunder [17 C.F.R. 240.10b-5], and ordering Gerbasio to pay disgorgement together with prejudgment interest in the amount of $540,044, but waiving payment of all but $100,000. The Court did not impose a civil penalty, based on Gerbasios sworn financial statements submitted to the Commission., On April 10, 2006, the Commission issued an Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions barring Gerbasio from association with any broker or dealer.

(Ahold), engaged in a large-scale fraud that, for fiscal years 2001 and 2002, materially overstated operating income by an aggregate amount of approximately $700 million in Commission filings and other public announcements., The Commissions complaint further alleges that Spears and others at USF induced third parties to confirm false information to USFs outside auditors.  Spears and others at USF did this to make it falsely appear that amounts recorded on USFs books and records as accounts receivable were earned.  As alleged in the complaint, Spears called vendors at USFs 2001 fiscal year-end and 2002 fiscal year-end and worked with others at USF to convince the vendors to sign the confirmation letters and return them to USFs auditors., Spears has agreed to settle the Commissions action, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, by consenting to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder.

The scheme was orchestrated by Duchesne, and began with a matched trade between Duchesne and Hayden that artificially inflated Nationwides stock price from pennies to $9.35 per share.

The complaint also names Jason Steph, a former supervisory employee in Nigeria, Gerald Jansen, a former administrative supervisor in Nigeria, Lloyd Biggers, a former employee in Nigeria and Carlos Galvez, a former accounting employee in Bolivia. According to the complaint, the company also violated the reporting, books and records and internal controls provisions of the Securities Exchange Act. Willbros Group, Steph, Jansen, Biggers and Galvez have agreed to settle the charges against them, without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations., The Commission alleges in its complaint that Willbros Group, through the actions of others acting on its behalf, engaged in multiple schemes to bribe foreign officials. First, the complaint alleges that, beginning by at least 2003, Willbros Group, through the conduct of a former executive officer, Steph and others, engaged in a scheme to pay over $6 million in bribes to Nigerian government officials and to employees of an operator of a joint venture majority-owned by the Nigerian government in order to obtain a significant contract. A similar scheme was used to help obtain a second significant contract. Together, these contracts resulted in net profits of approximately $8,900,000. In 2005, according to the complaint, Steph assisted in the payment of $850,000 to satisfy a portion of these earlier commitments. The complaint further alleges that Willbros Group, through acts by a former executive officer, Steph, Jansen, Biggers and others, employed a long-running scheme using fabricated invoices to procure cash from the companys administrative headquarters in Houston to, among other things, bribe Nigerian tax and court officials. This fraudulent cash abuse was also used to fund in part the bribes paid in 2005., Second, Willbros Group, through the conduct of the same former executive officer and others schemed to pay a $300,000 bribe to officials of an oil and gas company owned by the Ecuador government in order to obtain a $3 million contract., Finally, Willbros Group, through the actions of the same former executive officer, an outside consultant and Galvez implemented a fraudulent tax avoidance scheme in Bolivia. This fraudulent scheme resulted in material misstatements in Willbros Groups financial statements., The Commission alleges that, through these activities, Willbros Group violated Sections 30A, 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder, as well as Section 17(a) of the Securities Act.

Steph consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of these provisions. Pursuant to the judgment, the Court will determine later whether Steph will pay a civil penalty and what the amount of such penalty will be., Jansen, for his role in Nigeria, is alleged to have violated Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder and to have aided and abetted violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B) and 30A of the Exchange Act.

He has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of these provisions., Finally, the Commission alleges that Galvez, through his conduct in Bolivia, violated Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder and aided and abetted violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder. Galvez has agreed to consent to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of these provisions and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $35,000., The Commission acknowledges Willbros Groups cooperation in the investigation., In a related criminal proceeding, the United States Department of Justice filed a criminal Information and Deferred Prosecution Agreement in the Southern District of Texas relating to the criminal FCPA charges against Willbros Group and its subsidiary, Willbros International, Inc.

(Nutraceutical or the Company), a public company based in St. Petersburg, Florida. The Courts judgment (1) enjoins Kennedy from violating the anti-fraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, and the registration provisions of Section 5(a) and (c) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act); (2) orders Kennedy to disgorge $1,685,413.71 in ill-gotten gains (including prejudgment interest) from his participation in the pump-and-dump scheme; (3) imposes a $400,000 civil money penalty; and (4) bars Kennedy from participating in any offering of penny stock., The Commissions complaint, filed on November 15, 2004, alleges that in 2000 and 2001 Kennedy, along with fellow stock promoter Stanley Siciliano, attorney John Zankowski and Nutraceutical CEO Paul Simmons and CFO Rodney Gilbert, engaged in a multi-faceted pump-and-dump scheme involving the securities of Nutraceutical, which now, under different management, operates as Preservation Sciences, Inc. and EFUEL Network, Inc.

As part of a reverse merger transaction Kennedy helped to arrange, and in contravention of the registration provisions of the federal securities laws, CEO Simmons, CFO Gilbert, promoter Kennedy and attorney Zankowski secretly purchased nearly all of Nutraceuticals purportedly free trading stock through their offshore nominee accounts. They did so in order to make a public market for the illegal, unregistered distribution of their stock., To drum up interest in the Company and to facilitate their anonymous distribution, Simmons disseminated false and misleading publicity about Nutraceutical, while, at the same time, stock promoters Kennedy and Siciliano falsely touted the stock on an Internet message board and manipulated the market for the Companys stock through fraudulent stock trading via matched and washed buy and sell orders. According to the Courts order, Kennedys actions showed that he was aware of the true value of Nutraceuticals stock, while simultaneously deceiving potential investors to increase the profit of his stock sale. During the course of the pump, Kennedy unlawfully dumped Nutraceutical stock through nominee accounts, reaping $1,144,583.95 in profits., Previously, the Court had entered final judgments against all five of the other defendants in the Commissions lawsuit, enjoining them from further violations of the anti-fraud, registration or anti-touting provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering disgorgement, imposing monetary penalties and barring some of them from serving as officers or directors of public companies or participating in offerings of penny stock., In February 2008, the Court entered judgment against defaulting defendants Paul Simmons and Rodney Gilbert, Nutraceuticals former CEO and CFO, respectively.

Kelly (Kelly), a former South Bend, Indiana businessman that the Commission previously charged with securities fraud in a civil action filed in September 2007. The information alleges that Kelly engaged in a fraudulent investment scheme by offering and selling through fraudulent means approximately $34 million in promissory notes and more than $450 million in investments called Universal Leases. The criminal information charges Kelly with 10 counts of mail fraud, two counts of wire fraud and two counts of securities fraud and also seeks the forfeiture of approximately $500 million. Kelly was initially charged in a criminal complaint when he was arrested in December 2006., The criminal charges against Kelly are based on the same conduct underlying the SECs September 5, 2007 civil action filed against Kelly and 25 other defendants. The SECs complaint alleges that Kelly and the other defendants participated in a massive fraud on U.S. investors that involved the offer and sale of securities in the form of Universal Leases. Universal Lease investments were structured as timeshares in several hotels in Cancun, Mexico, coupled with a pre-arranged rental agreement that promised investors a high, fixed rate of return. The SECs complaint alleges that from 1999 until 2005, Kelly and others raised at least $428 million through the Universal Lease scheme from investors throughout the United States, with more than $136 million of the funds invested coming from IRA accounts. The SEC further alleges that a nationwide network of unregistered salespeople who sold the Universal Leases collected undisclosed commissions totaling more than $72 million. The SEC also alleges that Kelly and others ran the scheme from Cancun, Mexico, through a number of foreign entities in Mexico and Panama. According to the SECs complaint, Kelly and others told investors that Universal Leases would generate guaranteed income through the leasing of investor timeshares by a large, independent leasing agent. In fact, the complaint alleges, the leasing agent was a small Panamanian travel agency controlled by Kelly, and for most of the scheme its payments to investors came from accounts funded by money raised from new investors. Further, the complaint alleges that Kelly and the other defendants failed to disclose key facts about the Universal Lease investment, including the risks of the investment and that more than $72 million in investor funds were used to pay commissions as high as 27% to the selling brokers. The SECs action, which is pending, seeks injunctions against each of the defendants from further violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, and civil penalties. , For further information, see Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20267.htm>20267</a> (Sept. 5, 2007).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20573.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Nicholas, chairman and chief technology officer Henry Samueli, former chief financial officer William J. Ruehle, and general counsel David Dull perpetrated a scheme from 1998 to 2003 to fraudulently backdate stock option grants, failing to record billions of dollars of compensation expenses and falsifying documents to further the fraud.  As a result of the scheme, Broadcom restated its financial results in January 2007 and reported more than $2 billion in additional compensation expenses.The SEC alleges that, through this scheme, the four officers made it appear that the options were granted at times corresponding to low points of the closing price of Broadcoms stock - despite the fact that the purported grant date bore no relation to when the grant was actually approved.  This resulted in artificially and fraudulently low exercise prices for those options.  The SEC also alleges that the unrecorded compensation expenses and hidden backdating practices led Broadcom to provide false and misleading disclosures to Broadcoms shareholders in filings with the SEC through 2005., According to the SECs complaint, Nicholas and Samueli served on the two-member option committee that had authority to approve options to employees and all but the most senior officers, whose grants were to be decided by two independent directors comprising Broadcoms compensation committee.  The SEC alleges that the option committee approved as many as 88 grants during the relevant period, but for many of the grants the committee neither held meetings nor made decisions on the dates the grants were supposedly approved.  Instead, Ruehle allegedly selected most of the grant dates retroactively based on a comparison of Broadcoms historical stock prices, and Nicholas and Samueli allegedly concealed the backdating by signing false committee written consents stating that the grant had been approved as of the retroactive date., In addition, the SEC alleges that Nicholas, Samueli, and Ruehle - not the compensation committee - decided on option grants to Broadcoms senior officers and used hindsight to select the dates for them.  Dull allegedly knew about and participated in the backdating scheme and was involved in the preparation, review, and approval of false board and compensation committee meeting documents to conceal two backdated grants in 2001, one of which awarded him options to purchase 300,000 shares.The SEC is alleging that Ruehle and Dull each personally benefited from the backdating scheme by receiving and exercising backdated grants that were in-the-money by more than $100,000 for Ruehle and $1.8 million for Dull., The SECs complaint alleges that Nicholas, Samueli, Ruehle and Dull violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder, and aided and abetted Broadcoms violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.  In addition, the SEC alleges that: (i) Nicholas, Ruehle, and Dull violated Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 thereunder; (ii) Nicholas and Ruehle violated Rules 13a-14 and 13b2-2 of the Exchange Act; (iii) Ruehle and Dull violated Section 16(a) and Rules 13a-11 and 16a-3 of the Exchange Act; and (iv) Dull aided and abetted Broadcoms violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Standefor, age 40 of Altadena, California, and Pasadena, Calif.-based Accelerated Funding Group (AFG), for operating an $18 million real estate investment scheme targeting the African-American community., The SECs complaint, filed in federal district court in Los Angeles, alleges that between 2005 and 2007, Standefor and AFG solicited investors in a foreclosure reinstatement scheme through AFGs website, word of mouth, and testimonials by other seemingly successful investors. Standefor claimed investor funds would be used to cure defaults on distressed properties enticing investors with promises of returns of up to 50% within 30 to 45 days. AFG offering materials touted the foreclosure reinstatement program as virtually risk free and promised investors that their principal would be safely returned within 72 hours at their request., In reality, according to the SECs complaint, Standefor and AFG did not use investor funds to cure defaults on any residential properties and investors requests for returns of their investments have been ignored. Standefor and AFG have instead operated a Ponzi-like scheme by using money from new investors to pay previous investors. Standefor misappropriated more than $1.9 million of investor funds for personal expenses such as her lavish wedding, honeymoon, cars, jewelry, tickets to entertainment events, and home renovations. Standefor and AFG also misused investor funds to pay $121,000 in consulting fees to Standefors husband, Darrell R. Dansby., The SECs complaint alleges that the defendants violated the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933.

Solow to Pay Over $6 Million In Disgorgement and Penalties for Violating the Antifraud Provisions and Aiding and Abetting Violations of Various Broker-Dealer Net Capital, Books And Records, And Reporting Provisions of the Federal Securities Laws</h2>]","[On May 14, 2008, the Honorable Donald M. Middlebrooks of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida permanently enjoined Jamie L. Solow, a former registered representative who resides in Hillsboro Beach, Florida, from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), and ordered Solow to disgorge $3,424,788.90 in ill-gotten gains (including prejudgment interest) from his violations and to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $2,646,485.99, based upon a jury verdict that had been returned against Solow in January 2008. The Courts order also enjoined Solow from aiding and abetting violations of various broker-dealer net capital, books and records, and reporting provisions and from attempting to register as a broker-dealer or investment adviser or being associated with a broker-dealer or investment adviser., On January 31, 2008, following a nine-day jury trial, the jury found that Solow had violated these antifraud provisions and had aided and abetted violations of the net capital, books and records, and reporting provisions committed by one of his former firms, Archer Alexander Securities Corp. (Archer Alexander). The Commissions complaint, filed on November 8, 2006 and amended on September 24, 2007, alleged that in 2003, while associated with Archer Alexander, Solow engaged in a fraudulent trading scheme involving inverse floating rate collateralized mortgage obligations (inverse floaters), a highly complex, risky, and volatile type of mortgage-backed security derivative. Solow fraudulently evaded trading restrictions imposed on him by Archer Alexander and entered into numerous non-riskless principal transactions in which he secretly bought new issues of inverse floaters worth millions of dollars from other dealers for settlement at later dates without having an offsetting sale arranged or authorization from Archer Alexanders chief executive officer. The value of the resulting proprietary positions far exceeded Archer Alexanders available net capital, thereby exposing the firm to substantial risk without its knowledge or authorization. To hide the fact that his trades were not riskless principal transactions, Solow made numerous misrepresentations and omissions, including directing his assistant to prepare and submit false trade tickets that made it appear as though he had bought and sold blocks of inverse floaters on the same day. Archer Alexander, unaware of the actual circumstances of these transactions, paid Solow millions of dollars in compensation during 2003 for inverse floater trades that he carried out pursuant to this fraudulent scheme., The Commissions complaint also alleged that during 2003 to 2006, while associated with Archer Alexander and another registered broker-dealer, SAMCO Financial Services, Inc. (SAMCO), Solow sold inverse floaters to retail investors with conservative to moderate investment objectives or low net worth for whom these complicated, volatile, and risky securities were unsuitable investments. Solow defrauded his customers by grossly understating the risks of investing in inverse floaters. While at SAMCO, Solow recommended that his customers use high levels of margin to purchase inverse floaters, yet failed to adequately and truthfully apprise them of the increased risks associated with doing so. Eventually, as interest rates rose during the second half of 2005 and early 2006, the value of the inverse floaters that Solow had purchased for his customers, as well as the monthly interest and principal payments on these securities, declined dramatically. Many of Solows customers, including numerous elderly or retired investors, incurred heavy or total losses when they liquidated their accounts or were unable to meet margin calls., The Courts May 14, 2008 order stated that, [d]uring the trial I saw Mr. Solow blame others for his failings, refuse to accept any responsibility for his own actions, and repeatedly testify falsely under oath. Based upon his demeanor and testimony at trial, and after watching his video presentation to investors and hearing the testimony of those individuals he enticed into risky investments through false promises, I conclude he should not be allowed to register as, or associate with a registered broker-dealer or investment adviser.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20580.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The Honorable Paul A. Crotty, United States District Judge in the Southern District of New York, issued a temporary restraining order freezing De Collis assets in the U.S., including his brokerage account, containing more than $2.1 million in ill-gotten gain from his insider trading.  The order also grants expedited discovery, an order permitting alternative means of service, and an order preventing the alteration or destruction of documents., The Commissions complaint alleges that while in possession of material, nonpublic information regarding merger talks between DRS and Finmeccanica S.p.A, Cristian De Colli purchased shares and call options of DRS common stock.  The Complaint further alleges that after public disclosure of the merger talks, De Colli liquidated all of his call options for an illicit profit of five times the amount of his original investment., According to the Complaint, De Colli purchased 5,700 shares of DRS common stock from April 10 to April 29, 2008, and 3,116 call options for the common stock of DRS between April 15 and May 7, 2008.  De Colli purchased more than 2,400 of the call options on May 6 and May 7, including certain options that were out-of-the-money by over $6 and which expired ten days after purchase.  On April 28, 2008, De Colli liquidated securities that he had purchased in two other companies a week earlier in order to purchase additional DRS options.  At that point, 100 percent of the holdings in De Collis U.S.-based brokerage account consisted of DRS call options and DRS stock., The SECs complaint further alleges that immediately following a May 8th Wall Street Journal article reporting the advanced merger negotiations and after confirmation by DRS that it was engaged in talks regarding a potential strategic transaction, De Colli liquidated all of his call options and made his ill-gotten profit of more than $2.1 million on his initial investment of approximately $422,000.  Finmeccanica later announced on May 12, 2008 that it would acquire DRS for $5.2 billion, or $81 a share., The Commissions complaint further alleges that, in an interview with SEC staff, De Colli stated that no family members, friends, or anyone else he knew had ever worked for Finmeccanica.  According to the Complaint, contrary to his statement, however, De Collis older brother worked for Finmeccanica between 2004 and 2005., By virtue of the conduct described above, the Commission alleges in its complaint that De Colli violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Seaman as permanent receiver over defendant Safevest, LLC., The Commissions complaint, filed in federal court in Santa Ana, California on May 1, 2008, alleges that since at least May 2007, the defendants have raised more than $25 million from more than 500 investors, including many from the Christian community, misrepresenting that investor funds would be pooled and invested in commodity futures trading, that the investment would generate daily profits ranging from 1.5% to 1.9%, and that investors could receive their money back within 72 hours of requesting it. In reality, according to the complaint, no investor money was invested in futures trading, and requests by investors for withdrawal of their funds have either not been honored or have only been partially honored. The complaint further alleges that, undisclosed to investors, the defendants paid more than $18 million to investors in Ponzi-like fashion. The defendants also allegedly misappropriated investor funds for the personal use of Ervin, Slye, and their family members., Pursuant to the order entered May 12, 2008, defendants Safevest, Ervin, and Slye are preliminarily enjoined from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Gane is a principal of each of the issuing entities. The complaint further alleges that the defendants told investors that their money would be used to purchase or develop real estate, but instead Gane: (i) used new investor funds to pay back earlier investors; (ii) misappropriated investors funds by using them to pay himself, his family, and others; and (iii) transferred substantial portions of investor funds to Denkon, Inc., Guy W.

With Violations in Stock Options Backdating Scheme</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a civil injunctive action against Brooks Automation, Inc., a Chelmsford, Massachusetts semiconductor capital equipment company, alleging that it overstated income and understated employee compensation expenses in its financial statements by $64.5 million during the period from 1996 through 2005 as a result of its failure to properly account for employee stock options. Without admitting or denying the allegations, Brooks agreed to settle to charges that it violated the reporting, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws., According to the complaint, a backdated exercise in 1999 by former President and CEO Robert J. Therrien and other grants for which the company improperly accounted resulted in misleading disclosures, with Brooks overstating its net income by as much as 30% in fiscal year 2000 alone. Brooks misstated in its public filings that all stock options were granted at or above the fair market value of the stock on the date of the award, when that was not the case. Brooks also filed misstated financial statements with the SEC in its Forms 10-K and 10-Q that did not recognize compensation expense for the companys stock option grants, as required by generally accepted accounting principles., The Complaint alleges that, in November 1999, Therrien, upon learning that an option to exercise 225,000 shares had expired worthless the preceding August, participated in creating, and signed, false documents resulting in the issuance of in-the-money options to him, which he immediately exercised, to purchase 225,000 shares of Brooks. As a result of his fraudulent exercise alone, Therrien received $5.7 million in undisclosed compensation from Brooks. Brooks failed to report this compensation, and its effects on Brooks financial statements, in its filings with the SEC. Therrien was previously charged by the Commission in a separate, unsettled action filed in July 2007., The Complaint further alleges several instances of company-wide options grants with purported grant dates that were inaccurate. For example, according to the complaint, the option grant with a purported date of October 1, 2001 in fact was not finalized until November 30, 2001. During that period the price of Brooks stock rose by more than $11 per share, producing immediate compensation to the recipients of the grant of approximately $22 million, which Brooks failed to disclose in its financial reports., Brooks, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, agreed to settle the matter by consenting to a permanent injunction from further violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder., For further information, please see Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20210.htm>20210</a> (July 25, 2007) [unsettled action filed against Therrien]., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2008/comp20584.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20584.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Manterfield is a defendant in a pending Commission enforcement action in the United States in which the Commission obtained emergency relief, including an asset freeze, against Manterfield and others in connection with an alleged on-going fraudulent hedge fund operation. , On February 29, 2008, the Commission filed a limited notice application with the High Court of Justice, Queens Bench Division seeking an emergency order freezing approximately $1 million in assets held by Manterfield in the United Kingdom. The Commission filed the application after learning that a separate freeze order previously obtained by British authorities against Manterfields assets might be lifted. After a hearing on the Commissions application on February 29, 2008, the British Court issued an order freezing the assets until Thursday, March 6, 2008. Manterfield consented to continue the freeze until an evidentiary hearing could be held to determine whether the freeze should be extended. An evidentiary hearing was held in the High Court of Justice on April 30, 2008 and May 1, 2008. On May 16, 2008, the British Court issued an order continuing the freeze of Manterfields assets until the resolution of the Commissions pending enforcement action in the United States. , The Commission had previously filed its U.S. enforcement action on April 12, 2007 in the U.S. District Court in Massachusetts against Manterfield, Evan Andersen, of Boston, Massachusetts, and Lydia Capital, LLC, a registered investment adviser based in Boston, Massachusetts. The Commissions Amended Complaint alleges that, between June 2006 and April 2007, Manterfield and Andersen, acting through Lydia, engaged in a scheme to defraud more than 60 investors, who invested approximately $34 million in Lydia Capital Alternative Investment Fund LP, a hedge fund managed by Lydia. The Amended Complaint alleges that defendants told investors that they intended to use the Funds assets to acquire a portfolio of life insurance polices in the life settlement market. According to the Amended Complaint, Manterfield, Andersen, and Lydia made a series of material misrepresentations and omissions, including but not limited to: (1) materially overstating, and in some instances completely fabricating the Funds performance; (2) inventing business partners, offices, and investors in an attempt to legitimatize the firm and concealing the truth as to why key vendors and banks ceased relationships with the defendants; (3) lying about Manterfields significant criminal history, and failing to disclose a February 2007 criminal asset freeze in England; (4) lying about how the Fund planned to address certain material risks and failing to disclose others; and (5) misstating the nature of the Funds assets and its investment process. In addition, the Amended Complaint alleges that Manterfield and Andersen misappropriated millions of dollars of investors funds by withdrawing investor monies to which they were not entitled., On April 12, 2007, the U.S. District Court issued a temporary restraining order that, among other things, froze the three defendants assets. On May 3, 2007, following a hearing before the Court on May 2, 2007, the Court issued a consented-to preliminary injunction and ordered a continuation of an asset freeze of the defendants assets. The action is pending against all three defendants. , The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Financial Services Authority of the United Kingdom and the Securities Division of the Secretary of State of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, which also filed an action against the parties on April 13, 2007. , For further information, see Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20102.htm>20102</a> (May 3, 2007).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20585.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Rindner, former senior executive in the companys Business Affairs unit; Joseph A. Ripp, former Chief Financial Officer of the companys AOL division; and Mark Wovsaniker, former head of Accounting Policy, engineered, oversaw, and executed fraudulent round-trip transactions in which AOL Time Warner effectively funded its own advertising revenue by giving purchasers the money to buy online advertising that they did not want or need. Online advertising revenue was a key measure by which analysts and investors evaluated the company. The defendants made or substantially contributed to statements to investors that included the companys fraudulent financial results. Kelly and Wovsaniker, both certified public accountants, also are charged with misleading the companys external auditor about the fraudulent transactions., The complaint charges Kelly, Wovsaniker, Ripp, and Rindner with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act), Exchange Act Rules 10b-5 and13b2-1, and with aiding and abetting AOL Time Warners violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13, and 13b2-1 and charges Kelly and Wovsaniker with violations of Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 13b2-2.

However, the defendants failed to disclose to their clients that in the fall of 2007, Plus Money transferred $10 million from the Premium Return Funds to relief defendant Palladium Holding Company, an entity controlled by relief defendant Lopez, or that Palladium used about half that amount to engage in short-sale transactions involving Treasury Bonds and transferred most of the remainder to various individuals and entities, many of which are associated with or controlled by Lopez.

The Orders preliminarily enjoin the Defendants from violating the anti-fraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws in connection with a $72 million Ponzi scheme. The Orders also continue the asset freezes and certain other ancillary relief previously ordered by the Court on May 5, 2008., The Commissions complaint, filed May 5, 2008, alleged that McKnight and Legisi Holdings conducted a fraudulent, unregistered offering of securities in which, between December 2005 and at least November 2007, they raised approximately $72 million from more than 3,000 investors in all 50 states and several foreign countries through the Legisi website at www.legisi.com.

According to evidence presented at the criminal trial, Mathur used investor funds to, among other things, buy a Porsche Cayenne, purchase Mercedes Benz luxury vehicles, and fund gambling trips to Las Vegas for Mathur and his friends., Mathur is currently scheduled to be sentenced on September 5, 2008.

Judge Snyder ordered that each of the defendants be enjoined from future violations of the federal securities laws, including the anti-fraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Cimini Sr., and Philip Prichard with securities fraud for their participation in a fraudulent scheme to evade registration requirements and engaging in a pump and dump stock manipulation scheme.  The Commission also settled fraud charges against California-based securities attorney, Carmine J. Bua, who authored a fraudulent legal opinion, which authorized the issuance of purportedly unrestricted Global shares.  Further, the Commission charged defendants Prichard and Pietro Cimino with conducting a fraudulent private offering of Global stock., The Commissions complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, alleges that from June through August 2005, defendants engaged in a complex scheme to evade the registration requirements by obtaining a fraudulently backdated convertible promissory note, using a forged assignment to assign the note to three foreign entities and then converting the note into unrestricted Global shares.  The complaint alleges that defendant Bua drafted the assignment and legal opinion letter authorizing the issuance of unrestricted shares, despite possessing information which undermined the validity of the note and its subsequent assignment., The complaint further alleges that the defendants then engaged in a pump-and-dump scheme by arranging for Global to issue numerous press releases that contained false and misleading information relating to Globals purported clients, pending contracts and revenue projections.  According to the complaint, at least one entity defendant Mrakuzic controlled sold illegally issued Global shares into an artificially inflated market generating profits of approximately $1.2 million.  In addition, defendant Panella sold illegally issued Global shares for profits of nearly $1.1 million., The complaint also alleges that during July 2005, defendants Global, Prichard, and Cimino conducted a private offering of Global stock and provided investors with offering materials containing many of the same false and misleading statements contained in the press releases.

Yaroshinsky consented to the entry of the judgment without admitting or denying any of the allegations of the Commissions complaint.  Yaroshinsky is liable for disgorgement in the amount of $354,927, plus prejudgment interest thereon in the amount of $84,275, and a civil penalty of $283,798., The Second Amended Complaint in this matter alleges that Yaroshinsky, a former Vice President of Clinical Operations and Biostatistics for California-based Connetics Corporation, learned material non-public information concerning the FDA staffs preliminary analysis of the carcinogenicity tests of Velac Gel, an acne drug then being developed by Connetics.  The Second Amended Complaint alleges that Yaroshinsky tipped his co-defendant Victor Zak to this information and then traded on it himself.  In the end, Zak profited substantially from his illegal trading.  Zak settled charges related to this case last year, and agreed to disgorge $863,830 in illicit profits, along with an injunction against future violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Commission waived payment of $216,358 of that figure based on Zaks sworn financial statements and other documents submitted to the Commission., To settle the matter against him, Yaroshinsky is paying disgorgement of $138,569 for his own trades, plus an equal civil penalty of $138,569 and prejudgment interest of $32,902.  He is also paying the $216,358 in disgorgement that Zak was unable to pay, plus prejudgment interest thereon of $51,373 and a civil penalty of $145,229., The Second Amended Complaint alleges that on April 13, 2005, at 2:15 p.m. Yaroshinsky and other representatives of Connetics participated on a conference call in which the FDA staff told Connetics that the FDAs Executive Carcinogenicity Assessment Committee had concluded that the Velac Gel vehicle may be a tumor promoter or a carcinogen and that this is a serious issue for a topical product for the treatment of acne . . . .  Shortly after the call, Yaroshinsky called Zak, his friend and former neighbor, and told him what he had just learned from the FDA staff.  Minutes later, Zak, who had maintained a 5,000 share long position in Connetics before April 13, began executing transactions that positioned him to benefit from a drop in Connetics share price., The Second Amended Complaint further alleges that between April 13 and June 10, Yaroshinsky and Zak executed numerous trades.  Yaroshinsky bought put contracts in his own account and in a nominee account opened in the name of his mother-in-law and sold shares of Connetics common stock in his own account.  Zak bought put contracts, sold short Connetics shares, and sold his long position of Connetics shares.  All of the trading by defendants was conducted in advance of a June 13, 2005 public announcement by Connetics stating that it had received a not approvable letter from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) concerning Velac Gel.  After the announcement, Connetics stock price fell 27%.

To ease its financial difficulties, North American Clearing secured a bank loan using customer securities as collateral.  To comply with the federal securities laws and remain in operation, North American Clearing increased its reserves in an account it maintained for the benefit of customers, which limited funds available to North American Clearing to meet its daily operating expenses., According to the SECs complaint, on several occasions in March and April 2008, North American Clearing improperly sold customer money market funds as a means of temporarily freeing up funds that it then used to pay for daily operating expenses.  The SECs complaint also alleges that on May 13, 2008, the defendants manipulated North American Clearings processing system to overstate net customer money market purchases.  This enabled North American Clearing to illegally withdraw more than $3 million from the reserves it was required to maintain for the benefit of customers., The SECs complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida in Orlando, seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains against North American Clearing and Goble, and civil penalties against all defendants.  The SECs complaint alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud, customer protection and books and records provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act).  Specifically, the SEC alleges that North American Clearing violated Sections 10(b), 15(c), and 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 15c3-3, and 17a-3 thereunder, and that Goble, Blatman, and Ward violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and aided and abetted North American Clearings violations of Sections 15(c) and 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 15c3-3, and 17a-3 thereunder., On May 27, 2008, the Honorable Gregory A. Presnell granted the SECs ex parte motion for emergency relief, entering a temporary restraining order against the defendants and freezing North American Clearings assets.  The order also provides for a sworn accounting from North American Clearing and preservation of its records.  The Court further appointed Peter J. Anderson, an attorney in the law firm of Sutherland Asbill &amp; Brennan LLP of Atlanta, Georgia, as a receiver over North American Clearing.

Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SECs complaint filed today in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, Analog and Fishman agreed to settle charges against them by consenting to the entry of final judgments against them that orders Analog to pay a $3 million civil penalty and orders Fishman to pay a $1 million civil penalty. Fishman also consented to pay disgorgement of $450,000, plus prejudgment interest of $42,110, which represents the in-the-money benefit that Fishman obtained from selling stock obtained from the exercise of the 1998 backdated option grant that he exercised., The SECs complaint alleges that during at least 1998 through 2002, Analog and CEO Fishman engaged in an improper course of conduct involving backdating three stock option grants that operated as a fraud on Analogs shareholders and resulted in Fishman and other executives, directors and employees of Analog receiving undisclosed compensation., According to the complaint, in 1998, 1999 and 2001, Fishman caused the company to backdate stock option grants to price them below the market price of the stock on the date they were actually approved by Analogs Compensation Committee and caused the company to grant options at lower exercise prices than were allowed by the companys option plan. , The complaint alleges that these in-the-money option grants were made to Analogs officers and employees (and one grant to its directors in 2001) and resulted in $30.7 million in compensation costs ($21.8 million net of tax) that the company failed to properly expense in its financial statements. The complaint also alleges that the company and Fishman failed to disclose this practice in Analogs 1999–2002 proxy statements and related annual reports, and instead made false and misleading statements and omissions concerning the option grants and the benefits they provided to Analogs top officers, directors and employees., The SECs complaint also describes Analogs and Fishmans undisclosed practice of granting executive and employee stock options in advance of the announcement of favorable nonpublic financial information about the company. As stated in the complaint, this practice was not a basis for the charges alleged in the complaint. The complaint states that this non-disclosure predated the changes to the Commissions proxy disclosure rules, adopted in 2006, that expressly require disclosure concerning an issuers practice of timing option grants in coordination with the public release of material nonpublic information., In related administrative proceedings, without admitting or denying the SECs findings, Analog and Fishman consented to the entry of an administrative cease-and-desist order. The SECs order finds that Analog violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The order also finds that Fishman violated Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933, which does not require a showing of scienter. Analog and Fishman agreed to cease and desist from committing or causing the violations. Analog also agreed to re-price two of the three option grants awarded to Fishman that he has not yet exercised in order to eliminate the benefit of the lower exercise prices that resulted from backdating the options.

Judge Wood ordered that each of the above-referenced defendants be enjoined from future violations of the federal securities laws, including the anti-fraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Judge Wood further found Shpigelman liable to pay disgorgement of $12,000, plus prejudgment interest of $724.36, and found Santana liable to pay disgorgement of $475,151.79, plus prejudgment interest of $23,172.26, plus any interest that accrued in a brokerage account in his name controlled by Goldman Sachs Execution &amp; Clearing, LP (the Account) between October 18, 2007 and the date on which Santana causes the funds in the Account to be transferred to the Clerk of Court in satisfaction of the final judgment. Under the terms of the settlements with Plotkin and Smith, the Commission did not request, and Judge Wood did not order, disgorgement against Plotkin and Smith because neither of them received any substantial ill-gotten gains from the charged conduct. Under the terms of the settlements with Shpigleman, Plotkin and Smith, the Commission did not request, and Judge Wood did not order, penalties against Shpigelman, Plotkin and Smith based upon their prison sentences in parallel criminal proceedings. Under the terms of the settlement with Santana, the Commission did not request, and Judge Wood did not order, penalties against Santana based upon the sworn statements in his statement of financial condition., The Commissions Fourth Amended Complaint (the Complaint), alleged that Plotkin, along with co-defendant David Pajcin, orchestrated three separate insider trading schemes based upon trading in material non-public information stemming from Merrill Lynch (the Merrill Lynch Scheme), <i>Business Week</i> magazine (the <i>Business Week</i> Scheme) and grand jury proceedings in New Jersey concerning Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (the Grand Jury Scheme) (collectively, the Schemes). Based upon his involvement in the Schemes, the Complaint charged Plotkin with violations of Section 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder, as well as violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act).

(Consumer Information).  The charges stem from an alleged massive securities offering fraud that has victimized over 1,300 investors from across the United States, as well as Canada and Puerto Rico., The Commissions complaint, filed in U.S. District court in Wichita, Kansas, alleges that, between March 2004 and December 2007, the defendants raised approximately $156 million through the use of 22 purported oil-and-gas related equipment joint ventures structured to evade the securities laws.  The defendants, according to the complaint, lured potential investors with, among other things, the false promise of annual returns of up to 40% from leasing and operating oil and gas equipment, and that the joint ventures would be rolled up into a single entity that would be the subject of an even more lucrative initial public offering (IPO) resulting in returns as high as 3-8 times their investment.  However, the complaint alleges, the promised IPO and high annual returns have never come to fruition.  On the contrary, the defendants have only returned approximately $7 million to investors over the four-year period of their fraudulent scheme, $1 million of which was diverted from other investors as Ponzi payments.  Moreover, nearly half of the funds fraudulently raised were used to pay sales commissions and other organizational costs., The Commissions complaint further alleges that during their fraudulent securities offering, the defendants conducted regular, recorded, sales conference calls where they, directly and indirectly, made numerous misrepresentations, omissions, and half-truths concerning, among other things, their background and experience, the purported success and profitability of the joint ventures, the safety and risks of the investment, the likelihood of a profitable IPO, and the allocation of funds earned by the joint ventures., The complaint alleges that McNaul, Lucas, Krause, Nunns, Kilgariff, Tallman, Hembree, Leonard, Mid Western, and DuBoise violated Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) or the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint also alleges that Leonard, DuBoise, and Mid Western violated Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act.  The complaint seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions, disgorgement together with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  The complaint alleges that the relief defendants identified above received ill-gotten gains from the defendants fraudulent conduct.  The Commissions complaint sought an asset freeze against certain defendants and relief defendants, and the appointment of a receiver to recover and conserve assets for the benefit of defrauded investors., Without admitting or denying the allegations set forth in the complaint, all of the defendants except Leonard have consented to the entry of an order permanently enjoining them from engaging in the violations set forth above.  Tallman has agreed to an order finding him liable for disgorgement of $110,000, plus prejudgment interest of $9,369.59, and Hembree has agreed to an order finding him liable for disgorgement of $40,000, plus prejudgment interest of $5,535.24.  However, payment of all but $20,000 by Tallman, and $10,000 by Hembree, will be waived, and no civil penalties imposed, based on their respective sworn statements of financial condition and other documents.  The remaining settling defendants have agreed to defer determination of disgorgement and civil penalties.  In addition, defendants McNaul, Lucas, and Kilgariff and all relief defendants except Consumer Information have consented to an immediate asset freeze and to the appointment of a receiver.  Separately, the Court entered freeze and receivership orders against Leonard and relief defendant Consumer Information., The Commission acknowledges the cooperation and assistance of the Office of the Kansas Securities Commissioner, the Securities Commissioner for the State of Colorado, and the California Department of Corporations during this investigation.,  ]"

Barton (Barton), a formerly registered representative of a national, registered broker-dealer and two entities he controlled: TwinSpan Capital Management, LLC (TwinSpan), an investment adviser formerly registered with the Commission, and Barton Asset Management, LLC (Barton Asset Management).  The Commission alleges that, between 1999 and 2007, Barton, acting individually or through TwinSpan or Barton Asset Management, engaged in three separate securities frauds-including one involving a senior citizen suffering from Alzheimers disease-and through his misconduct obtained over $3 million in ill-gotten gains.  The Commission further alleges that he then spent his ill-gotten gains, among other things, to send his children to an exclusive private school, fund his own investment portfolio, and service his credit card debts., Named in the complaint are:, <b>Frederick J. Barton</b>, age 47, formerly a resident of Atlanta, Georgia, and now residing in Baldwin, Missouri.  Between 1988 and 2002, Barton was employed by a national broker-dealer as a registered representative and later as branch manager of the firms Atlanta office., <b>Barton Asset Management</b> is a Georgia limited liability company founded by Barton in November 2002., <b>TwinSpan Capital Management</b> is a Georgia limited liability company, which is operated and majority owned by Barton and is based in Atlanta, Georgia., The Commissions complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, Atlanta Division, alleges that between approximately May 1999 and December 2003, Barton, acting individually or through Barton Asset Management, misappropriated approximately $970,000 from a single, elderly brokerage customer of his who suffered from diminished mental capacity and Alzheimers disease.  The complaint alleges that Barton induced her to sell securities in her brokerage account, held by the firm that employed Barton, and give him the proceeds of those sales based on representations that he would somehow either transfer those proceeds into instruments offered by a local bank or, in a few instances, place the proceeds in an advisory account at Barton Asset Management.  As a result of this conduct, the value of this customers brokerage account declined from over $1.3 million (practically her entire lifes savings) to only a few dollars by December 2003., The Commissions complaint also alleges that between October 2004 and October 2005, Barton, acting individually or through TwinSpan, engaged in an unrelated $1.515 million offering fraud.  Barton and TwinSpan told investors that proceeds from their investments would be used to grow TwinSpan and for other business expenses.  In contravention of the offering material, Barton and TwinSpan diverted at least $493,100 of the offering proceeds for Bartons personal use and used a substantial portion of the offering proceeds in advance of reaching the minimum offering amount., The Commissions complaint further alleges that, from October 2006 to February 2007, knowing of the Commissions staffs investigation of his earlier misconduct, Barton misappropriated $685,000 from an advisory client of TwinSpan.  Specifically, Barton, acting through TwinSpan, forged the customers signature on four wire-transfer authorizations that transferred $185,000 of the clients assets at TwinSpan to a bank account in the name of Barton Asset Management.  A few weeks after his last unauthorized wire transfer, Barton borrowed an additional $500,000 from this client.  In so doing, he did not disclose his earlier theft of her funds., The Commission alleges that, by their misconduct, the defendants violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.   Additionally, the Commission alleges that Barton and TwinSpan violated Rule 10b-9 under the Securities Exchange Act.  The Commission seeks against the defendants permanent injunctive relief, an accounting, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and civil penalties.

Myers, an attorney who resides in Cranberry Township, Pennsylvania. The Commissions complaint alleges that he engaged in unlawful insider trading. In particular, Myers unlawfully purchased 1,000 shares of the common stock of NSD Bancorp, Inc. (NSD Bancorp) in advance of an October 15, 2004, public announcement of a merger between NSD Bancorp and F.N.B. Corporation (FNB) and after being tipped about the merger by a member of NSD Bancorps Board of Directors (the Insider). Following the announcement, NSD Bancorps share price increased $12.68 or 52 percent, from $24.02 to $36.70. Myers sold all 1,000 shares of his stock between January 2005 and February 2005 for a profit of $10,939., The Commissions complaint further alleges that Myers knew the Insider was a member of NSD Bancorps Board of Directors. Because of his position as a Director, by September 15, 2004, the Insider knew that at least four companies had submitted indications of interest in acquiring NSD Bancorp and that FNB had specifically offered $40 per share. The complaint further alleges that on September 16, 2004, Myers and the Insider, who were engaged in several joint business ventures unrelated to NSD Bancorp, met to discuss their business. During this meeting, the Insider provided Myers with material, nonpublic information concerning NSD Bancorps merger negotiations. On September 17, 2004, Myers, who had no prior history of trading in the securities of NSD Bancorp, purchased 1,000 shares of NSD Bancorps stock on the basis of the material, nonpublic information provided to him by the Insider. The Insider later died of natural causes. As a result of this conduct, the complaint alleges that Myers violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder., Simultaneously with the filing of the complaint, and without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, Myers consented to the entry of a final judgment, subject to the Courts approval: permanently enjoining him from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and ordering Myers to pay disgorgement of his trading profits, plus prejudgment interest thereon, totaling $13,705, and a one-time civil penalty of $10,939., The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority with respect to this matter., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2008/comp20610.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20610.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

McKeehan, of Monarch Beach, California, and Joseph A. Fontanetta, of Paramus, New Jersey, for engaging in unlawful insider trading in the securities of Animas Corporation (Animas) before a December 16, 2005 merger announcement with Johnson &amp; Johnson. Animas, which was headquartered in West Chester, Pennsylvania, designed, manufactured and sold products and services for patients with insulin-requiring diabetes. Its common stock was traded on the NASDAQ National Market System until February 2006, when the merger with Johnson &amp; Johnson became effective., The complaint alleges that Fontanetta, the Chief Executive Officer and board member of a privately-held medical instrumentation company, tipped material nonpublic information about Animas merger to McKeehan, a retired podiatrist, two days prior to the merger announcement. The complaint also alleges that Fontanetta either misappropriated or unlawfully received the material nonpublic information from a fellow board member at his company who was the husband of an Animas executive and privy to the merger negotiations., The complaint further alleges that, during a December 14, 2005 telephone call, Fontanetta unlawfully tipped McKeehan about the Animas merger. Specifically, he told McKeehan that Animas was going to be sold soon and that McKeehan would be making some money soon as a result.

DeMers, age 64, of Cerritos, Calif., cleaned out all of the cash in the Lincoln Funds accounts earlier this month by transferring approximately $2.9 million to his own separate company.  The SEC obtained a temporary restraining order, asset freeze and other emergency relief in a civil action to halt the defendants fraudulent activities and strip them of any ill-gotten gains.  Simultaneous with the filing of the Commissions complaint on June 6, the California Department of Corporations issued an Order against two of the individuals and Lincoln Funds ordering them to desist and refrain from offering, buying or selling securities in the state by means of any false or misleading statements., The Commissions complaint charges Lincoln Funds and its predecessor, Brookstone Capital, Inc., both based in Costa Mesa, Calif., and their principals, Robert L. Carver, age 53, of Irvine, Calif., his son Robert L. Carver, II, age 34, of Irvine, Calif., and DeMers.  The complaint also names as relief defendants Lincoln Biotech Ventures LP, Lincoln Biotech Ventures II, and LP Lincoln Biotech Ventures III LP — the three biotechnology venture funds created and controlled by the defendants.  Also named is MacAuslan Capital Partners, LLC, a company controlled by DeMers.  These relief defendants held cash or other assets acquired from investor proceeds.  Robert Carver has been the subject of at least five state administrative orders including three by the California Department of Corporations since 1996., The Commissions complaint alleges that since April 2004, the defendants sold securities in Brookstone Capital, Lincoln Funds, and three Lincoln Biotech Venture funds created purportedly for making biotechnology-related investments.  The defendants enticed investors by dangling the prospect of an upcoming initial public offering in Brookstone Capital and later, Lincoln Funds, when they knew full well that no steps had been taken for this purpose.  The complaint further alleges that the defendants made baseless predictions about the eight- to ten-fold appreciation in the entities projected stock price, and engaged in a sham transaction designed to hold Lincoln Funds out as a company with no connection to Brookstone Capital or Carver, which were subjects of state regulatory orders.  The defendants additionally concealed Carvers prior criminal record, and failed to invest investor funds in biotechnology ventures, as promised.  At least $2.5 million of the proceeds remain unaccounted for., Acting on the Commissions lawsuit, on June 6, 2008, the Honorable Judge Cormac J. Carney, United States District Judge for the Central District of California, granted the Commissions application for a temporary restraining order against the defendants and issued orders freezing the defendants and relief defendants assets and prohibiting the destruction of documents.  The Court also appointed James H. Donell as the temporary receiver over the assets of Brookstone Capital, Lincoln Funds, and its affiliates, including the three Lincoln Biotech Venture funds.  The Court ordered the temporary restraining order and asset freeze to remain in effect until June 19, 2008, on which date the Court will hold a hearing on the Commissions motion for a preliminary injunction and appointment of a permanent receiver at 10:00 a.m.  In addition to emergency relief, the Commissions complaint seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions, repayment of all ill-gotten gains, and also civil penalties., The Commissions complaint alleges that all of the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act.

During these eight months, FCBG shares were traded over the counter and quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board. Because the shares were thinly traded, Chapmans wash trades significantly inflated both the price and volume for FCBG shares. At a minimum, Chapman knew or recklessly ignored that his trading activity dramatically inflated both the volume and, occasionally, the price for FCBG shares. An injunction is particularly appropriate in this matter because Chapman continued to enter wash trades, albeit less frequently, after (1) his brokerage firm warned him that the conduct was illegal and ultimately required him to transfer his accounts and (2) the Enforcement staff expressed concerns to him that his wash trades distorted the market for FCBG shares., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2008/comp20616.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20616.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

At the time of his unauthorized trading, Eudowe worked for a registered representative with FINRA, who was also the principal of a registered brokerage firm and several investment partnerships., The Commission alleges in its complaint that, from December 26 through December 29, 2006, Eudowe engaged in a fraudulent trading scheme whereby he made five unauthorized purchases of two thinly-traded stocks, FRMO Corp.

The Commissions complaint alleges that defendant Real Estate Partners (REP), its related funds, and defendants Dawson Davenport, Michael Owens, and Ryan made several key misrepresentations to investors in the course of the fund offerings. First, the complaint alleges that these defendants misrepresented how REP would use investor funds, failing to disclose to investors that they spent over $26 million, or 52% of the money raised, on commissions to salespeople, including $10.9 million to two companies controlled by Owens and $3 million to a company controlled by Ryan., The complaint further alleges that REP was running a Ponzi-like scheme. Specifically, the complaint alleges that REP paid investors annual dividends using money obtained from other investors. The complaint also alleges that the defendants falsely claimed that Coldwell Banker was associated with the funds, when, in actuality, Coldwell Banker had nothing to do with the fund offerings. The complaint alleges that the defendants enticed investors with baseless promises of high rates of return on their investments, and dangled the unlikely possibility of conducting a public offering by converting the funds and REP into a publicly-traded real estate investment trust., Finally, the complaint alleges that the defendants conducted an unregistered offering of securities, and that defendants Owens, Ryan, McGill, Sanders, Tuchman, and Rayburn all sold REPs securities without being registered as broker-dealers, or associated with a registered broker-dealer., The Commissions complaint alleges that REP, the funds, Davenport, Owens, Ryan, McGill, Sanders, Tuchman, and Rayburn each violated the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933.

The Commissions Complaint further alleges that, after gaining control over the investors funds, Clifford produced sporadic statements or reports purporting to show that the investors were earning money, but that he became evasive when investors asked for the return of their funds and ultimately stopped responding to their requests and communications., The Commissions complaint alleges that Clifford violated Sections 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The Honorable Richard G. Stearns issued a temporary restraining order against further violations of the securities laws, an order freezing Cliffords assets, an order prohibiting the acceptance of additional investor funds, an accounting of assets and an order prohibiting the alteration or destruction of relevant documents, as well as other relief.  The Commission also seeks the entry of a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, plus pre-judgment interest and the imposition of civil monetary penalties against Clifford., The Commission acknowledges the assistance of Massachusetts Secretary of State William Francis Galvins Securities Division, which simultaneously brought an administrative cease-and-desist action against Clifford, and the Bourne, Massachusetts Police Department., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2008/comp20622.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  ]"

(Kocoras, J.)</h2>, <h2>SEC Charges Two Former Sentinel Management Group Executives With Orchestrating Fraud</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) announced today that on June 16, 2008, it charged two former Sentinel Management Group, Inc. (Sentinel) executives, Eric A. Bloom (Bloom) and Charles K. Mosley (Mosley), for their roles in devising and carrying out a fraud that has resulted in several hundred millions dollars in losses to Sentinels clients.  Prior to its August 2007 bankruptcy, Sentinel was a registered investment adviser that primarily managed short-term cash investment portfolios (Client Portfolios) for various types of advisory clients, including Futures Commission Merchants, hedge funds, financial institutions, pension funds, and individuals.  In an amended complaint filed today in federal court in Chicago, the Commission added Bloom and Mosley as defendants in the action it instituted against Sentinel on August 20, 2007.  Bloom was the President and Chief Executive Officer of Sentinel from approximately October 1988 until August 2007.  He controlled the day-to-day operations at Sentinel.  Mosley was Senior Vice President, head trader and portfolio manager of Sentinel from approximately October 2002 until August 2007.  He was responsible for Sentinels investing and trading activities.  The Commissions amended complaint also added new causes of action against Sentinel, which is now under the control of a bankruptcy trustee, in connection with Sentinels pre-bankruptcy conduct., The Commissions amended complaint alleges that from approximately 2003 through August 2007, Sentinel, through the actions of Bloom and Mosley, exposed its clients to substantial risks by engaging in an undisclosed investment strategy that relied extensively on leverage and repurchase transactions.  Additionally, the Commissions amended complaint alleges that Sentinel, Bloom, and Mosley misused Client Portfolio assets to finance risky leveraged trading for the benefit of Sentinels house portfolio (House Portfolio), which was owned by Sentinel insiders, including Bloom and Mosley.  The amended complaint also alleges that Mosley, with the knowledge and approval of Bloom, caused Sentinel to record huge returns -- annualized gains of 100% or more -- for its leveraged trading in the House Portfolio, partly through misuse of Client Portfolio assets.  The Commissions amended complaint also alleges that as part of their fraud, Bloom and Mosley improperly used Client Portfolio assets to collateralize a bank line of credit to Sentinel, thus subjecting clients to the risk that the lender would assert a security interest in the assets and sell them if Sentinel could not meet its loan obligations., The Commissions amended complaint alleges that, as a result of Defendants conduct, they violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, or, in the alternative as to Bloom and Mosley, aiding and abetting of Sentinels violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The amended complaint also alleges that Sentinel violated Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-2 thereunder and that Bloom and Mosley aided and abetted Sentinels violations of these provisions.

June 19, 2008)</h2>, <h2>SEC Charges Two Former Bear Stearns Hedge Fund Portfolio Managers with Securities Fraud</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged two former Bear Stearns Asset Management (BSAM) portfolio managers for fraudulently misleading investors about the financial state of the firms two largest hedge funds and their exposure to subprime mortgage-backed securities before the collapse of the funds in June 2007., The SECs complaint alleges that when the hedge funds took increasing hits to the value of their portfolios during the first five months of 2007 and faced escalating redemptions and margin calls, then-BSAM senior managing directors Ralph R. Cioffi and Matthew M. Tannin deceived their own investors and certain institutional counterparties about the funds growing troubles until they collapsed and caused investor losses of approximately $1.8 billion., In a related criminal action today, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York announced the indictment of Cioffi and Tannin on conspiracy and fraud charges., According to the SECs complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, the Bear Stearns High-Grade Structured Credit Strategies Fund and Bear Stearns High-Grade Structured Credit Strategies Enhanced Leverage Fund collapsed after taking highly leveraged positions in structured securities based largely on subprime mortgage-backed securities. According to the complaint, Cioffi acted as senior portfolio manager and Tannin acted as portfolio manager and chief operating officer for the funds, and they misrepresented the funds deteriorating condition and the level of investor redemption requests in order to bring in new money and keep existing investors and institutional counterparties from withdrawing money. The complaint alleges that, for example, Cioffi misrepresented the funds April 2007 monthly performance by releasing insufficiently qualified estimates — based only on a subset of the funds portfolios — that projected essentially flat returns. The complaint alleges that final returns released several weeks later revealed actual April losses of 5.09 percent for the High-Grade Structured Credit Strategies Fund and 18.97 percent for the High-Grade Structured Credit Strategies Enhanced Leverage Fund., The SECs complaint alleges that Cioffi and Tannin also misrepresented their funds investment in subprime mortgage-backed securities. According to the complaint, monthly written performance summaries highlighted direct subprime exposure as typically about 6 to 8 percent of each funds portfolio. As alleged in the complaint, however, after the funds had collapsed, the BSAM sales force was ultimately told that total subprime exposure — direct and indirect — was approximately 60 percent., The SEC further alleges that Cioffi and Tannin continually exaggerated their own investments in the funds while using their personal stake as a selling point to investors. The complaint alleges that Tannin repeatedly told investors, directly and through the Bear Stearns sales force, that he was adding to his own stake in the funds in order to take advantage of the buying opportunity presented by the funds losses. As alleged in the complaint, Tannin never actually added to his investment and he mocked as silly at least one investor who sought to redeem instead of following Tannins supposed example. Meanwhile, as the complaint alleges, Cioffi redeemed $2 million, which was more than one-third of his personal investment in the funds at the end of March 2007. According to the complaint, Cioffi transferred it to another BSAM fund that he described as short sub prime, which he knew was profitable at the time., The Commission alleges in its complaint that Cioffi and Tannin violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. In its complaint, the Commission seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of all illegal profits plus prejudgment interest, and the imposition of civil monetary penalties., The Commission appreciates the cooperation of the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which conducted a separate, parallel investigation., The SECs action was conducted through its Enforcement Divisions subprime working group, which is aggressively investigating possible fraud, market manipulation, and breaches of fiduciary duty that may have contributed to the recent turmoil in the credit markets.

(WLRF) in September 2000. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) alleged that Stamoulis was tipped about an impending acquisition involving WLRF, and then purchased 10,000 shares of WLRF stock just one day before WLRF announced that it was being acquired by Pilgrims Pride Corporation. Following the announcement, Stamoulis sold the shares and realized gains of nearly $60,000. The jury found that Stamoulis violated Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Judge Johnson enjoined Stamoulis from violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered Stamoulis to pay disgorgement of his trading profits, prejudgment interest and a penalty three times the amount of his realized gains., In addition to the jury verdict against Stamoulis, the Commission also announces that defendants Konstantinos Orfanakos (Orfanakos), Dimitrios Kostopoulos (Kostopoulos), Lampros Moumouris (Moumouris), Angelo Rigas (Rigas), Konstantine Drakopoulos (Drakopoulos) and John Tsiforis (Tsiforis) have agreed to settle the insider trading charges for their alleged involvement in trading and/or tipping in WLRF stock., With the judgment against Stamoulis, the Commission successfully concludes a case that originally involved 14 defendants and 3 relief defendants when the civil injunctive action was filed in April 2002. The Commissions complaint alleged that Eric Patton, a WLRF insider, learned material, non-public information about an impending acquisition of WLRF. According to the complaint, Eric then tipped his brother, Steven Patton who, in turn, tipped his broker, Michael Nicolaou (Nicolaou). The complaint alleged that Nicolaou then tipped, among others, his friends Tsiforis and Drakopoulos, a registered representative, and that Drakopoulos traded on the information and tipped, among others, Kostopoulos, also a registered representative, and Moumouris. As alleged in the complaint, Kostopoulos and Moumouris both traded on the information. The complaint also alleged that Tsiforis tipped Orfanakos and Stamoulis, who both traded on the information, and that Drakopoulos or Kostopoulos tipped Rigas, who traded on the information and tipped his relatives, Gregory Rigas, George Rigas and Antonia Bregianos. The United States Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York brought related criminal charges against Stamoulis, Orfanakos, Kostopoulos, Rigas, Moumouris, Drakopoulos and Tsiforis. Orfanakos, Kostopoulos and Drakopoulos each pleaded guilty in the criminal proceeding to conspiracy to commit securities fraud. Tsiforis pleaded guilty to perjury. The criminal charges were dismissed as to Stamoulis, Rigas and Moumouris., Orfanakos, Kostopoulos, Moumouris, Rigas, Drakopoulos and Tsiforis have agreed, without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, to settle the Commissions complaint against them under the following terms:, Orfanakos consented to the entry of a Final Judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The Final Judgment further orders him to pay $3,172 in disgorgement, an amount equal to his WLRF trading profits, $579 in prejudgment interest and a one-time civil penalty equal to his disgorgement., Kostopoulos consented to the entry of a Final Judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The Final Judgment also acknowledges that Kostopoulos disgorged his trading profits as part of the relief ordered in the parallel criminal proceeding., Moumouris consented to the entry of a Final Judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The Final Judgment further orders Moumouris to disgorge $74,300, the total amount of his WLRF trading profits, to pay prejudgment interest of $15,670, and to pay a civil money penalty of $40,000., Rigas consented to the entry of a Final Judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The Final Judgment further orders Rigas to disgorge $131,743, the total amount of his trading profits and those of his tippees, and pay prejudgment interest of $8,564. In addition, the Final Judgment orders Rigas to pay a one-time civil money penalty of $18,039, which equals the amount of his personal trading profits., Drakopoulos consented to the entry of a Final Judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The Final Judgment further orders Drakopoulos to pay a one-time civil money penalty of $14,209, an amount equal to his WLRF trading profits. The Final Judgment does not order Drakopoulos to pay disgorgement because his trading profits were disgorged by another defendant as part of the relief ordered in the parallel criminal proceeding., Tsiforis consented to the entry of a Final Judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder., The Court entered the Final Judgments as to Orfanakos, Kostopoulos, Moumouris and Rigas on July 11, 2007, the Final Judgment as to Drakopoulos on February 1, 2008, and the Final Judgment as to Tsiforis on March 28, 2008., Finally, the Commission has dismissed its insider trading charges against defendants Eric Patton, Steven Patton, Gregory Rigas, George Rigas and Antonia Bregianos and relief defendants Maria Rigas, Eugenia Rigas and Kathy Drakopoulos., For more information about this case, refer to Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17495.htm>17495</a> (April 30, 2002) and Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr17775.htm>17775</a> (October 8, 2002).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20630.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Carver, age 53, his son Robert L. Carver II, age 34, both of Irvine, California, and James L. DeMers, age 64, of Cerritos, California. The defendants raised at least $21 million from nearly 400 investors nationwide in an alleged securities fraud scheme. The Honorable Cormac J. Carney, United States District Judge for the Central District of California, also granted additional relief that the Commission sought, including orders freezing the defendants assets and the appointment of James H. Donell as permanent receiver over Lincoln Funds, Brookstone Capital, and their related entities., The Commissions complaint, filed on June 6, 2008 in federal court in Santa Ana, California, alleges that from April 2004 through late May 2008, the defendants sold securities in Lincoln Funds, Brookstone Capital, and three Lincoln Biotech Venture funds created purportedly for making biotechnology-related investments. The defendants enticed investors by dangling the prospect of an upcoming initial public offering (IPO) in Brookstone Capital and later, Lincoln Funds, when no steps had been taken for that purpose. The complaint alleges that the defendants made baseless predictions of an eight- to ten-fold appreciation in the entities projected stock price, and engaged in a sham transaction designed to hold Lincoln Funds out as a company with no connection to Brookstone Capital or Carver, which were subjects of various state regulatory orders. The complaint alleges that the defendants also concealed Carvers prior criminal record and failed to invest investor funds in biotechnology ventures, as promised. , The Commissions complaint alleges that all of the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act. Additionally, the complaint alleges that Carver, Carver II, and DeMers violated the broker-dealer registration provisions of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act. Finally, the Commission alleges that Lincoln Funds and DeMers violated Section 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.

Pauley III entered a final judgment against defendant Francis J. Saldutti (Saldutti).  The final judgment permanently enjoins Saldutti from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and requires him to pay more than $5,082,138 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest.  Saldutti consented to entry of the final judgment without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions Second Amended Complaint., On February 16, 2005, the Commission filed <i>SEC v. Northshore</i>, alleging that, in April 2003, defendant Northshore Asset Management LLC (Northshore) and its three principals, defendants Kevin Kelley (Kelley), Glenn Sherman (Sherman), and Robert Wildeman (Wildeman) (together, the Northshore Defendants), purchased Saldutti Capital Management, L.P. (SCM) from Saldutti and thereby obtained control over two hedge funds, Ardent Research Partners L.P. and Ardent Research Partners Ltd. (together, the Ardent Funds).  Kelley, Sherman, and Wildeman proceeded fraudulently to divert tens of millions of dollars of the Ardent Funds cash assets to their own personal use, including purported personal loans and self-dealing investments.  Consequently, by early 2005, the Ardent Funds became illiquid and were unable to meet investor redemption requests., In October, 2005, the Commission filed a First Amended Complaint that added securities fraud and investment adviser fraud claims against Saldutti, the Ardent Funds founder and investment adviser, and Douglas Ballew, Northshores former CFO.   In March 2008, the Commission filed a Second Amended Complaint that, among other things, added certain factual allegations against Saldutti.  The Commission alleged that after his sale of SCM to the Northshore Defendants, Saldutti remained as the portfolio manager of the Ardent Funds and became a part owner, creditor, and employee of Northshore.  The Commission alleged that Saldutti failed to disclose adequately, and made affirmative misrepresentations regarding, the sale of SCM to Northshore and his numerous conflicts of interest to the Ardent Funds and the Ardent Funds investors.  The Commission also alleged that Saldutti failed to disclose adequately, and made affirmative misrepresentations regarding, his transfer of tens of millions of dollars of Ardent Funds cash from their prime brokerage accounts to Northshore-controlled accounts.  The Commission further alleged that Saldutti failed to disclose certain material facts to two new investors that he welcomed to the Ardent Funds in late 2004, including the fact that Kelley had been arrested and charged with unrelated investment advisers fraud in early December 2004., Judge Pauley previously entered final judgments against Wildeman on May 2, 2008 and Kelley and Ballew on May 19, 2008.

Tex., filed June 30, 2008)</h2>, <h2>SEC Settles With Microtune Inc. and Sues Former Microtune Officers In Stock Option Backdating Scheme</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission filed civil fraud charges against Plano, Texas-based Microtune, Inc. and two former senior officers—former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Douglas J. Bartek and former Chief Financial Officer and General Counsel Nancy Richardson. The SEC alleges that Bartek and Richardson perpetrated a fraudulent and deceptive stock option backdating scheme that awarded themselves and other employees millions of dollars in undisclosed compensation. The backdating scheme caused the Plano, Texas-based company to file materially false and misleading financial statements with the Commission., The Commissions complaint, filed in the federal district court for the Northern District of Texas alleges that Bartek, with assistance from Richardson, routinely backdated the date on which he granted stock options to senior executives and other employees. To conceal the scheme, as alleged, Bartek directed others to backdate employment records, including offer letters, to establish falsified start dates and grant dates that preceded the actual dates the new hires began working for Microtune., According to the SECs complaint, the undisclosed backdating scheme ensured that the options falsely appeared to have been granted on dates in the past corresponding to low stock prices, thus resulting in potentially lucrative in-the-money options granted at below fair market value. As alleged, rather than report compensation expense as required at the time by U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, Bartek and Richardson falsified or directed others to falsify stock option records to make it appear that the backdated options were granted as of the backdated date, and therefore at-the-money. , The SECs complaint further alleges that Bartek and Richardson caused Microtune to grant backdated options, cancel those options after the companys stock price dropped precipitously, and subsequently re-grant the same options at a substantially lower exercise price. According to the SECs complaint, the re-grants were not, as required, accounted for using variable accounting, in part because, as alleged, Richardson and Bartek concealed the nature of the re-grants from Microtunes outside auditors and others., Without admitting or denying the SECs allegations, Microtune agreed to an injunction that permanently enjoins it from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, and 14a-9., The Commissions litigated action alleges that Bartek and Richardson violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Sections 10(b), 13(b)(5), and 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, 13b2-1, 13b2-2, and 14a-9 thereunder, and aided and abetted Microtunes violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, and 14a-9 thereunder.

Leonard liable for fraud in connection with the purchase and sale of IGDC securities., According to the Courts order, IGDC claimed, among other things, to be involved in the purchase and sale of natural gas, with the goal of providing financial self-sufficiency for Native Americans … and indigenous people worldwide., The Court found, that from May 2003 through September 2005, in a series of press releases and in filings with the Commission, IGDC and Leonard falsely told investors that IGDC had contracts to purchase and sell millions of dollars in natural gas and also had access to millions of dollars in financing. In fact, the Court found, IGDC was a start-up company that had no revenues and no significant contracts or sources of financing., The Court found that Leonard committed fraud in connection with the purchase and sale of securities, in violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; issued false certifications as to the accuracy of IGDC filings with the Commission, in violation of Exchange Act Rule 13a-14; and aided and abetted IGDC in making filings with the Commission that were materially inaccurate, in violation of Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13., The Courts order enjoins Leonard from violations of these provisions of the securities laws; requires him to pay disgorgement of $249,793.68 (representing the proceeds from his sales of IGDC stock to the public during the course of his fraud) plus prejudgment interest of $37,586.84; imposes a monetary penalty of $249,793.68; prohibits Leonard from serving as an officer or director of any public company; and also prohibits Leonard from involvement in the offering of any penny stock., In addition, the Court entered judgment against IGDC, which is now defunct, and imposed a penalty of $208,000.

As alleged in the complaint, the website and press releases failed to state the company was under court custodianship, had no operations or revenues, and that Roebucks stock sales were the companys only funding.  After Roebuck and Kaiser issued the press releases, Roebuck sold 9,539,350 shares, resulting in proceeds over $990,000.  Roebuck transferred approximately $300,000 to the company, and Kaiser took approximately $81,491 for himself., The complaint charges the defendants with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that Roebuck violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act.  Roebuck settled to a permanent injunction, disgorgement and a civil penalty to be determined by the court, and a permanent bar from participating in an offering of penny-stock.  The Commission is seeking from Kaiser an injunction, disgorgement, civil penalty, a penny-stock bar, and a permanent officer and director bar.,  ]"

Selden, Former CEO of a Massachusetts Biotechnology Company, Settles SEC Fraud Action</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that on July 9, 2008, a final judgment by consent was entered by the United States District Court Judge for the District of Massachusetts against Richard F. Selden of Lincoln Massachusetts.  Selden, age 49, was the former CEO of Transkaryotic Therapies (TKT), a biotechnology company that was headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and was publicly-traded until it was acquired in July 2005.  The final judgment against Selden permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders Selden to pay a $125,000 civil penalty and $1,041,417 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest related to his sales of TKT stock during the period of the alleged fraud., Selden was the only defendant in a civil injunctive action filed in September 2005, alleging that he made materially misleading statements between October 2000 and October 2002 concerning results of TKTs clinical trials and its U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) application for its flagship drug, Replagal.  The Commissions complaint alleged that, during the relevant time period, Selden and, at his direction, TKT, made positive statements concerning Replagals clinical benefits, describing its clinical trials as a success, and made positive statements about Replagals chance of being approved by FDA.  However, the complaint alleged that Selden knew, but failed to disclose, material negative information, including that Replagals clinical trial failed to meet its primary objective and FDA had told TKT on several occasions that it was a failed study and had recommended additional clinical trials.  The complaint further alleged that Selden benefited by selling 90,000 shares of TKT stock between May 2001 and February 2002, prior to TKTs disclosure of some negative information about Replagal on October 2, 2002, which caused TKTs stock price to fall., The judgment against Selden, to which he consented without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, enjoin him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and enjoin him from aiding and abetting violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13 thereunder.  Additionally, Selden agreed to pay a civil penalty of $125,000.  Selden was also held liable for $714,800 in disgorgement related to his trading in TKT stock during the relevant time period, plus $326,617 in prejudgment interest.  The Court will determine whether a bar from serving as an officer or director of any public company is warranted against Selden at a later date., For further information about the Commissions action in SEC v.

In support of his plea, Gibbs admitted that he engaged in a scheme to defraud numerous investors through a nationwide Foreign Currency Market (FOREX) Ponzi scheme., On March 19, 2008, Gibbs pled guilty to mail fraud and the Commission filed a settled civil injunctive action in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia against Gibbs for operating a Ponzi scheme. <i>S.E.C. v.

(collectively, the One Equity Companies) with operating an ongoing fraudulent stock loan program., The Commissions complaint alleges that, since at least 2004, the Spillans, who are residents of Gahanna, Ohio, and the One Equity Companies, which are located in Westerville, Ohio, raised approximately $70 million from 125 borrowers by holding themselves out as stock based lenders, underwriters, or administrators. According to the complaint, the defendants raised the money by inducing borrowers to transfer ownership of millions of shares of publicly traded stock to them as collateral for purported non-recourse loans based on a false promise to return the shares to borrowers who repaid their loans. In fact, the defendants generally sold all of the stock received from borrowers before funding each loan. After funding each loan, the Spillans did not set aside any cash reserves to repurchase and return shares to borrowers who repaid their loans. Instead, they used all of the money to pay expenses, including over $1 million in salaries and benefits to themselves., In an order dated July 10, the Honorable Judge Edmund A.

(originally incorporated as Sniffex, Inc.), a Nevada corporation with a principal place of business in Irving, Texas (Sniffex), and the other filed yesterday involving three issuers — National Storm Management Group, Inc., a Nevada corporation with its principal place of business in Glen Ellyn, Illinois (NLST); Deep Rock Oil and Gas, Inc., a Nevada corporation with its principal place of business in Tulsa, Oklahoma (DPRK); and Global Beverages Solutions (GBVS), a Nevada corporation with its principal place of business in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The companies traded over the counter under the symbols SNFX (now HSFI), NLST, DPRK and GBVS, respectively. Mark B. Lindberg, 40, of Coppell, Texas, was charged in both cases and has settled them without admitting or denying the allegations in the two complaints. In the Sniffex complaint, the Commission also named Sniffex; its President Paul B. Johnson, 60, of Colleyville, Texas; Petar D. Mihaylov, 28, of Pazardjik, Bulgaria; Yuri P. Markov, 50, of Sofia, Bulgaria; Nicholas V. Klausgaard, 22 of Denmark; and Ilona V. Klausgaard, 49, of Denmark as defendants., The Commissions complaint filed in the Northern District of Texas alleges that from October 2004 through April 2006, defendants Mihaylov and Markov acquired control of Sniffex — and carried out a $32 million pump-and-dump fraud scheme in concert with the other defendants. They acquired Sniffex in 2004 as a shell company from defendant Lindberg who agreed to provide them 15 million shares of so-called free-trading stock. To do this, Lindberg, Mihaylov, Markov, and Johnson, Sniffexs President, participated in a sham SEC Rule 504 stock offering that ultimately resulted in scheme participants obtaining virtually all of the companys purportedly free-trading stock. <br/> <br/>The complaint further alleges that Mihaylov, Markov, and Johnson then engaged in a fraudulent promotional campaign intended to inflate the share price and trading volume in the public market for Sniffex stock. The campaign characterized Sniffexs primary product, a purported hand-held bomb detector invented by Markov, which was also called Sniffex, as a critical breakthrough in the global war against terrorism. At the behest of Mihaylov and Markov, Johnson drafted and issued 33 press releases on Sniffexs behalf. The press releases contained materially false information about tests regarding the products ability to detect explosives and the companys financial situation. These fraudulent claims were parroted by Mihaylov in a spam-email campaign and in a glossy direct-mail piece., According to the complaint, as a result of the fraudulent promotional campaign, Sniffexs share price increased from $0.80 to $6.00, giving the bogus company a market capitalization of $474 million at the schemes peak. The individual defendants profited handsomely by disregarding re-sale restrictions and selling their scheme-derived shares into the artificially inflated market. Lindberg sold approximately 2.071 million shares for a net gain of approximately $315,481; Mihaylov sold approximately 3.73 million shares for approximately $11.3 million; Markov sold approximately 2.8 million shares for approximately $8.6 million; and the Klausgaards sold approximately 3.75 million shares for approximately $12.3 million. Neither the Sniffex press releases nor other public statements made in the scheme disclosed that Markov and Mihaylov controlled Sniffex, that they and the Klausgaards controlled virtually all of the companys public float, and that this group intended to sell, and was selling, millions of secretly owned shares into the market., The Commissions complaint charges Sniffex, Lindberg, Mihaylov, Markov, and Johnson with violations of the securities-registration provisions and the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5, and charges the Klausgaards with violations of the securities-registration provisions, Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act. The Commission seeks the following relief from Mihaylov, Markov, Johnson, and the Klausgaards: permanent injunctions against future violations of the federal securities laws, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, civil monetary penalties, penny-stock bars, and accountings. Lindberg, without admitting or denying any allegations in the complaint, has agreed to a permanent injunction, an officer-and-director bar, and a penny-stock bar., The Commissions complaint filed in the Northern District of Oklahoma alleges that defendant Lindberg and other members of a Shell Creation Group (SCG) manipulated at least three penny stocks from 2004 through 2006, including NLST, DPRK, and GBVS. Lindberg and the other members of the SCG, including attorneys, stock promoters, and financiers, worked together to acquire unrestricted shares of the three issuers and to profit by selling these shares into the market while manipulating the price of the stock by means of distributing promotional materials and coordinated trading. The SCG reaped profits in excess of $20 million from the sale of NLST, DPRK, and GBVS stock, and Lindberg personally reaped over $6.2 million in ill-gotten gains from this illegal conduct., The complaint alleges that the SCG exploited the devastating effects of Hurricane Katrina to manipulate the stock of NLST and DPRK. NLST purported to be a storm restoration firm specializing in residential home repair from the effects of wind and hail damage. DPRK purported to be an oil and gas exploration and production company. Lindberg and other members of the SCG assisted these companies reverse merge with SCG controlled shell companies. Throughout the reverse merger process, SCG members obtained control over large quantities of NLST and DPRK stock for its members and/or their nominees, which was issued without restriction based on legal opinion letters predicated on false information. In or about August and September 2005, the SCG began to orchestrate and pay for promotional campaigns, including faxes, spam emails, and glossy promotional pamphlets touting NLST and DPRK, claiming that Hurricane Katrina would result in greater profits and higher share prices for the companies. Some of the promotional materials encouraged readers to purchase the stock and included price targets. None of the NLST or DPRK promotional materials disclosed that the persons who ultimately orchestrated and paid for the promotional campaigns, the SCG, owned or controlled significant positions in the stocks and that they intended to sell stock while encouraging readers to purchase it. Additionally, the emails falsely indicated that NLST and DPRK made filings with the SEC., The complaint further alleges that in the spring and summer of 2005, the SCG obtained control of a company that had elected business development status under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and had registered its securities under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act. The SCG renamed the company GBVS, and used it to acquire a company named Rudy Beverages. The SCG obtained control over large quantities of unrestricted shares of GBVS for its members and/or their nominees. Like NLST and DPRK, the SCG orchestrated and paid for promotional campaigns, including faxes, spam emails, and glossy promotional pamphlets touting GBVS. Some of the promotional materials encouraged readers to purchase the stock and included price targets. None of the GBVS promotional materials disclosed that the persons who ultimately orchestrated and paid for the promotional campaigns, the SCG, owned or controlled significant positions in the stock and that they intended to sell the stock while encouraging readers to purchase it., According to the complaint, in some instances, accounts controlled by members of the SCG, including Lindberg, bought and sold NLST, DPRK, and GBVS stock in an effort to increase the volume in the market and to increase the price shown for the stocks. This trading activity and other trading activities were sometimes coordinated on a daily basis. During the SCGs promotional campaigns for all of the issuers, the price and daily trading volume of the stocks increased significantly. Throughout the promotional campaigns, Lindberg and other members of the SCG engaged in heavy selling of NLST, DPRK, and GBVS stock for prices far below the value predictions asserted in the promotional materials. The SCG and Lindberg personally profited through their sales of NLST, DPRK, and GBVS stock into the manipulated market., The complaint further alleges that the NLST and DPRK shares were sold by members of the SCG, including Lindberg, without being registered with the Commission and without a viable exemption from registration., The Commissions complaint charges Lindberg with violations of the securities-registration provisions and the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5. Lindberg, without admitting or denying any allegations in the complaint, has agreed to a permanent injunction, an officer-and-director bar, and a penny-stock bar., The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Northern District of Oklahoma, the Federal Bureau of Investigation; the Internal Revenue Service; the U.S. Postal Inspection Service; and FINRA., The Commissions investigations in these matters are ongoing., The Commission has published guidance for investors concerning investments in microcap stocks.

According to the Commissions complaint, Mayor William J. Rauch purchased stock in Advanced Cell Technology, Inc., immediately after one of its executives informed him about a breakthrough embryonic stem cell technique that the company was about to disclose publicly. Rauch was told the information was confidential, and he had previously signed an agreement with the company that barred him from using confidential company information for his own benefit. Rauch has agreed to settle the Commissions charges without admitting or denying the allegations., The Commissions complaint, filed in federal court in San Francisco, alleges that an Advanced Cell Technology executive told Rauch on August 3, 2006, that a science journal would soon be publishing an article reporting Advanced Cells development of a new technique for creating stem cell lines without harming embryos, which the company believed might alleviate concerns about stem cell technology., According to the Commissions complaint, Rauch called a securities broker and opened accounts in his name and his childrens names on the same day he received the confidential information. On August 9 and 14, after further discussions with the Advanced Cell executive, Rauch telephoned his broker and purchased more than $11,000 of Advanced Cell stock in his childrens accounts.

The Commission also alleges that during the same period, Rivera made false and misleading oral statements regarding USSE. Specifically, the Commissions complaint alleges that USSE and Rivera made material misrepresentations by claiming that USSE owned patents or pending patents; that USSEs cost to produce biofuel was $0.50 per gallon; that USSE had contracts for the sale of its product; that USSE had a fully operational plant; and that USSEs technology, when combined with the technology of another company with which it had agreed to merge, had an immediate market value of between 9 and 12 billion dollars. The complaint also alleges that after the press releases and false statements were issued, Price, who resided with Rivera at the time, sold USSE stock at artificially inflated prices, thereby profiting at least $721,000., The complaint alleges that USSE and Rivera violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The indictment alleged that the defendants induced investors by falsely representing and causing others to represent that investors money would be used for investments that would generate high yielding monthly returns.  The indictment alleged that only a small fraction of the money raised was used to make investments and they generated almost no returns, money received from new investors was used to make payments to earlier investors, and millions of investors funds were used for the defendants own personal use., In October 2004, the Commission filed a civil complaint against the defendants and Learn Waterhouse.  The court issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting future violations of the antifraud and the securities registration provisions of the federal securities laws, freezing the defendants assets, and appointing Thomas Lennon as the permanent receiver over Learn Waterhouse.  The court thereafter issued orders finding Treadwell in civil contempt for violating the asset freeze and ultimately revoked his pretrial release pending the trial in the criminal action.

Hirth was the former Vice-President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer for ProQuests Information and Learning Division., The Commissions complaint, filed in federal court in Detroit, alleged that at the end of monthly and quarterly reporting periods, from at least 2001 through 2005, Hirth made fraudulent manual journal entries in order to favorably alter ProQuests financial results. These manual journal entries were adjustments to the balances in certain ProQuest accounts and were designed to increase revenue and decrease expenses at ProQuest. Through these false accounting entries, Hirth materially inflated ProQuests reported Earnings Before Interest and Taxes for 2001 though 2004 and the first three quarters of 2005. The Commission further alleged that Hirth created false documentation to purportedly support the balances in the manipulated accounts and used hidden rows and white font functions in spreadsheets to conceal his false accounting entries. After ProQuest disclosed the accounting scheme in its public filings, the Commission alleged that ProQuest lost over $437 million in market capitalization. ProQuests stock price dropped from $29.41 to $12.31 per share between February and April 2006. Finally, the Commission alleged that ProQuest failed to devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls that could have prevented Hirths scheme and failed to properly apply other basic accounting principles during this period., ProQuest and Hirth consented to the settlement of this action without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions complaint. Under the settlement, Hirth is permanently enjoined from committing future violations of the federal securities laws, and he will pay disgorgement of $233,676.00, prejudgment interest of $54,474.25 and a civil penalty of $130,000, and consent to be permanently barred from serving as an officer and director of a public company and from practicing as an accountant before the Commission.

Martin, 41, of Houston, alleging violations related to stock-options backdating. Without admitting or denying the allegations, all three defendants agreed to settle the matter. The SEC filed its complaint in United States District Court in Houston., The complaint alleges that, on at least 38 and as many as 58 occasions from 1997 through 2005, Way looked back at HCCs historical stock prices and, with the benefit of hindsight, chose grant dates for the options that coincided with the dates of low closing prices for the stock. At Ways direction or with his knowledge, Martin, among other things, prepared documents indicating that HCCs option grants had been made on earlier dates when HCCs stock price had closed lower whereas in fact no such grants had been made on those dates. These inaccurate and misleading documents included written actions of HCCs compensation committee, stock option agreements, and Forms 4 and 5 reporting the grants to the SEC. Among other things, the backdating of options caused the company to understate its compensation expense by approximately $26.6 million., HCC consented to a permanent injunction from violations of the issuer-reporting, books-and-records, and internal-controls provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13 thereunder. The Commission did not allege fraud claims and did not seek a monetary penalty against HCC based in part on the Companys remedial measures and its extraordinary cooperation in the Commissions investigation., Way consented to a permanent injunction from violations of anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws and multiple other provisions, specifically Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Sections 10(b), 13(b)(5), 14(a), and 16(a) of the Exchange Act, and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, 13b2-1, 13b2-2, 14a-3, 14a-9, and 16a-3, and aiding and abetting violations of Exchange Act Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder.

The Commissions complaint also alleges that, in a classic Ponzi scheme tactic, Brown often transferred money from new investors to favored clients to create the illusion of profitable trading., At the SECs request, the federal court for the Northern District of California issued an order freezing Browns assets and prohibiting him from, among other things, further transferring or dissipating his clients assets., According to the SECs complaint, since at least 2000 and continuing to the present, Brown (previously of Vallejo, Calif.) offered a variety of investment programs that falsely promised astronomical returns. One program promised, for example, to double investor money in eight months. The SEC alleges that Brown raised more than $20 million, but transferred millions of dollars to himself and his family members for personal use. Only approximately $4 million went to any brokerage account, however it was a personal brokerage account that Brown treated as his own piggy bank., In order to perpetuate the scheme, the SEC alleges that Brown transferred newly-raised funds to older investors as purported profits on securities trading. The SECs complaint likewise alleges that Brown provided false account statements to investors that showed their investments were earning the returns he had promised. When Brown failed to repay his clients, he concocted elaborate excuses, blaming delays on the Patriot Act while representing that the SEC had cleared him of wrongdoing., Brown and Trebor are charged with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

In addition, the defendants have told investors and potential investors that they project millions of dollars of sales revenue within Aerokinetics first years of operations and billions of dollars shortly thereafter., The Commissions complaint alleges that the defendants claims are patently false. In contrast to its claims, Aerokinetic has no patents, license agreements, contracts, suppliers, customers, sales, revenue, or market share. In addition, Aerokinetics purported energy technologies and products are, at best, in the early development stage and, therefore, its predictions of imminent financial success and financial projections lack any reasonable basis in fact. Moreover, contrary to the defendants assurances that they would use investor funds to research and develop Aerokinetics products, the complaint alleges that Bridwell has misappropriated investors funds to pay his personal expenses, with approximately $230,000 in investor funds unaccounted for., The Commissions complaint alleges that Aerokinetic and Bridwell violated Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The Courts July 24 Order provides that the temporary restraining order and asset freeze would remain in effect until August 4, 2008. The Court further scheduled a hearing on the Commissions motion for a preliminary injunction on August 1, 2008. In addition to the interim relief already granted by the Court, the Commission seeks a final judgment against the defendants enjoining them from future violations of the foregoing antifraud and securities registration laws, ordering them to disgorge all ill-gotten gains, and assessing civil penalties., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2008/comp20655.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20655.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, Simchuk has agreed to settle this matter by consenting to the entry of a final judgment against him which imposes injunctive and monetary relief., The complaint alleges that in late November 2005, Simchuk, former General Director of Glamis de Mexico, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Glamis Gold, Inc. (Glamis, now Goldcorp, Inc.), learned material, nonpublic information concerning Glamis plan to acquire publicly traded Western Silver. The complaint further alleges that Simchuk learned of the potential acquisition in connection with his official duties assisting in the due diligence process on behalf of Glamis. A few days later, on December 1, 2005, Simchuk began purchasing Western Silver stock. From December 2005 through February 2006, during which time he remained privy to material, nonpublic information concerning Glamis potential acquisition of Western Silver, Simchuk intermittently purchased a total of 6,000 shares of Western Silver stock. According to the complaint, one of the purchases occurred while Simchuk was in attendance at a Glamis Board meeting at which he and others presented the due diligence findings with respect to Western Silver. On February 24, 2006, Glamis announced that it had signed a binding letter agreement to acquire Western Silver. By market close on February 24, news of the deal pushed the share price of Western Silver to $21.60, up 27% from its closing price the previous day., Based on the facts alleged, the Commission charged Simchuk with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The Commission charged Stanley W. Anderson of Arvada, Colorado and Edwin A. Smith of Denver, Colorado with orchestrating the fraudulent scheme through Trinity International Enterprises, Inc. (Trinity) and CFO-5, LLC, Colorado corporations controlled by Anderson and Smith. The Commission also charged Michael D. Norton of Denver, Colorado, Nicholas R. Fair of Ft. Collins, Colorado, and Charles L. Kennedy, a pastor from Tampa, Florida, with participating in the fraudulent scheme by soliciting investors., The Commissions complaint alleges that, from approximately April 2005 through July 2007, the defendants raised at least $5.1 million from investors. They solicited investors by misrepresenting that they would use the invested funds to purchase and sell in foreign medium term notes (MTNs). However, because these MTNs did not exist, investor funds were not used to buy and sell these securities. According to the Complaint, Anderson and Smith instead used investor money for their personal expenses and paid unrelated civil judgments and loans, Ponzi payments to other investors, and compensation to salespeople, among other things. The Commission also alleges that Kennedy, Norton, and Fair acted as salespeople for the scheme and, with Anderson and Smith, continued to solicit and lull investors through at least July 2007. Additionally, the Complaint alleges that Kennedy did not forward any of the funds he raised from other pastors who shared his religious affiliation, rather he spent all of these funds for his personal use. The Complaint also alleges that all of the defendants participated in unregistered offers and sales of securities, and that Anderson, Smith, Kennedy, Norton, and Fair acted as unregistered broker-dealers., The Commissions complaint alleges that all of the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of the securities laws in Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act).

Pai, the former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Enron Energy Services (EES), a division of Enron Corp. (Enron). The Commissions complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, alleges that Pai sold Enron stock in May and June 2001 on the basis of material, nonpublic information concerning Enron. Pai simultaneously settled the action without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint., According to the Commissions complaint, shortly before his departure from Enron, between May 18, 2001 and June 7, 2001, Pai sold 338,897 shares of Enron stock and exercised stock options that resulted in the sale of 572,818 shares to the open market - yielding millions of dollars in proceeds. Before making these sales, Pai learned from EES successor management that it had identified certain financial and operational problems and substantial contract-related losses at EES. Had Enron reported EESs contract-related losses in its Retail Energy Services segment, that segment would have shown a quarterly loss of at least $60 million, rather than a profit of $40 million as falsely reported in Enrons Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2001. Pai knew or should have known that he could not sell Enron stock without first disclosing such material, nonpublic information. By selling Enron stock without disclosing this information, Pai breached his fiduciary duty to Enron shareholders., The Commissions complaint further alleges that Pai avoided substantial losses from these sales when the price of Enron stock collapsed in the fall of 2001. Enrons stock price averaged approximately $53.78 per share during the time of Pais sales, but closed at $0.40 on December 3, 2001 - the day after Enron filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. By selling his shares in May and June 2001 before the collapse of Enrons share price, Pai avoided millions of dollars of losses., Pai has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and bars him from acting as an officer or director of a public company for five years. Pai also agreed to pay $30 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest (subject to a $6 million offset based on his prior waiver of insurance coverage for the benefit of Enron investors), plus a $1.5 million civil money penalty., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2008/comp20658.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20658.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Bennett, the former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Refco Inc., in a civil injunctive action brought by the Commission. The final judgment permanently enjoins Bennett from violating antifraud, record keeping, periodic reporting, internal controls, and certification provisions of the federal securities laws and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company. The settlement concludes the Commissions civil injunctive action against Bennett., The Commissions complaint alleged that Bennett orchestrated a fraud that periodically concealed hundreds of millions of dollars owed to Refco Inc. and its corporate predecessor, Refco Group Ltd. (together, Refco), by Refco Group Holdings, Inc. (RGHI), a private entity that Bennett controlled. The debt was primarily the result of trading losses and operating expenses that Refco transferred over time to RGHI. From at least 1998 to October 2005, the debt was concealed by short-term transactions Bennett directed that temporarily shifted the debt from RGHI to third parties at the ends of fiscal periods. The public revelation of Bennetts scheme in October 2005, two months after the companys initial public offering of common stock, caused hundreds of millions of dollars in losses to Refco shareholders. The complaint also alleged that Bennett directed practices that artificially inflated Refcos reported financial results., The judgment against Bennett, to which he consented without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, enjoins him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, and 15d 14, and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 15(d) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 15d-2 and 15d-13. The judgment also bars Bennett, pursuant to Section 20(e) of the Securities Act and Section 21(d)(2) of the Exchange Act, from serving as an officer or director of a public company., Bennett also agreed to settle proposed administrative proceedings against him pursuant to Section 15(b)(6) of the Exchange Act and Section 203(f) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, to be based on the entry of the Courts final judgment enjoining him. Pursuant to his offer of settlement, Bennett consented to the issuance of a Commission order barring him from association with any broker, dealer, or investment adviser., In a related federal criminal prosecution, on July 3, 2008, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York sentenced Bennett to sixteen years incarceration for his role in the Refco fraud and ordered him to forfeit assets up to an amount of $2.4 billion., The Commission acknowledges the assistance and cooperation of the Office of the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, the United States Postal Inspection Service, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission., The Commissions investigation is continuing., For further information about the Commissions action in <i>U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission v.

In a related case, on September 17, 2007, the Commission filed a complaint in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, alleging that, over the past four years Kaplan and Mesa, Arizona-based recidivist securities law violator Michael Saquella, a.k.a., Michael Paloma, conducted an elaborate market manipulation scheme that involved unlawfully taking public seven microcap companies, artificially inflating their share prices, and dumping millions of shares into the public market.   On March 14, 2008, Saquella was sentenced to serve ten years in federal prison for orchestrating the scheme.  , According to the Commissions complaint, Saquella repeatedly circumvented the registration requirements of the federal securities laws in order to obtain large blocks of purportedly free trading shares.  With the free trading shares in hand, Saquella and Kaplan coordinated wash sales and matched orders to artificially inflate the price of each issuer’s stock while also creating the appearance of an active trading market.  Saquella then coordinated the dissemination of millions of false and/or misleading blast fax and spam e-mails touting the companies shares.  Kaplan realized profits of some $677,632 by dumping shares of the microcap issuers into the public market at prices artificially inflated by his manipulative trading as well as the spam campaigns. The Commission alleged that Saquella carried out versions of this scheme using the shares of Courtside Products, Inc., Latin Heat Entertainment, Inc., Xtreme Technologies, Inc., PokerBook Gaming Corp., Commanche Properties, Inc., TKO Holdings Ltd. and Motion DNA Corp.  , In the Commission’s action, Kaplan consented to the entry of a final judgment (1) permanently enjoining him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; (2) imposing a penny stock bar against him; and (3) directing that he disgorge $677,632 in unlawful profits, plus prejudgment interest of $121,127. , Additional information can be found in Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20269.htm>20269</a> (September 6, 2007); Securities Act of 1933 Release No. <a href=/litigation/admin/2008/33-8892.pdf>8892</a> (February 7, 2008); and Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20502.htm>20502</a> (March 19, 2008).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20662.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The judgments permanently enjoin defendants Neu, Luscko, and China Score from committing future violations of the securities registration provisions of the federal securities laws, and the judgments as to Luscko, Neu, and Medlin enjoin them from committing future violations of the securities antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The judgments also bar Luscko, Neu, and Medlin from participating in any penny stock offering, and enjoin Luscko and Neu from conducting unregistered securities offerings.  Luscko, Neu, Medlin, and China Score each consented to the entry of the judgment against them without admitting or denying any of the allegations in the Commission’s complaint., Additionally, the Court entered final judgments against defendants Emerging Holdings, Inc. and Massclick, Inc., permanently enjoining both companies from committing future violations of the securities registration provisions of the federal securities laws.  On October 26, 2007, the Clerk of the Court entered the defaults of both Emerging Holdings and Massclick upon their failure to answer or otherwise respond to the Commission’s complaint.  Finally, the Court dismissed relief defendant Marc Primo Pulisci from the Commission’s action.  The final judgments entered by the Court effectively concluded the litigation in this matter., The Commission’s complaint, filed on April 27, 2007, alleged that, <a name=P12_2243></a>between March and August 2004, the defendants artificially inflated the stock price and trading volume of certain companies whose stock traded on the over-the-counter market.  The complaint alleged that defendants Luscko and Neu formed four companies, including defendants Emerging Holdings, Massclick and China Score, as well as another entity that is now defunct, and then recruited friends and business associates to act as company officers.  According to the complaint, Luscko and Neu arranged for these companies to transfer millions of shares of stock to their own or their friends’ brokerage accounts in a series of sham transactions designed to bypass Commission regulations that required the shares to be restricted from being resold into the open market.  The complaint also alleged that Luscko and Neu drafted false and misleading spam e-mails that were edited by defendant Medlin.  Further, the complaint alleged that Medlin embarked on a weekend spam e-mail campaign, bombarding the investing public with millions of spam e-mails that generated significant investor interest and resulted in rapid increases in the companies’ stock price and volume.  The Commission further alleged that, having “pumped” up the companies’ stock prices, Luscko and Neu then, directly or through their friends, “dumped” their shares into the open market, and the companies’ stock prices declined rapidly thereafter.  As a result of trades made in these four stocks, Luscko, Neu, and Medlin netted $6.5 million., The Court permanently enjoined Luscko, Neu, Emerging Holdings, Massclick, and China Score from violating the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933.  Luscko, Neu, and Medlin were also enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Finally, Medlin was enjoined from violating the anti-touting provisions of Section 17(b) of the Securities Act., In a related criminal action, the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia previously filed charges against Luscko, Neu, and Medlin, all of whom pled guilty to conspiring to commit securities fraud and e-mail fraud.  Neu was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment and three years’ supervised release.  Luscko was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment and two years’ supervised release.  Medlin was sentenced to six years’ imprisonment and three years’ supervised release.

Kelly and 25 other defendants, including Meyer and Meyer &amp; Associates, participated in a massive fraud on U.S. investors that involved the offer and sale of securities in the form of Universal Lease investments. Universal Leases were structured as timeshares in several hotels in Cancun, Mexico, coupled with a pre-arranged rental agreement that promised investors a high, fixed rate of return. The SECs complaint alleges that from 1999 until 2005, Kelly and others, including Meyer and Meyer &amp; Associates, raised at least $428 million through the Universal Lease scheme from investors throughout the United States, with more than $136 million of the funds invested coming from IRA accounts. The SEC further alleges that a nationwide network of unregistered salespeople who sold the Universal Leases, including Meyer and Meyer &amp; Associates, collected undisclosed commissions totaling more than $72 million. The SEC also alleges that Kelly and others ran the scheme from Cancun, Mexico, through a number of foreign entities in Mexico and Panama. According to the SECs complaint, Kelly and others told investors that Universal Leases would generate guaranteed income through the leasing of investor timeshares by a large, independent leasing agent. In fact, the complaint alleges the leasing agent was a small Panamanian travel agency controlled by Kelly and for most of the scheme its payments to investors came from accounts funded by money raised from new investors. Further, the complaint alleges that Kelly and others, including Meyer and Meyer &amp; Associates, failed to disclose key facts about the Universal Lease investments, including the risks of the investments and that more than $72 million in investor funds were used to pay commissions as high as 27% to the selling brokers. The SEC continues to pursue its claims against Meyer and Meyer &amp; Associates for disgorgement and civil penalties.

The complaint further alleges that the six individuals, and one relief defendant, collectively reaped proceeds exceeding $3.91 million from their illegal scheme., Named in the Commissions complaint are:, The Commissions complaint alleges that in the summer of 2005, Landess, Don Bradley and Don Bradleys son Jeffrey Bradley conveyed control of a Nevada corporate shell to Sonfield. The complaint further alleges that Sonfield caused the shell to issue several unpaid, backdated stock certificates, in order to make false claims that the shares qualified for sale under certain exemptions to the registration provisions of the federal securities laws., In September 2005, according to the complaint, Sonfield, Lane and Brewer merged the shell with a privately held corporation engaged in the development of computer security software. Following the merger, Sonfield, Lane and Brewer controlled virtually all of the supposed free trading, public float of the common stock of the surviving software corporation, Exobox Technologies Corp., which is based in Houston, Texas. From approximately late 2005 through at least April 2007, according to the complaint, Sonfield, Lane, Brewer, Landess, Jeff Bradley and Don Bradley transferred and sold the vast majority of the shares into the public market through over the counter sales for collective proceeds of $3.91 million. Of those total proceeds, the complaint further alleges that relief defendant Blankenship received $600,000, as the result of her personal relationship with Sonfield., The complaint also alleges that Sonfield prepared various filings with the Commission for Exobox, which omitted the material fact that he, Lane and Brewer controlled almost all of Exoboxs public float. The complaint alleges that because of these material omissions, Sonfield (but not Exobox or its officers and directors) violated the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws and aided and abetted violations of the reporting provisions of the federal securities laws., The complaint alleges that all the defendants (except the relief defendant)violated Sections 5(a) and (c) of the Securities Act of 1933, that Sonfield also violated Sections 10(b) and 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 16a-3 thereunder and that he aided and abetted violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 thereunder, and that Lane and Brewer also violated Section 13(d) and 16(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13d-1 and 16a-3 thereunder., The Commission is seeking injunctive relief against future violations of these provisions by the respective defendants, civil money penalties, penny stock bars, and disgorgement with pre-judgment interest of any ill-gotten gains.

Rosen of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan issued an order of preliminary injunction and asset freeze against Paul G. Merklinger (Merklinger) of Novi, Michigan, and Encore Associated Leasing, LLC (Encore Leasing), a company formed, owned and controlled by Merklinger, and issued an asset freeze against Merklingers son, Brian Merklinger, a relief defendant. Previously, on July 24, 2008, Judge Rosen issued an order temporarily prohibiting Merklinger and Encore Leasing from attempting to offer securities or other investments and from transferring any assets. That order was issued under seal by the court and that seal has now been lifted., According to the SECs complaint, from September 2006 to July 2007, Merklinger raised at least $7.2 million from five investors through the sale of investments in his purported tire recycling business. The investments consisted of an interest in a tire shredding truck that Encore Leasing would lease from the investor and purportedly use in its business operations, and a $10,000 warrant for a 1% interest in Encore Leasing. Merklinger told investors that a working prototype of the shredding truck existed and that their trucks would be in operation shortly. He promised that Encore Leasing would pay the investors $15,000 in monthly leasing fees and investment interest, and that after five years, the investors could expect returns of up to 372% and the warrant would be worth at least $1.2 million. However, as alleged in the SECs complaint, there was no working prototype, no reasonable basis for Merklingers income and return figures, and the investors never received a dime from their investment. Instead, Merklinger used more than $950,000 of investor funds for his own personal benefit, including payments for rent, back taxes and the purchase of luxury automobiles and watercraft and extravagant landscaping and furnishings for his home. He also, as alleged in the SECs complaint, spent or transferred more than $172,000 for the benefit of his son, Brian Merklinger, and used more than $134,000 to make payments to investors in one of his other companies. Further, Merklinger failed to disclose to investors that he had been barred from participating in Ontario, Canadas securities markets for ten years in connection with a prior investment scheme., The SECs complaint charges Merklinger and Encore Leasing with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement, and civil penalties.

Crowley, Jr., the former chief executive officer of SeraCare Life Sciences, Inc., and Jerry L. Burdick, a former member of SeraCares board of directors and the former interim chief financial officer, for their roles in financial fraud at SeraCare during 2005. At the time, SeraCare was based in Oceanside, Calif., and operated and continues to operate as a supplier and manufacturer of biological products for the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry., The SECs complaint against Crowley, filed in federal district court in San Diego, alleges that Crowley, age 40, of San Diego, failed to disclose material information in SeraCares Form 10-Q and earnings release for the first quarter of its fiscal year 2005 and during an earnings call with investors. Specifically, the complaint alleges that Crowley learned the day before these disclosures were made that a bill and hold sale representing almost 11% of SeraCares quarterly net income before taxes had been cancelled by a major customer. In spite of this knowledge, Crowley failed to disclose the cancelled sale in any of SeraCares first quarter disclosures, including the quarterly report that Crowley signed and certified, an earnings release, and an investor conference call., The SEC also filed a separate complaint against Burdick, age 68, of Westlake Village, Calif., alleging that in SeraCares second and third quarters of 2005, Burdick improperly released general inventory reserves that he had created following a major acquisition by SeraCare in 2004. As a result, SeraCares net income before taxes was artificially inflated in the second and third quarters by 20% and 17%, respectively, and misstated in the corresponding quarterly reports filed by SeraCare that Burdick prepared and/or certified. The complaint further alleges that Burdick also caused misrepresentations to SeraCares outside auditors by creating a backdated letter that was given to the auditors in order to recognize revenue on an almost $1 million sale before the close of the 2005 fiscal year. Finally, the Commissions complaint alleges that Burdick misled SeraCares auditors by providing them an increased inventory valuation without any documented or verifiable support., Crowley and Burdick each agreed to settle the SECs charges without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. These settlements are subject to approval by the court.

The complaint alleges that Lemons had his customers sign bank and brokerage documents in blank, under the false pretense that he would use the documents to liquidate securities in their accounts and reinvest the proceeds in higher yielding securities. Lemons instead used the documents signed in blank to extract funds for his personal use from the accounts of his customers without their authorization.

Settles Financial Reporting and Related Charges by SEC for Improperly Reporting Over $200 Million in Income as a Result of Purported Reinsurance Contracts</h2>]","[On August 6, 2008, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil injunctive action in United States District Court for the District of New Jersey charging Prudential Financial, Inc., a leading provider of financial services, with violating the financial reporting, books-and-records, and internal control provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Prudential has agreed to settle the case, without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, by consenting to the entry of a permanent injunction., The Commissions complaint, filed in federal court in Newark, alleges that from December 1997 through December 2002, Prudentials former property and casualty subsidiaries known as the Prupac companies (Prupac), entered into a series of so-called finite reinsurance contracts with General Reinsurance Corporation (Gen Re) that had no economic substance and no purpose other than to build up and then draw down on an off-balance sheet asset, or bank, that Gen Re held for Prupac. According to the complaint, the contracts were shams, written to look like they met the requirements to qualify for reinsurance accounting; in fact, they were subject to an oral side agreement that effectively eliminated any risk to either party and made such accounting improper. Prupac built up the bank in 1997, 1998 and 1999 and then, in 2000, 2001 and 2002, drew down on the bank and improperly recorded the repayments as income. In 2001, Prudential became a public company and the inaccurate financial statements became a part of its annual, quarterly and current filings thereafter., The complaint alleges that the improper accounting practices began in 1997, when Prudential and Gen Re negotiated a riskless reinsurance contract under which Prupac paid Gen Re $50 million. The contract was entered into in the final days of the coverage period, but backdated to appear as if it had been agreed to before the coverage period began. The understanding between the parties was that Gen Re would credit Prupac with interest at the one-year Treasury bill rate and also collect a fee on the money it held. It was further agreed that the relationship would be riskless: If Gen Re lost money in the early years of the relationship, when its exposure on the purported reinsurance contracts was greater than the amount in the bank, Prupac would make Gen Re whole. The parties kept track of where they stood in the relationship by means of a ledger, called an Experience Account Balance, which showed payments made into the bank, less fees, plus interest, and less payments out., From 1997 through 2000, Prupac built up the bank, depositing approximately $190 million of the $200 million it would eventually deposit with Gen Re in the form of premiums on reinsurance policies for which no reinsurance recoveries were triggered. In 2000, 2001, and 2002, Prupac drew down on the bank, structuring the purported reinsurance contracts to ensure it recovered virtually to the penny every payment it had made, plus interest, less Gen Res fee. As a result of these recoveries, Prudential improperly reported additional pre-tax income of $97 million, $80 million and $41 million in 2000, 2001 and 2002, respectively., The complaint alleges that the improper accounting practices within Prudentials Property and Casualty Insurance division resulted in an overstatement of Prudentials consolidated pre-tax income for 2000, 2001 and 2002 by $57 million or 9%, $75 million or 25%, and by $38 million or 146%, respectively. As a result of these improper accounting practices, Prudential filed annual, quarterly and current reports with the Commission that included financial statements that were inaccurate and misleading and violated the financial reporting, books-and-records, and internal controls provisions of the Exchange Act. Specifically, the complaint alleges that Prudential violated Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13 thereunder., Without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, Prudential has agreed to settle the charges by consenting to a permanent injunction against further violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13 thereunder., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2008/comp20670.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20670.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

ABB is a Swiss corporation, and its American Depository Receipts are registered with the Commission and trade on the New York Stock Exchange., As alleged in the complaint, Hozhabri was a project manager for ABB Network Management (ABB NM), a division of a U.S. based ABB subsidiary, which provides products and services for managing power generation and transmission networks. The Commission alleges that, from 2002 through 2004, Hozhabri fraudulently submitted approximately $468,714 in cash and check disbursement requests to ABB NM for purported business expenses associated with projects in Brazil, Paraguay, and the United Arab Emirates. As alleged in the complaint, these purported expenses were phony, and inaccurately recorded as legitimate business expenses in ABBs books and records. The Commission further alleges that the funds disbursed by ABB NM as a result of these requests were not used to pay any business expenses, but rather were embezzled by Hozhabri and the former General Manager of ABB NM.

The final judgment against Richman, age 56, of Houston, Texas entered on August 6, 2008, permanently enjoins Richman from violating the antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws, permanently bars Richman from serving as an officer or director of any public company and orders him to pay a $150,000 civil penalty., The Commissions Complaint, filed September 14, 2005, alleges that, beginning in April 2003, Biopure received negative information from the FDA regarding its efforts to obtain FDA approval of its synthetic blood product Hemopure but failed to disclose the information, or falsely described it as positive developments. Specifically, the Complaint alleges that in April 2003, the FDA placed a clinical hold barring Biopure from conducting clinical trials of Hemopure in trauma settings such as emergency rooms, because of safety concerns about Hemopure. The Complaint further alleges that, during the next eight months, Richman and other Biopure employees concealed the imposition of the clinical hold while making public statements about Biopures plans to obtain approval for trauma uses of Hemopure. In addition, according to the Complaint, in July 2003 the FDA informed Biopure that it had not approved Biopures application for use of Hemopure in orthopedic surgery, and instead conveyed serious concerns about whether the materials Biopure had submitted in support of its application were reliable and questioning the safety of Hemopure. According to the Complaint, Biopure, however, issued public statements beginning on August 1, 2003 describing the FDAs communication as good news, causing its stock price to increase by over 20%. The Complaint alleges that Richman and other Biopure employees continued to make misleading statements until December 2003. During this period, Biopure raised over $35 million from investors. The Complaint further alleges that as the true status of Biopures efforts to obtain FDA approval gradually became public, through a series of incomplete and misleading disclosures between late October and the end of December 2003, the companys stock price plummeted almost 66% from its August 1 price., To settle the Commissions charges, Richman consented, without admitting or denying the allegations of the Complaint, to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from committing future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b 5 thereunder and from aiding and abetting future violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-11 and 13a-13 thereunder.

Cal.)</h2>, <h2>SEC Charges Six Microcap Companies, Four Officers and Four Sham Consultants for Improperly Raising Capital By Abusing Form S-8</h2>]","[On August 6, 2008, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed two separate complaints in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California against six microcap companies, four officers and four sham consultants for engaging in unregistered public offerings that dumped billions of shares on the market through so-called employee stock option and consulting programs., In <i>SEC v. Angel Acquisition Corp., et al.</i>, the Commission alleges that five companies — NW Tech Capital, Inc. (NW Tech), Marshall Holdings International, Inc. (Marshall Holdings), Angel Acquisition Corp. (AAC), Winsted Holdings, Inc. (Winsted Holdings) and Zann Corp. — violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) when they improperly registered shares issued under their employee stock option programs on Form S-8 registration statements and then received at least 85% of the proceeds from the shares sales as payment for the options exercise price. The Commission also alleges that Marshall Holdings officers, Richard A. Bailey and Florian R. Ternes, and Winsted Holdings former officer, Mark T. Ellis, violated Section 5 when they implemented and administered their companies employee stock option programs. Form S-8 statements may be used to register shares issued to compensate employees and consultants and have abbreviated disclosure requirements as compared to statements registering shares used to raise capital. According to the complaints, however, the programs functioned as public offerings in which the companies used their employees as conduits to the market so that they could raise capital without complying with the registration provisions., The complaints further allege that the companies programs had features that, taken together, virtually guaranteed that the options would be exercised and the underlying shares simultaneously sold to the public at or near the time the options were granted. First, the options exercise price, which was typically set at 85% of the sale proceeds from the options underlying shares, floated with the market value of a companys stock at the time of exercise. Second, the options vested immediately, meaning that no conditions needed to be met before the options could be exercised. Third, a cashless exercise method was used so that the exercise price was paid from the sale proceeds of the underlying shares rather than directly by the employees. Other than opening brokerage accounts and signing blank letters of authorization, the companies employees made no decisions regarding the options exercise or the sale of the underlying shares during the course of the programs. The complaint seeks injunctive relief and disgorgement plus prejudgment interest. It also seeks civil penalties against Marshall Holdings, Bailey, Ternes and Ellis., In <i>SEC v. Global Materials &amp; Services, Inc., et al.</i>, the Commission alleges that, Global Materials &amp; Services, Inc. (Global Materials), and its former officer, Stephen J. Owens, violated Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder when they issued shares registered on Form S-8 to sham consultants, who then kicked back over 60% of the shares sales proceeds to Owens and Owens other businesses. The Commission also alleges that William Woo, Eric Ko, ASMAC Financial, Inc. and Edify Capital Group, Inc. aided and abetted Global Materials fraud and violated the registration provisions in their role as sham consultants. Finally, the Commission asserts that Global Materials violated the registration provisions by implementing an employee stock option program similar to the programs described in the first complaint. The Commission seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement with prejudgment interest and, with the exception of Global Materials, civil penalties. Additionally, against Owens, it seeks an officer and director bar pursuant to Section 20(e) of the Securities Act and Section 21(d)(2) of the Exchange Act and a penny stock bar pursuant to Section 21(d)(6) of the Exchange Act. Finally, the Commission names Flinn Springs Inn, Inc. as a relief defendant and seeks to disgorge the money it received under the fraudulent kickback scheme., NW Tech, AAC, Winsted Holdings, Zann Corp., and Global Materials have agreed to settle the charges, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaints, by consenting to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the registration provisions and, with respect to Global Materials, the antifraud provisions and ordering them to pay disgorgement plus prejudgment interest with waiver based on inability to pay.

Socius consented to the entry of the judgment without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions complaint. Pursuant to the Final Judgment, Socius will pay disgorgement in the amount of $1,237,342, plus prejudgment interest thereon in the amount of $123,481, and a civil penalty of $125,000., The Commissions complaint alleges that from August through November 2005, Socius, an entity incorporated in the British Virgin Islands and operating out of Geneva, Switzerland, in concert with other related individuals and entities, manipulated the stock price of Cameron International, Inc. (Cameron) through a series of coordinated wash sales and matched orders designed to create the illusion of an active and rising market in Cameron and induce others to buy Cameron shares at inflated prices. The complaint further alleges that during this period, the defendants trading comprised the majority, and on some days all, of the retail buying and selling of Camerons stock. Moreover, the complaint alleges that the defendants coordinated trades drove Camerons share price from less than $1 per share to $90 per share in approximately a two month period., On November 7, 2005, the Commission suspended trading in shares of Cameron due to a lack of current and accurate information concerning a possible change in ownership of the company and questions regarding the dramatic rise in its share price. On December 1, 2005, the United Stated District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a temporary restraining order freezing a U.S. brokerage account titled in the name of Socius that held the proceeds from Socius trading of Cameron stock.

The complaint further alleges that in five instances, Butko, in his own account, bought shares in the thinly traded issuers just prior to or at the same time that compromised accounts were made to buy shares, creating the false appearance of market activity. Shortly after the intrusions, Butko sold all of his shares at the inflated prices.

Alliance is a Nevada corporation, formerly known as Strategy X, Inc., that was headquartered in the State of Maine from at least December 2004 through August 2007, and is now located in Ranch Palos Verdes, California. Also charged for various roles in the scheme were Clifford A. Lewis of Huntsville, Alabama; Richard A. Dabney of Rancho Palos Verdes, California; Raymond C. Dabney of Vancouver, British Columbia; Philip M. Young of Phoenix, Arizona; Charles J. Smith of Reno, Nevada; and William D. ONeal of Fountain Hills, Arizona. The Commission settled charges against ONeal, an attorney who allegedly issued a series of legal opinions that enabled Alliance to illegally issue purportedly unrestricted shares of its stock in unregistered transactions. ONeal agreed to pay more than $220,000 in disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest and civil penalties, and to be prohibited from issuing similar legal opinions in the future or accepting securities of Pink Sheets issuers in consideration for legal services., According to the Commissions complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona, Alliance, Richard Dabney, and Lewis manipulated the market for Alliances stock by issuing press releases that made false and misleading claims about the companys contracts and revenues. The complaint alleges that the press releases issued by Alliance were published through business newswire services and on Alliances website from at least April 2005 through at least September 2006., The Commissions complaint further alleges that, from July 2005 to September 2006, Alliance, Richard Dabney, Raymond Dabney, Young, Smith, and ONeal participated in an unregistered distribution of Alliance securities through a series of purported stock offerings by Alliance to North American Funding, Inc. (NAF), a Texas corporation controlled by Smith. According to the complaint, Raymond Dabney, Young, and Smith arranged for Alliance to issue stock to NAF in offerings that purportedly were exempt from registration. The complaint alleges that, in fact, the transactions between Alliance and NAF were not exempt from registration and were merely a device to evade the registration provisions of the federal securities laws. According to the Commissions complaint, the stock was immediately distributed to third parties and sold into the market, without being paid for by NAF. Richard Dabney, an officer and director of Alliance, and ONeal enabled Alliance to engage in those transactions by providing the necessary corporate resolutions and legal opinions, respectively. The Commissions complaint also alleges that Young, Smith, and ONeal received some of the Alliance stock through the unregistered distribution and sold it into the market without registration or a valid exemption from registration. According to the complaint, Lewis, Richard Dabney, and Raymond Dabney received a portion of the proceeds that Young obtained by selling the Alliance stock., The Commissions complaint charges Alliance, Lewis, and Richard Dabney with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws (Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder) and charges Alliance, Richard Dabney, Raymond Dabney, Young, Smith, and ONeal with violating the securities registration provisions of the federal securities laws (Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act)). In its complaint, the Commission seeks permanent injunctions against all the defendants, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest and civil monetary penalties against Lewis, Richard Dabney, Raymond Dabney, Young, Smith, and ONeal, officer and director bars against Lewis and Richard Dabney, and penny stock bars against Lewis, Richard Dabney, Raymond Dabney, Young, and Smith., The Commission previously issued an Order on October 4, 2007 suspending trading in the securities of Alliance., Upon the filing of the Commissions complaint, and without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, ONeal consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Section 5 of the Securities Act, ordering him to pay disgorgement of $163,246.22 and prejudgment interest of $33,000.78 plus a civil penalty of $25,000. In addition, the final judgment prohibits ONeal from issuing any legal opinions to the effect that unregistered offerings are exempt from SEC registration under Rule 504 of Regulation D under the Securities Act and that securities issued in such Rule 504 offerings are unrestricted.

The targets of the fraudulent offerings are primarily members of the Orthodox Jewish community. Simultaneously with the filing of the action, the Commission is seeking emergency relief from the Court to freeze the defendants assets and place the Wextrust entities under the control of a receiver to safeguard assets. The Commission is also seeking a temporary restraining order to stop the ongoing offerings and other immediate relief., The Commissions complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, charges that Wextrust, its principals Steven Byers and Joseph Shereshevsky, and its affiliated entities Wextrust Equity Partners, LLC (WEP), Wextrust Development Group, LLC (WDG), Wextrust Securities, LLC (Wextrust Securities) and Axela Hospitality, LLC (Axela) conducted at least 60 securities offerings through private placements and created approximately 150 entities in the form of limited liability companies or similar vehicles to act as issuers or facilitators of the offerings, purportedly to fund the acquisition of specified assets, the majority of which were commercial real estate ventures. Contrary to representations in the offering memoranda that proceeds would be used for specific projects, the defendants allegedly diverted funds to pay returns to investors in prior offerings, or to fund expenses of the defendants., In one offering, conducted in 2005, the SEC complaint alleges that defendants falsely represented to investors that the more than $9 million raised would be used to purchase seven specifically identified real estate properties that were leased by federal government agencies, such as the General Services Administration. In fact, according to the complaint, the defendants never purchased the seven properties. Moreover, at the time the offering occurred, they knew or were reckless in not knowing that the seven properties would not be acquired. Significantly, while the offering was ongoing, the Wextrust entities borrowed more than $6 million from the funds raised in the GSA offering and used these funds for purposes unrelated to the GSA offering., Overall, the complaint alleges, defendants diverted at least $100 million dollars to unauthorized purposes. The complaint alleges that the defendants are conducting at least four ongoing offering frauds intended to raise money to pay back investors from prior offerings., In addition to the emergency relief sought today, the Commissions complaint seeks disgorgement of the defendants ill-gotten gains, civil penalties, and permanent injunctions barring future violations of the antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws., The complaint names the following defendants., Byers, age 46, is a resident of Oakbrook, Ill., and owns sixty percent of Wextrust.

(Century Estate Planning), Chambers business, from violating certain of the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws. The order, entered with Chambers and Century Estate Plannings consent, permanently enjoins them from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rules 10b-5 and 10b-10 promulgated thereunder, and enjoins Chambers from aiding and abetting violations of Rule 10b-10 of the Exchange Act., The SECs complaint in this matter charges that Michael E. Kelly and 25 other defendants, including Chambers and Century Estate Planning, participated in a massive fraud on U.S. investors that involved the offer and sale of securities in the form of Universal Lease investments. Universal Leases were structured as timeshares in several hotels in Cancun, Mexico, coupled with a pre-arranged rental agreement that promised investors a high, fixed rate of return. The SECs complaint alleges that from 1999 until 2005, Kelly and others, including Chambers and Century Estate Planning, raised at least $428 million through the Universal Lease scheme from investors throughout the United States, with more than $136 million of the funds invested coming from IRA accounts. The SEC further alleges that a nationwide network of unregistered salespeople who sold the Universal Leases, including Chambers and Century Estate Planning, collected undisclosed commissions totaling more than $72 million. The SEC also alleges that Kelly and others ran the scheme from Cancun, Mexico, through a number of foreign entities in Mexico and Panama. According to the SECs complaint, Kelly and others told investors that Universal Leases would generate guaranteed income through the leasing of investor timeshares by a large, independent leasing agent. In fact, the complaint alleges the leasing agent was a small Panamanian travel agency controlled by Kelly and for most of the scheme its payments to investors came from accounts funded by money raised from new investors.

Arizona)</h2>]","[On August 11, 2008, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil complaint against David B. Stocker, a Phoenix, Arizona attorney, and his wholly-owned corporation, Carrera Capital, Inc. The Commissions complaint alleges that Stocker perpetrated multiple instances of corporate identity theft. Beginning in early 2006, Stocker allegedly found several companies whose stock had once traded in the public markets, but that had become defunct corporations and were no longer operating. When he found such a company, he allegedly incorporated a new company under the same name in the same State and, using his authority to act for the new company, purported to act on behalf of the old company. Specifically, Stocker allegedly caused stock in the old companies to be exchanged for stock in the new companies under the false pretense that the old company was undergoing a reverse stock split. Stocker then allegedly caused the new companies to issue large blocks of stock to Carrera Capital, Inc., or to other persons, such that he or the other persons typically held 99% of the stock in the new companies. Through this scheme, Stocker was allegedly able to gain control of public shells without having to pay for them or otherwise deal with their former control persons. The Commission alleges that Stocker profited from the scheme by selling the shells for cash payments., Because an exchange of stock under false pretenses took place, fraud occurred in the offer or sale and in connection with the purchase or sale of a security. The Commission thus alleges that Stocker violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The issuance of stock in the new companies to the shareholders of the old companies also allegedly constituted an unregistered distribution of stock in violation of Sections 5(a) and (c) of the Securities Act of 1933, and the Commission charges the defendants with violating these provisions., The Commissions complaint seeks permanent injunctions, orders to provide an accounting, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, third tier civil penalties, and penny stock bars against each defendant., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2008/comp20681.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20681.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Indeed, Sladich promised investors 50–100% guaranteed return on their investment in one year. She also promised investors additional payments for every investor they referred., Sladichs representations to investors were simply false. Throughout the scheme, Kay Services had no revenue-generating business or assets. Instead of investing in real estate, Sladich used investor money: (1) to pay Kay Services obligations to existing investors; (2) to pay Sladichs personal expenses; and (3) to purchase real property and other assets for Sladich and her relatives.

Heinen, the former General Counsel of Apple, Inc.  As part of the settlement Heinen, of Portola Valley, California, agreed (without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations) to pay $2.2 million in disgorgement, interest and penalties, be barred from serving as an officer or director of any public company for five years, and be suspended from appearing or practicing as an attorney before the Commission for three years., The settlement stems from a complaint filed by the Commission in April 2007 in federal court in the Northern District of California.  According to the complaint, Heinen caused Apple to fraudulently backdate two large options grants to senior executives of Apple — a February 2001 grant of 4.8 million options to Apples Executive Team and a December 2001 grant of 7.5 million options to Apple Chief Executive Officer Steve Jobs — and altered company records to conceal the fraud.  The complaint alleges that as a result of the backdating Apple underreported its expenses by nearly $40 million., In the first instance, Apple granted 4.8 million options to six members of its Executive Team (including Heinen) in February 2001.  Because the options were in-the-money when granted (i.e. could be exercised to purchase Apple shares at a below market price), Apple was required to report a compensation charge in its publicly-filed financial statements.  The Commission alleges that, in order to avoid reporting this expense, Heinen caused Apple to backdate options to January 17, 2001, when Apples share price was substantially lower.  Heinen is also alleged to have directed her staff to prepare documents falsely indicating that Apples Board had approved the Executive Team grant on January 17.  As a result, Apple failed to record approximately $18.9 million in compensation expenses associated with the option grant., The Commissions complaint also alleges improprieties in connection with a December 2001 grant of 7.5 million options to CEO Steve Jobs.  Although the options were in-the-money at that time, Heinen — as with the Executive Team grant — caused Apple to backdate the grant to October 19, 2001, when Apples share price was lower.  As a result, the Commission alleges that Heinen caused Apple to improperly fail to record $20.3 million in compensation expense associated with the in-the-money options grant.  The Commission further alleges that Heinen then signed fictitious Board minutes stating that Apples Board had approved the grant to Jobs on October 19 at a Special Meeting of the Board of Directors — a meeting that, in fact, never occurred., As part of the settlement, Heinen consented (without admitting or denying the allegations) to a court order that:, In addition, Heinen agreed to resolve a separate administrative proceeding against her by consenting to a Commission order that suspends her from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an attorney for three years., For further information please see:, <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20086.htm>Litigation Release No. 20086</a>,  ]"

The Commission charged Bremerton, Wash.-based GHL Technologies, Inc., and its CEO Gene Hew-Len with issuing a series of false press releases touting the companys business dealings. The Commission also charged Francisco Abellan (also known as Frank Abel) of Barcelona, Spain with coordinating the scheme, sending glossy promotional mailers to over 2 million U.S. recipients and unloading over $13 million in GHL stock on unsuspecting investors., At the SECs request, the federal district court in Tacoma, Wash. Thursday issued an order freezing Abellans assets and prohibiting him from further dissipating the proceeds of the scheme (most of which, according to the SEC, he transferred to multiple bank accounts in the principality of Andorra)., GHL (later renamed NXGen Holdings, Inc.) is an installer of GPS-based navigation equipment. According to the Commissions complaint, in early 2006, President and CEO Hew-Len and stock promoter Abellan arranged for GHL to issue millions of shares of GHL stock to offshore entities designated by Abellan. In April 2006, the SEC alleges, Abellan caused the dissemination of The Street Stock Report, a full-color glossy mailer sent to millions of U.S. addresses urging investors to purchase GHL stock quickly to see huge trading profits. Around the same time, Hew-Len issued nine press releases over a nine-week period hyping the company. Among other things, according to the SEC, the press releases made false claims about contracts with large customers, fraudulently touting millions of dollars in potential revenues., Following this concerted promotion campaign, GHLs stock price doubled and trading volume spiked nearly 1500%. Abellan and his entities sold their GHL stock holdings for profits in excess of $13 million. The stock, which reached a high of nearly $9 per share at the height of the scheme, now trades at under a penny., The SECs complaint charges GHL, Hew-Len and Abellan with violating Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions, disgorgement, penalties, and other permanent and emergency relief.

Tarnow, United States District Judge for the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. , The Commission’s complaint, filed on April 25, 2006, alleged that Hayes, acting through former senior officers and employees, engaged in a fraudulent scheme to achieve corporate earnings targets and mask declining operating results.  The complaint alleged that as a result of the fraudulent accounting scheme, Hayes made materially false filings with the Commission in fiscal years 1999 and 2000 and for the first quarter of 2001, including the companys annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2001, and the quarterly reports on Forms 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended April 30, 2000, July 31, 2000, October 31, 2000 and April 30, 2001. , The complaint also alleged that, upon learning of the fraudulent accounting scheme, Cucuz and Shovers made affirmative misrepresentations to the companys outside independent auditor about Hayes financial statements and caused Hayes to make Commission filings containing material misrepresentations.  The complaint further alleged that Cucuz and Shovers took affirmative steps to conceal information about the improper accounting practices from Hayes outside independent auditor and Hayes Audit Committee and Board of Directors.  Finally, the complaint alleged that Cucuz and Shovers made material misrepresentations about Hayes financial condition in connection with a $300 million Rule 144A bond offering by Hayes in June 2001., The jury found that Shovers violated: (i) the antifraud provisions of both the Securities Act of 1933 (Section 17(a)(3)) and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder); (ii) the internal controls and books and records provisions of the Exchange Act (Section 13(b)(5) and Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1); and (iii) the lying-to-auditor provision of the Exchange Act (Rule 13b2-2).

Further, the Complaint alleges that Shapiro inflated earnings by executing large quarter-end inventory purchases solely to generate discounts that Fleming could immediately recognize as earnings in an effort to help meet Wall Street analysts earnings expectations.

On August 21, 2008, United States District Judge Sam A.

The court set a hearing for September 4, 2008 to consider the Commissions application for preliminary injunctive relief., The defendants named in the Commissions Complaint are:, <b>Patrick H. Haxton</b>, age 51, of Carrollton, Texas, the owner and sole manager of Royal; and , <b>Royal Forex Management, LLC</b>, a Texas limited liability corporation operated out of Haxtons Carrollton home., The Commissions Complaint alleges that from at least June 2007 to the present Haxton, personally and through Royal, raised at least $305,000 from 8 investors in three states. Haxton offers the Forex investments through the Royal web site (<a href=/cgi-bin/goodbye.cgi?www.royalforexmanagement.com>www.royalforexmanagement.com</a>), advertising on his work truck and personal contacts. Royals promotional materials and Haxtons oral statements are replete with representations of phenomenal past trading returns, including claims of 400% to 500% annual returns, generated by a complex software program named The Currency Trading Robot (Trading Robot), purportedly created by Haxton. On the web site, Haxton claims to have a great history and to have been a very successful trader since 2000. Haxton and the web site also represent that there is very little risk of loss., The Commission alleges, however, that these representations are materially false and misleading. For instance, the Commission contends that Haxton and Royal never generated the claimed phenomenal returns by trading currency. Indeed, according to the Complaint, Haxton lost a significant portion of investor funds trading foreign currencies and misappropriated the remaining funds for his own personal use.

The Commission also sued the owners of each company, John E. Brake and Gary P. Johnson (both of Southern California) for misappropriating millions of dollars of investor funds to finance everything from beachfront homes to undisclosed side businesses.  Boucher and Johnson have settled with the Commission without admitting or denying the allegations., According to complaints filed today in federal district court in San Francisco, from 1999 through 2005, the defendants collectively raised about $20 million from investors based upon misrepresentations that the money would be used to fund large-scale real estate development projects and that the investments were secured by real property.  In reality, the investments were not secured: one development company never owned property, and by the summer of 2002, the other companys lone property was so heavily debt laden that its debts exceeded potential profits. In the end, neither company successfully developed a real estate project, and investors lost millions of dollars., The Commission alleges that many investors became interested because Boucher — a hedge fund manager and the author of the book The Hedge Fund Edge — recommended the investments in a monthly newsletter he circulated to his advisory clients., The Commissions complaints allege that the defendants misused investor funds to pay for a wide variety of personal expenses.  Among other things, Brake allegedly used investor funds to pay for a beachfront home rental in Carmel, California, luxury automobiles, a personal chauffeur, private jet travel, jewelry and designer clothing, while Johnson used investor funds to launch a failed furniture business.  The Commission also alleges that Boucher used investor money to pay a portion of the mortgage on his personal residence., Boucher, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, has agreed to a permanent injunction from further violations of Sections 17(a) and 17(b) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder (Exchange Act), and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

According to the complaint, a Philippines-based firm controlled by Con-way made approximately $417,000 in improper payments to numerous foreign government officials between 2000 and 2003.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission’s complaint, Con-way agreed to pay a $300,000 civil penalty., The complaint alleges that Emery Transnational, a Manila, Philippines-based firm engaged in shipping and freight operations in the Philippines, was controlled by a wholly-owned, U.S.-based subsidiary of Con-way.  The complaint further alleges that between 2000 and 2003, Emery Transnational made approximately $244,000 in improper payments to foreign officials at the Philippines Bureau of Customs and the Philippine Economic Zone Area.  The complaint alleges that these payments were made to induce these foreign officials to violate customs regulations, settle customs disputes, and reduce or not enforce otherwise legitimate fines for administrative violations., The complaint also alleges that, during this period, Emery Transnational made approximately $173,000 in improper payments to foreign officials at fourteen state-owned airlines that conducted business in the Philippines.  The complaint alleges that these payments were made to induce airline officials to improperly reserve space for Emery Transnational on the airplanes, to falsely under-weigh shipments, and to improperly consolidate multiple shipments into a single shipment, resulting in lower shipping charges., According to the complaint, none of the improper payments made by Emery Transnational were accurately reflected in Con-way’s books and records, and Con-way knowingly failed to implement a system of internal accounting controls concerning Emery Transnational that would both ensure that Emery Transnational complied with the FCPA and require that the payments it made to foreign officials were accurately reflected on its books and records.

Fishman is the former president and chief executive officer of One Liberty Properties, Inc. (OLP), a publicly traded New York based real estate investment trust.  In one scheme, Fishman misappropriated hundreds of thousands of dollars from Medemil LLC (Medemil), a company Fishman created purportedly to invest in foreign currency options.  In the second scheme, Fishman extracted undisclosed kickbacks from two OLP business partners.  , The Commission’s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, alleges that, between 2001 and 2005, Fishman raised approximately $940,000 from seventeen individuals to invest in Medemil and misappropriated at least $609,000 of this amount to pay personal expenses and to gamble.  The complaint further alleges that Fishman concealed his misappropriation of Medemil funds by deliberately falsifying account statements and other documents he provided to Medemil’s investors and accountants.  By 2005, all of the Medemil investors’ funds had been dissipated as a result of Fishman’s misconduct and through trading losses., The complaint further alleges that in 2002 and 2003, Fishman received almost $1 million in undisclosed kickbacks from two of OLP’s commercial partners in exchange for, among other things, more favorable terms in connection with business transactions involving OLP.  Fishman never disclosed these payments and their relation to OLP’s business transactions to OLP or to OLP’s auditors.  Consequently, OLP never disclosed these related party transactions in its financial statements, proxy statements, or registration statements filed with the Commission between 2002 and 2005. , The Commission’s complaint charges Fishman with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, and 13b2-2 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting violations by OLP of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(B)(i), and 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, and 14a-9 thereunder., Fishman agreed to settle the Commission’s claims against him.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Fishman consented to the entry of a final judgment, subject to approval by the court, that enjoins him from violating or aiding and abetting future violations of the above provisions of the securities laws, permanently bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and orders him to pay $821,843.65 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and a $75,000 civil penalty.  The Commission will seek the court’s approval to place the disgorgement, prejudgment interest and civil penalty in a Fair Fund, as provided in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, in order to distribute the money to Medemil investors who were harmed by Fishman’s misconduct., The Commission acknowledges the assistance and cooperation of the United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York and the New York Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2008/comp20691.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20691.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Strauss of Cleveland, Ohio, a defendant in a previously-filed civil injunctive action involving a multi-faceted scheme to manipulate the stock price of Competitive Technologies, Inc., (CTT), a technology development company located in Fairfield, Connecticut.  In addition, Judge Hall permanently enjoined Strauss from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  These remedial penalties follow a November 29, 2007 verdict for the Commission on all of its securities fraud charges against Strauss after a three-week jury trial in Bridgeport, Connecticut., The Commissions complaint, filed against a total of eight defendants on August 11, 2004, alleged that the defendants participated in a scheme to manipulate and inflate the price of CTT stock from at least July 1998 to June 2001. The complaint alleged that the defendants artificially raised and maintained the price of CTTs stock and created a false or misleading appearance with respect to the market for CTT stock through manipulative practices such as placing buy orders at or near the close of the market in order to inflate the reported closing price (marking the close), placing successive buy orders in small amounts at increasing prices (painting the tape), and using accounts they controlled or serviced to place pre-arranged buy and sell orders in virtually identical amounts (placing matched trades)., The jury found Strauss liable for violating Sections 9(a) and 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.  In addition, the jury found Strauss liable for aiding and abetting defendant and former registered representative Chauncey Steeles violations of Sections 9(a) and 10(b) of the Exchange Act.  Steele previously settled the Commission’s action against him in 2005.  The jury was unable to reach verdicts on most of the charges against two remaining defendants: Richard A. Kwak, a registered representative formerly associated with a broker-dealer in San Diego, California and Stephen J. Wilson, a registered representative formerly associated with a broker-dealer in Media, Pennsylvania. The Commission expects to retry its case against defendant Wilson, currently scheduled to begin on September 29, 2008, and its case against defendant Kwak, which is expected to occur in early 2009., The SEC also announced that on April 8, 2008, the Court determined that a bar from serving as an officer or director of any public company was not warranted against CTT’s former CEO, defendant Frank R. McPike of Ridgefield, Connecticut.  On October 31, 2007, the Court entered a final judgment by consent against defendant McPike, enjoining him from violating Sections 9(a) and 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $60,000, but leaving the issue of an officer and director bar open., For further information about the Commissions action in SEC v.

The order against Fletcher also requires him to disgorge $5,000,000, plus prejudgment interest, and pay a civil money penalty of $130,000., The SEC’s complaint charges that ProVision and Fletcher fraudulently raised millions of dollars from investors, and then Fletcher used the money for personal expenses and to support his lavish lifestyle, including purchasing jewelry and clothing, and for gambling.  The complaint alleges that Fletcher was the chief executive officer, chairman and president of ProVision, a company that purportedly provided continuing education and support to investors through seminars and workshops focusing on real estate investing, stock investing and other wealth-building strategies.  The Commission’s complaint also alleges that while raising funds from investors, ProVision and Fletcher fraudulently represented that the company was successful and expanding.

The amended complaint also adds broker-dealer fraud charges against defendant Steven Byers. The Commissions original complaint alleged that defendants conducted a massive Ponzi-type scheme from 2005 or earlier that raised approximately $255 million from approximately 1,200 investors. The targets of the fraudulent offerings are primarily members of the Orthodox Jewish community. Simultaneously with the filing of the original action, the Commission sought and obtained emergency relief from the Court to freeze the defendants assets, place the Wextrust entities under the control of a receiver to safeguard assets and issue a temporary restraining order to stop the ongoing offerings and orders granting other immediate relief. With the filing of the amended complaint, the Commission sought and obtained a temporary order freezing the assets of the relief defendant, Elka Shereshevsky., The Commissions original complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan on August 11, 2008, charged that Wextrust, its principals Steven Byers and Joseph Shereshevsky, and its affiliated entities Wextrust Equity Partners, LLC (WEP), Wextrust Development Group, LLC (WDG), Wextrust Securities, LLC (Wextrust Securities) and Axela Hospitality, LLC (Axela) conducted at least 60 securities offerings through private placements and created approximately 150 entities in the form of limited liability companies or similar vehicles to act as issuers or facilitators of the offerings, purportedly to fund the acquisition of specified assets, the majority of which were commercial real estate ventures. Contrary to representations in the offering memoranda that proceeds would be used for specific projects, the defendants allegedly diverted funds to pay returns to investors in prior offerings, or to fund expenses of the defendants. Overall, the complaint alleged that defendants diverted at least $100 million dollars to unauthorized purposes and that defendants are conducting at least four ongoing offering frauds intended to raise money to pay back investors from prior offerings. In addition to the emergency relief sought when filed, the Commissions original complaint seeks disgorgement of the defendants ill-gotten gains, civil penalties, and permanent injunctions barring future violations of the antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws., The Amended Complaint alleges that defendant Joseph Shereshevsky routinely placed his own assets - residential real estate, bank accounts, and a share in the ownership of Wextrust - in his wifes name. The Amended Complaint further alleges that Elka Shereshevsky had a no show job at Wextrust and received improper transaction-based compensation and bonuses for sales of securities her husband made through Wextrust Securities while he was not registered as an associated person with it. Although Elka Shereshevsky purportedly holds twenty percent ownership of Wextrust Securities as General Partner of the Shereshevsky Family Partnership, the Amended Complaint alleges that defendant Joseph Shereshevsky controls that interest., The Amended Complaint further alleges that in early August 2008, when numerous Wextrust accounts had been frozen, defendant Joseph Shereshevsky directed his wife to open an account with a bank in Norfolk, Virginia, into which he diverted at least $75,000 of his own or Wextrust investment vehicle assets. In addition, the court-appointed receiver in this matter has identified other accounts putatively controlled by Elka Shereshevsky that contain more than $825,000 of her husbands or the Wextrust Defendants assets.

The SECs Division of Enforcement in 2007 formed a subprime working group, which is aggressively investigating possible fraud, market manipulation, and breaches of fiduciary duty that may have contributed to the recent turmoil in the credit markets., The complaint, filed today in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that Julian Tzolov and Eric Butler misled customers into believing that auction rate securities being purchased in their accounts were backed by federally guaranteed student loans and were a safe and liquid alternative to bank deposits or money market funds. Instead, the securities that Tzolov and Butler purchased for their customers were backed by subprime mortgages, collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), and other non-student loan collateral., The complaint also alleges that Tzolov and Butler, while employed at Credit Suisse in New York, deceived foreign corporate customers in short-term cash management accounts by sending or directing their sales assistants to send e-mail confirmations in which the terms St. Loan or Education were added to the names of non-student loan securities purchased for the customers. Tzolov and Butler also routinely deleted references to CDO or Mortgage from the names of the securities in these e-mails. As a result, the complaint alleges that customers were stuck holding more than $800 million in illiquid securities after auctions for auction rate securities began to fail in August 2007. Those holdings have since significantly declined in value., The Commissions complaint charges Tzolov and Butler with securities fraud in violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.

The Commission alleges that over a ten-year period, Stanley and others participated in a scheme to bribe Nigerian government officials in order to obtain construction contracts worth more than $6 billion. The contracts were awarded to a four-company joint venture of which The M.W. Kellogg Company, and later KBR, was a member., The Commission alleges that beginning as early as 1994, Stanley and other members of the joint venture determined that it was necessary to pay bribes to individuals within the Nigerian government in order to obtain contracts to build liquefied natural gas facilities (LNG Trains) in Bonny Island, Nigeria. Stanley and others met with high-ranking Nigerian government officials and their representatives on at least four occasions to arrange the bribe payments. To conceal the illicit payments, Stanley and others approved entering into sham contracts with two agents to funnel money to the Nigerian officials. Thereafter, as the joint venture was paid for its work building the LNG Trains, the joint venture paid the agents over $180 million. In turn, substantial payments were made to various Nigerian government officials., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Stanley has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the anti-bribery, record-keeping and internal control provisions of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Sections 30A and 13(b)(5) and Rule 13b2-1). Stanley has also agreed to cooperate with the SECs ongoing investigation.

URI separately guaranteed the equipment manufacturer against any losses it might incur under the guarantee it had extended to the financing company., The SECs complaint also alleges that in another effort to improve its earnings, URI engaged in a series of fraudulent trade packages with suppliers. The company sold blocks of used equipment for amounts in excess of fair value, in exchange for certain undisclosed financial inducements offered to those suppliers., In addition, the SEC alleges that from 1997 to 2000, during a period of enormous growth through acquisitions, URI engaged in other improper accounting practices involving its valuations of acquired assets, use of acquisition reserves, and accounting for customer relationships as well as improperly accounting for other items that overstated net income, including its estimation and recording of self-insurance reserves, its recognition of equipment rental revenues, and its income tax accounting., Without admitting or denying the charges, URI has agreed to settle the SECs enforcement action and pay $14 million penalty, which the Commission intends to place in a Fair Fund for distribution to affected investors., In addition to the financial penalty, URI consented to be permanently enjoined from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13, thereunder.

Between April 2003 and October 2005, Dawson allocated approximately 400 trades to his personal account, approximately 393 of which were profitable on the first day, for a success rate of approximately 98%. In contrast, of the 2,880 trades Dawson allocated to his clients during the same time, only 1,489 were profitable on the first day for a success rate of approximately 52%. Dawson did not tell his clients — Victoria Investors or his individual clients — about his cherry-picking scheme., The Commissions complaint also alleges that Dawson used Victoria Investors funds to pay for personal and family expenses. Dawson did not disclose to Victoria Investors that he was using Victoria Investors assets to pay for his personal expenses., The Commission alleges that Dawson violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. In its lawsuit, the Commission seeks an order permanently enjoining Dawson from violations of the above provisions of the federal securities laws. The Commission also seeks disgorgement, plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against Dawson., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2008/comp20707.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20707.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Boston, Jr. (Boston) of Canton, Georgia from violating certain of the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws. The order, entered with Bostons consent, permanently enjoins him from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 10b-10 promulgated thereunder, and from aiding and abetting violations of Rule 10b-10 of the Exchange Act., The SECs complaint in this matter charges that Michael E. Kelly and 25 other defendants, including Boston and his former business, Century Estate Planning, Inc. (Century Estate Planning), participated in a massive fraud on U.S. investors that involved the offer and sale of securities in the form of Universal Lease investments. Universal Leases were structured as timeshares in several hotels in Cancun, Mexico, coupled with a pre-arranged rental agreement that promised investors a high, fixed rate of return. The SECs complaint alleges that from 1999 until 2005, Kelly and others, including Boston and Century Estate Planning, raised at least $428 million through the Universal Lease scheme from investors throughout the United States, with more than $136 million of the funds invested coming from IRA accounts. The SEC further alleges that a nationwide network of unregistered salespeople who sold the Universal Leases, including Boston and Century Estate Planning, collected undisclosed commissions totaling more than $72 million. The SEC also alleges that Kelly and others ran the scheme from Cancun, Mexico, through a number of foreign entities in Mexico and Panama. According to the SECs complaint, Kelly and others told investors that Universal Leases would generate guaranteed income through the leasing of investor timeshares by a large, independent leasing agent. In fact, the complaint alleges the leasing agent was a small Panamanian travel agency controlled by Kelly and for most of the scheme its payments to investors came from accounts funded by money raised from new investors. Further, the complaint alleges that Kelly and others, including Boston and Century Estate Planning, failed to disclose key facts about the Universal Lease investments, including the risks of the investments and that more than $72 million in investor funds were used to pay commissions as high as 27% to the selling brokers.

Cal.)</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged three former senior executives of Embarcadero Technologies, Inc., alleging that they fraudulently backdated stock option grants to employees at the San Francisco business software company and reported false financial information to shareholders., The Commission alleges that the former CEO, President and Chairman, Stephen R. Wong, the former CFO, Raj P. Sabhlok, and the former Controller, Michael C. Pattison, concealed millions of dollars in compensation expenses associated with valuable, “in-the-money” options secretly granted to company employees.  , The Commission’s complaints, filed in federal district court in San Francisco, allege that Embarcadero routinely provided valuable options priced at below market prices to its employees.  The Commission alleges that the three executives allowed Embarcadero to avoid reporting expenses for these options by backdating paperwork to make it appear as if the options had been granted on an earlier date, when the stock was trading at a lower price.  According to the Commission’s complaints, Embarcadero made hundreds of backdated stock option grants during 16 consecutive quarters.  As a result, the company significantly overstated its net income (or understated its net loss) from 2000 through 2005.  In the year with the largest percentage impact, Embarcadero understated its net losses by more than 500 percent., The Commission’s complaints also allege that all three executives participated in backdating grants, each playing a role in falsifying paperwork, selecting false grant dates, and filing false financial statements.  Moreover, according to the Commission, Sabhlok and Pattison used false documents to support large option awards to themselves that were collectively “in-the-money” by almost $1.5 million—a potential windfall hidden from Embarcadero’s shareholders. , Wong, without admitting or denying the Commission’s allegations, consented to a permanent injunction against violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), 13(b)(5) and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13, 13a-14, 13b2-1, 13b2-2, and 14a-9 thereunder.  Wong also agreed to pay a $250,000 civil penalty., The Commission’s litigated action against Sabhlok and Pattison charges both with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13 and 14a-9 thereunder.  Sabhlok is also charged with violating Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 16a-3, 13a-14, and 13b2-2.

Ramanthan was arrested in Hong Kong and extradited to the United States on May 25, 2007.  On July 2, 2008, Ramanathan pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, securities fraud, computer fraud and aggravated identity theft., In January 2007, Ramanthan was indicted by a federal grand jury in Omaha along with his brother Chockalingam Ramanathan and Jaisankar Marimuthu, also residents of Chennai.  Marimuthu and Chockalingham Ramanathan were charged with one count of conspiracy, eight counts of computer fraud, six counts of wire fraud, two counts of securities fraud and six counts of aggravated identity theft. Marimuthu is currently being detained in a Hong Kong prison awaiting extradition to the U.S. following his conviction there on similar offenses but related instead to the Hong Kong stock market. Chockalingam Ramanathan remains at large., On March 12, 2007, the SEC filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Nebraska charging all three Indian nationals with participating in a fraudulent scheme to manipulate the prices of at least fourteen securities through the unauthorized use of other people’s online brokerage accounts., The Commission’s complaint alleges that, between July and November 2006, Jaisankar Marimuthu, Chockalingam Ramanathan and Thirugnanam Ramanathan hijacked the online brokerage accounts of unwitting investors using stolen usernames and passwords.  Prior to intruding into these accounts, the Defendants acquired positions in the securities of at least thirteen issuers and options on shares of another issuer.  Then, without the account holders’ knowledge, and using the victims’ own accounts and funds, the Defendants placed scores of unauthorized buy orders at above-market prices.  After these unauthorized buy orders were placed, the Defendants sold the positions held in their own accounts at the artificially inflated prices netting unlawful trading profits of at least $121,500.  These transactions created the appearance of legitimate trading activity and pumped up the share price of the fourteen securities., The Commission’s action charges the Defendants with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement and civil money penalties., The Commission’s Office of Investor Education and Assistance has previously issued an investor alert, available on the Commission’s website, which provides tips to avoid becoming a victim of online intrusions.

Unbeknownst to Grossman and Curshen, the individual actually was an undercover FBI agent. Grossman and Curshen promised to pay a 25% kickback to the agent and the registered representatives he purported to represent in exchange for the purchase of up to $3 million of IBOT stock through the customers accounts., The complaint further alleges that from June 27 to July 2, 2008, Grossman and Curshen instructed the agent to purchase approximately 85,000 shares of IBOT stock for a total of approximately $76,000 through matched trades using detailed instructions concerning the size, price and timing of the purchase orders.

Without admitting or denying the allegations of the Complaint, Lay and MDL Capital have consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining them from engaging in the violations set forth below, and ordering other relief, The Commissions Complaint alleges that, between February 2004 and November 2004, Lay and MDL Capital defrauded their advisory client, the Ohio Bureau of Workers Compensation, in connection with the Bureaus investment of public money in the MDL Active Duration Fund, Ltd., a hedge fund affiliated with and managed by Lay and MDL Capital. The Bureau transferred approximately $200 million from its advisory account managed by MDL Capital and Lay to the hedge fund pursuant to an agreement that those assets would be conservatively leveraged., The Complaint further alleges that MDL Capital and Lay exposed Bureau funds to unauthorized and undisclosed risk by substantially exceeding a 150% leverage guideline, at one point using leverage of over 21,000% in the hedge fund. As a result, the Bureau incurred losses of approximately $160 million. During the course of the fraud, Lay repeatedly lied to and misled the Bureau as to the reasons for and amount of the losses as well as the excessive leverage Lay was using., In October 2007, based on these same facts, Lay was convicted in the Northern District of Ohio of criminal mail fraud, wire fraud and investment adviser fraud.

The Commissions complaint alleges Kerschenbaum violated the order by soliciting investors to purchase shares in a now defunct Fort Lauderdale-based penny stock company., According to the complaint, in June 2004, an Administrative Law Judge entered an order by default against Kerschenbaum barring him from participating in any offering of penny stock. The judge imposed the bar against Kerschenbaum based on his 2003 conviction for conspiring to commit securities fraud by agreeing to bribe brokers to artificially increase the stock price of a public company., The Commissions complaint alleges that after the penny stock bar was issued, Kerschenbaum accepted employment with Great Cities Media, Inc. (Great Cities), a company purportedly in the business of producing high-definition television shows. It further alleges that, throughout 2005, Great Cities conducted a private offering of its common stock which was a penny stock. According to the complaint, Kerschenbaum participated in the offering in contravention of the penny stock bar by soliciting investors to buy the Great Cities securities., The complaint alleges that, in January 2008, after a five-day hearing, another District Court Judge within the Southern District of Florida revoked Kerschenbaums probation, which included a provision prohibiting him from selling securities. The Court found that Kerschenbaum violated the terms of his probation by being part of a team that solicited investors in Great Cities from at least January to December 2005.

This caused period costs to be fraudulently capitalized in order to meet AIPCs external targets.

On many occasions, the grant dates coincided with dates of low monthly closing prices for the companys common stock.

The complaint also alleges that, because of the backdating scheme, KB Home filed periodic reports and proxy statements with the SEC that inaccurately stated that KB Home granted options at fair-market-value on the date of the grant.

Rowzee along with James R. Halstead of Santa Ana, Calif., and Robert T. Harvey of Prosper, Texas, told investors that Rowzee was an experienced securities attorney who personally screened and selected each PIPE investment after thorough due diligence. Contrary to these representations, they did not place investor funds in PIPE investments. Rowzee, Halstead, and Harvey instead used new investor funds to pay principal and returns to earlier investors, and to finance their own personal endeavors such as trips to Las Vegas, property purchases, and alimony payments., Investors must be wary of promoters, even securities attorneys or other purported experts who offer investment opportunities with high returns but fail to disclose complete and verifiable information about the investment theyre touting, said Rosalind R.

The SECs complaint also alleges that Harvey formed a California limited liability company, Harvest Income LLC, to pool investor funds to invest in the purported PIPE investments. The defendants allegedly solicited business clients and acquaintances and generated word-of-mouth referrals., According to the SECs complaint, Halstead misappropriated at least $10.4 million of investor funds to support an extravagant lifestyle that has included frequent trips to Las Vegas and three luxurious homes.

Ficken, age 33, of Boston, Massachusetts, pled guilty to one count of conspiracy, three counts of wire fraud, and two counts of securities fraud in a case being prosecuted by the United States Attorney’s Office in Boston, Massachusetts.  These charges resulted from Fickens role in a scheme to place deceptive market timing trades in mutual funds while working at the Boston branch office of Prudential Securities, Inc.  Ficken was indicted on December 19, 2007.  The indictment charged that Ficken and others at Prudential Securities disguised their own and their hedge fund customers identities in order to execute market timing trades that mutual funds were trying to prohibit.  He is currently scheduled to be sentenced before U.S. District Judge Patti B. Saris on December 10, 2008., The Commission previously filed a civil injunctive action against Ficken and others based on similar conduct.  The Commission filed its complaint against Ficken, four other former Prudential Securities registered representatives, and their former branch manager, on November 4, 2003, and amended its complaint on July 14, 2004.  The amended complaint alleged that Ficken was part of a three-person group of registered representatives, known as the Druffner Group, that defrauded mutual fund companies and the funds shareholders by placing thousands of market timing trades worth more than $1 billion for five hedge fund customers from at least January 2001 through September 2003.  According to the amended complaint, Ficken knew that the mutual fund companies monitored and attempted to restrict excessive trading in their mutual funds.  The amended complaint alleged that, to evade those restrictions when placing market timing trades, Druffner Group members disguised their own identities by establishing multiple broker identification numbers and disguised their customers identities by opening numerous customer accounts for what were, in reality, only a handful of customers.  , On September 13, 2007, the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts entered a final judgment against Ficken after having previously granted the Commissions motion for summary judgment against him.  The final judgment enjoined Ficken from future violations of the federal securities laws and ordered him to pay $589,854 in disgorgement and pre-judgment interest.  Ficken has appealed that judgment, and that appeal is pending., On September 26, 2007, the Commission instituted administrative proceedings against Ficken based on the entry of the final judgment in the civil injunctive action to determine what, if any, remedial action was appropriate and in the public interest.  On February 20, 2008, Administrative Law Judge Robert G Mahony issued an initial decision granting the Enforcement Divisions motion for summary disposition and barring Ficken from association with any broker or dealer or investment advisor.

The Final Judgment enjoined Andersen, a principal of Lydia, from engaging in future violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and holds him liable for $2,350,000 in disgorgement of profits from the conduct alleged in the Commission’s complaint, plus prejudgment interest of $177,089, but waived all except $1.8 million of the disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and did not impose a civil penalty, based on Andersen’s financial condition., The Commission originally filed its action against Andersen on April 12, 2007 and filed an amended complaint on May 1, 2007.  The amended complaint alleged that from June 2006 through April 2007, Andersen and his business partner, Glenn Manterfield, acting through Lydia, engaged in a scheme to defraud more than 60 investors who invested approximately $34 million in Lydia Capital Alternative Investment Fund LP, a hedge fund managed by Lydia.  The amended complaint alleged that the defendants told investors that they intended to use the hedge fund’s assets to acquire a portfolio of life insurance polices in the life settlement market.  According to the amended complaint, Andersen, Lydia, and Manterfield made a series of material misrepresentations and omissions, including: (1) materially overstating, and in some instances completely fabricating the hedge fund’s performance; (2) inventing business partners, offices, and investors in an attempt to legitimatize the firm and concealing the truth as to why key vendors and banks ceased relationships with the defendants; (3) lying about Manterfield’s significant criminal history, and failing to disclose a February 2007 criminal asset freeze against him in England; (4) lying about how the hedge fund planned to address certain material risks and failing to disclose others; and (5) misstating the nature of the hedge fund’s assets and its investment process.  In addition, the amended complaint alleges that Andersen and Manterfield took millions of dollars of investors’ funds by withdrawing investor monies to which they were not entitled., On April 12, 2007, the U.S. District Court issued a temporary restraining order that, among other things, froze the three defendants’ assets.  On May 3, 2007, the Court issued a preliminary injunction and ordered a continuation of an asset freeze of the defendants assets.  , The Final Judgment permanently enjoined Andersen from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

The Court, however, waived payment of all of Andersen’s disgorgement and prejudgment interest obligations except for $1,800,000, and did not impose a civil penalty, based on his financial condition.

The SEC’s complaint alleges that the outside directors recklessly approved backdated stock option grants and reviewed and signed public filings that contained materially false and misleading disclosures about the company’s stock option grants and company expenses.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC’s complaint, Kohavi, Shamir and Yaron agreed to permanent injunctions and each will pay a $100,000 financial penalty to settle the charges., Kohavi, Shamir and Yaron served on the board of directors of the company, formerly known as Mercury Interactive Corporation, from 1997 through 2005.  They served on its compensation and audit committees from at least 1997 to 2002., The SEC’s complaint, filed in federal district court for the Northern District of California, alleges that senior management at Mercury engaged in a fraudulent scheme that involved the backdating of 45 stock option grants to employees and executives that concealed hundreds of millions of dollars of compensation expenses on Mercury’s financial statements.  As alleged, the backdating occurred from as early as 1997 to April 2002, while the overstatements of income that resulted from the backdating continued to appear in the company’s financial statements through 2005.  , According to the SEC’s complaint, Kohavi, Shamir and Yaron approved 21 of those grants at the recommendation or with the direct participation of senior Mercury management.  The complaint alleges that Kohavi, Shamir and Yaron were aware that under Mercury’s stock option plan, options were required to be priced at the closing price of the company’s stock on the day that they approved the grant of options.  The complaint also alleges that they were aware that options with an exercise price lower than the price on the date the options were actually approved created a compensation expense.  The complaint alleges, however, that Kohavi, Shamir and Yaron repeatedly executed documents approving grants of stock options while failing to observe, among other things, that the exercise price of stock options they were approving was less than the market price of the company’s stock at the time of approval., The SEC’s complaint alleges that Kohavi, Shamir and Yaron routinely signed unanimous written consents and approved board meeting minutes despite being presented with numerous facts and circumstances indicating that management was backdating option grants.  For example, as alleged in the complaint:, In addition to signing unanimous written consents with “as of” dates that preceded the actual date of approval at times by months, the SEC’s complaint alleges that on a few occasions Shamir, Yaron and Kohavi signed multiple written consents presented to them by management for the same grant with different grant dates that had more favorable prices.  , Without admitting or denying the SEC’s allegations, Shamir, Yaron and Kohavi each consented to a court order that orders each of them to pay a $100,000 civil penalty and that permanently enjoins each of them from violating the antifraud, proxy, and falsification of books and records provisions of the federal securities laws – Sections 10(b) and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 14a-9 – and from aiding and abetting violations of the reporting, books and records and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws – Exchange Act Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13., The SEC previously filed civil fraud charges in federal district court against Mercury and four of its former senior officers – former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Amnon Landan, former Chief Financial Officers Sharlene Abrams and Douglas Smith, and former General Counsel Susan Skaer – based on the officers’ stock option backdating scheme and fraudulent disclosures concerning, among other things, Mercury’s “backlog” of sales revenues to manage its reported earnings.  Mercury, which was acquired by Hewlett-Packard Company on Nov. 8, 2006, after the alleged misconduct, settled the matter by agreeing to pay a $28 million penalty and to be permanently enjoined.

According to the complaint, Roberts hired a stock promoter in November 2004 to send faxes to tens of thousands of potential investors across the country. The faxes made it appear as if Infinium Labs were on the verge of launching its flagship product, a home videogame system called the Phantom. In fact, at the time of the fax campaign, Infinium Labs lacked the financial resources to overcome the significant technological and manufacturing hurdles preventing it from marketing the game system to consumers.

Most of the false statements detailed in the Complaint concerned assets which Conversion claimed to own but did not, including the entirety of two series of sovereign Venezuelan bonds. , In a previous Order issued July 21, 2008, granting the Commissions motion for default judgment, the Court found that: (1) Harris and Conversion violated Section 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; (2) Conversion violated the reporting provisions of the Exchange Act (Section 13(a) and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-11) with regard to five separate Commission filings; (3) Harris aided and abetted Conversions violations of the reporting provisions of the Exchange Act (Section 13(a) and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-11) with regard to those same five separate Commission filings; and (4) Harris falsely certified three separate periodic reports of Conversion filed with the Commission in violation of Rule 13a-14 promulgated under the Exchange Act. , The Courts September 17, 2008 decision followed a live remedies hearing on September 10, 2008, at which the Commission presented evidence that short-selling had no meaningful effect on Conversions share price from September 26 through October 23, 2006, as only approximately 250,000 shares of Conversion were sold short short out of a total of over 62,000,000 shares traded during that period. , On the basis of the evidence presented at the hearing, the Court found that Conversion never had any business-related revenue, and that its only source of funds was an ongoing offering of convertible notes and/or stock that began before the time period charged in the Complaint. The Court also found that Conversion had not paid any money for any of the purported assets carried on its books, which consisted of various series of bonds, uncollected interest due on the purported bonds, and a document called the UCC-1 Note. The Court found that the UCC-1 Note is not a standard piece of commercial paper, but an eight-page document signed by an individual named David Hawkins, which purports to be an Affidavit of Obligation in favor of Mad Dog Builders, Inc. and Mr. Hawkins, and which contains references to purported legal concepts including the individual energy protection maxim, the social cooperation protection maxim, and the Hebrew/Jewish Commercial Code., The Court found that, through three relatives, Harris attempted, unsuccessfully, to sell up to 1.6 million shares of Conversion into the public market during the time period alleged in the complaint, while the stock was trading at dramatically inflated prices as a result of his fraudulent misstatements about Conversions purported assets in Conversions press releases and SEC filings. The Court found that the scheme caused tremendous harm to the investing public, resulting in many millions of dollars of losses to thousands of innocent investors., On the basis of these findings, the Court permanently enjoined Harris and Conversion from future violations of the statutes it had found them to have violated in its July 21, 2008 Order. Additionally, the Court barred Harris, pursuant to Section 21(d)(2) of the Exchange Act, from acting as an officer or director of any issuer with a class of securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act or that is required to file reports pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act for a period of seven (7) years. Finally, the Court ordered Harris to pay a civil penalty of $1,170,000, and Conversion to pay a civil penalty of $250,000. The Court did not find a basis for disgorgement of any ill-gotten gains by Harris or Conversion. Accordingly, there is no statutory authority for the creation of a Fair Fund in this case, and any funds collected pursuant to the Courts September 17, 2008 Order will be paid to the U.S. Treasury. , Additional information concerning this action and the Commissions actions related to this matter can be found at:, Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19883.htm>19883</a> / Oct. 25, 2006,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20731.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Without admitting or denying the Commission’s allegations, Peever and Curtis consented to the entry of their respective judgments.  These judgments resolve the Commission’s claims against Peever and Curtis (except for the determination of monetary relief) in a civil action filed on December 19, 2007, in which the Commission alleged that that they had participated in a fraudulent scheme to manipulate the stock price of SHEP Technologies, Inc. (“SHEP”) f/k/a Inside Holdings Inc. (“IHI”), whose shares traded on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board.  With regard to the monetary relief, the judgments order Peever and Curtis each to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the Court., The Commission’s complaint alleged, in pertinent part, that during 2002 and 2003, defendants Peever and Curtis, together with certain co-defendants, engaged in a scheme to secretly obtain control of the publicly traded shell company IHI, through use of nominees.  The scheme involved merging IHI with a private company to form SHEP, paying touters to promote the IHI/SHEP stock, and then selling SHEP stock into the ensuing demand.  During the first half of 2003, Peever, Curtis, and certain co-defendants sold over 3 million SHEP shares into this artificially-stimulated demand, generating about $4.3 million in illegal proceeds.  As part of the scheme, Peever and Curtis failed to file required reports regarding their beneficial ownership of IHI and SHEP stock, and a co-defendant caused several false reports to be filed with the Commission to conceal that Peever and Curtis, among others, owned substantial positions in, and had been selling, SHEP stock., The judgments (i) permanently enjoin Peever and Curtis from future violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5; the securities registration provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 5 of the Securities Act; and the beneficial ownership reporting provisions, Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13d-1 and 13d-2 thereunder, (ii) permanently bar them from participating in any future offerings of penny stocks, and (iii) order Peever and Curtis each to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the Court., For additional information, please see <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20407.htm>Litigation Release No. 20407</a> (Dec. 17, 2007).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20733.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

In addition, the Complaint alleges that Bio Franchise acquired 1,101,055 shares of Bio Manufacturing common stock prior to the sale of Bio Extraction, and that Bio Franchise sold substantially all of these shares to foreign investors.

The Commission’s complaint alleges that from July 2003 through April 2005, the four defendants defrauded two securities brokerage firms out of a total of at least $1.16 million<b> </b>through the payment of sham finder fees and undisclosed kickbacks that ultimately came out of the pockets of the two brokerage firms., The defendants named in the Commission’s complaint are:, <b>Melyvn Nathanson (“M. Nathanson”)</b>, age 70, resides in Lady Lake, Florida.  From at least October 1998 to March 2006, M. Nathanson worked as a stock loan finder with SME, which he effectively controlled., <b>Eric Nathanson (“E. Nathanson”)</b>, age 43, resides in Lady Lake, Florida.  From October 1998 to March 2006, he worked as a stock loan finder with SME.  E. Nathanson is M. Nathanson’s son., <b>Charles Peterein (“Peterein”)</b>, age 59, resides in Evergreen Park, Illinois.

Peterein and his wife are both officers of Ganis, but Peterein alone effectively controls Ganis and its bank account., The Commission’s complaint specifically alleges as follows:  , During the relevant period, Peterein was the stock loan trader in charge of the securities lending desk at PAX, and M. Nathanson and E. Nathanson operated SME.  Through SME, M. Nathanson and E. Nathanson worked as consultants to Kellner, Dileo &amp; Co. (“Kellner”), a registered broker-dealer based in New York City, and were paid to arrange stock loan transactions for Kellner.  Pursuant to the defendants’ scheme, Peterein caused PAX to engage in stock loans with Kellner on terms that deliberately favored Kellner at PAX’s expense and increased the amount of compensation that Kellner paid to SME.  In exchange, M. Nathanson and E. Nathanson directed kickbacks to Peterein by causing Kellner to pay sham finder fees on those stock loan transactions to Ganis, a shell-company controlled by Peterein.  The fees paid to Ganis were a sham because, unbeknownst to Kellner, Ganis did not perform any finding or other legitimate services on the transactions.  In addition, Peterein never told PAX that Peterein was receiving payments from Kellner, much less that the payments were kickbacks arranged by M. Nathanson and E. Nathanson to compensate Peterein for directing stock loan transactions to Kellner at rates that purposely disadvantaged PAX in order to generate payments to both SME and Ganis.  Peterein, M. Nathanson and E. Nathanson caused PAX and Kellner to engage in over 4,000 stock loans pursuant to their scheme, with Kellner paying a total of approximately $651,580 to SME and a total of approximately $513,788 to Ganis in sham finder fees., All four defendants are charged with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and, in the alternative, with aiding and abetting each other’s violations of certain of the above provisions of the federal securities laws.

The Commission’s complaint alleges that over a period of nearly four years from 2000 through 2004, the six defendants defrauded Schonfeld Securities, LLC (“Schonfeld”), a Long Island, New York, brokerage firm, out of a total of at least $1.66 million<b> </b>through the payment of sham finder fees and undisclosed kickbacks that ultimately came out of Schonfeld’s pocket., The defendants named in the Commission’s complaint are:, <b>Kenneth Suarez (“Suarez”)</b>, age 57, resides in Staten Island, New York.  From September 2003 through May 2007, Suarez was employed as a securities lending representative with Schonfeld, where he was head of the stock loan trading desk from January 2004 to May 2007., <b>Kevin King (“King”)</b>, age 54, resides in Freehold, New Jersey.  From May 1997 through January 2005, King was employed as a securities lending representative at Van der Moolen Specialists USA, LLC (“VDM”)., <b>Ronald Garcia (“Garcia”)</b>, age 61, resides in Hudson, New York.  From January 2000 through May 2005, Garcia operated defendant Independent Investor Services, Inc. (“Independent Investor”), a purported stock loan finder firm.  , <b>Gilbert Beital (“Beital”)</b>, age 68, resides in Tampa, Florida.  From January 2000 through May 2005, Beital operated defendant Gilcar Securities of Florida, Inc. (“Gilcar”), a purported stock loan finder firm., <b>Independent Investor</b> is a New York corporation with a business address in Iselin, New Jersey.  Independent Investor is controlled by Garcia, who is its only officer.      , <b>Gilcar</b> is a Florida corporation with a business address in Tampa, Florida.  Gilcar is controlled by Beital, whose wife is its only officer., The Commission’s complaint specifically alleges as follows:, Pursuant to the defendants’ fraudulent stock loan scheme, Suarez, while the head of Schonfeld’s stock loan trading desk, caused Schonfeld to enter into stock loan transactions on terms that were deliberately unfavorable to Schonfeld in order to enable the counterparty to pay sham finder fees to either Garcia or Beital.  A portion of those fees were then kicked back to Suarez:  Garcia paid kickbacks to King -- who arranged the loans with Suarez and caused his firm, VDM, to pay the sham finder fee to Garcia -- and King then paid kickbacks to Suarez, while Beital paid kickbacks directly to Suarez.  The defendants sometimes took steps to conceal the kickback payments by, among other things, exchanging cash-filled envelopes at public restaurants, having the finder pay the trader’s credit card and mortgage bills, and making payments to a shell company.   , From January 2004 to December 2004, King caused VDM to pay Garcia’s firm, Independent Investor, a total of approximately $200,000 in sham finder fees on over 2,000 stock loan transactions involving Schonfeld.  Neither Garcia nor anyone else associated with Independent Investor performed any services in connection with those transactions.  The sham finder fees were paid at Schonfeld’s expense because Suarez caused Schonfeld to enter into the stock loans on terms that were less favorable than Schonfeld would have otherwise obtained, thus enabling VDM to pay the fees to Independent Investor.  Garcia then paid a portion of the sham finder fees to King, who, in turn, paid a portion of the fees to Suarez., From March 2000 to December 2004, Beital engaged in similar fraudulent conduct with Suarez and Suarez’s predecessor as head of Schonfeld’s stock loan trading desk (the “Second Schonfeld Trader”).  Pursuant to this kickback arrangement, Beital’s firm, Gilcar, received approximately $1.46 million in stock loan finder fees at Schonfeld’s expense.  Suarez caused Schonfeld to enter into stock loans on terms that were less favorable than Schonfeld would have otherwise obtained, thus enabling the counterparties to pay finder fees to Gilcar, in exchange for which Beital paid kickbacks to Suarez and the Second Schonfeld Trader.  Suarez received approximately $90,000 in kickbacks from Beital., All six defendants are charged with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and, in the alternative, with aiding and abetting each other’s violations of certain of the above provisions of the federal securities laws.  The Commission’s complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  , In parallel criminal proceedings, the United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York filed criminal charges in May 2008 against Suarez and Beital for some of the same conduct alleged in the Commission’s complaint., The Commission acknowledges the assistance and cooperation of the United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter.

Des Champs and former vice president of finance Martha W. Vlcek fraudulently recognized revenue on bill and hold transactions, made misleading disclosures and omissions regarding revenue recognition, and made materially false statements to the companys outside auditors when they represented the transactions were proper under generally accepted accounting principles.

Taking advantage of Videos artificially inflated stock price, Aubel dumped millions of shares of Video stock (acquired at a steep discount from Video) into the market, reaping millions of dollars.

Tex.)</h2>]","[On September 24, 2008, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil complaint against four individuals and five entities alleging that during 2006 and 2007, they engaged in a scheme to offer and sell millions of shares of penny stock to the public through false and misleading statements, while evading the registration requirements of the federal securities laws. The alleged scheme involved the stock of eCarfly, Inc., now known as Market 99, Ltd. Named as defendants are Texas residents Ryan M. Reynolds, Jason W. Brola, and Desmond J. Milligan, and Timothy T. Page, who resides in California. Also named as defendants are Market 99, Bellatalia, L.P., a Texas limited partnership that Reynolds allegedly controlled, Testre, L.P., a Texas limited partnership that Page allegedly controlled, Tryst Capital Group, L.L.C., a Texas limited liability company that Brola allegedly controlled, and Griffdom Enterprises, Inc., a Texas corporation., According to the complaint, Brola approached Reynolds in 2006 seeking to create a publicly-trading company which would sell used automobiles over the Internet and raise funds to operate by selling its shares to investors. Reynolds engaged Page to purchase a shell corporation and to give a controlling position in the shell corporations stock to Milligan. Milligan became president and CEO of the shell corporation and changed its name to eCarfly, Inc. Milligan subsequently caused eCarfly to issue shares to Testre, Griffdom, and Bellatalia. Page, Reynolds, and Brola deposited the shares held in the names of the entities into various brokerage accounts and sold them to the public. The stock sales allegedly were not registered with the Commission., The complaint alleges that, to create public demand for the eCarfly stock that Page, Reynolds, and Brola were selling, eCarfly issued numerous false and misleading press releases about its business operations, which were drafted and distributed by Milligan and Brola. The complaint alleges that, among other things, the press releases falsely claimed that eCarfly had partnerships with major national automobile dealers, that it was operating an internet automobile sales business, that it had substantial expertise in the automotive industry, and that it was opening a finance division. The press releases also allegedly made projections concerning eCarflys revenues and the price for its stock, which lacked any reasonable basis., The complaint further alleges that eCarfly made later unsuccessful attempts to merge with another company in the Internet automobile sales business. Thereafter, according to the complaint, Milligan and eCarfly engaged in further fraudulent acts by issuing false and misleading press releases about potential mergers between eCarfly and other companies, including an Australian company that was purportedly in the alternative fuels business, while eCarfly continued to issue stock to Bellatalia, Griffdom Enterprises, and Testre, who continued to sell stock to the public in unregistered transactions., Milligan, Brola, Tryst Capital, and Market 99 are charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint charges all defendants with violations of the provisions of Sections 5(a) and (c) of the Securities Act of 1933, which prohibit interstate offers and sales of securities unless a registration statement is filed or in effect with the Commission. Reynolds, Page, Griffdom Enterprises, Testre, and Bellatalia are also charged with violating Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act, which prohibits persons from acting as brokers or dealers without registration with the Commission. The Commission seeks permanent injunctions against all defendants, an accounting of stock sales proceeds, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, and civil penalties. The Commission also seeks penny stock bars against all defendants except Market 99, and officer-and-director bars against Milligan and Brola., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2008/comp20742.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20742.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Norelid recently had been assigned by the consulting company for which he worked to assist in due diligence related to the merger. Later that same month, Norelid tipped a relative, Pedro Gil Simoes, disclosing to him that Services Acquisition intended to merge with Jamba Juice., The Commissions complaint further alleges that prior to the announcement of the merger agreement on March 13, 2006, both Norelid and Simoes purchased Services Acquisition stock while in possession of material, non-public information. Following the announcement of the merger agreement, Services Acquisitions stock jumped more than 34% over its previous day closing price.

The Indictment alleges that in reality, Richman did not have cancer. Rather, according to the Indictment, he falsely claimed to be terminally ill in order to avoid discovery in the SECs case against him and to obtain a favorable settlement. The Indictment alleges that, to perpetuate his lie, Richman provided the Court with false affidavits and fabricated letters from a physician.

According to the SECs complaint, Telomolecular and Sarad falsely claimed the company was backed by a deep management and scientific team, generating significant industry interest in its technologies, and prepared to obtain financing from substantial institutions.

Goldman, a Miami, Florida resident, for fraudulently operating an unregistered securities day trading firm that primarily targeted investors in the Hispanic community.  The Commission’s complaint alleges that Goldman violated the antifraud, broker-dealer registration, and securities registration provisions of the federal securities laws.  , According to the Commission’s complaint, from approximately May 2004 through at least February 2006, Goldman solicited traders to invest approximately $2.1 million in a day trading operation he ran through his company, E Trade Fund LLC (“E Trade”).  Goldman provided securities day trading capability to E-Trade Fund’s more than 110 traders and permitted them to day trade securities in E Trade Fund’s own brokerage account at a registered broker-dealer through sub-accounts created for each trader.  <br/>The complaint alleges that Goldman held investment seminars in Spanish, which he advertised in Spanish periodicals, to solicit traders for his day trading operation.  , The Commission’s complaint alleges that Goldman misled traders into believing that their trading accounts were secured by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) and that they would be better protected against certain losses or risks by trading with E Trade Fund.  He also omitted to disclose to traders that E Trade Fun994 even though E Trade Fund’s website touted his professional experience and reputation.  The complaint alleges that E Trade Fund’s traders ultimately lost about $1.0 million out of the $2.1 million they originally invested.  , The Commission’s complaint also alleges that at the same time Goldman ran the day-trading operation, he offered and sold other investments in E Trade Fund, which he characterized as certificates of deposit.  The rates of return of these securities ranged from 5 to 10 percent annually on a 6-month certificate and 7 to 12 percent annually on a 12-month certificate.  Goldman offered these investments to the public via an affiliated website. , According to the Commission’s complaint, Goldman misrepresented to investors that these certificates were insured and protected by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and SIPC.  He also falsely told investors that the returns on the certificates were “secured” and “guaranteed” when, in fact, the funds from the sales of these certificates were used solely to sustain E Trade Fund’s high risk day trading operation and the returns were based on its success.  The complaint also alleges that Goldman violated the securities registration provisions in connection with the offer and sale of the certificates.  Goldman raised about $317,000 from at least two investors through the sale of the certificates.  , The Commission’s complaint alleges that Goldman violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 15(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The Commission also alleges that Salomon acted as an unregistered broker-dealer. Salomon and EHD have agreed to settle the charges against them, without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations., From at least March through September 2007, EHD, at Salomons direction, raised $903,195 from 22 investors through offers and sales of fractional interests in a turnkey oil and gas drilling program to be conducted in Denton County, Texas.

(SafeNet). Without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, Argo consented to the entry of the Final Judgment. The judgment settles the Commissions claims against Argo in a civil action filed on August 1, 2007, in which the Commission alleged that Argo engaged in a fraudulent scheme to backdate option grants while she was an officer of SafeNet., The Commissions complaint alleged that among other things, Argo was aware that SafeNet routinely granted in-the-money options, and she knowingly or recklessly failed to cause SafeNet to record a compensation expense as required by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Consequently, SafeNet reported materially misstated financial results for periods beginning in late-2000 through early-2006. The complaint further alleges that Argo regularly prepared, reviewed, and/or signed proxy statements, periodic reports, and registration statements that she knew, or was reckless in not knowing, contained materially false and misleading statements and omissions concerning SafeNets financial condition and options granting practices., The Final Judgment (i) permanently enjoins Argo from future violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5; the periodic report certification provision, Section 13a-14 of the Exchange Act; the prohibitions against public company officers and directors falsifying accounting records and making false or misleading statements to an issuers auditors, Exchange Act Rules 13b2-1 and 13b2-2; the prohibition on false or misleading statements in proxy statements filed by an issuer, Exchange Act Rule 14a-9; and the beneficial ownership of securities reporting provision, Exchange Act Rule 16a-3; and from aiding and abetting violations of the issuer periodic reporting, books and records, and internal controls provisions, Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13, (ii) imposes a ten year officer and director bar, and (iii) orders Argo to pay a civil penalty of $50,000 (which will be offset by any payment Argo makes toward the $1,000,000 fine that was imposed upon her in a parallel criminal prosecution)., As part of the settlement, the Commission today issued an administrative order, pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3) of the Commissions Rules of Practice, suspending Argo from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant.

Sentenced were Daniel William Heath, 51, formerly of Chino Hills, California, Denis Timothy OBrien, 53, formerly of Yorba Linda, California, and Heaths father, John William Heath, now-deceased, formerly of Covina, California. Daniel Heath was sentenced on September 26, 2008 to 127 years and four months in state prison: OBrien on April 4, to 40 years and four months; and John Heath on February 22, to 28 years and four months. Each defendant received the maximum sentence for their convictions and was ordered to pay a total of $117 million in restitution to the defrauded investors., In 2004, the Riverside County District Attorneys Office arrested and charged the defendants with committing securities fraud, elder abuse, grand theft, money laundering, tax fraud, and conspiracy, all under California law. In January 2008, a Riverside County jury found Daniel Heath found guilty on 400 felony counts, OBrien on 70 felony counts, and John Heath on 52 felony counts., In 2004, the Commission filed a complaint against Daniel Heath and OBrien alleging they fraudulently induced elderly investors through free lunch seminars to invest in secured notes that paid a guaranteed return. Final judgments of permanent injunction and other relief were entered enjoining them from violating the antifraud, securities registration, and broker-dealer registrations provisions of the federal securities laws for their role in the scheme and they were ordered to disgorge to the receiver their ill-gotten gains. The Commission also instituted administrative proceedings against Heath and OBrien barring them from association with a broker or dealer and they consented to the entry of the final judgments and administrative orders without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations and findings. In September 2007, the Commission instituted separate administrative proceedings against two other men involved in the scheme that were barred from association with any broker or dealer and ordered to disgorge ill-gotten gains and they consented to the entry of the orders without admitting or denying the Commissions findings., Administration of the court-order receivership over the Heath entities will continue., The Commission wishes to acknowledge and thank the Riverside County District Attorneys Office for their substantial assistance in this matter., For further information, see Litigation Release Nos. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18689.htm>18689</a> (May 3, 2004), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18703.htm>18703</a> (May 11, 2004), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18724.htm>18724</a> (May 24, 2004), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18777.htm>18777</a> (July 9, 2004), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr19287.htm>19287</a> (June 28, 2005), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20438.htm>20438</a> (January 24, 2008), and Administrative Proceeding Release Nos. <a href=/litigation/admin/34-51473.pdf>34-51473</a> (April 4, 2005), <a href=/litigation/admin/34-51922.pdf>34-51922</a> (June 24, 2005), and <a href=/litigation/admin/2007/33-8838.pdf>33-8838</a> (September 5, 2007).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20753.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Petry with insider trading in the stock of Texas-based Chaparral Steel Co., prior to the announcement of its acquisition by Florida-based Gerdau Ameristeel, S.A. on July 10, 2007.  At the time of his trading, Petry was a director of Gerdau Ameristeels Brazilian parent, Gerdau, S.A.  Petry has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that will enjoin him from violating certain provisions of the federal securities laws, will require him to pay a total of $166,331 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty, and will bar him from being an officer or director of a public company for five years., The Commissions Complaint alleges that in or about May 2007, through his position as a director of Gerdau, Petry learned that Gerdau Ameristeel had identified Chaparral as one of seven or eight possible acquisition targets.  During early June 2007, again through his position as a director of Gerdau, Petry learned that Gerdau Ameristeel had begun conducting extensive due diligence work on Chaparral in connection with a possible acquisition and that Gerdau Ameristeel planned on requesting approval from the Gerdau board at its next meeting to make an acquisition proposal to Chaparral.  According to the Complaint, On June 26, 2007, Petry attended the Gerdau board of directors meeting at which the Gerdau board authorized Gerdau Ameristeel to proceed with its bid to acquire Chaparral.  The possible acquisition of Chaparral by Gerdau Ameristeel was material, nonpublic information that Petry was privy to by virtue of his position as a member of Gerdaus board of directors., The Commissions Complaint further alleges that, between June 25 and 27, 2007, Petry, while in the possession of this material, non-public information concerning the possible acquisition of Chaparral by Gerdau Ameristeel, purchased 8,500 shares of Chaparral stock.  On the afternoon of July 10, 2007, after the closing of the market, Gerdau Ameristeel issued a press release publicly announcing its acquisition of Chaparral.  The closing price of Chaparral stock increased 11 percent the next day.  As a result, the Complaint alleges that Petry profited by $105,044., The Commissions complaint charges Petry with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  To settle the Commissions charges, Petry has consented, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions Complaint, to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from committing future violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Belot, for the District of Kansas, Wichita Division, appointed a receiver and froze the assets of four defendants and two relief defendants in an emergency injunctive action filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission). The charges stem from an alleged securities offering fraud that raised approximately $2.8 million from approximately 50 investors across the United States.  The case is an off-shoot of a previously filed massive securities oil-and-gas related offering fraud case, SEC v. Michael J. McNaul, II, et al., pending in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas, Wichita Division, Civil Action No. 08-1159-JTM- DWB.  Both cases involve the use of purported oil-and-gas equipment-leasing joint ventures that were allegedly structured to evade the securities laws.  In truth, however, the investments are not joint ventures, but investment contracts, which meet the statutory definition of securities and fall within the scope of the federal securities laws., Named as defendants in the Commissions case are:, The complaint also named two entities formed by Brooks and Cohen as relief defendants: Onshore Leasing, LLC (Onshore) and PJB Enterprises, Inc. (PJB)., The complaint alleges that defendants Delta Management and Jackson offered and sold securities in the same fraudulent manner as the defendants in the McNaul case, including using offering materials that are virtually identical to the materially false and misleading materials used by the McNaul defendants.  Among other things, defendants Delta Management and Jackson allegedly misrepresented that the venture had acquired two drilling rigs that were ready to go to work earning the venture annual returns of 25% to 36%.  In fact, as of early August 2008, when defendant Jackson was contacted by the SEC and ceased the offering, the Delta venture had not acquired any drilling rigs and investors had not received any returns over the seven-month period of the scheme.  Moreover, the complaint alleges that approximately half of the funds raised from investors was used to pay exorbitant sales commissions to unlicensed securities salesmen, including defendants Brooks, Cohen and Hertz, who cold called unsuspecting investors, over half of whom are 60 years old or older., The complaint alleges that Jackson and Delta Management violated the anti-fraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act.  The complaint also alleges that Brooks, Cohen and Hertz violated Section 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act, and the broker-dealer registration provision of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act.  The complaint seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions, disgorgement together with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  The complaint further alleges that the relief defendants identified above received ill-gotten gains from the fraudulent offering., The Court has frozen the assets of defendants Delta Management, Brooks, Cohen and Hertz, as well as the assets of relief defendants Onshore and PJB.  A receiver has also been appointed to recover and conserve assets for the benefit of defrauded investors., Without admitting or denying the allegations set forth in the complaint, Jackson and Delta Management have consented to the entry of an order permanently enjoining them from engaging in the violations set forth above, and deferring any monetary relief until a later date., The Commission acknowledges the cooperation and assistance of the Oklahoma Securities Commission during this investigation.,  ]"

Penn Traffic also agreed to certain undertakings that require it to employ an independent examiner, among other things. The settlement is subject to the Courts approval., According to the SECs complaint, Penn Traffic intentionally inflated its operating income and other financial results by prematurely recognizing promotional allowances in a scheme that lasted from approximately the second quarter of Penn Traffics fiscal year 2001 through at least the fourth quarter of its FY 2003. Promotional allowances — also referred to as rebates, slotting fees, or vendor allowances — are fees paid from vendors in exchange for various marketing and promotional activities, such as inclusion in a supermarkets weekly circular. As a result of Penn Traffics willful misconduct, the company prematurely recorded a total of approximately $10 million in operating income and reported these false results in financial reports filed with the Commission., The SECs complaint also alleges a separate scheme from at least the first quarter of Penn Traffics FY 2000 through the first quarter of its FY 2003. Penn Traffic recorded fraudulent entries to the books and records of Penny Curtiss, its wholly-owned bakery manufacturing subsidiary that has since closed. For example, Penny Curtiss fabricated accounting records to overstate inventory and reduce cost of goods sold. As a result, Penn Traffic overstated after tax net income by more than $7 million and reported these false results in financial reports filed with the Commission., The SECs complaint further alleges that Penn Traffic failed to file financial reports or filed non-compliant reports with the Commission between the fourth quarter of its FY 2003 and the fourth quarter of its FY 2008. Penn Traffic has consented to the entry of a permanent injunction against future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder., The SEC previously charged two former senior Penn Traffic executives and one Penny Curtiss executive for their roles in the fraudulent schemes alleged in the complaint. The Commissions case is pending against Leslie H. Knox, Penn Traffics former Senior Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer, and Linda J. Jones, Penn Traffics former Vice President of Non-Perishable Merchandising. In 2005, the Commission obtained a consent judgment against Michael J. Lawler, the former Director of Manufacturing at Penny Curtiss, permanently enjoining him from violating the antifraud and books and records of the securities laws., The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Northern District of New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter., For additional information see:, <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2008/comp20760.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20760.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

(DFG) — the Funds investment adviser and managing member — to invest $25 million in a fraudulent prime bank scheme. The Complaint alleges that, among other misrepresentations, Myatt falsely claimed that:, In reality, the ATI Program was a sham designed to defraud investors. No trades ever took place and no profits were actually generated. Such something-for-nothing trading programs are entirely fictional. Moreover, the Federal Reserve does not oversee any such trading programs or license any individuals to conduct such trading., The Commissions Complaint also alleges that the Funds Chief Compliance and Chief Marketing Offier, William Eichengreen, (a) defrauded the Fund by falsifying the Funds financial statements, thereby allowing DFG to take profit-based fees to which it was not entitled, and (b) defrauded prospective investors in the Fund (and DFGs individual investment adviser clients who invested in the Fund) by consistently misrepresenting the Funds trading strategy, investments, and performance., The Complaint seeks a court order permanently enjoining Eichengreen and Myatt from violating the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 [Section 17(a)], the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5], and from aiding and abetting violations of record keeping provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 [Section 204 and Rule 204-2]. The Complaint also seeks to enjoin Eichengreen from aiding and abetting violations of the antifraud provisions of the Advisers Act [Sections 206(1) and 206(2)] and seeks an order requiring Eichengreen and Myatt to pay a civil monetary penalty., The Commission has previously sued DFG and its President, Sharon Vaughn, in connection with this matter. The Commission settled all claims against DFG and Vaughn and the Court distributed the Funds assets to investors, ensuring that investors received their principal in full.

Zangara, and two entities controlled by Castaldo or Zangara with violations of the broker-dealer registration and reporting requirements. The Commissions complaint alleges that, from approximately May 2005 through February 2007, Castaldo solicited investors, and received transaction-based compensation, in connection with three offerings of securities, including one offering conducted under the auspices of Vision, and that Zangara solicited investors and received transaction-based compensation in connection with one of these offerings. According to the Complaint, this conduct was illegal because Castaldo and Zangara were not registered as brokers, and Castaldo was not a registered representative of Vision. Moreover, Zangaras brokerage activities violated the terms of a Commission order previously entered against him. In addition, the Complaint alleges that Vision filed numerous inaccurate Form BD amendments, in which it failed to disclose Gallaghers control of the firm. , The complaint names the following defendants:, Castaldo, age 37, a resident of Glen Head, New York and the president and CEO of Corporate Communications Corp. Castaldo is also a former registered representative of Stratton Oakmont Inc. and Tasin &amp; Company, Inc., and has been the subject of disciplinary action by several state securities regulators., Corporate Communications Corp., an unregistered entity with its office in Glenwood Landing, New York.

Zangara has an extensive disciplinary history including a 2004 Commission bar from association with a broker or dealer, with a right to reapply after five years. <i>See Frank Zangara</i>, Exchange Act Release No. 49805 (June 3, 2004)., BHI, a New York corporation with its principal place of business in Nassau County, New York, that is allegedly owned and controlled by defendant Zangara and his wife. , The Complaint alleges that in about May 2005, Castaldo and Zangara, a former colleague of Castaldos from Tasin, began soliciting Stock Traders Press subscribers and others for an offering of securities in an on-line comparison-shopping business. Corporate Communications received commissions on the amount Castaldo raised, and BHI received commissions on the amount that Zangara raised. The complaint further alleges that in about September 2005, Castaldos former colleague at the Stratton Oakmont firm, Gallagher, enlisted Castaldo to assist Gallaghers firm, Vision, in soliciting investors for another offering, even though Gallagher knew that Castaldo and Corporate Communications were not registered and lacked the requisite licenses. Vision ultimately paid Corporate Communications approximately seventy percent of the commissions it received on the money Castaldo raised for that offering. In addition, Vision Securities, with the knowledge and substantial assistance of Gallagher, filed numerous Form BD amendments with the Commission, in which it failed to disclose Gallaghers true relationship to, and control of, Vision.

According to the complaint, once the investors transferred funds to PCMG, Park misappropriated the funds to subsidize his lifestyle and to finance a mortgage business that he owned and controlled.  The Commissions complaint further alleges that to induce investors to open accounts with him, Park told investors that he and PCMG generated high annualized returns.  For example, according to the complaint, one investor invested $1.2 million over a three-month period after Park told him that PCMGs managed accounts had annual returns of 28%.  The complaint alleges that Park further represented to the investor that he would receive annualized returns of 36% if he kept his investment with PCMG for 18 months.  Similarly, the complaint alleges that Park told another investor that he would receive annualized returns of at least 20% to 25% by investing in an investment pool., According to the Commissions complaint, to further his fraudulent conduct, Park provided fraudulent stock purchase confirmations and/or quarterly account statements to investors on PCMG letterhead showing that various stocks had been purchased for their accounts. These confirmations and quarterly statements also falsely showed investors that their investments had grown significantly, in one instance by as much as 25% in one quarter., The complaint alleges that Park admitted his fraud to investors in a letter, dated June 30, 2008, in which he told investors that their accounts with Park Capital Management Group had no current liquid value and that he was unable to return the value of their investments.   The complaint further alleges that Park also admitted that 15 to 18 of the PCMG accounts were not legitimate., The Commissions complaint seeks permanent injunctions against Park from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The Commission alleges that since approximately January 2008, Mikula, a recidivist securities law violator, and Craddock, acting individually or through Nations Warranty or JW&amp;P Consulting, have used misrepresentations and omissions of material fact to offer and sell approximately $2.8 million of securities issued by Nations Warranty in unregistered transactions to approximately 120 investors., Nations Warranty is a Marietta, Georgia-based extended automobile warranty broker that is majority-owned and controlled by Craddock and partially owned by Mikula. The Complaint alleges that Mikula, operating through his wholly-owned entity JW&amp;P Consulting, and Craddock used material misrepresentations and omissions of material facts to offer and sell short-term promissory notes issued by Nations Warranty. The notes were sold with terms of either 100 or 220 days, and promised rates of return of 4% or 5% per month, respectively. Among the misrepresentations and omissions, the defendants described Nations Warranty to investors as a profitable company when, in fact, Nations Warranty has incurred a net loss of at least $1.2 million during 2008. Defendants also claimed the Nations Warranty notes were guaranteed when, in fact, they were not. Furthermore, Defendants represented that JW&amp;P Consulting had evaluated the risks of investing in Nations Warranty notes and had found the risks acceptable.

Rivor allegedly passed the confidential, non-public information to friends Emmanuel Axiaq of San Carlos, Calif., and Steven Lusardi of San Jose. Rivor told Emmanuel Axiaq to pass the information to his father, Francis Axiaq of Millbrae. The SEC alleges that Rivor instructed his friends to limit the size of their Restoration Hardware stock purchases to prevent detection., According to the SECs complaint, filed in federal district court in San Francisco, Emmanuel Axiaq and Lusardi complied with Rivors instruction to limit the size of their stock purchases. Meanwhile, Francis Axiaq spent the following weeks amassing nearly 250,000 shares of Restoration Hardware stock. When Restoration Hardware publicly announced the acquisition on Nov. 8, 2007, its stock price soared more than 140 percent, from $2.68 to $6.44 per share. The SECs complaint alleges that Emmanuel Axiaq and Lusardi profited by $29,539 and $4,398, respectively, on their stock purchases. The announcement gave Francis Axiaq an illicit potential profit of nearly $900,000., Rivor, Lusardi, and Emmanuel Axiaq, without admitting or denying the allegations in the SECs complaint, have agreed to a permanent injunction from further violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

According to the complaint, Lion Gate and Rickel realized profits of at least $207,291 from their illegal trading., From January 2005 through September 2006, Lion Gate and Rickel allegedly used shares purchased in fourteen registered public offerings to cover short sales that occurred during the five business days before the pricing of those offerings (the restricted period).  The Commission’s complaint alleges that this conduct violates Rule 105 of Regulation M under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  The SEC alleges that in each instance, Lion Gate and Rickel engaged in transactions that created the appearance that the shares covering the restricted period short sales were purchased on the open market.  According to the complaint, Rickel made every trading decision and placed every one of the violative trades., At the time of the conduct in the complaint, Rule 105 prohibited covering a short sale made during the restricted period with securities purchased in a registered offering.  Rule 105 was designed to prevent manipulative short selling prior to registered public offerings and to promote offering prices based upon open market prices, as determined by supply and demand rather than artificial forces.  Short sellers who violated Rule 105 largely could avoid market risk by using shares purchased at a discount in a registered offering to cover restricted-period short sales.

Duane Reade is the operator of the largest chain of drug stores in the New York Metropolitan area., The SEC’s complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that the former Duane Reade executives entered into a series of fraudulent transactions designed to boost reported income, and enable the company to meet quarterly and annual earnings guidance.  According to the SEC’s complaint, the fraudulent transactions were designed by the company’s former CEO, Anthony J. Cuti, and primarily implemented by its former Real Estate Administrator and one-time CFO, William J. Tennant., The SEC’s complaint alleges that the earnings inflation scheme lasted from 2000 through 2004, and involved two kinds of transactions:  The “Real Estate Concession” transactions and the “Credit and Rebilling” transactions.  The Real Estate Concession transactions involved payments to Duane Reade for its agreement to relinquish purportedly valuable leases or other real-estate rights.  The complaint alleges that these agreements were in reality a sham and that most transactions involved round-trip payments in which Cuti persuaded counter-parties to make payments to Duane Reade in exchange for his promise to repay them through other fictitious transactions.  The complaint further alleges that Tennant prepared the false documentation used to implement the scheme., In the Credit and Rebilling scheme, Cuti allegedly engineered different round-trip transactions that he designed to produce additional current income.  The complaint charges that, at Cuti’s direction, Duane Reade vendors issued bogus credits to the company that were booked as a reduction to current expenses, resulting in a corresponding increase to current income.  However, Cuti also directed these vendors to rebill Duane Reade for the credited amount in later periods under fictitious invoices.  Accordingly, when Duane Reade later paid the vendors for phantom services, the fictitious credits were reversed. To disguise the connection between the invoice payments and the original credits, and to ensure that the payments could be capitalized and amortized, rather than charged against current income, Cuti allegedly had the vendors submit the fictitious invoices for work performed on a construction or maintenance project different from that on which the vendor had issued the credits. , According to the complaint, these schemes together caused Duane Reade to overstate its pre-tax income by a total of approximately $17.5 million.  To assure the success of the Real Estate Concession scheme in inflating reported income, Cuti and Tennant are alleged to have intentionally deceived the company’s CFO and other members of management.  Cuti also allegedly made false statements and omitted material facts in conversations with and written representations to the company’s independent auditors as to the true nature of the Real Estate Concession and Credit and Rebilling transactions., The SEC seeks a final judgment permanently enjoining both defendants from committing future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and from committing future violations of Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2, and from aiding and abetting future violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 15(d) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13, 15d-1, 15d-11, and 15d-13; and Cuti from committing future violations of Rules 13a-14 and 15d-14 of the Exchange Act, and from aiding and abetting future violations of Section 13(b)(2)(B); and ordering defendants to pay civil penalties and disgorgement of any ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest.

(SII), a now-defunct broker-dealer based in Springfield, Illinois. The defendants were the owners and associates of Strategic Investment Advisory, Inc. (SIA), a stock promoter that falsely claimed to provide independent recommendations about microcap companies. As the U.S. District Court for the Central District of Illinois concluded, registered representatives at SII defrauded customers by recommending the purchase of securities that SIA had been paid to tout, without disclosing that material fact to their brokerage customers., On February 20, 2008, the Honorable Jeanne E. Scott, U.S. District Judge for the Central District of Illinois, approved the Commissions Distribution Plan and appointed one of the Commissions attorneys as Distribution Agent and Tax Administrator, given the small size of the Fair Fund. Following a claims process conducted by Commission attorneys, Judge Scott granted the Commissions motion to disburse the Fair Fund to Eligible Claimants on September 24, 2008., In 2002, the SEC obtained judgments against Wayne F. Gorsek, Lyndell F. Parks and P. Brenden Gebben. The Court had previously granted the Commissions motion for summary judgment against defendants Gorsek and Parks and held them liable — as co-owners of SIA — for violations of the antifraud and anti-touting violations of the federal securities laws. After a jury trial, defendant Gebben was also found liable for violations of the antifraud and anti-touting violations of federal securities laws. Finally, after a bench trial, the Court again found defendant Gorsek liable — as a principal of SII — of defrauding his brokerage clients at SII.

According to the Commissions complaint, the defendants promised to pay investors at a rate of 6.35% annual percentage yield in nine months. The complaint alleges that at least 15 investors in six different states, including Arizona, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri, Pennsylvania, and Texas, purchased these Certificates for at least $432,400.

The Complaint alleges that Luckett took thousands of dollars from at least one Transnational bank account into which he had deposited investor funds and used the money to pay, among other things, rent on a luxury condominium in Boston and the lease on a Toyota automobile.

The verdict followed a one-week trial in Bridgeport, Connecticut before the Honorable Janet Hall, United States District Court Judge for the District of Connecticut., The Commissions complaint, filed against a total of eight defendants on August 11, 2004, alleged that the defendants participated in a scheme to manipulate and inflate the price of CTT stock from at least July 1998 to June 2001. The complaint alleged that the defendants (which included CTT itself and its former CEO, plus six former registered representatives of broker-dealers) raised and maintained the price of CTTs stock and created a false or misleading appearance with respect to the market for CTT stock through manipulative practices such as placing buy orders at or near the close of the market in order to inflate the reported closing price (marking the close), placing successive buy orders in small amounts at increasing prices (painting the tape), and using accounts they controlled or serviced to place pre-arranged buy and sell orders in virtually identical amounts (placing matched trades)., A previous trial in November 2007 resulted in a verdict in the Commissions favor against one scheme participant, Sheldon A. Strauss, a former registered representative from Cleveland, Ohio, and a hung jury against Wilson and one other defendant, Richard A. Kwak.

Shortly after receiving the one million shares, Miller and I-Vest began promoting M45. In May 2007, Miller profiled M45 on I-Vests website and touted M45 by sending out thousands of blast, unsolicited text messages to cell phone users. The touts by Miller and I-Vest failed to disclose the stock compensation paid by M45. Between May 2007 and October 2007, Miller liquidated the one million shares of M45 stock. Miller retained half the proceeds and transferred the other half to an associate that referred him the M45 business. , The Commission alleges that M45 violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), and Miller violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(b) of the Securities Act. M45 and Miller consented to judgments that permanently enjoin them from future violations of these provisions of the federal securities laws, and Miller has also agreed to pay disgorgement of $129,630 plus prejudgment interest of $7,162., The staffs investigation into this matter is ongoing., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2008/comp20790.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20790.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The final judgment enjoins Alliance from future violations of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 (securities registration provisions) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder (antifraud provisions). , The Commission’s complaint, filed on August 8, 2008, charges Alliance and others in connection with a scheme to manipulate Alliance’s stock price and trading volume through false and misleading public disclosures and to issue and sell Alliance’s common stock in an unregistered distribution.  According to the Commission’s complaint, Alliance’s press releases made false and misleading claims about the company’s contracts and revenues and were published through business newswire services and on Alliance’s website from at least April 2005 through at least September 2006.  The Commission’s complaint further alleges that, from July 2005 to September 2006, Alliance and other defendants participated in an unregistered distribution of Alliance securities through a series of purported stock offerings by Alliance to North American Funding, Inc. (“NAF”), a Texas corporation.  According to the complaint, several of  the defendants arranged for Alliance to issue stock to NAF in offerings that purportedly were exempt from registration but that were, in fact, not exempt and the transactions were merely a device to evade the registration provisions of the federal securities laws.  The complaint alleges that the stock was immediately distributed to third parties and sold into the market, without being paid for by NAF.  , Simultaneous with the filing of its complaint, the Commission settled charges against William D. O’Neal of Fountain Hills, Arizona, an attorney who allegedly issued a series of legal opinions that enabled Alliance to illegally issue purportedly unrestricted shares of its stock in unregistered transactions.  The litigation is continuing against the remaining defendants, Clifford A. Lewis of Huntsville, Alabama; Richard A. Dabney of Rancho Palos Verdes, California; Raymond C. Dabney of Vancouver, British Columbia; Philip M. Young of Phoenix, Arizona; and Charles J.

Pimstein, The Bottom Line of South Florida, Inc.

According to the complaint, Pimstein and his agents told investors that Bottom Line and Summit would use the proceeds from their investments to buy iPods and other personal electronics from vendors in the United States for resale to Ripley Corp., S.A., a Chilean company that operates one of the largest department store chains in South America. The complaint further alleges that Pimstein and his agents claimed Bottom Line and Summit had a competitive edge over other electronics suppliers because Pimstein was the cousin of Ripleys chief executive officer and had previously worked for Ripley., The complaint alleges that, contrary to defendants representations, they purchased very few electronics with investor funds and did not re-sell any electronics to Ripley. Instead, defendants operated a large Ponzi scheme by using newly invested funds to make principal and interest payments to existing investors. The defendants also paid commissions to the agents who solicited investors on the defendants behalf. In addition, Pimstein used investor funds to pay his personal expenses. According to the complaint, in April 2008, the defendants Ponzi scheme collapsed when the interest and principal Bottom Line and Summit were obligated to pay investors substantially exceeded the amount of new funds Pimstein and his agents were able to raise from investors. The complaint alleges that Pimstein subsequently confessed to local police that that he had operated a Ponzi scheme and admitted that Ripley never purchased any electronics from the defendants., The Commissions complaint charges Pimstein, Bottom Line and Summit with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. In its complaint, the Commission seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest and civil penalties against the defendants.

The Complaint alleged that the defendants engaged in a scheme beginning in January 2001 by which they and other executives of PFTC defrauded a defined contribution plan client and group of mutual funds of approximately $4 million. Karnig H. Durgarian, Jr., of Hopkinton, Massachusetts, a former senior managing director and chief of operations of PFTC, and Ronald B. Hogan of Saugus, Massachusetts, a former vice president who had responsibility for new business implementation, each consented to imposition of the final judgment without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions Complaint. The Court issued orders of permanent injunction against both defendants and imposed civil money penalties of $100,000 and $35,000, respectively., The Commissions Complaint against Durgarian, Hogan, and four other defendants, filed on December 30, 2005, alleges that the defendants misconduct arose out of PFTCs one-day delay in investing certain assets of a defined contribution client, Cardinal Health, Inc., in January 2001. The markets rose steeply on the missed day, causing Cardinal Healths defined contribution plan to miss out on nearly $4 million of market gains. According to the Complaint, rather than inform Cardinal Health of the one-day delay and the missed trading gain, the defendants decided to improperly shift approximately $3 million of the costs of the delay to shareholders of certain Putnam mutual funds through deception, illegal trade reversals, and accounting machinations. The Complaint also alleges that the defendants improperly allowed Cardinal Healths defined contribution plan to bear approximately $1 million of the loss without disclosing to Cardinal Heath that they had done so. The Complaint further alleges that certain defendants also took steps to cover-up the wrongful conduct, and, as a result, the conduct was not discovered until January 2004., The Complaint alleges that through their fraudulent conduct, defendants violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and violated and/or aided and abetted violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The complaint further alleges that Durgarian also violated Sections 34(b) and 37 of the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Court issued an order of permanent injunction against Durgarian prohibiting him from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 34(b) and 37 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and ordered Durgarian to pay a civil money penalty of $100,000.

Veritasiti was ordered to pay over $14 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest., On June 6, 2006, the Commission filed a complaint alleging that Frank J. Russo, formerly of Wakefield, Massachusetts, operated a fraudulent ponzi scheme through his investment advisory corporation FJR Corporation. Russo, the Commission alleged, raised at least $15 million from at least 160 investors in 12 states to invest in two limited partnerships he controlled: Russo Associates Limited Partnership and Eliot Partners. On June 28, 2006, the Commission filed an amended complaint in the action naming Veritasiti, a California corporation, as a relief defendant based on its receipt of proceeds from the alleged fraud perpetrated by Russo., The amended complaint alleged that while Russo told investors that their funds were being invested in bonds and other investment securities, and that the investments were safe and conservative, he diverted at least $11.5 million in investor funds to Veritasiti, a corporation that Russo formed with a college acquaintance. The amended complaint further alleged that Russo was Veritasiti=s chief financial officer and that he was one of two directors. According to the amended complaint, Russo did not disclose the purported investment in Veritasiti to investors in the limited partnerships. To the contrary, the amended complaint alleged that he sent false and misleading account statements to investors reporting fictional returns in excess of 10% and making false statements concerning the investment strategies of the limited partnerships. The amended complaint alleged that Veritasiti has no legitimate claim to the funds and that it was unjustly enriched by its receipt of those funds. The amended complaint sought disgorgement of all funds diverted to Veritasiti. The default judgment, entered on October 28, 2008, orders Veritasiti to pay disgorgement of $11.9 million plus prejudgment interest of $2.2 million for a total of $14.1 million., In a parallel criminal proceeding, Russo pled guilty to federal charges of investment fraud and mail fraud. On February 25, 2008, he was sentenced to 18 years in prison to be followed by 3 years of supervised release and ordered to pay $20 million in restitution and a $500,000 fine.

Phelps (Phelps) of Bulverde Texas from violating certain of the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws. Phelps is also known as Lin Phelps and also did business under the name Safe Estate Plans. The order, entered with Phelps consent, permanently enjoins him from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rules 10b-5 and 10b-10 promulgated thereunder, and from aiding and abetting violations of Rule 10b-10 of the Exchange Act., The SECs complaint in this matter charges that Michael E. Kelly (Kelly) and 25 other defendants, including Phelps, participated in a massive fraud on U.S. investors that involved the offer and sale of securities in the form of Universal Lease investments. Universal Leases were structured as timeshares in several hotels in Cancun, Mexico, coupled with a pre-arranged rental agreement that promised investors a high, fixed rate of return. The SECs complaint alleges that from 1999 until 2005, Kelly and others, including Phelps, raised at least $428 million through the Universal Lease scheme from investors throughout the United States, with more than $136 million of the funds invested coming from IRA accounts. The SEC further alleges that a nationwide network of unregistered salespeople who sold the Universal Leases, including Phelps, collected undisclosed commissions totaling more than $72 million. The SEC also alleges that Kelly and others ran the scheme from Cancun, Mexico, through a number of foreign entities in Mexico and Panama. According to the SECs complaint, Kelly and others told investors that Universal Leases would generate guaranteed income through the leasing of investor timeshares by a large, independent leasing agent. In fact, the complaint alleges the leasing agent was a small Panamanian travel agency controlled by Kelly and for most of the scheme its payments to investors came from accounts funded by money raised from new investors.

In fact, the Commission alleges, Laumbattus never invested in the stock market any of the monies he received from those investors and used them for his personal use., The Commission also filed an application for a temporary restraining order in order to freeze Jeffrey Laumbattus assets. The Honorable Michael J. Reagan, United States District Judge in the Southern District of Illinois, has issued a temporary restraining order freezing Laumbattus assets., The Commissions complaint alleges that Laumbattus sought out investor funds by holding himself out as a consultant with Moriah Group, a fictitious investment firm. Laumbattus falsely represented to investors that Moriah Group had been managing millions of dollars for large institutional investors since 1950 with average annual returns of 300 percent, and falsely represented to investors that their money would be pooled with large sums invested by institutional investors, in order to achieve a greater return on their money. The complaint further alleges that Laumbattus signed correspondence to investors on Moriah Group letterhead under a fictitious name as the purported managing director of Moriah Group, to further the appearance of a legitimate investment firm, The Commissions complaint alleges that after receiving monies from the unsuspecting investors, Laumbattus commingled those funds in a single bank account he controlled, and failed to invest those funds as promised or directed. Instead, the Commission alleges, he delivered counterfeit stock certificates and phony account statements and misappropriated all of his investors monies to fund his lifestyle, using their money to pay personal living expenses. The complaint also names Laumbattus wife, Joni Laumbattus, as a relief defendant, alleging that she received at least $65,000 of investor funds from Laumbattus., By virtue of the conduct described above, the Commission alleges in its complaint that Jeffrey Laumbattus violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties., On November 4, 2008, in the Southern District of Illinois, Laumbattus was indicted and charged with one count of securities fraud, six counts of mail fraud, one count of wire fraud, and one count of aggravated identity theft. <i>US v.

Verheecke, alleging that they backdated stock option grants to executives and employees and reported false financial information to shareholders., The SECs complaint alleges that from approximately 2000 through 2005, Blue Coat concealed nearly $50 million in compensation expenses associated with valuable in-the-money options by backdating paperwork to make it appear as if the options had been granted on earlier dates. Blue Coat and Verheecke have agreed to settle the SECs charges without admitting or denying the allegations. Verheecke will pay more than $185,000 in disgorgement, penalties, and prejudgment interest., The SECs complaint, filed in federal court in San Jose, alleges that Blue Coat regularly used hindsight to select favorable exercise prices for employee and officer stock option grants without accurately reporting the grants to investors. Blue Coat was required to record an expense for options issued at below-market prices (in-the-money options). In order to avoid these expenses, Blue Coat allegedly identified dates on which its stock was trading at historically low prices, then created documents making it look like options had been granted on those earlier dates. In March 2007, after an internal investigation, Blue Coat corrected its financial statements for fiscal years 2000 through 2005, recording nearly $50 million in additional expenses for misdated options. The majority of the expenses related to grants prior to May 2001., Verheecke served as CFO from May 2001 through May 2005. According to the SECs complaint, at various times Verheecke used hindsight to pick stock option grant dates, prepared or distributed misleading option paperwork, and approved Blue Coats false and misleading financial statements and SEC filings. The SEC alleges that Verheecke personally exercised backdated options for $30,000 in excess profits., Without admitting or denying the SECs allegations, Verheecke consented to a permanent injunction against violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), 13(b)(5), and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13, 13a-14, 13b2-1, 13b2-2, and 14a-9 thereunder. Verheecke also consented to disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $35,946, a financial penalty of $150,000, and five-year bars from serving as an officer or director of a public company and appearing or practicing as an accountant before the SEC., Blue Coat consented to be enjoined from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 14(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 10b-5, 12b 20, 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13, and 14a-9.

The Commissions action charged Evans and McQuillin with, among other things, securities fraud in connection with their participation in a revenue inflation scheme with another senior officer of Aspen, a Cambridge, Massachusetts software company.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, McQuillin and Evans each consented to the entry of a final judgment enjoining them from violating the anti-fraud and other provisions of the securities laws.  McQuillin was also ordered to pay an $85,000 civil penalty, $28,381.61 in disgorgement and pre-judgment interest, and was barred from serving as an officer or director of any public company, and Evans was ordered to pay a $75,000 civil penalty and $21,478.01 in disgorgement and pre-judgment interest., According to the Commissions complaint, Evans and McQuillin, along with former Aspen Chief Financial Officer Lisa W. Zappala, caused Aspen to report inflated revenue in the companys publicly-filed financial statements and in press releases on at least six software transactions during fiscal years 1999 through 2002.  The Complaint alleged that the three defendants caused Aspen to recognize revenue during the relevant period despite knowing that Aspen was prohibited from doing so under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles because contracts were not signed within the appropriate quarter and/or the earnings process was incomplete due to contingency arrangements which changed the terms of the customers payment commitments under the contracts.  The Complaint alleged that, as a result of the fraudulent scheme, Aspen overstated license revenue for its fiscal year ended June 30, 2000 by 5.5% and for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2001 by 9.3%.  The Complaint further alleged that, as a result of prematurely recognized revenue from those earlier periods, license revenue for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2002, 2003, and 2004 was understated by 1.8%, 13.9%, and 4.0% respectively., Separately, in a related criminal action, McQuillin pled guilty to one count each of conspiracy and securities fraud.  In October 2007, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York sentenced McQuillin to three years of probation and a $12,000 criminal fine for that conduct., In addition to the financial penalties (and, as to McQuillin, the officer and director bar), the final judgments imposed permanent injunctions prohibiting Evans and McQuillin from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2; and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13., The Commissions action against Zappala remains pending., The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York and the FBI., For further information, please see: Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr19960.htm>19960</a> (January 8, 2007), Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20059.htm>20059</a> (March 29, 2007), and Administrative Proceeding File No. 3-12718 (July 31, 2007).,  ]"

Battanni of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan granted the Commissions motion for summary judgment against Patrick D. Quinlan, Sr., the former CEO of MCA Financial Corporation (MCA), for his involvement in a fraudulent scheme perpetrated by MCA. Quinlan was the last remaining defendant in a civil injunctive action filed by the Commission on April 23, 2002. The Complaint in that case alleged that Quinlan and six other defendants violated, or aided and abetted violations of, the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, among other things, as a result of their involvement in a financial and offering fraud by MCA. The Complaint further alleged that MCA sold $71 million of securitized interests in pools of mortgage loans from 1994 through 1999 while knowingly misrepresenting the risk, rate of return and historical performance of the interests in the offering materials and that as a result, investors lost at least $49 million. The Complaint also alleges that MCA engaged in the fraudulent sale of $19 million in debentures between 1994 and 1999 by including financial statements that materially inflated its assets, income and equity in registration statements and annual and quarterly reports filed with the Commission and that as a result, investors in the debentures lost all $19 million invested., In its 25-page summary judgment opinion, the Court found that Quinlan, as a result of the collateral estoppel effect of his guilty pleas in criminal proceedings, was primarily liable for MCAs misrepresentations of material facts to investors in connection with the offer and sale of MCA pass-through certificates and debentures from 1994 through 1999. The Court further found that Quinlan was liable for, among other things: (1) aiding and abetting MCAs filing of materially false annual and quarterly reports from 1996 through 1998; and (2) making false and misleading statements to MCAs auditors in 1997 and 1998. The Court permanently enjoined Quinlan from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B) and 15(d) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 15d-1 and 15d-13 thereunder. The Court also imposed an officer and director bar against Quinlan., Previously, in February 2004, Quinlan pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit mail, wire and bank fraud and to make false statements in a matter within the jurisdiction of a federal agency and one count of making false statements to the Commission for his involvement in MCAs fraudulent scheme. In July 2005, Quinlan was sentenced to ten years in prison and ordered to pay $256.6 million in restitution based on his guilty pleas. <i>U.S. v. Quinlan et al.</i>, Case No. 01-80514 (E.D.

The Complaint also seeks to recover property transferred to relief defendant Gilda Bolick Huffman (G. Huffman), Huffmans wife. The Honorable Richard L. Voorhees, United States District Judge for the Western District of North Carolina, issued orders freezing the assets of the defendants and relief defendants, appointing a receiver for the defendants, and permanently enjoining the defendants from future violations of the registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws., The Complaint alleges that Huffman, operating through Biltmore, conducted a Ponzi scheme since 1991, and raised at least $25 million from more than 500 investors in North Carolina and several other states. According to the Complaint, investors made their investments pursuant to an agreement which promised profits that would fluctuate at market rates and which were guaranteed never to drop below 0%. The Complaint alleges that Huffman initially told investors that Biltmore operated like a mutual fund. After September 11, 2001, in order to assure investors that their investments would not be affected by the volatility of the stock market, Huffman represented that Biltmore pooled investors funds to purchase and sell mortgages for a profit. According to the Complaint, Biltmores offering materials, which Huffman provided to investors and prospective investors, also indicated that the investment was protected against loss. The Complaint alleges that Huffman failed to invest client funds as he represented, and used new investor funds to pay profits to earlier investors. The Complaint also alleges that Huffman spent investor funds to subsidize his lavish lifestyle. Further, the Complaint alleges that G. Huffman received benefits from the fraudulent scheme, and was thereby unjustly enriched., The Complaint alleges that the defendants have violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The court adjudged Hilger and his co-defendant Alan C. Goldsworthy, Applixs former Chief Executive Officer, not liable on the other claims asserted against them by the Commission.

The complaint alleges that Cuban avoided losses in excess of $750,000 by selling his stock prior to the public announcement of the PIPE offering., According to the complaint, Cuban was Mamma.coms largest known shareholder during the relevant time period. On June 28, 2004, the complaint alleges, Mamma.coms then-chief executive officer — after securing Cubans agreement to keep the information confidential — invited Cuban to invest in the PIPE offering. The complaint further alleges that Cuban knew that the offering would be conducted at a discount to the prevailing market price and that it would be dilutive to existing shareholders. According to the complaint, later that day, Cuban called his broker and — in breach of his agreement to keep the information confidential — instructed him to sell out his entire position in the company. That afternoon (June 28), and over the next day (June 29), the broker liquidated Cubans entire 600,000 share position. After the markets closed on June 29, 2004, Mamma.com publicly announced the PIPE offering. The next day, Mamma.coms stock price opened at $11.89, down $1.215 or 9.3%, from the prior days closing price of $13.105. According to the complaint, Cuban thereby avoided losses in excess of $750,000 by selling on the basis of material, non-public information concerning the PIPE offering., The complaint alleges that by engaging in illegal insider trading, Cuban violated the antifraud provisions of both the Securities Act of 1933 (Section 17(a)) and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder). The Commissions complaint seeks to permanently enjoin Cuban from future violations of the applicable provisions of the federal securities laws, disgorgement (with prejudgment interest thereon), and a civil penalty., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2008/comp20810.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>, <p class=boxalert10>On October 16, 2013, after a three-week trial, a nine-person federal jury found Mark Cuban not liable for insider trading.

David Lee, et al.</i>, Civil Action No. 08-CIV-9961 (GBD) (SDNY)</h2>, <h2>SEC Charges Banker And Brokerage Executives With Multimillion Dollar Financial Fraud</h2>]","[On November 18, 2008, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York charging four individuals with engaging in a fraudulent scheme to overvalue the commodity derivatives trading portfolio at Bank of Montreal (BMO), and thereby inflate BMOs publicly reported financial results. The defendants include a former senior derivatives trader at BMO and the top two senior executive officers of Optionable, Inc. (Optionable), a publicly traded commodities brokerage firm., The defendants named in the Commissions complaint are:, <b>David Lee (Lee)</b>, age 36, resides in New Jersey. Lee was a natural gas options trader employed by BMO Capital Markets Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of BMO and a registered broker-dealer, until he resigned on May 15, 2007. From 2001 through 2004, Lee was a Vice President of BMOs Commodity Derivatives Group, the unit through which BMO traded commodity derivatives. In 2005, he was promoted to Managing Director of that group., <b>Kevin P. Cassidy (Cassidy)</b>, age 49, resides in Bedford Hills, New York. Cassidy was one of Optionables founders and served as Vice Chairman of Optionables board of directors until he resigned on May 12, 2007. Except for the period from March 2004 to October 2005, he was also Optionables CEO throughout the relevant period., <b>Edward OConnor (OConnor)</b>, age 55, resides in Briarcliff Manor, New York. OConnor was one of Optionables founders and since 2001, he has served as President and a director of Optionable. From March 2004 through October 2005, he was also Optionables CEO and Treasurer., <b>Scott Connor (Connor)</b>, age 31, resides in Rye, New York. Connor was employed by Optionable as a commodities broker until May 2007., The Commissions complaint specifically alleges as follows:, Lee fraudulently overvalued BMOs portfolio of natural gas options by deliberately mismarking trading positions for which market prices were unavailable. Lee recorded inflated values that were then purportedly validated by Optionable, which held itself out to BMO and the public as a legitimate provider of independent derivatives valuation services. In fact, Cassidy, OConnor and Connor schemed with Lee to have Optionable simply rubber-stamp whatever inflated values Lee recorded. After the scheme was discovered, BMO restated its financial results by reducing net income for the first quarter of its 2007 fiscal year by approximately $237 million Canadian dollars ($204 million USD), which reflects a 68% overstatement of BMOs net income for that quarter., BMO was Optionables largest customer, and BMO trades accounted for as much as 60% of Optionables commodity brokerage business. Lees trading accounted for virtually all of BMOs business with Optionable. As a result, Optionables management, led by Cassidy, was willing to do whatever it took to keep Lee satisfied. When market prices were unavailable, BMOs risk management personnel sought to verify the accuracy of BMOs commodity derivatives traders valuations of their positions, or their marks, by obtaining supposedly independent valuations, or quotes, for those positions from one or more third parties. During the relevant period, Optionable was the primary source of the third-party quotes that BMO used to validate Lees marks. Lee provided his marks directly to Cassidy, OConnor or Connor, who then simply forwarded Lees marks, virtually unchanged, to BMOs risk management department as if they were Optionables independent quotes. At first, Lee used this u-turn scheme to boost his trading profits and incentive compensation, but in 2006, the market turned against Lee and he used the scheme to hide substantial trading losses. In May 2007, BMO concluded that due to the Optionable scheme and other positions that Lee had also mismarked, Lees trading book was overvalued by an aggregate total of $680 million (CAD) since the beginning of BMOs fiscal year ended October 31, 2006., Cassidy and OConnor also defrauded Optionables public shareholders by concealing Optionables role in the scheme. Optionables periodic reports touted the synergistic benefits of the derivatives valuation services that Optionable purportedly provided to multiple brokerage clients, but those reports, which Cassidy and OConnor signed, never disclosed that BMO was the principal client for whom those services were performed and that the valuation services provided to BMO were a sham designed to defraud BMO. In addition, Cassidy and OConnor defrauded the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) by selling over $10 million of their own Optionable stock to NYMEX in April 2007. Both Cassidy and OConnor represented to NYMEX that Optionables periodic reports were materially accurate, but they never disclosed anything about their scheme with Lee to defraud the shareholders of BMO, Optionables largest customer. On May 9, 2007, one day after BMO announced that it had placed Lee on leave and suspended its business relationship with Optionable, Optionable issued an announcement stating that the suspension would have an adverse effect on Optionables business. Optionables stock price fell almost 40% that day, from $4.64 to $2.81 per share, and dropped to below 50 cents per share one week later after Cassidys prior criminal record was disclosed in press reports., All four defendants are charged with committing violations of Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder; and with aiding and abetting BMOs violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-16. The complaint further charges Cassidy, OConnor and Connor with aiding and abetting Optionables violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13, and also charges Cassidy and OConnor with violating Rules 13a-14 and 13b2-2 under the Exchange Act and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933. As to each defendant, the complaint seeks a permanent injunction against future violations, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil monetary penalties. The complaint also seeks an order barring Cassidy and OConnor from acting as officers or directors of a public company., The United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York (USAO), the New York County District Attorneys Office (NYCDA), and the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) also filed parallel criminal and regulatory charges today arising from the same conduct that is alleged in the Commissions complaint. Lee pled guilty to parallel criminal charges filed by the USAO and the NYCDA. In connection with his guilty plea, Lee agreed to pay a total of $4.41 million in forfeiture., Lee has agreed to settle the SEC charges by consenting, without admitting or denying the SECs allegations, to the entry of a permanent injunction against future violations of various provisions of the federal securities laws. The Commissions claims for disgorgement and civil penalties against Lee, and all of its claims against the other three defendants, remain pending., The Commissions investigation is continuing.

Adley of a judgment that was entered against him in January 2008 in a securities fraud action. Adley is the former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Chancellor Corporation, a now defunct Boston, Massachusetts transportation equipment-leasing company., The Commission originally filed an action against Adley and ten other defendants on April 24, 2003, in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The Commissions complaint alleged that Adley caused Chancellor to file false financial statements in 1999 and 2000 by directing the wholesale fabrication of corporate documents, by instructing that the fabricated documents be given to the companys auditors, and by coordinating the filing of false financial statements with the Commission. By the fall of 2007, all defendants other than Adley had settled the case with the Commission, and the Commission went to trial against Adley in November 2007. After a three week trial, on November 26, 2007, a Massachusetts federal court jury found Adley liable for violating the antifraud and record-keeping provisions of the federal securities laws, for making false statements to Chancellors accountants, and for aiding and abetting Chancellors reporting and recordkeeping provisions of the federal securities laws. <i>SEC v. Chancellor Corporation, et al.</i>, (United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, C.A. No. 03-10762-PBS)., On January 3, 2008, the District Court entered a Final Judgment against Brian Adley for his role in the multi-faceted financial fraud. The District Court ordered that Adley be enjoined from future violations of the federal securities laws, that he pay $930,000 in disgorgement and that Adley be barred from acting as an officer or director of a public company for twenty-years. Thereafter, on February 27, 2008, Adley filed a Notice of Appeal. The First Circuit Court of Appeals notified Adley on October 3, 2008, that he was in default for failure to file an opening brief in his appeal, and warned him to file the brief by October 20 or face dismissal. Adley failed to file the required brief. The First Circuit dismissed his appeal on November 3., The Commission had previously settled with ten other defendants, including: Chancellor Corporation; the companys former President and Chief Operating Officer; the companys former acting Chief Financial Officer; the companys former treasurer; two former Chancellor directors and audit committee members; Chancellors outside auditing firm and three members of its audit team., For further information, see Litigation Release Nos. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18104.htm>18104</a> (April 24, 2003), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr19177.htm>19177</a> (April 11, 2005), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20177.htm>20177</a> (July 2, 2007), <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20370.htm>20370</a> (November 26, 2007) and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20426.htm>20426</a> (January 10, 2008).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20812.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

In addition to JC Advisory, JC Parent owned a mortgage banking subsidiary and several other related businesses. JC Parent and JC Advisory recently filed bankruptcy petitions in United States Bankruptcy Court for the Middle District of Tennessee., The Commissions Complaint alleges that, at various times from no later than 2005 through at least September 2008, JC Parent, JC Advisory, Reed and Mathis facilitated the offer and sale of more than $11 million of JC Parent stock in unregistered transactions to over 100 investors in several states. According to the Complaint, JC Parent, JC Advisory, and Reed misrepresented and omitted material facts to investors relating to the value of the investors stock, JC Parents revenues and profitability, the use of key man life insurance proceeds for redemptions of Reeds JC Parent stock, and undisclosed sales commissions. The Complaint also alleges that Mathis promoted JC Parent stock to advisory clients and misrepresented material facts to investors about undisclosed sales commissions.

The sentence ordered Calvin to serve 200 months in prison, to be followed by three years of supervised release, and to pay restitution in the amount of $2,083,736.41 and a mandatory special assessment of $100. , Calvin was criminally indicted on January 24, 2007 by a federal grand jury convened by the United States Attorney for the Western District of Missouri. The three-count indictment alleged, among other things, that between January 1999 and March 2002, Calvin defrauded approximately 115 investors of more than $2.8 million by offering and selling securities in a purported trading program called Growth Benefit Systems (GBS) that was completely fictitious. The indictment also alleged that Calvin solicited investors by, among other things, telling them that their funds would be pooled to purchase Prime Bank instruments that would be traded by top-rated banks and promising returns as high as 20% per month. In fact, according to the indictment, the GBS trading program never existed and Calvins representations to investors were therefore false. On November 14, 2007, Calvin entered a guilty plea to one count of securities fraud. , The Commission had previously filed a civil injunctive action against Calvin on March 31, 2003 in the U.S. District Court in Massachusetts alleging many of the same facts charged in the criminal action.

Okla.), an insider trading case the Commission filed on March 13, 2008.  The Commission’s complaint alleged that Cole, a former sales representative for Diebold, Inc., made over $500,000 in illegal profits by using material, nonpublic information to trade Diebold securities.  Diebold is an Ohio-based public company that manufactures and sells automated teller machines, bank security systems, and electronic voting machines., The Commission’s complaint alleged that on September 15, 2005, shortly after learning from his sales manager that revenues and orders in Diebold’s North American regional bank business were significantly below target, Cole began purchasing hundreds of soon-to-expire Diebold put options contracts, at a total cost of $70,110, anticipating that Diebold would lower its earnings forecast and the price of Diebold stock would fall.  As alleged in the complaint, on September 21, 2005 — one day after Cole completed purchasing these Diebold put option contracts — Diebold announced that it was lowering its earnings forecasts, primarily because of a revenue shortfall in the company’s North American regional bank business.  After this public announcement, Diebold’s stock price dropped sharply, closing at $37.27 per share, which was a 16% drop from the previous day’s closing price of $44.13.  As the complaint alleged, Cole immediately sold the Diebold put option contracts for $579,190, realizing illicit profits of $509,080 (a 700% return). , The Commission alleged that Cole violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Cole consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of these provisions, and orders him to disgorge his illicit profits of $509,080, which will be deemed satisfied by a forfeiture order entered in a related criminal case.  In that case, <i>U.S. v. Robert Cole</i>, No. 5:08-CR-327 (N.D.

Boots Del Biaggio III, in federal district court in the Northern District of California alleging that he engaged in two distinct securities fraud schemes, defrauding investors, banks and private lenders out of $65 million.  The complaint alleges that Del Biaggio used the funds to maintain a lavish lifestyle, which included buying an interest in a professional hockey team, satisfying substantial gambling debts, and paying expenses on his familys luxury home.  Without admitting or denying the complaints allegations, Del Biaggio has agreed to a permanent injunction from further violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  Del Biaggio also has agreed that, at a later date, the court in this matter shall determine the amount of ill-gotten gains (disgorgement) and civil monetary penalties that Del Biaggio shall be required to pay., According to the Commissions complaint, Del Biaggio engaged in two distinct securities fraud schemes.  First, Del Biaggio fraudulently pledged securities owned by innocent customers of a San Francisco-based broker dealer as collateral for more than $45 million in personal loans.  Beginning in August 2007, Del Biaggio obtained brokerage account statements of unknowing customers with the help of a friend who was a managing director at a San Francisco brokerage firm, and then falsified the account statements to make it appear that Del Biaggio owned the assets in the accounts.  To obtain more than $45 million in loan proceeds, Del Biaggio supplied the forged account statements to multiple banks and private lenders and signed agreements pledging the securities in the innocent customers accounts.  As alleged in the complaint, Del Biaggio used $25 million of the loan proceeds to purchase an interest in the Nashville Predators professional hockey team, and used the rest for other personal expenses., In the second scheme, according to the Commissions complaint, Del Biaggio misappropriated more than $19 million from individual investors he advised.  The Commission alleges that between 2003 and 2008, Del Biaggio used his reputation as a prominent venture capitalist and role as the founder and CEO of established venture firm Sand Hill Capital L.P. to entice dozens of his advisory clients to invest in three investment funds he formed.

The 101-count indictment charges Langford, the former president of the County Commission of Jefferson County, Alabama (County Commission); Blount, chairman of Blount Parrish &amp; Co, Inc., a broker-dealer based in Montgomery, Alabama; and registered lobbyist LaPierre with, among other charges, conspiracy, bribery, and money laundering in an alleged long-running bribery scheme related to Jefferson County bond transactions and swap agreements.  According to the indictment, between 2002 and 2006, Langford used his position as president of the County Commission to generate $7.1 million in fees for Blount and Blount Parrish in connection with these Jefferson County financial transactions.  Blount, in turn, paid LaPierre approximately $219,500.  In return, the indictment alleges that Blount and LaPierre gave Langford approximately $235,000 in expensive clothes, jewelry and cash to pay off his personal debts as part of a conspiracy to funnel Jefferson County financial business to them., In April 2008, the SEC filed a civil action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama against Langford, Blount, Blount Parish and LaPierre.  The SECs complaint alleged that while Langford served as president of the County Commission, he accepted more than $156,000 in undisclosed cash and benefits over the course of two years from Blount in exchange for Blount Parrish participating in every Jefferson County municipal bond offering and security-based swap agreement transaction during 2003 and 2004, earning Blount Parrish over $6.7 million in fees.  The complaint further alleged that Langford and Blount concealed the payment scheme by using their long-time friend, LaPierre as a conduit.

(Columbia Distributor), the principal underwriter and distributor for a group of approximately 140 mutual funds in the Columbia mutual fund complex (Columbia Funds).  The SEC had alleged in a civil injunctive action that from 1998 through 2003, Tambone and Hussey participated in a fraudulent scheme with Columbia Distributor and Columbia Management Advisors, Inc. (Columbia Advisors), the investment adviser to the funds, by secretly entering into or approving arrangements with at least eight preferred customers allowing them to engage in frequent short-term trading in certain Columbia Funds in contravention of the prospectuses that represented that the funds did not permit or were otherwise hostile to market timing or other short-term or excessive trading., The First Circuit ruling reversed a decision by the District of Massachusetts that had dismissed the case in December 2006 on the ground that Tambone and Hussey could not be held primarily liable for false statements in the prospectuses because they did not make those statements.  The First Circuit held that Tambone and Hussey could be held liable.  In its decision, the First Circuit emphasized the unique role that underwriters play in the sale and distribution of mutual funds to the investing public and the reliance that the investing public places on them as a result.  The First Circuit explained that Tambone and Hussey, as executives of Columbia Distributor, had a legal duty to confirm the accuracy and completeness of the prospectuses and other fund material that they distributed.  By distributing the misleading prospectuses, the First Circuit reasoned, Tambone and Hussey made implied statements to potential investors that they had a reasonable basis for believing that the key statements in the prospectuses regarding market timing were accurate and complete., The SEC first bought action against Tambone and Hussey on February 9, 2005.  The District Court dismissed that action without prejudice on January 27, 2006.  Thereafter, on May 19, 2006, the SEC filed a new complaint concerning the same conduct.  The SECs complaint alleges that the defendants violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and aided and abetted Columbia Distributors violations of Section 15(c)(1) of the Exchange Act, Columbia Advisors violations of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and the Columbia entities violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act.  The SEC is seeking an order permanently enjoining Tambone and Hussey from violating the antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws, requiring them to disgorge funds received through their violations of the securities laws, and imposing civil monetary penalties. Although the District Court dismissed this complaint on December 29, 2006, the First Circuit, in its decision, remanded the case to the District Court for further proceedings., In related proceedings, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Columbia Management Advisors, Inc. and Columbia Funds Distributor, Inc., in federal court in Massachusetts on February 24, 2004. That action was later dismissed when the two Columbia entities agreed to settle charges through administrative proceedings that resulted in an Order issued by the SEC on February 9, 2005 requiring, among other things, $140 million in disgorgement and penalties to be distributed to investors harmed by market timing activity at Columbia.

Dreier engaged in an elaborate scheme, that violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and raised at least $113 million from the sale of bogus promissory notes.  According to the SECs complaint, Dreier is the founder and managing partner of Dreier LLP, a 250-attorney law firm headquartered in Manhattan.  Along with its complaint seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of Dreiers ill-gotten gains, and civil monetary penalties, the Commission filed an application for an emergency court order to freeze Driers assets and appoint a temporary receiver., The SECs complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan alleges that since at least October 2008, Dreier has been marketing fake promissory notes, including bogus notes of a New York-based real estate development company, to hedge funds and other private investment funds, and has closed at least three sales.  According to the complaint, Dreier created an elaborate charade designed to convince purchasers that the notes were genuine.  He allegedly distributed phony financial statements and audit opinion letters of a reputable accounting firm, and recruited confederates to play the parts of representatives of legitimate companies involved in the transactions, even creating dummy email addresses and telephone numbers., According to the Commissions complaint, Dreier directed that two purchasers of the bogus notes wire payment to what appeared to be his law firms escrow account.  At least one note purchaser discovered the fraud and demanded, and received, the return of its investment.  Approximately $100 million in known proceeds from the sale of the bogus notes remains unaccounted for., The SECs complaint alleges that, among other fake securities, Dreier has been offering fictitious promissory notes of a New York-based real estate development company (the developer), a former client of Dreier and his firm.  Since at least October of this year, Dreier has approached at least three different investment funds with an offer to sell them, at a deep discount, various short-term, unsecured promissory notes supposedly issued by the developer.  Two of the investment funds agreed to purchase the notes (one fund purchased notes in two separate transactions) and forwarded approximately $113 million to an account in the name of Dreier LLP Attorney Trust Account in payment.  A third fund was offered the notes, but declined to participate., As alleged in the complaint, all of the offers were accompanied by documents that Dreier subsequently admitted he knew were fabricated.  Dreier offered the notes for sale even though he knew that the developer had never issued the notes, had not authorized Dreier to market them and indeed knew nothing of their existence or Dreiers offers or sales., The complaint further alleges that in marketing the notes, Dreier provided the hedge funds with fabricated documents including a form note and related agreements, audited financial statements, and purported audit letters, which bore the forged signature of the developers auditor, but which were printed on purported stationary of the developers auditing firm.  Dreier did not tell representatives from the hedge funds that the notes were bogus, that the audited financial statements and audit opinion letters were fabricated, or that the developer had never issued the notes or authorized Dreier to market them, despite Dreiers knowledge of these matters., As alleged in the complaint, Dreier has admitted that:, The Commission seeks emergency and preliminary relief, including the asset freeze, appointment of a receiver and temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, as well as a final judgment permanently enjoining Dreier from committing future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, ordering him to pay civil penalties and disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and provide an accounting., According to the complaint, Dreier is 58 years old and resides in Manhattan, and is a former partner at two prestigious law firms and a graduate of Harvard Law School and Yale College.

Previously, on August 7 and 8, 2008, the Commissions Division of Enforcement announced preliminary settlements with Citi and UBS, respectively., According to the SECs complaints, filed in federal court in New York City, Citi and UBS misrepresented to customers that ARS were safe, highly liquid investments that were comparable to money markets.  According to the complaints, in late 2007 and early 2008, the firms knew that the ARS market was deteriorating, causing the firms to have to purchase additional inventory to prevent failed auctions.  At the same time, however, the firms knew that their ability to support auctions by purchasing more ARS had been reduced, as the credit crisis stressed the firms balance sheets.  The complaints allege that Citi and UBS failed to make their customers aware of these risks.  In mid-February 2008, according to the complaints, Citi and UBS decided to stop supporting the ARS market, leaving tens of thousands of Citi and UBS customers holding tens of billions of dollars in illiquid ARS., The settlements, which are subject to court approval, will restore approximately $7 billion in liquidity to Citi customers who invested in ARS, and $22.7 billion to UBS customers who invested in ARS., Without admitting or denying the SECs allegations, Citi and UBS agreed to be permanently enjoined from violations of the broker-dealer fraud provisions and to comply with a number of undertakings, some of which are set forth below., The Citi settlement provides, among other things, that:, The UBS settlement provides, among other things, that:, The Commission alerts investors that, in most instances, they will receive correspondence from Citi and UBS, and that they must advise the respective firm that they elect to participate in these settlements, or they could lose their rights to sell their ARS.  Further, if eligible customers incurred consequential damages because of the illiquidity of their ARS, they may participate in special FINRA arbitrations., Both Citi and UBS will also be permanently enjoined from violating the provisions of Section 15(c) of the Exchange Act of 1934, which prohibit the use of manipulative or deceptive devices by broker-dealers.  Both firms also face the prospect of financial penalties to the Commission.  After the buy back periods are substantially complete, the Commission may consider imposing a financial penalty against Citi and/or UBS based on the traditional factors the Commission considers for penalties and based on whether the individual firm has fulfilled its obligations under its settlement agreement., The Commission notes the assistance and cooperation from the New York Attorney General, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the Texas State Securities Board, and the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA)., The Commissions investigation of the auction rate securities market is continuing., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/>  SEC Complaints in this matter: <a href=/litigation/complaints/2008/comp20824-ubs.pdf>UBS</a>; <a href=/litigation/complaints/2008/comp20824-citi.pdf>Citigroup</a>,  ]"

Zurich Financial Services</i>, 08 Civ. 10760 (WHP)(S.D.N.Y.), December 11, 2008</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced the filing and settlement of charges against Zurich Financial Services Group for aiding and abetting a fraud by Converium Holding AG involving the use of finite reinsurance transactions to inflate improperly Converium’s financial performance.  Under the settlement, Zurich consents to the entry of a final judgment directing it to pay a $25 million penalty plus $1 in disgorgement and, in a related administrative proceeding, consents to the entry of a cease-and-desist order against it. , The Commission’s complaint, filed today, alleges that beginning in 1999, the management of Zurich’s reinsurance group, which operated under the name Zurich Re, developed three reinsurance transactions for the purpose of obtaining the financial benefits of reinsurance accounting.  However, in order for a company to obtain the benefits of reinsurance accounting, the reinsurance transaction must transfer risk.  Here, Zurich Re management designed the transactions to make them appear to transfer risk to third-party reinsurers, when, in fact, no risk was transferred outside of Zurich-owned entities.  For two of the transactions at issue, Zurich Re ceded risk to third-party reinsurers, but took it back through reinsurance agreements – known as retrocessions – with another Zurich entity.  For the third transaction, Zurich Re ceded the risk to a third-party reinsurer but simultaneously entered into an undisclosed side agreement with the reinsurer pursuant to which Zurich Re agreed to hold the reinsurer harmless for any losses realized under the reinsurance contracts.  Because the ultimate risk under the reinsurance contracts remained with Zurich-owned entities, these transactions should not have been accounted for as reinsurance.  , The complaint also alleges that, in March 2001, Zurich announced its intent to spin off its reinsurance group in an initial public offering.  Zurich then created and capitalized Converium, which assumed the rights and obligations of Zurich’s assumed reinsurance business.  On December 11, 2001, Zurich spun off Converium in an IPO.  At the conclusion of the IPO, the members of Zurich Re management responsible for the three reinsurance transactions ceased to be affiliated with Zurich.  As a result of the improper accounting treatment the reinsurance transactions received, the historical financial statements in Converium’s IPO documents, including the Form F-1 it filed with the Commission, were materially misleading.  Among other things, Converium understated its reported loss before taxes by approximately $100 million (67%) in 2000 and by approximately $3 million (1%) in 2001.  In addition, for certain periods, the transactions had the effect of artificially decreasing Converium’s reported loss ratios for certain reporting segments – the ratio between losses paid by an insurer and premiums earned that is frequently cited by analysts as a key performance metric for insurance companies.  , The complaint further alleges that Converium’s misstatements relate to fact that were material to investors who purchased shares in the IPO.  Through the IPO, which was the largest reinsurance IPO in history, Zurich raised significantly more than it would have raised had Zurich and Converium not improperly inflated Converium’s financial performance.  , The Commission’s complaint alleges that Zurich aided and abetted Converium’s violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  , In connection with the settlement, Zurich has agreed, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission’s complaint, to pay a $25 million penalty, plus $1 in disgorgement.  In a related administrative proceeding, Zurich has also agreed, without admitting or denying the Commission’s findings, to the issuance of an order that requires Zurich to cease and desist from committing or causing any violation and any future violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  , <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2008/comp20825.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20825.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The defendants include National Lampoon, Inc. and its CEO, Daniel S. Laikin, as well as stock promoters, a consultant, and an officer of another company. The United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania today separately announced criminal charges involving the same conduct., The Commissions actions, filed in federal district court in Philadelphia, allege that, in each case, individuals who controlled the stock of a public company arranged with corrupt promoters and others to generate purchases of the companys stock in exchange for cash kickbacks. In each case, a witness secretly cooperating with the government (the CW) was paid a kickback to make purchases in the stock. The goal of the manipulators was to create the appearance of market interest, induce public purchases of the stock, and ultimately increase the stocks trading price. For example, the Commission alleges that Daniel Laikin and another defendant paid at least $68,000 in cash kickbacks for the purchase of National Lampoon stock in order to artificially inflate the stock price., The Commissions complaints allege as follows:, Defendants: <b>National Lampoon, Inc.</b>, headquartered in Los Angeles, California, is a media and entertainment company that develops, produces and distributes media projects including feature films, television programming, online and interactive entertainment, home video, and book publishing. The company produced such widely known films as National Lampoons <i>Animal House</i>, and the National Lampoon <i>Vacation</i> series.

Barsky</b>, of Las Vegas, Nevada, is a consultant to National Lampoon, and a significant stockholder. <b>Eduardo Rodriguez</b>, of Livingston, New Jersey, is a stock promoter. <b>Tim Dougherty</b>, of Webster, New York, is a stock promoter and principal of OTC Advisors, Inc., a stock promotion company., The Commissions complaint alleges that, from at least March 2008 through June 2008, Laikin, Barsky, Rodriguez and Dougherty engaged in a fraudulent scheme to manipulate the market for the common stock of National Lampoon. Specifically, Laikin, along with Barsky, paid kickbacks in exchange for generating or causing purchases of National Lampoon stock to Rodriguez, a corrupt stock promoter, and the CW, whom Laikin, Barsky and Rodriguez believed had connections to corrupt registered representatives. As part of this scheme, Dougherty generated purchases of National Lampoon stock in exchange for a portion of the kickbacks. Dougherty made his purchases over the course of a number of days and used various accounts to give the false impression of a steady demand for the stock., The complaint alleges that Laikin and Barsky paid at least $68,000 that went to Rodriguez, Dougherty, and the CW to cause the purchase of at least 87,500 shares of National Lampoon stock. Through these efforts, Laikin and Barsky sought to artificially push National Lampoons stock price from under $2 per share to at least $5 per share, in part, to keep the companys stock price above the minimum listing requirements of the AMEX, and to increase National Lampoons ability to enter into possible strategic partnerships and acquisitions. In addition to paying others to purchase the stock, Laikin shared confidential financial information regarding National Lampoon, non-public news releases, and confidential shareholder lists, and coordinated the release of news with the illegal purchases in the stock. Barsky helped direct the purchases and facilitated the kickback payments. National Lampoon and Laikin also made materially misleading statements in a tender offer., The complaint alleges violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 9(a)(2), 10(b) and 13(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 13e-4 thereunder. The complaint seeks permanent injunctions against all defendants, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, together with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties, from the individual defendants, and an officer and director bar against Laikin., Defendant <b>Advatech Corporation</b> is headquartered in West Palm Beach, Florida. It describes itself as an early stage biotechnology company engaged in research and development for the commercialization of products for non-invasive therapeutic medicine. Advatechs securities trade on the grey market. Grey market stocks have no market makers, and are not listed, traded or quoted on any stock exchange, or the over-the-counter bulletin board. However, customers may trade through brokers on an unsolicited basis, and trading data is publicly available throughout the trading day. Defendant <b>Richard J. Margulies</b>, of Edison, New Jersey, is Advatechs Chief Financial Officer and a member of its board of directors. Margulies owns and/or controls a significant portion of Advatech stock either directly or through nominees., The Commissions complaint alleges that, from at least May 2008 through June 2008, Margulies engaged in a fraudulent scheme to manipulate the market for Advatechs common stock. In furtherance of the scheme, Margulies arranged to pay a 20 percent kickback to Rodriguez and the CW for purchases of Advatech stock. Before Rodriguez and the CW made the illegal purchases, Margulies provided them with shareholder lists, confidential information about the company, and non-public press releases. Margulies coordinated the release of news with the purchases, said that he wanted to increase Advatechs stock price from approximately $0.30 to $2.00 per share, and instructed Rodriguez and the CW that they should move [the stock] up nice and slow, so it doesnt look like were a bunch of idiots., The complaint alleges that, to effectuate his scheme, Margulies paid at least $1,040 in kickbacks as partial payments to the CW in exchange for purchases of at least 5,000 shares of Advatech stock on June 17 and 18, 2008., The complaint alleges violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint seeks permanent injunctions against Advatech and Margulies, and disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, together with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and a penny stock bar against Margulies., Defendants <b>Alex Kanakaris</b>, of Newport Beach, California, and <b>Richard Epstein</b>, of Parkland, Florida, are stock promoters who are significant investors in the stock of SwedishVegas, Inc., headquartered in Arcadia, California, whose stated business plan is to launch a series of themed eateries with an extensive beer and wine menu and reasonably priced lunches, dinners and appetizers. Until July 23, 2008, when the Commission suspended trading in its stock, SwedishVegas common stock was quoted on an inter-dealer electronic quotation and trading system in the over-the-counter securities market which is operated by Pink OTC Markets, Inc., commonly known as the Pink Sheets., The Commissions complaint alleges that, from at least June through July 2008, Kanakaris and Epstein engaged in a fraudulent scheme to manipulate the market for the common stock of SwedishVegas. Specifically, the defendants paid a kickback to Rodriguez, a corrupt stock promoter, and the CW, whom they believed had connections to corrupt stockbrokers, to buy Swedish Vegas stock in an effort to create the appearance of market interest, induce public purchases of stock, and ultimately increase the stocks trading price. At one point, Kanakaris told Rodriguez and the CW that he wanted them to buy as much stock as possible in order to make the stock price fly., The complaint further alleges that, in accordance with their scheme, Kanakaris and Epstein paid at least $15,000 to Rodriguez and the CW in exchange for completed purchases of at least 125,000 shares of SwedishVegas stock on July 22, 2008. After this initial stock purchase, actually made with FBI funds, the Commission suspended trading in the stock., The complaint alleges violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Siemens Aktiengesellschaft</i>, Civil Action No. 08 CV 02167 (D.D.C.)</h2>, <h2>SEC Files Settled Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Charges Against Siemens AG for Engaging in Worldwide Bribery With Total Disgorgement and Criminal Fines of Over $1.6 Billion</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a settled enforcement action on December 12, 2008, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia charging Siemens Aktiengesellschaft (Siemens), a Munich, Germany-based manufacturer of industrial and consumer products, with violations of the anti-bribery, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). Siemens has offered to pay a total of $1.6 billion in disgorgement and fines, which is the largest amount a company has ever paid to resolve corruption-related charges. Siemens has agreed to pay $350 million in disgorgement to the SEC. In related actions, Siemens will pay a $450 million criminal fine to the U.S. Department of Justice and a fine of 395 million (approximately $569 million) to the Office of the Prosecutor General in Munich, Germany. Siemens previously paid a fine of 201 million (approximately $285 million) to the Munich Prosecutor in October 2007., The SECs complaint alleges that:, Between March 12, 2001 and September 30, 2007, Siemens violated the FCPA by engaging in a widespread and systematic practice of paying bribes to foreign government officials to obtain business. Siemens created elaborate payment schemes to conceal the nature of its corrupt payments, and the companys inadequate internal controls allowed the conduct to flourish. The misconduct involved employees at all levels, including former senior management, and revealed a corporate culture long at odds with the FCPA., During this period, Siemens made thousands of payments to third parties in ways that obscured the purpose for, and the ultimate recipients of, the money. At least 4,283 of those payments, totaling approximately $1.4 billion, were used to bribe government officials in return for business to Siemens around the world. Among others, Siemens paid bribes on transactions to design and build metro transit lines in Venezuela; metro trains and signaling devices in China; power plants in Israel; high voltage transmission lines in China; mobile telephone networks in Bangladesh; telecommunications projects in Nigeria; national identity cards in Argentina; medical devices in Vietnam, China, and Russia; traffic control systems in Russia; refineries in Mexico; and mobile communications networks in Vietnam. Siemens also paid kickbacks to Iraqi ministries in connection with sales of power stations and equipment to Iraq under the United Nations Oil for Food Program. Siemens earned over $1.1 billion in profits on these transactions., An additional approximately 1,185 separate payments to third parties totaling approximately $391 million were not properly controlled and were used, at least in part, for illicit purposes, including commercial bribery and embezzlement., From 1999 to 2003, Siemens Managing Board or Vorstand was ineffective in implementing controls to address constraints imposed by Germanys 1999 adoption of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) anti-bribery convention that outlawed foreign bribery. The Vorstand was also ineffective in meeting the U.S. regulatory and anti-bribery requirements that Siemens was subject to following its March 12, 2001, listing on the New York Stock Exchange. Despite knowledge of bribery at two of its largest groups — Communications and Power Generation — the companys tone at the top was inconsistent with an effective FCPA compliance program and created a corporate culture in which bribery was tolerated and even rewarded at the highest levels of the company. Employees obtained large amounts of cash from cash desks, which were sometimes transported in suitcases across international borders for bribery. Authorizations for payments were placed on post-it notes and later removed to eradicate any permanent record. Siemens used numerous slush funds, off-books accounts maintained at unconsolidated entities, and a system of business consultants and intermediaries to facilitate the corrupt payments., Siemens failed to implement adequate internal controls to detect and prevent violations of the FCPA. Elaborate payment mechanisms were used to conceal the fact that bribe payments were made around the globe to obtain business. False invoices and payment documentation was created to make payments to business consultants under false business consultant agreements that identified services that were never intended to be rendered. Illicit payments were falsely recorded as expenses for management fees, consulting fees, supply contracts, room preparation fees, and commissions. Siemens inflated U.N. contracts, signed side agreements with Iraqi ministries that were not disclosed to the U.N., and recorded the ASSF payments as legitimate commissions despite U.N., U.S., and international sanctions against such payments., In November 2006, Siemens current management began to implement reforms to the companys internal controls. These reforms substantially reduced, but did not entirely eliminate, corrupt payments. All but $27.5 million of the corrupt payments occurred before November 15, 2006. The company conducted a massive internal investigation and implemented an amnesty program to its employees to gather information., Siemens violated Section 30A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) by making illicit payments to foreign government officials in order to obtain or retain business. Siemens violated Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act by failing to have adequate internal controls to detect and prevent the payments. Siemens violated Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act by improperly recording the payments in its books., Without admitting or denying the Commissions allegations, Siemens has consented to the entry of a court order permanently enjoining it from future violations of Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act; ordering it to pay $350 million in disgorgement of wrongful profits, which does not include profits factored into Munichs fine; and ordering it to comply with certain undertakings regarding its FCPA compliance program, including an independent monitor for a period of four years. On December 15, 2008, the court entered the final judgment. Since being approached by SEC staff, Siemens has cooperated fully with the ongoing investigation, and the SEC considered the remedial acts promptly undertaken by Siemens. Siemens massive internal investigation and lower level employee amnesty program was essential in gathering facts regarding the full extent of Siemens FCPA violations., The SEC acknowledges assistance from the U.S. Department of Justice, Fraud Section; the U.S. Attorneys Office for District of Columbia, Fraud and Public Corruption Section; the Federal Bureau of Investigation; the Internal Revenue Service; the Office of the Prosecutor General in Munich, Germany; the U.K. Financial Services Authority; and the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2008/comp20829.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20829.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Turino to show cause why the Court should not hold him in contempt for violating a five-year penny stock bar entered against him on December 5, 2003, as part of a settlement of an earlier Commission enforcement action. The penny stock bar prohibited Turino from participating in any penny stock offering. In the December 4th order, the Court finds that the Commission had made a sufficient and proper showing that Turino had violated this bar by participating in penny stock offerings of Biotech Medics, Inc., Equitable Mining Corp., Global Diamond Exchange, Inc., Grand Entertainment and Music, Inc. and OMDA Oil and Gas, Inc. The Commission had previously issued orders temporarily suspending the trading in the securities of two of these companies, Equitable Mining Corp. and Global Diamond Exchange. , The order directs Turino to show cause why the Court should not hold him in contempt, should not require him to disgorge the unlawful proceeds from selling shares obtained in penny stock offerings, and should not make him subject to a permanent penny stock bar. Further, the order freezes certain bank and brokerage accounts held or controlled by, or in the name of Melissa Spooner, Robert Leslie, Mountain Passages, Inc., Austin Funding, LLC and CRL Holdings, Inc. Finally, the order extends the penny stock bar against Turino pending a final hearing on the show cause order. , The penny stock bar against Turino resulted from the Commissions May 8, 2002, enforcement action against Turino, Vincent Lo Castro, and a company they controlled, Pinnacle Business Management, Inc. <i>SEC v.

On December 5, 2003, Turino consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoined him from further violations of these provisions and imposed a $60,000 civil penalty, a permanent officer and director bar, and a five-year penny stock bar., For additional information, see below:,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20830.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

(JGK)</h2>, <h2>SEC Charges Wall Street Professionals and Others with Widespread Insider Trading</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed insider trading charges against nine defendants and also named three relief defendants. The Commissions complaint alleges that from at least March 2004 through July 2008, <b>Matthew Devlin</b>, then a registered representative at Lehman Brothers, Inc. (Lehman) in New York City, traded on and tipped at least four of his clients and friends with inside information about 13 impending corporate transactions. According to the complaint, some of Devlins clients and friends, three of whom worked in the securities or legal professions, tipped others who also traded in the securities. The complaint alleges that the illicit trading yielded over $4.8 million in profits., As alleged in the complaint, although many of the defendants had accounts with Lehman, they often attempted to avoid detection by trading in the securities of the target companies in numerous accounts that were not associated with Lehman or Devlin. The complaint alleges that to further conceal their illicit trading, at least two of the defendants sold off some of the shares they had purchased based on inside information prior to public announcements of the deals. In addition, Devlin and one of his tippees arranged to buy shares on Devlins behalf so Devlin could profit from the nonpublic information but evade scrutiny. When this tippees name appeared on a watch list, Devlin and the tippee agreed that Devlin would stop providing him inside information., The complaint alleges that Devlin misappropriated the confidential nonpublic information about the corporate transactions from his wife, a partner in the New York City office of an international public relations firm working on the deals. As alleged in the complaint, because the inside information was valuable, some of the traders referred to Devlin and his wife as the golden goose. The complaint further alleges that by providing inside information, Devlin curried favor with his friends and business associates and, in return, was rewarded with cash and luxury items, including a Cartier watch, a Barneys New York gift card, a widescreen TV, a Ralph Lauren leather jacket and Porsche driving lessons., The complaint alleges that, based on the information provided by Devlin, the defendants variously purchased the common stock and/or options of the following public companies: InVision Technologies, Inc.; Eon Labs, Inc.; Mylan, Inc.; Abgenix, Inc.; Aztar Corporation; Veritas, DGC, Inc.; Mercantile Bankshares Corporation; Alcan, Inc.; Ventana Medical Systems, Inc.; Pharmion Corporation; Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.; Anheuser-Busch, Inc.; and Rohm and Haas Company. At the time that Devlin tipped the other defendants about these companies, each company was confidentially engaged in a significant transaction that involved a merger, tender offer, or stock repurchase., The Commissions complaint contains the following additional allegations:, Devlin tipped <b>Jamil Bouchareb</b>, age 27, his friend and client at Lehman about 12 of the deals. Bouchareb, a Miami Beach, Florida-based trader, traded in his own accounts and tipped his friends and business partners. He also caused his parents to trade. , Boucharebs tippees include his friend and business partner, <b>Daniel Corbin</b>, age 32, who traded in a number of the deals through accounts in the name of his companies, <b>Augustus Management LLC</b> and <b>Corbin Investment Holdings LLC</b>. Corbin, a Miami-based trader, shared some of the profits he made with Bouchareb. Bouchareb and Corbin also shared an interest in a number of accounts that traded in the deals. In turn, Daniel Corbin, provided the information to his father <b>Lee Corbin</b>, age 66, an attorney based in White Plains, New York. Lee Corbin traded in his personal accounts in four of the deals and owned an interest in the Corbin Investment Holdings account that Daniel used to trade in the deals. Bouchareb and Corbin introduced Devlin to Lee Corbin, who steered Devlin business from some of his trusts and estates clients. Bouchareb also provided the information to his girlfriend, <b>Maria Checa</b>, age 38, who currently resides in Greensboro, North Carolina. Checa traded in her accounts, <b>Checa International, Inc.</b> and Playmate Capital LLC. Bouchareb shared in some of the profits that Checa made. In total, Bouchareb, Daniel Corbin, Lee Corbin, Maria Checa and Boucharebs parents reaped illegal profits of more than $4.2 million., <b>Frederick Bowers</b>, age 40, a registered representative at Lehman and one of Devlins work partners was tipped on at least three of the transactions. Bowers then tipped <b>Thomas Faulhaber</b>, one of Bowers clients at Lehman. Faulhaber realized profits of approximately $217,000. Faulhaber kicked back cash to Bowers who shared some of it with Devlin. Devlin received at least $10,000., <b>Eric Holzer</b>, age 34, Devlins friend and a tax associate in the New York City office of an international law firm, traded in at least three of the transactions. Holzer reaped profits of $175,000 in his own accounts and two accounts controlled by his father. Holzer gave Devlin cash, some of which came from shares he had his father buy on Devlins behalf., <b>Jeffrey Glover</b>, age 46, another of Devlins Lehman clients and an investment adviser, traded in at least five of the deals. Glover, who is a resident of Bellaire, Texas, made approximately $189,000 in illicit profits. , Defendants Devlin, Bouchareb, Daniel Corbin, Bowers, Faulhaber, Holzer, Glover, Corbin Investment Holdings, LLC and Augustus Management, LLC are charged with violating Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3. The SEC seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement of illicit profits with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. Defendants Checa, Checa International, Inc. and Lee Corbin are charged as relief defendants and the SEC seeks their trading profits., The U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York filed related criminal charges today against some of the defendants named in the SECs complaint.

On December 12, 2008, the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut entered judgment against Lucarelli, 36, a resident of Greenwich, Connecticut ordering him to pay disgorgement of $14,000 plus prejudgment interest of $4,450 and a civil penalty of $25,000. In related administrative proceedings instituted by the Commission on December 17, 2008, Lucarelli was ordered to cease and desist from violating Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and suspended from associating with any broker-dealer for 12 months., According to the Commissions Complaint, filed on June 28, 2005, Lucarelli and others engaged in a fraudulent scheme in connection with the initial public offering of NewAlliance Bancshares, Inc. The Commissions Complaint alleges that first priority for receipt of stock in the IPO was given to depositors of New Haven Savings Bank (the predecessor to NewAlliance) as of June 30, 2002, and that the IPO offering was oversubscribed and that certain eligible depositors did not receive all the shares they requested. The Complaint also alleges that the defendants were not entitled to receive any stock in the IPO, but they illegally purchased stock in the NewAlliance IPO in violation of the federal securities laws. In particular, the Complaint alleges that, beginning in or about February 2004, one of Lucarellis co-defendants, Robert Ross, orchestrated a scheme in which he and others used seven depositors of New Haven Savings Bank to illegally obtain 490,000 shares of NewAlliance Bancshares stock at the initial offering price of $10 per share. According to the Complaint, Lucarelli located depositors who would be willing to enter into arrangements with Ross. The Complaint further alleges that, as a result of this fraudulent conduct, the overall scheme generated approximately $1.75 million in total profits., In addition to the Commissions action, Lucarelli was indicted on October 14, 2005, and charged with conspiracy, mail fraud, wire fraud, and securities fraud in connection with the NewAlliance IPO. Following a jury trial in July 2006, the jury found Lucarelli guilty of one count of securities fraud and one count of conspiracy. On March 22, 2007, however, the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut entered a judgment of acquittal in Lucarellis favor, thereby setting aside the jurys verdict., The Commission acknowledges the assistance and cooperation of the U.S. Attorney for the District of Connecticut, and the New Haven Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Connecticut Department of Banking, Securities and Business Investment Division.

The complaint alleges that Madoff last week informed two senior employees that his investment advisory business was a fraud. Madoff told these employees that he was finished, that he had absolutely nothing, that its all just one big lie, and that it was basically, a giant Ponzi scheme. The senior employees understood him to be saying that he had for years been paying returns to certain investors out of the principal received from other, different investors. Madoff admitted in this conversation that the firm was insolvent and had been for years, and that he estimated the losses from this fraud were at least $50 billion., The Commission continues to seek, among other things, a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus pre-judgment interest, and civil money penalties., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2008/comp-madoff121108.pdf>SEC Complaint in this matter</a>,  ]"

For Improper Payments to Iraq Under the U.N. Oil for Food Program — Fiat Agrees to Pay Over $10 Million in Disgorgement, Interest, and Penalties</h2>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed Foreign Corrupt Practices Act books and records and internal controls charges against Fiat S.p.A. and CNH Global N.V. in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.  Fiat S.p.A., an Italian company, provides automobiles, trucks and commercial vehicles.  CNH Global N.V., a majority-owned subsidiary of Fiat, provides agricultural and construction equipment.  The Commissions complaint alleges that from 2000 through 2003, certain Fiat and CNH Global subsidiaries made approximately $4.3 million in kickback payments in connection with their sales of humanitarian goods to Iraq under the United Nations Oil for Food Program (the Program).  The kickbacks were characterized as after sales service fees (ASSFs), but no bona fide services were performed.  The Program was intended to provide humanitarian relief for the Iraqi population, which faced severe hardship under international trade sanctions.  The Program required the Iraqi government to purchase humanitarian goods through a U.N. escrow account.  The kickbacks paid by Fiats and CNH Globals subsidiaries diverted funds out of the escrow account and into Iraqi-controlled accounts at banks in countries such as Jordan., According to the Commissions Complaint:, During the Oil for Food Program, Fiats subsidiary, IVECO S.p.A., used its IVECO Egypt office to enter into four direct contracts with Iraqi ministries in which $1,803,880 in kickbacks were made on the sales of commercial vehicles and parts.  After agreeing to pay the ASSFs, IVECO Egypt increased its agents commissions from five percent to between fifteen and twenty percent of the total U.N. contract price, which the agent funneled to Iraq as kickbacks.  The agent submitted invoices for the inflated commissions, and IVECO financial documents show line items for contract pay-back due to the agent.  IVECO and the agent secretly inflated the U.N. contracts by ten to fifteen percent.  Despite the agents invoices being held for one year and the unusually large commissions, IVECO paid the invoices.  In one instance, IVECO set up a bank guarantee in the amount of the ASSF in favor of a Dubai-based firm that operated as a front company for Iraq.  IVECOs bank guarantee was canceled and, instead, the agent established an identical bank guarantee to conceal IVECOs role.  A line item identified as pay-back on IVECO documents corresponded to the amount of the agents bank guarantee.  The ASSFs were incorrectly recorded as legitimate commissions on the companys books and records., Beginning in November 2000, IVECO changed its method of doing business for future contracts by making the agent its distributor.  As a distributor, the agent purchased equipment directly from IVECO for its own account, and in turn, the agent sold IVECO trucks and parts to Iraq under its own inflated contracts to the U.N.  With IVECOs knowledge, the agent facilitated $1,364,080 in ASSFs on twelve additional contracts.  Through this mechanism, IVECO was able to move its goods into Iraq, but keep itself distanced from any involvement in the ASSF scheme.  IVECO knew or should have known from its direct sales to Iraq that the agents sales of IVECO products included ASSFs.  In correspondence with the U.N., the agent conceded that it paid ASSFs on the contracts and confirmed that the payments were made through Al Rafidain Bank., In mid-2001, CNH Global subsidiary Case France engaged in three direct transactions with Iraqi ministries in which $187,720 in kickbacks were made on the sale of construction equipment.  Armed Iraqi officials approached Case Frances Baghdad facility reiterating its request for kickbacks.  Case France then entered into a side letter agreeing to pay kickbacks.  The side letter was not disclosed to the U.N.  To generate funds to pay the kickbacks and to conceal the ASSFs, Case France and its agent secretly inflated the U.N. contracts by approximately ten percent.  Case France inflated its commission payments to its distributor, who then forwarded the excess funds to Iraq as kickbacks.  Case France did not record the kickbacks on its books and records., Between December 2000 and May 2001, CNH Global subsidiary New Holland engaged in two direct transactions with Iraqi ministries in which $447,116 in kickbacks were made on the sale of tractors. To generate funds to pay the kickbacks and to conceal the ASSFs, New Holland secretly inflated the U.N. contracts by approximately ten percent.  On one contract, New Holland obtained a bank guarantee in favor of the Iraqi ministry in the amount of the ASSF.  The ASSFs were recorded as cost of goods sold in New Hollands books and records.  Soon after the two direct contracts were negotiated, New Holland ceased entering into direct sales to Iraq.  After an Iraqi official inquired why the company no longer conducted business in Iraq, New Holland resumed its business but in a manner that distanced itself from the ASSFs.  New Holland made its dealer a distributor, which allowed the dealer to purchase New Holland goods for the dealers own account.  The dealer, in turn, then sold New Holland products to Iraq under the dealers own secretly inflated U.N. contracts.  A November 2001, correspondence from the dealer to New Holland discussed the fact that New Hollands direct sales to Iraq remain impracticable as long as the famous 10 (a reference to the ten percent kickback) was required, and showed the dealer could make the payment rather than New Holland.  With New Hollands knowledge, the dealer facilitated ASSF payments totaling $576,861 to Iraq on three U.N. contracts.  An additional $312,198 ASSF payment on a fourth contract was authorized, but never received by Iraq., Fiat and CNH Global failed to maintain adequate systems of internal controls to detect and prevent the payments and their accounting for these transactions failed properly to record the nature of the payments.  Fiat and CNH Global, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining Fiat and CNH Global from future violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and ordering Fiat to disgorge $5,309,632 in profits plus $1,899,510 in pre-judgment interest plus a civil penalty of $3,600,000.  Fiat will also pay a $7,000,000 penalty pursuant to a deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice, Fraud Section.  The Commission considered remedial acts promptly undertaken by Fiat and CNH Global and the cooperation the companies afforded the Commission staff in its investigation.

Without admitting or denying the allegations, UnitedHealth agreed to settle to charges that it violated the reporting, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws., In a separate complaint, the Commission charged former UnitedHealth General Counsel David J. Lubben with participating in the stock option backdating scheme. Without admitting or denying the allegations, Lubben consented to, among other things, an antifraud injunction, a $575,000 civil penalty, and a five-year officer and director bar., The Commission alleges that between 1994 and 2005 UnitedHealth concealed more than $1 billion in stock option compensation by providing senior executives and other employees with in-the-money options while secretly backdating the grants to avoid reporting the expenses to investors., According to the Commissions complaint, certain UnitedHealth officers used hindsight to pick advantageous grant dates for the companys nonqualified stock options that on many occasions coincided with, or were close to, dates of historically low annual and quarterly closing prices for UnitedHealths common stock. Although pricing the options below current prices required the company to report a compensation expense under well-settled accounting principles, UnitedHealth avoided reporting the charges by creating inaccurate and misleading documents indicating that the options had been granted on the earlier date. The backdated grants resulted in materially misleading disclosures, with the company overstating its net income in fiscal years 1994 through 2005 by as much as $1.526 billion., The Commission declined to charge the company with fraud or seek a monetary penalty, based on the companys extraordinary cooperation in the Commissions investigation, as well as its extensive remedial measures. UnitedHealths cooperation included an independent internal investigation, the companys release in a Form 8-K of a report detailing the investigations findings and conclusions, and the sharing of the facts uncovered in the internal investigation with the government. The company also took significant remedial actions in response to the findings of its internal investigation, including the implementation of new controls designed to prevent the recurrence of fraudulent conduct, removal of certain senior executives and board members, and the recoupment of nearly $1.8 billion in cash, options value and other benefits from several former and current officers, through, among other things, derivative litigation and the voluntary re-pricing and cancellation of retroactively-priced options., In a separate complaint, the Commission charged former UnitedHealth General Counsel David J. Lubben with participating in the stock option backdating scheme. According to the Commissions complaint, Lubben or others acting at his direction created false or misleading company records indicating that the grants had occurred on dates when the companys stock price had been at a low. Lubben personally received numerous backdated grants of options, representing as many as 3.8 million shares of UnitedHealth stock on a split adjusted basis. He exercised approximately 1.8 million of those options for approximately $1.1 million in gains attributable to improper backdating., Without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commissions complaint, Lubben consented to the entry of an order permanently enjoining him from violating or aiding and abetting violations of the antifraud, reporting, record-keeping, internal controls, proxy statement, and securities ownership reporting provisions of the federal securities laws, and barring him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for a period of five years. Lubben will disgorge ill-gotten gains of $1,403,310 with $347,211 in prejudgment interest and pay a $575,000 civil penalty., Under the terms of the settlement, Lubbens disgorgement and prejudgment interest would be deemed satisfied by his voluntary repricing of his UnitedHealth stock options, which reduced the value of those options by approximately $2.7 million, and his payment of approximately $630,000 in pending settlements to resolve derivative and shareholder lawsuits related to options backdating filed against Lubben in state and federal courts in Minnesota., In addition, Lubben agreed to resolve a separate administrative proceeding against him by consenting to a Commission order that suspends him from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an attorney for three years., The Commissions settlements with UnitedHealth and Lubben in the civil actions are subject to the approval of the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota., In December 2007, the Commission announced a record $468 million settled enforcement action against William W. McGuire, M.D., the former Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of UnitedHealth. The settlement, which is pending before U.S. District Judge James M. Rosenbaum, was the first with an individual to deprive corporate executives of their stock sale profits and bonuses earned while their companies were misleading investors pursuant to the clawback provision (Section 304) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. McGuire consented to anti-fraud and other injunctions; disgorgement plus prejudgment interest of approximately $12.7 million; a $7 million civil penalty (the largest penalty against an individual in a stock option backdating case); and reimbursement to UnitedHealth under Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of approximately $448 million in cash bonuses, profits from the exercise and sale of UnitedHealth stock and unexercised UnitedHealth options. McGuire also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for ten years.

Previously, on March 13, 2008, the Commission obtained a temporary restraining order against Reynolds, Wynn, Fleming, and their respective entities, Bellatalia LP, Wynn Industries, LLC, and Thomas Wade Investments, LLC for engaging in illegal distributions of Beverage Creations, Inc. stock. The SEC alleged that by this conduct, the defendants violated Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933. The SEC also charged Wynn, Wynn Industries and Beverage Creations with fraud related to the Beverage Creation, Inc. stock offering., In its amended complaint, the SEC alleges that Reynolds, Wynn, Fleming, and additional companies under their control purchased stock from ConnectAJet.com, Inc., My Vintage Baby, Inc. and Alchemy Creative, Inc. for pennies per share and immediately began liquidating those shares in the public market at prices grossly inflated by their own promotional activities. The amended complaint adds as defendants Lugano Funds LLC, Wynn Holdings, LLC and Regus Investment Group, LLC, which are companies owned or controlled by Reynolds, Wynn and Fleming, respectively., In addition, the SEC alleges that Jason Wynn and companies under his control created artificial demand for the stock of ConnectAJet.com, Inc., My Vintage Baby, Inc. and Alchemy Creative, Inc. through various ad campaigns, nationwide promotional mailers and spam emails. While the promotional mailers disclosed that Wynn companies received the stock being touted, they did not disclose that Wynn and his companies intended to sell that stock into the artificially inflated market created by the promotions., The SECs lawsuit also names as defendants Beverage Creations, Inc.

(“Rica”) and its former Chief Executive Officer, Calixto Chaves, a resident of Costa Rica.  Rica, headquartered in Costa Rica, traded on the American Stock Exchange until it was delisted in November 2006. According to the SEC’s complaint, while serving as CEO of Rica, Chaves engaged in pervasive self-dealing resulting in millions of dollars in related-party transactions which Rica failed to disclose in its SEC filings and the improper valuation of millions in assets Chaves caused Rica to purchase from him and his family. Rica and Chaves each consented, without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC’s complaint, to the entry of a Final Judgment of Permanent Injunction and Other Relief (Final Judgment).,  According to the SEC’s complaint, between 1998 and 2004, Chaves pledged and encumbered numerous assets belonging to Rica in order to secure approximately $37 million in loans made to him and entities under his control.  Additionally, Chaves caused Rica to purchase approximately $24 million worth of real property and other assets owned by Chaves and his family.  The SEC’s complaint alleges that Chaves engaged in the related-party transactions because of mounting personal and business debts that ultimately lead to his resignation from Rica in January 2005.  As a result, Rica failed to disclose these related-party transactions and improperly recorded the value of the assets acquired from Chaves in its filings with the SEC between 2000 and 2005., The Final Judgment will permanently enjoin Rica Foods and Chaves from violating Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1 thereunder; and Chaves from violating Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 13a-14, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2, thereunder.

Theodule. According to the Commissions complaint, the defendants raised at least $23.4 million from thousands of investors in the Haitian-American community nationwide through a network of purported investment clubs Theodule directs investors to form. Also on December 29, 2008 Judge Donald M. Middlebrooks, U.S. District Judge for the Southern District of Florida, issued an order placing Creative Capital under the control of a receiver to safeguard assets, as well as other emergency orders, including temporary restraining orders and asset freezes., The Commissions complaint alleges that starting in at least November 2007, Theodule, directly and through Creative Capital, raised at least $23.4 million from thousands of investors, mostly Haitian-Americans. As part of the scheme, the defendants direct investors to form investment clubs solely for the purpose of funneling funds to Theodule and Creative Capital. Theodule solicits investors for Creative Capital by guaranteeing a 100% return on their investment within 90 days based on his claimed successful trading of stocks and options. The defendants also solicit investors by claiming that Creative Capitals trading profits are used to fund new business ventures, some of which benefit the Haitian community in the United States and Haiti, and others in Sierra Leone. In truth, Theodule has lost at least $18 million trading stocks and options just over the last year. In addition, Creative Capital merely repaid earlier investors with monies collected from new investors in typical Ponzi scheme fashion. Finally, the Complaint alleges, Theodule has commingled investor funds with his personal funds and misappropriated at least $3.8 million for himself and his family., The Commissions complaint further alleges:, Defendants statements of the safety and security of investor deposits are patently false. Theodule directs prospective investors to form investment clubs with the assistance of a purported self-regulatory agency called Smart Investment Management Services, LLC (SIMS). Defendants tout SIMS independent verification of their deposits as an added measure of safety and security. In reality, SIMS is a private company run by a former Creative Capital employee and not a regulatory entity., Defendants claim of success trading stocks and options are also false. Of the more than $18 million deposited in brokerage accounts, Theodule has lost approximately 97% of those funds trading stocks and options. In fact, Theodule has consistently lost money trading in those accounts since November 2007, and has never generated net trading profits., Defendants claims that Creative Capitals trading profits were used to fund new business ventures, some of which would benefit the Haitian community in the United States and Haiti, and others in Sierra Leone are false. In reality, there were no trading profits, and most of the funds the Defendants disbursed went to pay earlier investors their purported profits, not fund business projects. Moreover, the Defendants misappropriated millions of dollars of investor funds. , In addition to the emergency relief obtained today, the Commissions complaint seeks disgorgement of the defendants ill-gotten gains, civil penalties, and permanent injunctions barring future violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws., Investors are advised to read the Commissions <a href=/investor/pubs/affinity.htm>Affinity Fraud Investor Alert</a>, which provides tips on how to avoid being a victim in an affinity fraud.
