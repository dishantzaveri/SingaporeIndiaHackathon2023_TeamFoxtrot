22214,2012,"[<h3>SEC CHARGES CHARLES A. AIKEN AND AIKEN CONTINENTAL, L.L.C. WITH FRAUD IN THE OFFER AND SALE OF MUNICIPAL BONDS</h3>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced its filing of a civil injunctive action alleging fraud in the offer and sale of municipal bonds by Charles A. Aiken and his entity, Aiken Continental, L.L.C., Filed December 29, 2011 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia, the SECâs complaint alleges that Aiken and Aiken Continental made material misrepresentations and omissions in connection with the 2006 offer and sale of $2.96 million of industrial development revenue bonds. Raleigh County, West Virginia issued the bonds in October 2006 to facilitate Aiken Continentalâs acquisition of Continental Casket, Inc., a casket manufacturing facility located within its jurisdiction. Aiken formed Aiken Continental in August 2006 for the sole purpose of acquiring Continental Casketâs assets, and served as its sole principal., According to the SECâs complaint, Aiken concealed from key participants to the transaction, including the issuer, bond counsel, the underwriter, and the bondholdersâ trustee, that he had been indicted for felony financial fraud in late 2005. Aiken also concealed the fact that he was in the process of negotiating a plea agreement just before the bonds were issued in October 2006, which included a term of imprisonment. In addition, Aiken failed to disclose material information about a $200,000 loan to Aiken and Aiken Continental from an entity partially owned by their attorney, in order to facilitate the closing of the transaction. This loan required a $100,000 interest payment, and gave the lender a twenty percent equity interest in Aiken Continental if the loan plus interest was not fully repaid within six months. Aikenâs failure to disclose details about his criminal proceeding and the loan rendered certain statements in the bondsâ Official Statement materially misleading. For example, one section of the Official Statement contained information about Aikenâs background, but failed to mention his felony indictment for financial fraud. Another section of the Official Statement contained projected financial statements for Aiken Continental, but failed to take into account the repayment of the $200,000 loan plus $100,000 interest. Aiken Continental supplied and authorized the use of information in the Official Statement. Aiken signed the Official Statement on behalf of Aiken Continental, and authorized it to be distributed to investors., According to the SECâs complaint, Aiken served 90 days in federal prison and 90 days of home detention in Georgia following the close of the transaction. Aikenâs six-month absence negatively affected the operations of the casket company and the Raleigh County bonds are now in default, with the entire principal amount and accrued interest due., Based on this conduct, the SECâs complaint alleges that Aiken and Aiken Continental violated Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder. The SECâs complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22214.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"
22215,2012,[<h3>SEC CHARGES ATLANTA-BASED ATTORNEY WITH FRAUD IN THE OFFER AND SALE OF MUNICIPAL BONDS</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced its filing of a civil injunctive action alleging fraud in the offer and sale of municipal bonds by Chalmer E. Detling, II, an attorney based in Atlanta., Filed December 29, 2011 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, the SECâs complaint alleges that Detling made material misrepresentations and omissions in connection with the 2006 offer and sale of $2.96 million of industrial development revenue bonds. Raleigh County, West Virginia issued the bonds in October 2006 to facilitate Aiken Continental, L.L.C.âs acquisition of Continental Casket, Inc., a casket manufacturing facility located within its jurisdiction. In 2006, Detling served as counsel to Aiken Continental and its sole principal, Charles A. Aiken, for purposes of the acquisition, and simultaneously represented Aiken in an unrelated federal criminal proceeding., According to the SECâs complaint, Detling failed to disclose to key participants to the transaction, including the issuer, bond counsel, the underwriter, and the bondholdersâ trustee, that Aiken had been indicted for financial fraud in late 2005. Detling also failed to disclose that he was in the process of negotiating a plea agreement for Aiken just before the bonds were issued in October 2006. In addition, Detling failed to disclose material information about a $200,000 loan to Aiken and Aiken Continental from a company that was partially owned by Detling, in order to facilitate the closing of the transaction. This loan required a $100,000 interest payment, and gave the lender a twenty percent equity interest in Aiken Continental if the loan plus interest was not fully repaid within six months. Detlingâs failure to disclose details about Aikenâs criminal proceeding and the loan rendered certain statements in the bondsâ Official Statement materially misleading. By reviewing the Official Statement, which was distributed to investors in connection with the transaction, and failing to correct the misstatements and omissions therein, the SECâs complaint alleges that Detling aided and abetted the violations of Aiken and Aiken Continental., In addition, the SECâs complaint alleges that Detling signed an opinion letter as counsel to Aiken Continental in which he made false and misleading representations. Specifically, Detling represented that no proceeding at law was pending which would adversely affect Aiken Continental, and that the Official Statement did not contain any untrue statement of material fact or omit any material facts. The SECâs complaint alleges that these representations were materially false and misleading due to Detlingâs failures to disclose material information about Aikenâs criminal proceeding and the loan., According to the SECâs complaint, Aiken served 90 days in federal prison and 90 days of home detention in Georgia following the close of the transaction. Aikenâs six-month absence negatively affected the operations of the casket company and the Raleigh County bonds are now in default, with the entire principal amount and accrued interest due., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Detling agreed to settle the SECâs charges by consenting to the entry of a final judgment, which will permanently enjoin him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and from aiding and abetting violations of Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. As part of the settlement, Detling also agreed to pay $10,000 in disgorgement, $3,052 in prejudgment interest, and a $25,000 civil penalty, all of which will be distributed on a pro rata basis to Raleigh County bondholders. The SECâs settlement with Detling is subject to court approval. In addition, pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3) of the Commissionâs Rules of Practice, Detling consented to the entry of an administrative order suspending him from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an attorney, with the right to reapply after five years.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22215.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Mowen</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that on December 29, 2011, the United States District Court for the District of Utah granted its motion for summary judgment against Jeffrey L. Mowen.  On May 4, 2011, Mowen pled guilty to committing wire fraud in a related criminal action, <i>United States of America v. Mowen</i>, Case No. 2:09-cr-00098-DB (D. Utah).  In pleading guilty, Mowen acknowledged operating a Ponzi scheme from around October 2006 to around October 2008, wherein he received over $18 million from investors for use in a purported foreign currency trading program.  The SEC Complaint alleges that the investor funds provided to Mowen were raised by Thomas Fry and the other defendants, Fry’s promoters, from the unregistered offer and sale of high-yield promissory notes to over 150 investors in several states.  Mowen acknowledged in his guilty plea that, rather than using investor funds for their intended purpose, he used the money for his personal benefit, misappropriating over $8 million., The SEC moved for summary judgment against Mowen based upon the facts he acknowledged in his guilty plea.  The Court granted the SEC’s motion, which sought a finding that Mowen violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, an injunction against future violations of those provisions, and disgorgement of $8,041,779 in ill-gotten gains, plus prejudgment interest of $1,964,203.,  ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22216.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"
22217,2012,[<h3>FORMER REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVE SENTENCED TO 20 YEARS IN PRISON IN CONNECTION WITH MISAPPROPRIATION SCHEME</h3>],"[ The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that on December 13, 2011, the Honorable William Stiehl, United States District Court judge, sentenced Edward Lynn Moskop, 64, of Belleville, Illinois, to the maximum statutory penalties of 240 months’ imprisonment on Mail Fraud and 120 months on Money Laundering, to be served concurrently. Judge Stiehl also ordered Moskop to pay more than $1.49 million in restitution to his victims. The sentencing followed Moskop’s August 3, 2011 plea of guilty to the two count indictment. ,  Moskops 20-year prison sentence was the culmination of his long-time investment fraud and misappropriation scheme. In the criminal case, the United States Attorney’s office for the Southern District of Illinois alleged that Moskop, operating as Financial Services Moskop and Associates, Inc., acted as a securities broker for several customers by making investments on their behalf. According to the U.S. Attorney’s office, from 1991 to 2010, Moskop persuaded customers to provide him with funds for investment. But, according to the U.S. Attorney’s office, instead of making the investment, Moskop kept the funds for his own use. The U.S. Attorney’s office alleged that Moskop also provided his customers with fraudulent periodic investment statements showing false interest and gains in the investments. According to the U.S. Attorney’s office, Moskop obtained by fraud approximately $2,400,000 from 25 victims. The U.S. Attorney’s office alleged that Moskop’s victims included his relatives, individuals referred by trusted friends and attorneys, a local Veterans of Foreign War Post, and long-time customers of his insurance business. ,  The criminal charges against Moskop are related to the conduct underlying the SEC’s civil action against Moskop and his company, Financial Services Moskop &amp; Associates. On November 19, 2010, the SEC filed an emergency civil action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois to halt an ongoing fraud on investors conducted by Moskop and his company. In its complaint, the SEC alleged that from 1989 until the filing of the SEC’s action against Moskop and his company, Moskop misappropriated most of the life savings of at least two elderly investors. On the same day the SEC filed its case, the Honorable Rebecca R. Pallmeyer, United States District Court Judge, granted the SEC’s motion for emergency relief, entering a temporary restraining order against Moskop and his company and an order freezing their assets. On November 27, 2010, the court entered a preliminary injunction against Moskop and his company, and on July 21, 2011, the court entered a permanent injunction against Moskop and his company and continued the order freezing their assets. The SECs action, which is ongoing, seeks disgorgement of the ill-gotten gains received by Moskop and his company, as well as civil penalties. ,  For further information, see Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr21983.htm>21983</a> (May 27, 2011) and Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2010/lr21752.htm>21752</a> (November 22, 2010). ,  ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22217.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"
22218,2012,[<h3>SEC CHARGES THREE INDIVIDUALS FOR THEIR ROLE IN $16 MILLION PONZI SCHEME </h3>],"[On December 29, 2011, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil fraud action against Kevin J. Wilcox, Jennifer E. Thoennes, and Eric R. Nelson for their role in a $16 million Ponzi scheme operated by Joseph Nelson.  The SEC previously charged Joseph Nelson and others involved in the scheme.  , The SEC’s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah, alleges that from at least June 2005 through June 2010, Joseph Nelson and his associates, including at various times Wilcox and Thoennes, solicited at least $16 million from more than 100 persons to invest in promissory notes offered by Joseph Nelson’s companies.  Joseph Nelson, Wilcox, and Thoennes told investors — many of whom are fellow members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (“LDS”) that Nelson identified and targeted through church connections and during church functions — that Joseph Nelson and his companies were engaged in the business of purchasing “merchant portfolios” of credit card processing accounts, holding them for a certain period of time, and then selling them for a profit to financial institutions, such as banks., According to the SEC’s complaint, Joseph Nelson, Wilcox, and Thoennes lured investors by offering extraordinary rates of return.  Most investors were given promissory notes promising returns of 14% to 60% on an annualized basis and additional premium of 20% to 60% at maturity.  Some investors were simply told that they would double their money.  , The SEC alleges that Joseph Nelson and his companies never purchased or sold a single merchant portfolio.  The money invested with Joseph Nelson and his companies was instead used by Nelson to make incremental payments to investors in a Ponzi-scheme fashion, to pay his associates, including Wilcox and Thoennes, and to pay his own lavish personal expenses, as well as those of other family members. , The SEC’s complaint alleges that between May 2008 and July 2010, Wilcox raised and helped to raise approximately $3 million from at least 11 people.  Between August 2009 and January 2010, Thoennes raised and helped to raise at least $1.5 million from at least 4 persons, and solicited investments from at least 15 other individuals who did not invest with the Nelson companies.  , The SEC’s complaint also alleges that Eric Nelson, Joseph Nelson’s brother, created fictitious documents that Joseph Nelson and his associates used to mislead investors into believing that Joseph Nelson and his companies were engaged in the business of buying and selling merchant credit card portfolios.  In addition, the SEC claims that Eric Nelson created fictitious bank account statements reflecting balances in his brother’s accounts that were far in excess of the actual amounts in those accounts, which deceived investors about the continued viability of Joseph Nelson and his companies., The SEC’s complaint charges that Wilcox, Thoennes, and Eric Nelson each violated and aided and abetted violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws — Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint also alleges that Wilcox and Thoennes violated the broker-dealer and securities registration provisions of the securities laws — Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act, and Exchange Act Section 15(a).  The SEC seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest thereon, and civil penalties against Wilcox, Thoennes, and Eric Nelson.  , The SEC’s previously filed action against Joseph Nelson and others is pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah. See <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2010/lr21570.htm target=_top>Litigation Release No. 21570</a> (June 25, 2010).

22220,2012,[<h3>SEC CHARGES COMPANY AND ITS OFFICERS WITH ACCOUNTING FRAUD</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it filed an action in federal court in Massachusetts against JBI, Inc., a publicly-traded company formerly located in Massachusetts and now headquartered in Ontario, Canada. The Commission also charged JBIâs current CEO, John Bordynuik, a resident of Ontario, Canada, and its former CFO, Ronald Baldwin, Jr, a resident of Palm Harbor, Florida. The action alleges that the defendants engaged in a scheme to commit securities and accounting fraud by reporting materially false and inaccurate financial information on the financial statements of JBI, Inc. for two reporting periods during 2009., According to the Commissionâs complaint, JBI is purportedly a technology company focused on data restoration and recovery and environmentally engineered product development. The company is headquartered in Canada, but purportedly has operations in New York, Florida, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. The complaint alleges that JBI is purportedly also involved in the research and development of a process designed to convert plastic waste into oil, known as âPlastic2Oilâ or âP2Oâ. The Commission alleges that during the third quarter of 2009 and the year end 2009, JBI materially overstated certain assets in an effort to bolster its balance sheet and success in two private capital raising efforts (Private Investment in Public Equity or PIPES) geared toward raising the capital necessary to begin commercial operation and production of P2O. The Complaint alleges that JBI raised over $8.4 million for the company in these PIPES just before the company issued a public statement indicating its financial statements could no longer be relied upon, in part, due to the erroneous valuation of certain assets, known as media credits, on the balance sheet., The Commission alleges that in contravention of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (âGAAPâ), the company erroneously booked the media credits at a value of $9.997 million, thereby becoming the single largest asset on the companyâs balance sheet, when they should have been initially booked at a value of $1,000,000 when acquired in August 2009, and subsequently, the media credits should have been remeasured at their current value and written down to zero as of the end of the companyâs third fiscal quarter on September 30, 2009. According to the complaint, Bordynuik was aware of, or was reckless in not being aware of, GAAP concerns surrounding the reported value of the media credits in advance of the companyâs third quarter 2009 Form 10-Q filing with the Commission on November 16, 2009 and the year end 2009 Form 10-K filing with the Commission on March 31, 2010 yet falsely certified that the companyâs financial statements for those reporting periods were filed in conformity with GAAP. The Commission complaint further alleges that Baldwin was aware of, or was reckless in not being aware of, GAAP concerns surrounding the reported value of the media credits in advance of the companyâs year-end 2009 10-K filing on March 31, 2010, yet falsely certified that the companyâs financial statements for that period were filed in conformity with GAAP., The Commissionâs complaint charges JBI, Inc. with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (âSecurities Actâ) and Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ) and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13 thereunder. The complaint alleges that Bordynuik violated Sections 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5, and Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act. In addition, the Commissionâs complaint alleges that Baldwin violated Sections 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5, and Section 13(b)(5). Finally, the complaint alleges that Bordynuik and Baldwin violated directly or aided and abetted JBIâs violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 (Bordynuik only), 13a-14, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 (Bordynuik only). In its complaint, the Commission seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against all three defendants, and officer and director bars against Bordynuik and Baldwin.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22220.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"
22221,2012,[<h3>SEC BRINGS FRAUD AND INSIDER TRADING CHARGES AGAINST THREE FORMER WELLCARE EXECUTIVES</h3>],"[On January 9, 2012, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) filed a civil injunctive action against three former executives of WellCare Health Plans, Inc. (“WellCare”), a managed care services company that administers federal government-sponsored health care programs.  According to the Commission’s complaint, from 2003 to 2007, Todd Farha, former Chief Executive Officer, Paul Behrens, former Chief Financial Officer, and Thaddeus Bereday, former General Counsel, (collectively, “the Defendants”), devised and carried out a fraudulent scheme that deceived the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration (“AHCA”) and the Florida Healthy Kids Corporation (“Healthy Kids”) by improperly retaining over $40 million in health care premiums the company was statutorily and contractually obligated to spend on certain health care services or reimburse to the state agencies.  As a result of the scheme, WellCare recorded the retained amount as revenue, which materially inflated its net income and diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) in its public financial statements.  , As alleged in the complaint, WellCare received premiums from AHCA and Healthy Kids that WellCare was required, by contract and by statute, to spend on certain eligible health care services for low-income plan participants.  If WellCare spent less than a certain percentage of the premiums on eligible health care services, it was required to refund some or all of the difference to the State of Florida.  According to the complaint, the Defendants devised a scheme to evade the state’s regulatory framework and fraudulently retain the premiums by, among other methods, funneling the premiums through an internal subsidiary and by applying administrative and other non-allowable expenses in their calculation of money spent on health care services.  In total, through their fraudulent conduct, the complaint alleges that WellCare reduced the refunds it paid to AHCA by approximately $35 million and to Healthy Kids by approximately $6 million.   , The excess premiums retained by the Defendants went straight to WellCare’s bottom line.  WellCare materially misstated its net income and EPS in filings with the Commission and in quarterly and annual earnings releases from 2004-2006 and the first two quarters of 2007.  On January 26, 2009, WellCare filed its Form 10-K for 2007 and restated its financial results for those time periods.  The Restatement reduced WellCare’s reported net income and EPS by approximately 14% for fiscal year (“FY”) 2004, 9% for FY 2005, 13% for FY 2006, and 9% for the first quarter of FY 2007.  , The Commission’s complaint also alleges that, after setting their fraudulent scheme in motion, the Defendants sold approximately 1.6 million WellCare shares into the public market for gross proceeds of approximately $91 million.  The Commission alleges that the Defendants sold these shares on the basis of the material, nonpublic information that they were conducting a fraudulent scheme that impacted WellCare’s financial results, caused false and misleading statements, and imperiled the Company’s business relationship with the State of Florida.  According to the complaint, the Defendants sold the shares pursuant to 10b5-1 trading plans that were created and amended in bad faith, and through three public stock offerings conducted while the scheme was ongoing.  , Based on the conduct alleged in the complaint, the Commission charges that each of the Defendants violated antifraud provisions Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, and also violated Exchange Act Section 13(b)(5) and Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1.  All of the Defendants are also charged with aiding and abetting WellCare’s violations of reporting, books and records, and internal controls provisions, namely, Sections (13)(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13.  Bereday is charged with aiding and abetting Farha’s and Behrens’ violations of antifraud provisions Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5(b) of the Exchange Act.  Finally, Farha and Behrens are charged with violating Exchange Act Rules 13b2-2 and 13a-14, and Section 304(a) of Sarbanes-Oxley, which requires that the CEO or CFO of a company that restates its financial results to reimburse the company any incentive-based or equity-based compensation received and any profits realized from the sale of the company’s stock during the 12-month period following initial issuance of the misleading financial statements.  , As to each Defendant, the Commission is seeking a judgment permanently enjoining them from violating the provisions of the securities laws specified above, civil penalties, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and officer and director bars.  As to Farha and Behrens, the Commission seeks reimbursement of incentive-based and equity-based compensation pursuant to Section 304(a) of Sarbanes-Oxley.  , In conducting its investigation, the Commission acknowledges assistance from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Florida, the Office of Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  ,  ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr22221.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

In its Order, the Court found that Weintraub deceived the public by making false and misleading statements regarding Sterling Global’s ability to purchase and operate Kodak and AMR.  Specifically, the Court found:, The Court permanently enjoined Weintraub and Sterling Global from future violations of Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-8 thereunder, and ordered them to each pay a civil money penalty in the amount of $200,000.  The Commission did not seek any other remedies.  , The Commission filed its complaint in this matter on May 3, 2011.  See Litigation Release 21955 (May 4, 2011).

On July 15, 2011, the Commission filed a complaint charging defendants Compania International Financiera S.A. (Compania”), Coudree Capital Gestion S.A. (“Coudree”), and Chartwell Asset Management Services (“Chartwell”) with insider trading in violation of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, alleging that the defendants traded ahead of a July 11, 2011 public announcement that Swiss-based Lonza Group Ltd. would acquire Connecticut-based Arch Chemicals, Inc.  , Today the Commission filed an amended complaint adding an additional claim for relief under the tender offer antifraud provisions of the Exchange Act, specifically Section 14(e) and Rule 14e-3 thereunder.  The Commission amended its complaint because the Lonza acquisition of Arch Chemicals was in the form of a tender offer.  The Commission’s amended complaint now charges the defendants with violating Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and Rule 14e-3.

22228,2012,[<h3>SEC CHARGES ST. LOUIS-BASED PRIVATE INVESTMENT FUNDS AND THEIR PRINCIPAL WITH FRAUD AND OBTAINS EMERGENCY RELIEF AGAINST THE ENTITIES</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that it has filed charges and obtained emergency relief, including an asset freeze and the appointment of a receiver, against several St. Louis, Missouri private investment funds and management companies. The SEC alleges that Burton Douglas Morriss, the principal of these entities, misappropriated over $9 million of investor assets., The SEC alleges that Morriss told investors that his private investment funds and management companies would invest their money in a portfolio of financial services and technology companies. However, investors were unaware that for the past several years, Morriss had been misappropriating their money to the tune of millions of dollars through a series of fraudulent transfers to himself and another entity he controlled. To conceal his fraud, Morriss later disguised these fraudulent transfers as personal loans., According to the SECâs complaint filed in federal court in St. Louis, Missouri, at various times between approximately 2003 and 2011, Morriss, his two private investment funds, MIC VII, LLC and Acartha Technology Partners, LP, and his management firms, Gryphon Investments III, LLC and Acartha Group, LLC, raised at least $88 million from at least 97 investors to invest in preferred shares or membership interests in the defendant entities. The defendants represented to investors that the investment funds would invest in early to mid-stage companies in the financial services and technology sectors., The SEC alleges that unbeknownst to investors, for the past several years, Morriss has misappropriated investor funds through transfers from his companies to himself and another entity he controlled, Morriss Holdings, LLC, to pay for personal expenses, including, mortgage and alimony payments, payment of personal loans, pleasure trips, and household expenses. In an attempt to conceal his scheme, the fraudulent transfers that Morriss made to himself were recorded as âloansâ on the defendant entitiesâ books. In fact, these transfers were never truly loans because Morriss did not intend to repay them at the time of his misappropriation. Moreover, the funds transferred to Morriss for his personal use were inconsistent with the disclosures contained in the offering materials provided to investors., The SECâs complaint also alleges that Morriss concocted a scheme to recruit new investors to purchase membership interests in one of his private investment funds without the unanimous consent of existing investors, as required. This diluted the investments of the fundâs existing investors., On January 17, 2012, the Honorable Carol E. Jackson granted the SECâs request for asset freezes, the appointment of a receiver over the entity defendants, and other emergency relief to prevent further dissipation of investor assets. The SEC seeks permanent injunctive relief and financial penalties against Morriss and the entity defendants, as well as disgorgement of all ill-gotten gains from them and the relief defendant Morriss Holdings, LLC. The SEC also seeks an officer-and-director bar against Morriss. In addition, the SECâs action names Morriss Holdings, LLC as a relief defendant., The SECâs complaint charges:,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22228.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"
22230,2012,"[<h3>SEC Charges Seven Fund Managers and Analysts In Insider Trading Scheme, and Also Charges Hedge Fund Firms Diamondback Capital and Level Global</h3>]","[On January 18, 2012, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York charging two multi-billion dollar hedge fund advisory firms as well as seven fund managers and analysts involved in a $78 million insider trading scheme based on nonpublic information about Dell’s quarterly earnings and other similar inside information about Nvidia Corporation.  , The charges stem from the SEC’s ongoing investigation into the trading activities of hedge funds.  The U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the same seven individuals., The SEC alleges that a network of closely associated hedge fund traders at Stamford, Conn.-based Diamondback Capital Management LLC and Greenwich, Conn.-based Level Global Investors LP illegally obtained the material nonpublic information about Dell and Nvidia.  Investment analyst Sandeep “Sandy” Goyal of Princeton, N.J., obtained Dell quarterly earnings information and other performance data from an insider at Dell in advance of earnings announcements in 2008.  Goyal tipped Diamondback analyst Jesse Tortora of Pembroke Pines, Fla., with the inside information, and Tortora in turn tipped several others, leading to insider trades on behalf of Diamondback and Level Global hedge funds., According to the SEC’s complaint, the illicit gains in the Dell insider trades exceeded $62.3 million, and the illicit gains in the Nvidia insider trades exceeded $15.7 million.  For his role in the scheme, Goyal was paid $175,000 in soft dollar payments that were deposited in a brokerage account of an individual affiliated with him., The SEC alleges that after obtaining the inside information from Goyal in advance of Dell’s first and second quarter earnings announcements in 2008, Tortora tipped his portfolio manager at Diamondback, Todd Newman of Needham, Mass.  Newman traded on the information on behalf of the Diamondback hedge funds he controlled.  Tortora also tipped Spyridon “Sam” Adondakis, an analyst at Level Global.  Adondakis tipped his manager Anthony Chiasson, who then traded on the inside information on behalf of Level Global hedge funds.  During this time period, both Adondakis and Chiasson lived in New York City., According to the SEC’s complaint, Tortora also tipped two others at firms other than Diamondback or Level Global with the Dell inside information: Jon Horvath of New York City and Danny Kuo of San Marino, Calif.  Horvath caused insider trades at his firm that resulted in approximately $1.4 million of illicit gains.  Kuo similarly caused the firm where he worked to execute profitable insider trades in Dell securities.  , The SEC further alleges that Kuo also obtained inside information about Nvidia Corporation’s calculation of its revenues, gross profit margins, and other financial metrics in advance of the company’s first quarter 2010 earnings announcements, which was made in May 2009.  Kuo again caused his firm to trade on inside information.  Kuo’s insider trades in Dell and Nvidia resulted in approximately $270,000 in ill-gotten gains.  Kuo also tipped Tortora at Diamondback and Adondakis at Level Global with the nonpublic information about Nvidia.  Tortora again tipped Newman, who made more insider trades on behalf of the Diamondback hedge funds.  The illegal trades in Dell and Nvidia securities resulted in $3.9 million in illicit gains for Diamondback.  At Level Global, Adondakis tipped Chiasson who made the insider trades on behalf of those hedge funds.  Chiasson’s insider trades in Dell and Nvidia resulted in approximately $72.6 million of illicit gains for the Level Global hedge funds., The SEC’s complaint charges each of the defendants with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and, additionally, charges Goyal, Tortora, Newman, Adondakis, Chiasson, Horvath and Kuo with aiding and abetting others’ violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC’s complaint seeks a final judgment ordering the defendants to disgorge their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, ordering them to pay financial penalties, and permanently enjoining them from future violations of these provisions of the federal securities laws.,  ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22230.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The judgment also orders relief defendants DASH Development, LLC, Aron Holdings, Inc., PermaPave Construction Corp., Dymoncrete Industries, LLC, Dymon Rock LI, LLC, and Lumi-Coat, Inc. to disgorge the ill-gotten gains they received from defendants., This judgment resolves the Commission’s claims and grants all relief sought against the PermaPave Entities, Interlink, DASH, Aron Holdings, PermaPave Construction, Dymoncrete Industries, Dymon Rock, and Lumi-Coat in a civil action filed on October 6, 2011.  , The Commission’s Complaint alleged that, from 2006 to 2010, the PermaPave Entities raised more than $26 million from the sale of promissory notes and “use of funds” agreements to over 140 investors.  Their management told investors that there was a tremendous demand for the product that the PermaPave Entities ostensibly sold – permeable paving stones – and that investors would be repaid by the profits generated by the guaranteed sales of this product.  In reality, however, there was little demand for the product, and defendants used investor proceeds to make “interest” and “profit” payments to earlier investors and to fund management’s lavish lifestyles.  The management of the PermaPave Entities also caused Interlink to issue a Form 8-K stating that a company that had never heard of Interlink had agreed to invest $6 million in Interlink., The judgment (i) permanently enjoins the PermaPave Entities from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, (ii) permanently enjoins Interlink from future violations of Sections 10(b) and 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, and 13a-11, (iii) orders the PermaPave Entities to pay $7,734,983 in disgorgement, $281,268 in prejudgment interest, and $7.7 million in civil penalties, (iv) orders Interlink to pay $375,000 in civil penalties, and (v) orders relief defendants DASH, Aron Holdings, PermaPave Construction, Dymoncrete Industries, Dymon Rock, and Lumi-Coat to disgorge ill-gotten gains received from defendants totaling $4,236,252 and prejudgment interest totaling $214,233., The Commission’s civil action continues against Defendants Eric Aronson, Vincent Buonauro, Robert Kondratick, Fredric Aaron, and Permeable Solutions, Inc. and Relief Defendants Caroline Aronson and Deborah Buonauro., For further information, see <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr22117.htm>Litigation Release No. 22117</a> (Oct. 6, 2011).<a name=P20_4068></a>,  ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22231.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Gonski purchased Oak Hill stock in his account and another account and made approximately $35,500 in illicit profits.  In addition, Gonski tipped his friend Joseph Mroz, and the two men together made approximately $15,099 from illegal trading in Oak Hill stock., The case was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio.

Over the next several weeks, Shafer continued to provide material, nonpublic information about the merger to Gonski and during this time period, Gonski substantially increased his position in Oak Hill.  Gonski also tipped his friend Mroz, and they both bought shares of Oak Hill using Mroz’s brokerage account.

According to the SECâs complaint, at various times from December 2008 to May 2010 First Resource and Stern, and telemarketers they employed, fraudulently solicited brokers to purchase stock in TrinityCare Senior Living, Inc. and Cytta Corporation. The complaint alleges that while First Resource and Stern were recommending the purchase of the securities of the two microcap companies, Stern sold First Resourceâs shares of TrinityCare and Cytta unbeknownst to the investors who were purchasing the stocks, a practice known as scalping. Further, the complaint alleges that while Stern was selling the stocks, he was also purchasing small amounts of the stocks in order to create the false appearance of legitimate trading activity to induce the investors to purchase shares in both companies. The SEC also alleges that Stern and First Resource acted as unregistered broker-dealers., The SECâs complaint, which was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, charges First Resource Group and Stern with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

22241,2012,"[<h3>FORMER OFFICERS AND ACCOUNTANTS AT BRITISH SUBSIDIARY OF SYMMETRY MEDICAL, INC. SETTLE FINANCIAL FRAUD CASE</h3>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced four enforcement actions arising from an alleged financial fraud spanning several years at a British subsidiary of the NYSE-listed Symmetry Medical, Inc. (âSymmetryâ)., First, the Commission announced today that it has filed and, subject to Court approval, simultaneously settled charges against Richard J. Senior, Matthew Bell, Lynne Norman and Shaun P. Whiteley arising from the alleged financial fraud. According to the Commissionâs Complaint, the fraud was orchestrated and carried out by senior executives and accounting staff of the Sheffield, England-based Symmetry Medical Sheffield LTD, f/k/a Thornton Precision Components, Limited (hereinafter âTPCâ), particularly by Senior, Bell, Norman and Whiteley, who were, respectively, Symmetryâs VP for European Operations, TPCâs Finance Director, TPCâs Controller and a TPC Management Accountant. According to the Complaint, the fraud involved the systematic understatement of expenses and overstatement of assets and revenues, and materially distorted the financial statements of the Indiana-headquartered Symmetry, into which TPCâs financials were consolidated, for a period running from Symmetryâs December 2004 initial public offering through its second fiscal quarter of 2007. The Complaint further alleges that during the fraud, Senior, Bell and Norman made false certifications as to the accuracy of the financial information reported to Symmetry by TPC, and lied to TPCâs outside auditors. Finally, the Complaint alleges that Senior and Bell sold Symmetry stock during the fraud, at prices each knew or recklessly disregarded were inflated by the fraud at TPC., According to the Complaint, by their conduct, Senior, Bell, Norman and Whiteley violated Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ) and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder, and aided and abetted Symmetryâs violation of Exchange Act Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B), and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder; Senior and Bell also violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933; and Senior, Bell and Norman also violated Exchange Act Rule 13b2-2. The four defendantsâ signed Consentsâwhich are subject to approval by the Courtâprovide that, without admitting or denying the Commissionâs allegations, defendants Senior, Bell and Norman would be barred from serving as an officer or director of any public company. (Additionally, Bell, Norman and Whiteley each consented to be permanently barred, in follow-on administrative proceedings, from appearing or practicing before the Commission as accountants.) The final judgment to which Bell consented further orders that he is liable for disgorgement of $136,209 together with $50,728 in prejudgment interest thereon, but, based on his sworn financial statements and supporting documentation, waives payment of disgorgement and prejudgment interest; and the judgment to which Senior consented defers resolution of the monetary portion of his case pending the completion of asset discovery, with which Senior would be ordered to cooperate. Each defendant would also be permanently enjoined against future violations of the statutes and rules each is alleged to have violated., The Commission also announced that it has filed, and, subject to Court approval, simultaneously settled, a civil action against Symmetryâs former CEO, Brian S. Moore, seeking reimbursement for bonuses and other incentive-based and equity-based compensation pursuant Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Commissionâs Complaint alleges that Symmetry was required to restate its annual financial statements for 2005 and 2006, as well as other reporting periods, as a result of misconduct in the reporting of TPCâs financials. The Complaint further alleges that Moore received from Symmetry bonuses and incentive-based and equity-based compensation, and realized profits from the sale of Symmetry stock, during the 12-month periods following the restated financials, but has made no reimbursement thereof. The Complaint does not allege that Moore engaged in the fraud. Mooreâs signed Consentâwhich is subject to approval by the Courtâprovides that, without admitting or denying the Commissionâs allegations, Moore would agree to issuance of a Final Judgment ordering him make reimbursement of $450,000 to Symmetry., The Commission further announced that, separately, it has instituted and simultaneously settled administrative proceedings against two Associate Chartered Accountants in the United Kingdom, Christopher J. Kelly and Margaret Hebb nÃ©e Whyte, who were the former audit partner and audit manager, respectively, on Ernst &amp; Young UK LLPâs audits of TPC for the 2004 through 2006 fiscal years (in the case of Kelly) and for the 2005 and 2006 fiscal years (in the case of Hebb). Kelly and Hebb consented to issuance of the Commissionâs Order and the sanctions it imposed, without admitting or denying the Orderâs findings. The Order found that both Kelly and Hebb engaged in improper professional conduct by, among other things, failing to properly audit TPCâs accounts receivable balances and inventory. Based on these findings, the Order suspended both Kelly and Hebb from appearing or practicing before the Commission as accountants, with the opportunity to seek reinstatement after two years. See <i>Matter of Christopher J. Kelly, ACA and Margaret Hebb, ACA</i>, Admin. Proc. File No. 3-____ (Jan. 30, 2012), Finally, the Commission further announced that, separately, it has instituted and simultaneously settled administrative proceedings against Symmetry and its CFO, Fred L. Hite. Symmetry and Hite consented to issuance of the Commissionâs Order and the sanctions it imposed, without admitting or denying the Orderâs findings. With respect to Symmetry, the Order found that, as a result of the fraud at TPC, Symmetry (i) filed periodic reports with the Commission that included materially false and misleading financial statements in violation of Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 and (ii) maintained materially inaccurate books, records and accounts in violation of Exchange Act Section 13(b)(2)(a); and that Symmetry also failed to devise and maintain effective internal accounting controls in violation of Exchange Act Section 13(b)(2)(B). With respect to Hite, the Order found that by failing to provide an internal audit status report concerning TPC to Symmetryâs Audit Committee in July 2006, Hite violated Exchange Act Section 13(b)(5) and was a cause of Symmetryâs violation of Exchange Act Section 13(b)(2)(B); and that by failing to reimburse Symmetry for bonuses, incentive- and equity-based compensation, and Symmetry stock-sale proceeds he received during periods embraced by Symmetryâs restatement, Hite violated Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Based on the foregoing findings, the Commission ordered Symmetry and Hite to cease-and-desist from committing or causing future violations of the relevant provisions, and ordered Hite to pay a $25,000 penalty and make reimbursement of $185,000 to Symmetry.

Malarz Equity Investments, LLC (âMalarz Equityâ) was the primary entity through which the scheme was perpetrated. Gloria Lin was a member of Malarz Equity, and Lin was an officer of Malarz Equity. The complaint alleges, among other things, that investors were told that their funds would be used to purchase apartment complexes and rehabilitate and convert the individual apartment units for sale as condominiums. The complaint alleges that contrary to these representations, Malarz used substantial sums of the Malarz Equity investorsâ funds for his personal benefit and to make ponzi-type âinterestâ and principal payments to previous investors.

In addition, on January 12, 2012, Judge Susan R. Bolton of the United States District Court for the District of Arizona entered a default judgment against Thomas Chow, formerly the Chief Procurement Officer and a Director of Syntax. The Court permanently enjoined Chow from future violations of the antifraud, reporting, books and records, internal controls, and misrepresentation to auditor provisions of the federal securities laws, and ordered him to pay disgorgement of $10,370,317.16, prejudgment interest of $2,567,483.64, an insider trading penalty of $30,849,951.48, and a civil penalty of $4,680,000.00 for his role in the financial fraud scheme. Chow was also permanently barred from serving as an officer or director of a publicly traded company., As alleged in the SECâs Complaint against Chow, from at least June 2006 through April 2008, Chow and other members of Syntaxâs senior management engaged in a complex scheme to overstate Syntaxâs revenues and earnings and artificially inflate its stock price. As a result, Syntax reported false and misleading financial statements beginning in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, through the fiscal first quarter ended September 30, 2007. The scheme included the creation of fictitious sales and shipping documents and coordinating the circular transfer of funds among and between Syntax, its primary manufacturer in Taiwan, and its purported distributor in Hong Kong., In its Complaint against Chiu, the SEC alleged that he served as an audit and relationship partner for Syntaxâs outside auditor. Specifically, the SEC alleged that Chiu instructed Syntax executives on how to create a backdated distribution agreement to assist them in improperly recognizing revenue in Syntaxâs fourth quarter ended June 30, 2006. Additionally, the SEC alleged that after his firm was replaced as Syntaxâs auditor, Chiu participated in an engagement for Syntaxâs purported distributor, where he learned that it was treating the Syntax sales as agency sales. This treatment was in contrast to Syntaxâs treatment of the same sales. Despite his knowledge, Chiu failed to object to his accounting firmâs issuance of multiple consents to the reissuance of its audit opinion to Syntaxâs Form 10-K for fiscal year 2007., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SECâs complaint, Chiu consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 10(b), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder.

Todd, then Gatewayâs CFO, caused Gateway to recognize an additional $21 million in revenue from an incomplete sale of computers to a second entity, also in violation of GAAP.

22247,2012,[<h3>SEC Charges Former Credit Suisse Investment Bankers in Subprime Bond Pricing Scheme</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced a civil action against four former veteran investment bankers at Credit Suisse Group for engaging in a complex scheme to fraudulently overstate the prices of $3 billion in subprime bonds during the height of the subprime credit crisis., According to the SEC’s complaint, Credit Suisse’s former global head of structured credit trading Kareem Serageldin and former head of hedge trading David Higgs along with two mortgage bond traders deliberately ignored specific market information showing a sharp decline in the price of subprime bonds under the control of their group.  They instead priced them in a way that allowed Credit Suisse to achieve fictional profits.  Serageldin and Higgs periodically directed the traders, Faisal Siddiqui and Salmaan Siddiqui, to change the bond prices in order to hit profit targets, cover up losses in other trading books, and send a message to senior management about their group’s profitability. , According to the SEC’s complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Serageldin oversaw a substantial portion of Credit Suisse’s structured products and mortgage-related businesses.  Faisal Siddiqui and Salmaan Siddiqui, who are not related, reported to Higgs and Serageldin.  As the subprime credit crisis worsened in late 2007 and 2008, Serageldin frequently communicated to Higgs the specific profit &amp; loss (P&amp;L) outcome he wanted.  Higgs in turn directed Faisal Siddiqui or Salmaan Siddiqui to mark the book in a manner that would achieve the desired P&amp;L.   However, under the relevant accounting principles and Credit Suisse policy, the group was required to record the prices of these bonds to accurately reflect their fair value.  Proper pricing would have reflected that Credit Suisse was incurring significant losses as the subprime market collapsed., The SEC’s complaint alleges that the scheme reached its peak at the end of 2007, when the group recorded falsely overstated year-end prices for the subprime bonds.  Despite acknowledging that the subprime bonds were mispriced, Serageldin approved his group’s year-end results without making any effort to correct the prices.  When the mispricing was eventually detected in February 2008, Credit Suisse disclosed billions of dollars in additional subprime-related losses related to the investment bankers’ misconduct., The SEC’s complaint alleges that Serageldin, Higgs, Faisal Siddiqui, and Salmaan Siddiqui violated Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder, and aided and abetted pursuant to Section 20(e) of the Exchange Act violations of Sections 10(b) and 13(a) and 13(b)(2) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 12b-20 and 13a-16 thereunder., The SECs investigation was conducted by Staff Accountant Kenneth Gottlieb, Senior Counsel Kristine Zaleskas, Senior Specialized Examiner Michael Fioribello, Assistant Regional Director Michael Paley, and Assistant Regional Director Michael Osnato, Jr. in the SEC’s New York Regional Office.

Therrien, Former CEO of Brooks Automation</h3>]","[The Commission announced that on February 1, 2012, the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts entered a final judgment by consent against Robert J. Therrien of Boston, Massachusetts, a defendant in a civil injunctive action filed by the Commission in July 2007.  The Commission alleged in its complaint that Therrien, the former CEO of Massachusetts-based Brooks Automation, Inc. (“Brooks”) engaged in a scheme to falsify company records to create the false appearance that certain options granted below the then-current market price actually had been granted at the then-current market price on an earlier date.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions Complaint, Therrien consented to the entry of a final judgment enjoining him from violating the antifraud, books and records, and other provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering him to disgorge $728,269, representing profits gained, and the proceeds of the sale of 150,000 shares of Brooks stock and to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, and barring him from serving as an officer or director of a public company., The Commissions Complaint, filed July 26, 2007, alleged that, Therrien, in or about November 1999, created and signed false documents resulting in the issuance of the options to himself, which he immediately exercised, to purchase 225,000 shares of Brooks’ common stock.  The Commission further alleged that Therrien signed these false documents after learning that his options to purchase the shares had expired unexercised a few months earlier in or about August 1999.  According to the Complaint, the documents Therrien signed falsely indicated that he had actually exercised his option before it expired.  As a result, according to the Complaint, Therrien received undisclosed compensation from Brooks, and Brooks failed to report this compensation in its Commission filings. , The final judgment imposed a permanent injunction prohibiting Therrien from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b), 13(b)(5), 14(a), and 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, 13b2-1, 13b2-2, 14a-9, and 16a-3 thereunder and aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder; ordering him to pay $728,269 in disgorgement and to pay to Brooks the proceeds of the sale of 150,000 shares of Brooks stock; ordering him to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $100,000; and barring him from acting as an officer or director of a public company. , The Commission filed a settled enforcement action against Brooks in May 2008 concerning Therrien’s conduct and other issues.<br/>For further information, see Lit.

Barriger, Monticello, New York Investment Adviser, is Permanently Enjoined and Barred from the Securities Industry</h3>]","[On December 14, 2011, the Honorable Cathy Seibel, United States District Judge for the Southern District of New York, entered a judgment permanently enjoining Lloyd V. Barriger from violating the registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The judgment further orders Barriger to disgorge ill-gotten gains, together with prejudgment interest, and pay a civil penalty, but defers the Court’s determination of the amount of disgorgement and penalty to be paid until a later date, pending a motion by the Commission.  Barriger consented to entry of the judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission’s complaint., In a related administrative proceeding, on January 11, 2012, the Commission issued an Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Section 203(f) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (Order) against Barriger.  The Order bars Barriger from association with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, transfer agent, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization, and from participating in any offering of a penny stock.  <i>Lloyd V. Barriger</i>, Exchange Act Release No. 66142 (January 11, 2012).  Barriger consented to the issuance of the Order without admitting or denying any of the findings except he admitted to the entry of the final judgment., The Commission’s complaint, filed on May 13, 2011 in federal court in White Plains, New York, charged Barriger with fraud in connection with two upstate New York real estate funds he managed — the Gaffken &amp; Barriger Fund, LLC (the G&amp;B Fund or the Fund), and Campus Capital Corp. (Campus).  The complaint alleged that from at least July 2006 until March 5, 2008, when he froze the Fund and disclosed to investors its true financial condition, Barriger defrauded investors and prospective investors in the G&amp;B Fund by misrepresenting that the Fund was a relatively safe and liquid investment that paid a minimum “Preferred Return” of 8% per year.  The complaint further alleges that Barriger made these misrepresentations knowing, or recklessly disregarding, that the Fund’s actual performance did not justify these performance claims, and without disclosing information about the Fund’s true performance and financial condition — which rapidly deteriorated in 2007 and early 2008 as Barriger continued to raise money from new and existing investors.   , The Commission’s complaint also alleged that Barriger defrauded the G&amp;B Fund itself by (a) allocating the Preferred Return to investors when the Fund did not have sufficient income to justify the allocation; and (b) by, when the Fund lacked the income to support those allocations and payments, causing the Fund to pay cash distributions of the Preferred Returns to those Fund investors who requested them, and to redeem investors at values reflecting the purportedly accrued 8% per year Preferred Return., Finally, the complaint alleged that Barriger defrauded Campus and its prospective investors by (1) causing Campus to inject a total of nearly $2.5 million into the G&amp;B Fund between August 2007 and April 2008 at a time when the G&amp;B Fund was in distress; (2) by raising money for Campus without disclosing to investors his use of Campus’s assets to prop up the ailing G&amp;B Fund; and (3) by causing Campus to engage in other transactions that personally benefitted Barriger, without disclosing that to prospective Campus investors.  , The complaint alleged that, as a result of the foregoing, Barriger violated Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940).  The judgment entered on December 14th permanently enjoins Barriger from violating those provisions. , Barriger has also been criminally charged in connection with the conduct alleged in the Commission’s complaint. <i>United States v.

The SECâs complaint alleges that Michaud, DâAmaro, and Riviello each participated in market manipulation schemes with Defendant Pawel P. Dynkowski.  , As alleged in the complaint, the schemes generally followed the same pattern:  Dynkowski and his accomplices agreed to sell large blocks of shares for penny stock companies in exchange for a portion of the proceeds.  The shares were put in nominee accounts that Dynkowski and his accomplices controlled.  The defendants artificially inflated the market price of the stocks through manipulative trading, often timed to coincide with false or misleading press releases, and then sold shares obtained from the issuers and divided the illicit proceeds.  , The complaint alleges that in 2006, Dynkowski, Riviello, Michaud and others participated in a manipulation scheme involving the stock of Asia Global Holdings, Inc., which generated over $4 million in illicit profits.  As alleged in the complaint, Dynkowski and Michaud manipulated the price of Asia Global Holdings, Inc. stock using wash sales, matched orders, and other manipulative trading, while Riviello used his position as a registered representative at a broker-dealer to open a series of nominee accounts and execute sell orders for shares obtained from the issuer.  The complaint further alleges that Riviello helped launder proceeds from a separate manipulation scheme involving the stock of GH3 International, Inc.  , That same year, the complaint alleges, Dynkowski, DâAmaro and others participated in a manipulation scheme involving the stock of Playstar Corp., which generated over $1 million in illicit profits.

22257,2012,[<h3>SEC Charges California Hedge Fund Manager Connected to Galleon Insider Trading Case</h3>],"[On February 10, 2012, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York charging a hedge fund manager and his Menlo Park, Calif.-based firm for their involvement in the insider trading ring connected to Raj Rajaratnam and hedge fund advisory firm Galleon Management., The SEC alleges that Douglas F. Whitman and Whitman Capital illegally traded based on material nonpublic information obtained from Rajaratnam associate Roomy Khan, who was Whitman’s friend and neighbor.  Khan tipped Whitman with confidential details about Polycom Inc.’s fourth quarter 2005 earnings and Google Inc.’s second quarter 2007 earnings prior to the public announcements of those financial results by the companies.  Whitman Capital reaped nearly $1 million in ill-gotten gains by trading on Khan’s illegal tips.  , According to the SEC’s complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, the inside information about Polycom and Google used by Whitman is the same information that the SEC has previously alleged Khan provided to many of her hedge fund contacts, including Rajaratnam as well as Robert Feinblatt and Jeffrey Yokuty at Trivium Capital., The SEC alleges that Khan illegally tipped Whitman in January 2006 with information about Polycom’s quarterly financial results, and she noted that these details were nonpublic and acquired from a source at Polycom.  Whitman Capital accumulated 132,263 shares of Polycom stock in the next two weeks.  When the company announced its results on January 25, Whitman Capital liquidated its entire Polycom position for a profit of more than $360,000.  On at least one later occasion, in September 2008, Whitman asked Khan to contact her Polycom source to obtain inside information about the company’s upcoming earnings so the two could “short it.”  When Khan rebuffed Whitman citing a fear of getting caught, Whitman suggested that she use “Skype” to avoid detection.  Whitman later stated that he would stop speaking to Khan if she wasn’t going to be a “slimeball” anymore., The SEC further alleges that Khan illegally tipped Whitman with inside information about Google’s quarterly financial results shortly before the company’s post market-close earnings announcement on July 19, 2007.  At Whitman’s insistence, Khan identified her Google source as an employee of an investor relations firm used by Google.  Whitman Capital funds then purchased 2,761 Google put option contracts based on the tip from Khan.  On July 20, Whitman Capital closed the put option positions and generated ill-gotten profits of more than $620,000.  Afterwards, Whitman sent Khan a large floral arrangement to thank her for the tip., The SEC’s complaint charges Whitman and Whitman Capital with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.  The complaint seeks a final judgment permanently enjoining the defendants from future violations of the above provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to disgorge their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and ordering them to pay financial penalties.  , The SEC has charged 30 defendants in its Galleon-related enforcement actions, which have exposed widespread and repeated insider trading at numerous hedge funds and by other traders, investment professionals, and corporate insiders located throughout the country.  The insider trading occurred in the securities of more than 15 companies for illicit profits totaling more than $91 million. ,  ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22257.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

In its complaint, the Commission alleged that Eschbach misappropriated over $3 million in investment advisory client funds from 2003 through 2009., The Commissionâs complaint alleges that Eschbach violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933(Securities Act), Sections 10(b) and 15(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers Act) and seeks a permanent injunction against future violations of those provisions, disgorgement of her ill-gotten gains, with prejudgment interest thereon, and a civil money penalty., The complaint alleges that Eschbach began to misappropriate client funds while operating a franchise of a large investment adviser and broker-dealer and that the theft of client funds continued after Eschbach founded Aventine Investment Services, Inc., a now-defunct California corporation.

Burns (âBurnsâ), a defendant in an action filed by the Commission in January 2011.  The Commission alleged in its complaint that from 2003 to 2008, Burns, the former Chairman of the Board of Directors of CytoCore, Inc. (âCytoCoreâ), employed fraudulent schemes to profit from CytoCore stock transactions and received hundreds of thousands of dollars in improper compensation and benefits from CytoCore as an unregistered broker.  According to the complaint, in February 2008, Burns caused CytoCore to issue a press release touting Burnsâ investment in CytoCore stock, and then secretly sold shares immediately following the announcement.  According to the complaint, Burnsâ secret selling also constituted insider trading because Burns was in possession of material, nonpublic information about an ongoing CytoCore private stock offering.  , The complaint further alleged that, from 2003 to 2008, Burns improperly received transaction-based compensation as an unregistered broker soliciting investors in CytoCore stock.  The complaint also alleged that Burns submitted false claims for commissions purportedly earned by a friend for soliciting CytoCore investors, and his friend, in turn, remitted those commission payments to Burns.  The Complaint also alleged that Burns submitted to CytoCore false claims for expense reimbursements relating to his investor solicitations.  The complaint further alleged that Burns violated insider reporting requirements.  , The Courtâs final judgment enjoins Burns from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b), 14(a), 15(a), and 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 14a-9, and 16a-3 thereunder, orders him to pay disgorgement in the amount of $804,100.00, plus prejudgment interest of $324,325.00, for a total amount of $1,128,425.00, and permanently bars him from acting as an officer or director of a public company., For further information, please see Litigation Release Number 21811 (January 13, 2011).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22260.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

In a parallel criminal case, Kinnucan has been arrested and charged with one count of securities fraud and one count of wire fraud., The SEC has charged 22 defendants in enforcement actions arising out of its expert networks investigation, which has uncovered widespread insider trading at several hedge funds and other investment advisory firms. The insider trading has occurred in the securities of 12 technology companies — including Apple, Dell, Fairchild Semiconductor, Marvell Technology, and Western Digital — for illicit gains totaling nearly $110 million. , The SEC alleges that Kinnucan and Broadband claimed to be in the business of providing clients with legitimate research about publicly-traded technology companies, but instead typically tipped clients with material nonpublic information that Kinnucan obtained from prohibited sources inside the companies. Clients then traded on the inside information. Portfolio managers and analysts at prominent hedge funds and investment advisers paid Kinnucan and Broadband significant consulting fees for the information they provided. Kinnucan in turn compensated his sources with cash, meals, ski trips and other vacations, and even befriended some sources to gain access to confidential information. , According to the SEC’s complaint, Kinnucan’s misconduct occurred from at least 2009 to 2010, a period during which he generated hundreds of thousands of dollars in annual revenues for Broadband. Kinnucan obtained material nonpublic information from well-placed employees at a variety of publicly-traded technology companies., The SEC’s complaint specifically alleges that in July 2010, Kinnucan obtained material nonpublic information from a source at F5 Networks Inc., a Seattle-based provider of networking technology. On the morning of July 2, Kinnucan learned that F5 had generated better-than-expected financial results for the third quarter of its 2010 fiscal year, with the public announcement scheduled for July 21. Within hours of learning the confidential details, Kinnucan had phone conversations or left messages with several clients to convey that F5’s revenues would exceed market expectations. At least three clients — an analyst and two portfolio managers — caused trades at their respective investment advisory firms on the basis of Kinnucan’s inside information. The insider trading resulted in profits or avoided losses of nearly $1.6 million., The SEC’s complaint, which charges Kinnucan and Broadband with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, seeks a final judgment ordering them to disgorge their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, requiring them to pay financial penalties, and permanently enjoining them from future violations. ,  , , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22261.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Specifically, Judge Sweet found that Defendants PCM and Chester orchestrated a scheme to defraud mutual funds in the United States through late trading from February 2001 through September 2003.  Late trading refers to the practice of placing orders to buy, redeem, or exchange U.S. mutual fund shares after the time as of which the funds calculate their net asset value (usually as of the close of trading at 4:00 p.m. ET), but receiving the price based on the net asset value already determined as of 4:00 p.m. ET.  Judge Sweet found that the Defendants “intentionally, and egregiously violated the federal securities laws through a scheme of late trading” through broker-dealer Trautman Wasserman &amp; Company, Inc. (TW&amp;Co.), and found that the scheme was “broad ranging over the course of several years and in no sense isolated.”, As a result of Defendants’ conduct, the Court found that PCM and Chester violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and granted the Commission’s request to enjoin PCM and Chester from future violations of those provisions.  Judge Sweet further found PCM and Chester, together with Relief Defendant Pentagon Special Purpose Fund, Ltd., PCM’s advisory client, jointly and severally liable for disgorgement of $38,416,500 of profits from the U.S. mutual fund trades executed through TW&amp;Co. plus prejudgment interest.  Finally, Judge Sweet imposed civil penalties against Defendants in the amount of $38,416,500, equal to Defendants’ pecuniary gain for late trades through TW&amp;Co., The Court found in Defendants’ favor regarding charges of deceptive market timing of U.S. mutual funds., Chester, age 43, is a resident of London, England.

(“Puda”) and the former CEO of Puda with securities fraud for the undisclosed theft of the primary asset of the U.S. public company they controlled.  The Commission’s complaint alleges as follows:, Defendants Ming Zhao, the Chairman of Puda, and Liping Zhu, Puda’s former CEO, perpetrated a massive fraud on Puda’s public shareholders by effectively stealing and selling Puda’s operating subsidiary.  Before the defendants’ fraud, Puda held an indirect 90% ownership stake in Shanxi Puda Coal Group Co., Ltd (“Shanxi Coal”), a coal mining company located in the Shanxi Province of the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”).   In September 2009, just weeks before Puda announced that Shanxi Coal had received a highly lucrative mandate from the provincial government authorities to become a consolidator of smaller coal mining companies, Zhao, with Zhu’s knowledge and complicity, transferred Puda’s 90% stake in Shanxi Coal to himself.  In July 2010, Zhao transferred a 49% equity interest in Shanxi Coal to CITIC Trust Co. Ltd. (“CITIC Trust”), a Chinese private equity fund controlled by CITIC Group, which is reported to be the largest state-owned investment firm in the PRC.  CITIC Trust placed its 49% stake in Shanxi Coal in a trust and then sold interests in the trust to Chinese investors.  In addition, Zhao caused Shanxi Coal to pledge 51% of its assets to CITIC Trust as collateral for a loan of RMB 3.5 billion ($516 million) from the trust to Shanxi Coal.  In exchange, CITIC Trust gave Zhao 1.212 billion preferred shares in the trust.  None of these asset transfers were approved by Puda’s board or its shareholders or disclosed in Puda’s various SEC filings, which Zhao and Zhu signed knowing that those documents were materially false and misleading.  Puda also conducted two public offerings in 2010 in the U.S. without disclosing that it no longer had any ownership stake in the coal company, Puda’s sole source of revenue.  Thus, at the same time that CITIC Trust was effectively selling interests in the coal company to Chinese investors, Zhao and Zhu were still telling U.S. investors that Puda owned a 90% stake in that company., In addition, Zhao and Zhu continued their fraudulent scheme to deceive public investors even after the Commission began its investigation.  As part of the fraud, Zhu forged a letter purporting to be from CITIC Trust which falsely stated that no funds had actually been loaned to Shanxi Coal and disclaimed any interest in Puda’s or Shanxi Coal’s assets.  Zhao’s counsel then provided the forged letter to the Commission’s investigative staff and to Puda’s audit committee in an effort to create the false impression that Puda and its public shareholders had not been harmed by the asset transfers.  After Puda disclosed the letter to the public in an SEC filing, further misleading shareholders about the ownership of Puda’s assets, the letter was exposed as a forgery.  Zhu admitted forging the letter and resigned as CEO, but Zhao remains Chairman.  As a result of the defendants’ fraud, Puda is now little more than a shell company, with no ongoing business operations., Both Zhao and Zhu are charged in the Commission’s complaint with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b), 13(b)(5), and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, 13b2-2, 14a-3, and 14a-9a thereunder.  Both men are also alleged to be liable pursuant to Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act as control persons of Puda for Puda’s violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder, and that they are also liable pursuant to Section 20(e) of the Exchange Act for aiding and abetting those violations.  Zhu is also charged with violating Exchange Act Rule 13a-14.  Finally, the Commission alleges, in the alternative, that Zhao and Zhu are liable pursuant to Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act as control persons of Puda for Puda’s violations of Sections 10(b) and 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5(a), 10b-5(b), and 10b-5(c), 14a-3 and 14a-9, and that they are also liable pursuant to Section 20(e) of the Exchange Act for aiding and abetting those violations., The complaint seeks a final judgment permanently enjoining the defendants from committing future violations of these provisions, ordering them to disgorge their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, imposing financial penalties and barring them from acting as officers or directors of a public company.,  ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22264.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

In assessing the penalty, the Court found that the egregiousness of defendants’ behavior, the recurrent nature of the conduct, the lack of cooperation with authorities, defendants’ degree of scienter, and the risk of loss created by defendants’ actions all weighed in favor of imposing a substantial penalty.  , This case arises out of allegations by the Commission in a complaint filed on July 30, 2009, that defendant Bard, an investment adviser, and his solely-owned company Vision Specialist Group, LLC, had violated the federal securities laws through fraudulent misrepresentations regarding client investments, account performance and advisory fees, the creation of false client account statements, and forgery of client documents.

In addition to injunctive relief, the Court orders Magnum to pay disgorgement in the amount of $7,728,824, representing profits gained as a result of the conduct alleged in the Complaint, together with prejudgment interest in the amount of $233,543.01, and imposes a civil penalty in the amount of $725,000. Also, on December 8, 2011 and January 4, 2012 the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida entered judgments of permanent injunction and other relief, by consent, against defendants David Della Sciucca, Jr. and Dwight Flatt, respectively. The judgments enjoin Sciucca and Flatt from violations of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act.

The Complaint alleges Magnum issued stock pursuant to false Form S-8 registration statements, and used bogus consultants to funnel more than $7 million in illicit stock proceeds back into the company. The Complaint also alleges that in facilitating this kickback scheme, Magnum garnered the assistance of Flatt, Sciucca, and others, who liquidated Magnum S-8 stock, kept a portion of the sales proceeds, and then returned the remaining sales proceeds to Magnum under the guise of loan agreements. The Complaint further alleges that Magnum made false and misleading statements in its Form S-8 registration statements and in various press releases during the relevant time period., For additional information, see Litigation Release No. 21951 (April 29, 2011).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22268.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Goldsmith of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan accepted a guilty plea by Flint-area resident Gregory N. McKnight to one count of wire fraud for his role in orchestrating a $72 million Ponzi scheme involving at least 3,000 investors. For his crimes, McKnight faces a potential maximum penalty of 20 years in federal prison. His sentence will be determined at a future date. The U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Eastern District of Michigan filed criminal charges against McKnight on February 14, 2012., The criminal charges arose out of the same facts that were the subject of an emergency action that the Commission filed against McKnight and others on May 5, 2008. On that same day, the Court issued orders freezing McKnightâs assets and those of several companies he controlled, and appointed a Receiver. The Commissionâs complaint alleged that, from December 2005 through November 2007, McKnight, through his company Legisi Holdings, conducted a fraudulent, unregistered offering of securities in which he raised approximately $72 million from more than 3,000 investors in all 50 states and several foreign countries. According to the Commissions complaint, McKnight represented that he would invest the offering proceeds in various investment vehicles and pay interest of as much as 15 percent per month from the resulting profits. The complaint charged that McKnight invested less than half of the offering proceeds and that these investments resulted in millions of dollars in losses. The Commissions complaint further charged that McKnight used investor funds to make Ponzi payments to investors and for his own use. The Commissionâs complaint charged McKnight with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder., On July 6, 2011, the Court entered a final judgment against McKnight in the Commissionâs action, and ordered McKnight to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties totaling approximately $6.5 million. The court also issued orders permanently enjoining McKnight from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder., For additional information, see Litigation Release No. 20563 (May 8, 2008) and Litigation Release No. 20588 (May 20, 2008).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22269.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

On February 8, 2011, the SEC filed an Amended Complaint, charging a New York-based hedge fund and four hedge fund portfolio managers and analysts who illegally traded on confidential information obtained from technology company employees moonlighting as expert network consultants.  The scheme netted more than $30 million from trades based on material, nonpublic information about such companies as Advanced Micro Devices, Seagate Technology, Western Digital, Fairchild Semiconductor, and Marvell Technology Group.  The charges were the first against traders in the SECs ongoing investigation of insider trading involving expert networks. , The SEC alleged that from approximately 2008 through 2010, Pflaum, a former analyst at Barai Capital Management (“Barai Capital”), received material nonpublic information regarding several publicly traded securities and, along with co-defendant Samir Barai, caused Barai Capital to execute securities trades based on that information.  In December 2010, Pflaum pleaded guilty to conspiracy and securities fraud in a parallel criminal case, <i>United States v. Pflaum, </i>11 Cr. 01265 (JGK), arising from the same conduct.

The SEC further alleged that PGR’s hedge fund clients traded on the basis of the information Shimoon provided.  In July 2011, Shimoon pleaded guilty to conspiracy and securities fraud in a parallel criminal case, <i>United States v. Shimoon, </i>11 Cr. 00032 (JSR), arising from the same conduct.

Nowlin of the Western District of Texas, Austin Division, entered summary judgment against Austin residents Marleen Jantzen, a former assistant to an executive at Dell, Inc., and husband John Jantzen, a Commission-registered securities broker.  The Commission previously charged the Jantzens with insider trading in connection with a September 21, 2009 public announcement that Dell would acquire Perot Systems, Corp. in a tender offer transaction.  , The Court found that both Jantzens insider traded in violation of Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3(a) thereunder, and that Marleen Jantzen also violated Exchange Act Rule 14e-3(d).  The Court enjoined the Jantzens from future violations of those provisions and ordered them to pay disgorgement of $26,920.50, representing profits gained as a result of the illegal insider trading, plus prejudgment interest.  The Court deferred a final ruling on the Commission’s request for monetary penalties, pending submission of further briefing by the parties., In granting this relief, the Court specifically found that “Marleen tipped John and took unprecedented and persistent action to ensure that they were able to maximize their informational advantage.”  The Court also found that the evidence showed “a high degree of <i>scienter,</i> particularly with regard to John, who as a licensed securities broker certainly knew what he was doing.”  , The Commission’s complaint, filed on October 5, 2010, alleged that Marleen Jantzen learned through an internal Dell email material, nonpublic information regarding Dell’s impending tender offer for the shares of Perot Systems, Inc., and thereafter tipped her husband to the inside information.  The Court found that on September 18, 2009, the last trading day before the tender offer announcement, Marleen Jantzen made a highly unusual cash transfer to the couples’ joint brokerage account.  Within minutes of this transfer, John Jantzen bought Perot Systems call options and stock and Dell securities in the joint account—in total, purchasing 500 shares of Perot Systems common stock and 24 Perot Systems call option contracts.  , On September 21, 2009, Dell and Perot Systems jointly announced the tender offer for Perot Systems’ shares.  The stock price immediately rose from $17.91 to $29.56, or approximately 65% from the prior day’s closing price.  When John Jantzen cashed out that day, the couple reaped one-day trading profits of $26,920.50.  ,  ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22273.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Williams (“Williams”), 38, of Media, Pa., separately traded illegally in the securities of Hi-Shear Technology Corporation (“Hi-Shear”), a Torrance, Calif.-based manufacturer of products for the aerospace and defense industries.  After obtaining nonpublic information about Hi-Shear’s proposed acquisition by Chemring Group PLC (“Chemring”), Duncan and Williams each purchased Hi-Shear stock in breach of their duties to these companies before the public announcement of the sale on Sept. 16, 2009., Duncan and Williams each agreed to settle the Commission’s insider trading charges by paying $175,649 and $14,226.41 respectively., According to the Commission’s complaint against Duncan filed in federal court in Los Angeles, Hi-Shear sought quotes in late August 2009 for a “tail policy” from its longstanding insurance agent ISU-Olson Duncan Agency.  A tail policy provides ongoing insurance coverage for a company’s officers and directors for claims made after a company is sold.  Duncan is president of the insurance brokerage.  As Hi-Shear’s point of contact, he knew that Hi-Shear expected him to keep sensitive business information confidential and that he had a duty to avoid self-dealing.  However, Duncan traded on the basis of the confidential information concerning Hi-Shear’s need for a tail policy.  Duncan realized illicit profits of approximately $85,525 on the purchase and sale of 10,000 shares of Hi-Shear stock., According to the Commission’s separate complaint against Williams filed in federal court in Philadelphia, Williams obtained the confidential information about Chemring’s impending acquisition of Hi-Shear while working as a tax manager at Deloitte Tax LLP (“Deloitte”), which provided services to Chemring and its subsidiaries.  Williams assisted in the tax due diligence for the proposed transaction and was told that Hi-Shear was Chemring’s acquisition target.  Williams then traded on the basis of the confidential information and concealed his trades from Deloitte, which required its employees to pre-clear and report their trades.  Williams realized illicit profits of approximately $6,803.18 on the purchase and sale of 850 shares of Hi-Shear stock., Duncan and Williams each consented to the entry of final judgments without admitting or denying the allegations against them.  They agreed to pay disgorgement of their trading profits, prejudgment interest, and a penalty equal to the amount of their profits pursuant to Section 21A(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”).

The promissory notes overstated the amount of money diverted to the real estate project; for instance, in 2011, Callahan received $14.5 million in promissory notes in exchange for only $3.3 million he provided to his brother-in-law. The inflated promissory notes allowed Callahan to overstate the amount of assets he was managing, and inflate his management fees by 800% or more. , Callahan refused to testify in the SEC’s investigation and recently informed investors about the investigation, but gave false assurances that no laws had been broken.  Callahan also misled investors by not disclosing that in 2009, the Financial Regulatory Industry Authority barred him from associating with any FINRA member, the SEC alleged. , The SEC charges Callahan and his advisory firms with violating federal antifraud laws, specifically Sections 17(a)(1), (2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5(a), (b) and (c) thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.  The SEC is seeking preliminary and permanent injunctions against Callahan and his firms, return of ill-gotten gains, with interest, and civil penalties   , At the SEC’s request, and after a court hearing on March 5, 2012, the court granted a temporary restraining order freezing the assets of Callahan and his advisory firms, enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions and granting other emergency relief.   , The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the British Virgin Islands Financial Services Commission and the Bermuda Monetary Authority. <a name=P17_3228></a>,  ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22275.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The stock price jumped over 30 percent when the deal was announced publicly the following day, enabling Harrold to make an illicit $86,850 profit., Coca-Cola Enterprises is one of the world’s largest marketers, producers and distributors of Coca-Cola products, and its stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the stock symbol CCE.  The Coca-Cola Company (ticker symbol: KO) develops and sells its products and syrup concentrate to Coca-Cola Enterprises and other bottlers.  Coca-Cola Enterprises combines the concentrate with other ingredients to create and package the beverages, and then markets them to consumers. , According to the SEC’s complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, Harrold was regularly in possession of sensitive and confidential information as an executive at CCE.  On numerous occasions, Harrold signed non-disclosure agreements requiring him to keep confidential any information he learned about acquisitions being considered.  Harrold also periodically received blackout notices prohibiting him from trading in company stock for a defined period in which he was likely to be in possession of confidential information.  , The SEC alleges that Harrold, who lives in Los Angeles and London, was informed in early January 2010 that CCE was considering the acquisition of The Coca-Cola Company’s Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations.  He signed a non-disclosure agreement requiring him to maintain the confidentiality of any nonpublic information he learned about the potential transaction.  Harrold also received an e-mail from CCE’s legal counsel informing him that he was subject to a blackout period and was prohibited from trading in CCE stock “until further notice.”, Nevertheless, the SEC alleges that Harrold purchased 15,000 CCE shares in his wife’s brokerage account on Feb. 24, 2010, the day before the announcement of the transaction with The Coca-Cola Company.  The insider trading was based on certain confidential information that Harrold learned in the days leading up to the announcement, including that the transaction was internally valued at more than $800 million and was viewed as creating significant positive growth opportunities for CCE., The SEC’s complaint charges Harrold with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder.  The complaint seeks a final judgment ordering Harrold to pay a financial penalty and disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, preventing him from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and permanently enjoining him from future violations of those provisions of the federal securities laws., The SEC acknowledges the assistance of FINRA in this matter.,  ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22280.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Ellis, Sr. and Jennifer L. Seidel of Pottstown, Pennsylvania.  The Commission’s complaint alleges that Ellis and Seidel orchestrated a fraudulent, unregistered offering of Sederon, Inc. (“Sederon”) stock.  Sederon was a Collegeville, Pennsylvania, based company that provided home maintenance services to residential home owners.  Ellis and Seidel have agreed to settle the matter. The settlements are pending final approval by the court., The Commission’s complaint alleges that from at least August 2007 through October 2008, Ellis and Seidel raised approximately $519,500 from more than 50 investors by offering and selling Sederon stock through material misrepresentations and omissions.  According to the complaint, Ellis and Seidel made numerous misrepresentations to investors, including that Sederon was a highly profitable and rapidly expanding home maintenance company, and that Sederon would soon be launching an initial public offering (“IPO”) that would allow investors to be able to sell their shares in the open market at a profit of 900 to 1,300 percent.  In reality, Sederon never pursued an IPO, was never profitable, and often failed to generate enough revenue to meet payroll and other expenses.  The defendants also misled investors about the use of investor proceeds, and failed to disclose the fact that Ellis is a convicted felon and securities fraud recidivist. , Ellis and Seidel have each consented to the entry of an order permanently enjoining them from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The order will bar Ellis and Seidel from serving as an officer or director of a public reporting company.  Ellis and Seidel will also be ordered, jointly and severally, to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $569,575.  , The defendants each pled guilty to criminal charges of mail fraud and wire fraud in connection with the same conduct alleged in the Commission’s complaint.

(“Jamdat”), a software company that designed games for cell phones, would be acquired by Electronic Arts, Inc. (“Electronic Arts”). The final judgment permanently enjoins her from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay a $25,000 civil penalty. Kueng consented to the entry of the final judgment, without admitting or denying the allegations against her in the complaint. , The Commission’s civil complaint, filed in October 2009, alleged that Kueng, a former sales specialist at J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., in December 2005, had conveyed to a J.P. Morgan trader and two institutional customers, highly specific material, nonpublic information regarding Jamdat’s impending acquisition by Electronic Arts that she had received from a friend in the securities brokerage industry. The trader and the institutional customers invested in Jamdat stock on the basis of that information and realized profits totaling approximately $350,000. The Commission further asserted that given the specificity of the information Kueng had received, which included the price per share and the timing of the acquisition, she knew or should have known that the information had been obtained in breach of a duty to Jamdat. Also, in October 2009, the Commission filed a civil action in federal district court in Northern California charging four other defendants, including a Jamdat insider, with insider trading for tipping and/or trading on the basis of<strong></strong>material, nonpublic information regarding Jamdat. Those defendants settled the charges against them. , Kueng also has agreed to the issuance of an administrative order, based on the entry of the permanent injunction against her, barring her from association with a broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, transfer agent, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization, with a right to reapply for association in a non-supervisory capacity after ten years and barring her from participating in the offering of a penny stock, with the right to apply for re-entry after ten years. , For additional information, please see Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21249.htm>21249</a> (October 15, 2009). ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22284.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

(âThornburgâ), currently TMST, Inc., for allegedly materially misrepresenting the financial condition and liquidity of Thornburg, formerly the countryâs second largest independent mortgage company.  Goldstone, Simmons, and Starrett reside in Santa Fe, New Mexico.  , The Complaint alleges that Thornburg, through Goldstone, Simmons, and Starrett, fraudulently overstated its quarterly income by more than $420 million in its 2007 annual report filed with the Commission.  As a result, the Complaint alleges that Thornburg fraudulently reported a profit rather than a loss for the quarter.  According to the Complaint, in the two weeks leading to the filing of its annual report, Thornburg received more than $300 million in margin calls from its lenders that severely drained its liquidity.  The Complaint further alleges that, unable to meet its margin calls on a timely basis, Thornburg violated three of its lending agreements, and received a reservation of rights letter from one lender in which the lender reserved its right to declare Thornburg in default at any time.  Accordingly, the Complaint alleges that in the days before Thornburg filed its annual report, the collateral it used for its lending agreements, adjustable rate mortgage (âARMâ) securities, was subject to being seized and sold by its lenders.  According to the Complaint, given the circumstances of Thornburgâs liquidity crisis, circumstances that were misrepresented to, and concealed from, the companyâs auditor, Goldstone, Simmons, and Starrett each knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that Thornburg did not have the intent or ability to hold its ARM  securities until maturity or until their value recovered in the market.  The Complaint concludes that the individual defendants also knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that this meant Thornburg was required to recognize on its income statement approximately $428 million of losses associated with the companyâs ARM securities, and that the proper accounting treatment for these securities would have resulted in Thornburg reporting a loss rather than a profit for the quarter.  , The Complaint claims that, based on this conduct, the defendants violated or aided and abetted the violation of, or in the case of Goldstone and Simmons are liable as control persons under Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ) for Thornburgâs violation of, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder.  The Complaint also claims that Goldstone and Simmons violated Rule 13a-14 of the Exchange Act.  As part of this action, the Commission seeks against each of the defendants an injunction against future violations of the provisions set forth above, officer and director bars, and third tier civil money penalties.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22287.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The complaint alleges that McGee misappropriated the inside information from a PHLY senior executive who was confiding in him through their relationship at Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) about pressures he was confronting at work. McGee then purchased PHLY stock in advance of the merger announcement on July 23, 2008, and made a $292,128 profit when the stock price jumped 64 percent that day., The complaint further alleges that McGee tipped Michael Zirinsky, who purchased PHLY stock in his own trading account as well as those of his wife, sister, mother, and grandmother. Zirinsky tipped his father Robert Zirinsky and his friend Paulo Lam, who in turn tipped another friend whose wife Marianna sze wan Ho also traded on the nonpublic information.

Jackson along with James J. Ruehlen, who is the current Director and Division Manager of Nobleâs subsidiary in Nigeria, bribed customs officials to process false paperwork purporting to show the export and re-import of oil rigs, when in fact the rigs never moved. The scheme was designed to save Noble Corporation from losing business and incurring significant costs associated with exporting rigs from Nigeria and then re-importing them under new permits. Bribes were paid through a customs agent for Nobleâs Nigerian subsidiary with Jackson and Ruehlenâs approval., The SEC separately charged Thomas F. OâRourke, who was a former controller and head of internal audit at Noble. The SEC alleges that OâRourke helped approve the bribe payments and allowed the bribes to be booked improperly as legitimate operating expenses for the company. OâRourke agreed to settle the SECâs charges and pay a penalty., Noble Corporation <a href=/news/press/2010/2010-214.htm>was charged with FCPA violations as part of a sweep of the oil services industry in late 2010</a>. The company cooperated with investigators and agreed to pay more than $8 million to settle civil and criminal cases.   , According to the SECâs complaint against Jackson and Ruehlen filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, the executives who perpetrated the scheme worked at Noble and Nobleâs Nigerian subsidiary Noble Drilling (Nigeria) Ltd, whose rigs operated in Nigeria on the basis of temporary import permits granted by the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS). These temporary permits allowed the rigs to be in the country for a one-year period. NCS had the discretion to grant up to three extensions lasting six months each, after which the rigs were required to be exported and re-imported under a new temporary permit or be permanently imported with the payment of sizeable duties., The SEC alleges that Jackson and Ruehlen had a role in arranging, facilitating, approving, making, or concealing the bribe payments to induce Nigerian customs officials to grant new temporary permits illegally and favorably exercise or abuse their discretion to grant permit extensions. Together, Jackson and Ruehlen participated in paying hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes to obtain about 11 illicit permits and 29 permit extensions. Jackson approved the bribe payments and concealed the payments from Nobleâs audit committee and auditors. Ruehlen prepared false documents, sought approval for the bribes, and processed and paid the bribes., The SECâs complaint against Jackson and Ruehlen alleges they directly violated the anti-bribery provisions of Section 30A of the Securities Exchange Act and the internal controls and false records provisions of Section 13(b)(5) and Rule 13b2-1 of the Exchange Act. The complaint alleges that they aided and abetted Nobleâs violations of Section 30A and the books and records and internal controls provisions of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act. The complaint further alleges that Jackson directly violated Exchange Act Rule 13b2-2 by misleading auditors and Exchange Act Rule 13a-14 by signing false certifications of Nobleâs financial statements. He also is liable as a control person under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act for violations of the anti-bribery, books and records, and internal controls provisions by Noble, Ruehlen, and OâRourke., The SECâs complaint against OâRourke alleges that he aided and abetted Nobleâs violations of the anti-bribery, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the Exchange Act, and that he directly violated the internal controls and false records provisions of the Exchange Act. Without admitting or denying the SECâs allegations, OâRourke consented to entry of a court order requiring him to pay a $35,000 penalty and permanently enjoining him from further violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), 13(b)(5) and 30A of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22290.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Greenberg was the former Chief Executive Officer and majority owner of registered investment adviser Tactical Allocation Services LLC (TAS) and the founder and head portfolio manager for a registered investment adviser wholly-owned by TAS, Agile Group LLC (Agile Group). The Final Judgment also found that Greenberg was liable for disgorgement of $3,941,185, plus prejudgment interest, but based on his financial condition waived payment of all but $330,000 of that amount and, in addition, required Greenberg to surrender his interests in certain Agile Group hedge funds. The Final Judgment imposed no penalty based on Greenbergâs financial condition and prohibited Greenberg from seeking reimbursement for the money and fund interests he was disgorging. Greenberg paid the $330,000 and those funds were distributed to Agile investors under a Court approved equitable distribution plan., On January 31, 2012, the Commission moved for an order requiring Greenberg to pay the unpaid portion of his disgorgement, pre- and post-judgment interest thereon, and a maximum civil penalty, alleging that Greenbergâs statement of financial condition on which the Final Judgment was based was incomplete. The Order, to which Greenberg stipulated, finds Greenberg liable for disgorgement of $3,998,145, representing the unpaid portion of the amount ordered to be disgorged in the Final Judgment (original $4,328,145 judgment comprised of $3,941,185 in disgorgement and $386,960 in prejudgment interest, offset by the $330,000 Greenberg paid on January 24, 2011). It further orders Greenberg to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $3,941,185, and post-judgment interest through February 29, 2012 of $130,480.03. The Order further imposes a freeze on Greenbergâs assets., According to the SECâs original complaint in this matter, extensive losses were suffered by affiliated hedge funds managed and recommended by Greenberg, including the Agile Safety Fund, the Agile Safety Fund International, and the Agile Safety Variable Fund (collectively Agile hedge funds). The Agile hedge funds were marketed and managed by affiliated investment advisers Agile Group and TAS. The Commissionâs complaint alleged that Greenberg negligently misrepresented the safety, suitability, and diversification of the Agile hedge funds to TAS clients, in many cases conservative investors in or near retirement. Further, the complaint alleged that Greenberg made inadequate disclosure concerning advisory fees; failed to implement adequate compliance policies and procedures; failed to properly supervise his subordinate investment advisers; and failed to provide account statements and annual reports to his clients.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22291.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

However, Mazzola and his firms engaged in improper self-dealing – earning secret commissions above the 5 percent disclosed in offering materials on the funds’ acquisition of Facebook stock and on re-sales of fund interests to new investors.  The hidden charges essentially raised the prices paid by their investors for Facebook stock because it created a disincentive for Mazzola and his firms to negotiate a lower price for fund investors.  They also sold Facie Libre fund interests despite knowing the funds lacked ownership of certain Facebook shares.  , According to the SEC’s complaint filed in federal court in San Francisco, Mazzola and his firms also made false statements to investors in other funds they created to invest in various pre-IPO companies.  For instance, they misled one investor into believing a Felix fund had successfully acquired stock of Zynga.  They also made false representations about Twitter’s revenue to attract investors to their Twitter fund., The SEC’s lawsuit charges Mazzola, Felix Investments, and Facie Libre Management Associates with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder.  It also charges Mazzola and Facie Libre Management Associates with violating Section 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.  The Commission seeks court orders prohibiting them from engaging in securities fraud and requiring them to disgorge their ill-gotten gains and pay financial penalties., Separately, the Commission initiated a settled administrative proceeding against Laurence Albukerk and his company EB Financial Group LLC, for failing to disclose in their offering materials certain compensation they earned in connection with two Facebook funds they managed.  Without admitting or denying the SEC’s findings, Albukerk and EB Financial consented to entry of a SEC order finding that they violated Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Section 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.

SharesPost and Brogger consented to an SEC order finding that SharesPost committed and Brogger caused a violation of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act of 1934.

22294,2012,"[<h3>COURT ORDERS FORMER BROKER TO PAY OVER $500,000 FOR DEFRAUDING 9/11 WIDOW </h3>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that a federal judge in Massachusetts entered a final judgment on March 14, 2012 ordering defendant James J. Konaxis, formerly a registered representative of Beverly-based broker-dealer Sentinel Securities, Inc., to disgorge more than $483,000 in commissions earned over a two-year period by defrauding a former customer who was left widowed by the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.  Together with prejudgment interested and a civil penalty, Konaxis has been ordered to pay a total of $514,954.  In granting the Commission’s motion for monetary remedies, Judge Denise L. Casper found that Konaxis was liable in the amount of all commissions earned from three of the victim’s accounts over a two-year period because he “misled the victim into thinking her investments were safe, while churning (<u>e.g.</u>, excessively trading) her funds in a manner contrary to her interests[.]”   , According to the Commission’s complaint, Konaxis violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder by excessively trading his customer’s funds while knowingly or recklessly disregarding her interests.  During a two-year period, the Commission alleges that the value of his customer’s accounts (funded by payments made to the victim and her family by the September 11<sup>th</sup> Victim Compensation Fund) decreased from approximately $3.7 million to approximately $1.6 million, much of which was due to Konaxis’s investments and the resulting commissions paid to Konaxis.  , At the time the Commission’s complaint was filed, Konaxis entered into a partial settlement with the Commission, in which he consented to be enjoined from future violations of the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act and Exchange Act, and to be barred from participating in any offering of penny stock.  In addition, as part of the settlement, Konaxis agreed to be barred in related administrative proceedings from any future association with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, or transfer agent.  However, the Commission also filed a motion with the Court seeking disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus pre-judgment interest, and the imposition of a civil penalty, which Konaxis opposed., After a hearing on March 1, 2012, Judge Denise L. Casper issued an order granting the Commission’s motion for monetary remedies, including disgorgement in the full amount of Konaxis’ commissions earned over a two-year period from the three accounts churned, totaling $483,460.23, prejudgment interest in the amount of $31,494.44, and a civil penalty of $10,000, for a total of $514,954.  , The SEC acknowledges and appreciates the assistance of the Massachusetts Securities Division., For additional information, see <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr21897.htm>Litigation Release No. 21897</a> (Mar. 23, 2011).,  ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22279.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"
22296,2012,[<h3>SEC Charges Senior Executives at California-Based Firm in Stock Lending Scheme</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged two senior executives and their California-based firm with defrauding officers and directors at publicly-traded companies in an elaborate $8 million stock lending scheme., The SEC alleges that Argyll Investments LLC’s purported stock-collateralized loan business is merely a fraud perpetrated by James T. Miceli and Douglas A. McClain, Jr. to acquire publicly traded stock from corporate officers and directors at a discounted price from market value, separately sell the shares for full market value in order to fund the loan, and use the remaining proceeds from the sale of the collateral for their own personal benefit. Miceli, McClain, and Argyll typically lied to borrowers by explicitly telling them that their collateral would not be sold unless a default occurred. However, since Argyll had no independent source of funds other than the borrowers’ collateral, Argyll often sold the collateral prior to closing the loan and then used the proceeds to fund it., Also charged in the SEC’s complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California is a broker through which Argyll attracted potential borrowers. The SEC alleges that AmeriFund Capital Finance LLC and its owner Jeffrey Spanier violated the federal securities laws by brokering numerous transactions for Argyll while not registered with the SEC., The SEC alleges that Miceli and McClain induced at least nine corporate officers and directors since 2009 to transfer ownership of millions of shares of stock to Argyll as collateral for purported loans. Miceli and McClain promised to return the stock to the borrowers when the loans were repaid. However, rather than retaining the collateral shares as required, they sold the shares without the borrowers’ knowledge before or soon after funding the loans. In many cases, they used the proceeds from the collateral sales to fund the loans. Because Argyll typically loaned the borrowers 30 to 50 percent less than the current market value of the shares, the company retained substantial proceeds even after funding the loans. As a result of the scheme, Argyll reaped more than $8 million in unlawful gains that Miceli and McClain used in part toward their personal expenses., In addition to the fraud charges against Miceli, McClain, and Argyll, the SEC alleges that they violated the federal securities laws by improperly selling the collateral shares — all of which were restricted securities — into the public markets in unregistered transactions. They also failed to register with the SEC as brokers or dealers. , The SEC’s complaint alleges that Miceli, McClain, and Argyll violated Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933, and that Spanier and AmeriFund violated Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act. The SEC is seeking permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and financial penalties., The SEC’s investigation was conducted by Jacob D. Krawitz, Anthony S. Kelly, and Anik Shah, and supervised by Julie M. Riewe. The SEC’s litigation effort will be led by Dean Conway. , The SEC thanks the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of California and the Federal Bureau of Investigation for their assistance with this matter.,  ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22296.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

As alleged in the SEC’s amended complaint, filed on March 16, 2012, Defendant Thomas C. Hardin, a former managing director at Lanexa Management, engaged in insider trading on behalf of a Lanexa hedge fund ahead of the announced acquisition of 3Com Corp. in September 2007, resulting in more than $600,000 in illegal trading profits. ,  The SEC’s amended complaint alleged that Arthur Cutillo and Brien Santarlas, two former attorneys with the law firm of Ropes &amp; Gray LLP, misappropriated from their law firm material nonpublic information concerning the acquisition of 3Com, and tipped the inside information, through another attorney, to Zvi Goffer, a former proprietary trader at Schottenfeld Group LLC, in exchange for kickbacks. The SEC further alleged that Goffer tipped the inside information to, among others, Gautham Shankar, a fellow proprietary trader at Schottenfeld, who then tipped Hardin, a managing director at Lanexa. As alleged in the amended complaint, Hardin used the inside information to trade in the securities of 3Com on behalf of a Lanexa hedge fund. ,  To settle the SEC’s action, Lanexa agreed to a final judgment ordering it, as a relief defendant, to disgorge $612,190 in illicit trading profits, plus prejudgment interest of $134,607.

Murray provided MNT investors with a report purportedly prepared by independent auditor Jones, Moore &amp; Associates (JMA). However, JMA is not a legitimate accounting firm but rather a shell company that Murray secretly created and controlled. The phony audit report misstated the financial condition and performance of MNT to investors. , The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California also has filed criminal charges against Murray in a complaint unsealed yesterday., According to the SEC’s complaint filed in federal court in San Francisco, Murray began raising the funds from investors in 2008. The following year, MNT distributed the phony audit report to investors claiming the audit was conducted by a legitimate third-party accounting firm. However, JMA is not registered or licensed as an accounting firm in Delaware, where it purports to do business. JMA’s website was paid for by a Murray-controlled entity and listed 12 professionals with specific degrees and licenses who supposedly work for JMA. However, at least five of these professionals do not exist, including the two named principals of the firm: “Richard Jones” and “Joseph Moore.” Murray has attempted to open brokerage accounts in the name of JMA, identified himself as JMA’s chief financial officer, and called brokerage firms falsely claiming to be the principal identified on most JMA documents., The SEC alleges that the bogus audit report provided to investors understated the costs of MNT’s investments and thus overstated the fund’s investment gains by approximately 90 percent. The JMA audit report also overstated MNT’s income by approximately 35 percent, its member capital by approximately 18 percent, and its total assets by approximately 10 percent., The SEC’s complaint charges Murray with violating Section 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder, which prohibits fraud by investment advisers on investors in a pooled investment vehicle. The complaint seeks injunctive relief and financial penalties from Murray., The SEC’s investigation was conducted by Karen Kreuzkamp and Robert S.

According to the filing, the Commission is investigating possible fraud in connection with Wells Fargo’s sale of nearly $60 billion in residential mortgage-backed securities to investors.  Pursuant to subpoenas dating back to September 2011, the bank was obligated to produce (and agreed to produce) documents to the Commission, but has failed to do so. Accordingly, the Commission filed its Application for an Order Requiring Compliance with Administrative Subpoenas., The Commission’s action relates to its investigation into whether Wells Fargo made material misrepresentations or omitted material facts in a series of offerings between September 2006 and early 2008.  The Commission’s application explains that, in connection with the securitization of the loans, a due diligence review of a sample of the loans in each offering was performed.  Certain loans within that sample would be dropped from the offering for failure to comply with Wells Fargo’s loan underwriting standards.  However, according to the Commission, it does not appear that Wells Fargo took any steps to address similar deficiencies in the remainder of the loans in the pool, which were securitized and sold to investors.  The Commission is investigating, among other things, whether Wells Fargo misrepresented to investors that the loans being securitized complied with the bank’s loan underwriting standards.  , The staff in the Commission’s San Francisco Regional Office issued several subpoenas to Wells Fargo since September 2011 seeking, among other things, materials related to due diligence and to the bank’s underwriting guidelines.  According to the Commission, Wells Fargo agreed to produce the documents, and set forth a timetable for doing so, yet has failed to produce many of the materials.    , Pursuant to its Application, the Commission is seeking an order from the federal district court compelling Wells Fargo to comply with the Commission’s administrative subpoenas and to produce all responsive materials to the staff.

22306,2012,[<h3>SEC CHARGES MEDICAL DEVICE COMPANY BIOMET WITH FOREIGN BRIBERY</h3>],"[<i>Washington, D.C., March 26, 2012</i> — The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Warsaw, Ind.-based medical device company Biomet Inc. with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) when its subsidiaries and agents bribed public doctors in Argentina, Brazil, and China for nearly a decade to win business.  , Biomet, which primarily sells products used by orthopedic surgeons, agreed to pay more than $22 million to settle the SEC’s charges as well as parallel criminal charges announced by the U.S. Department of Justice today.  The charges arise from the SEC and DOJ’s ongoing proactive global investigation into medical device companies bribing publicly-employed physicians., The SEC alleges that Biomet and its four subsidiaries paid bribes from 2000 to August 2008, and employees and managers of all levels of the parent company and the subsidiaries were involved along with the distributors who sold Biomet’s products.  Biomet’s compliance and internal audit functions failed to stop the payments to doctors even after learning about the illegal practices., According to the SEC’s complaint filed in federal court in Washington D.C., employees of Biomet Argentina SA paid kickbacks as high as 15 to 20 percent of each sale to publicly-employed doctors in Argentina.  Phony invoices were used to justify the payments, and the bribes were falsely recorded as “consulting fees” or “commissions” in Biomet’s books and records.  Executives and internal auditors at Biomet’s Indiana headquarters were aware of the payments as early as 2000, but failed to stop it., The SEC alleges that Biomet’s U.S. subsidiary Biomet International used a distributor to bribe publicly-employed doctors in Brazil by paying them as much as 10 to 20 percent of the value of their medical device purchases. Payments were openly discussed in communications between the distributor, Biomet International employees, and Biomet’s executives and internal auditors in the U.S.  For example, a February 2002 internal Biomet memorandum about a limited audit of the distributor’s books stated:, <p class=em2><i>“Brazilian Distributor makes payments to surgeons that may be considered as a kickback. These payments are made in cash that allows the surgeon to receive income tax free. …The accounting entry is to increase a prepaid expense account. In the consolidated financials sent to Biomet, these payments were reclassified to expense in the income statement.” </i>, According to the SEC’s complaint, two additional subsidiaries — Biomet China and Scandimed AB — sold medical devices through a distributor in China who provided publicly-employed doctors with money and travel in exchange for their purchases of Biomet products.  Beginning as early as 2001, the distributor exchanged e-mails with Biomet employees that explicitly described the bribes he was arranging on the company’s behalf.  For example, one e-mail stated:, <p class=em2><i>“[Doctor] is the department head of [public hospital]. [Doctor] uses about 10 hips and knees a month and it’s on an uptrend, as he told us over dinner a week ago. …Many key surgeons in Shanghai are buddies of his. A kind word on Biomet from him goes a long way for us. Dinner has been set for the evening of the 24th. It will be nice. But dinner aside, I’ve got to send him to Switzerland to visit his daughter.”</i>, The SEC alleges that some e-mails described the way that vendors would deliver cash to surgeons upon completion of surgery, and others discussed the amount of payments.

According to the Complaint, Callahan raised more than $74 million from at least two dozen investors since 2005.  The Complaint alleges that Callahan promised investors that their money would be invested in liquid assets, but instead diverted investors’ money to his brother-in-law’s real estate project, which was facing foreclosure, in exchange for unsecured, illiquid, overstated promissory notes.  According to the Complaint, Callahan and his advisory firms used these promissory notes to hide Callahan’s misuse of investor funds, and the overstated promissory notes inflated Callahan’s management fees., At the SEC’s request, and after a Court hearing on March 27, 2012, the Court issued an Order preliminarily enjoining Callahan and his advisory firms with violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 17(a)(1), (2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5(a), (b) and (c) thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.

Sarkesian, a Swiss citizen and resident, and Quorne Ltd., a British Virgin Islands limited liability company wholly owned by a Cyprus trust maintained for the benefit of a Sarkesian relation. The alleged illicit trading by Sarkesian and Quorne took place ahead of a December 17, 2010 announcement that the European Union’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, had recommended to the European Commission that it permit InterMune to market its developmental drug, Esbriet, in the European Union. Sarkesian and Quorne consented to the entry of the final judgment, which imposes injunctive and monetary relief. The Commission also announced that on March 27, 2012, it amended its complaint, filed on December 23, 2010 against one or more unknown purchasers of the options of InterMune, to name Sarkesian and Quorne as defendants., In its amended complaint, the Commission alleges that Sarkesian was tipped to material non-public information concerning the CHMP’s recommendation in advance of the December 17 announcement and that, while in possession of this material non-public information, Sarkesian exercised his authority to manage and administer Quorne’s funds by recommending to Quorne that it purchase InterMune call options. As a result, Sarkesian caused Quorne to purchase 400 InterMune call options through a brokerage account in Switzerland on December 7 and 8, 2010. The market price of the 400 options rose over 500% following the December 17 announcement., On December 23, 2010, on the same day that the Commission filed its initial complaint, the Court entered a Temporary Restraining Order freezing assets and trading proceeds from the alleged illicit trading and prohibiting the then-unknown purchasers from disposing of the options or any proceeds from the sale of the options. Quorne later sold the 400 options, the proceeds of which have remained frozen by Court order., Without admitting or denying the allegations of the amended complaint, Quorne and Sarkesian consented to entry of a final judgment enjoining them from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and ordering them jointly and severally to pay $616,000 in disgorgement and $93,806.17 in civil penalties pursuant to Exchange Act Section 21A.

Stern is a defendant in an enforcement action filed by the Commission in October 2010 alleging that he and his company, Online Registries, Inc., d/b/a Online Medical Registries (“OMR”), defrauded investors by making various misrepresentations and dissipating investor funds.  The court initially entered a temporary restraining order and asset freeze in the case and later entered a preliminary injunction and continuing asset freeze that, among other things, prohibited Stern from transferring, assigning, or diminishing in value any assets of OMR or soliciting new investors., On August 3, 2011, the Commission had filed an application for civil contempt against Stern, alleging that Stern had formed a new company, Instant Medical Access LLC d/b/a Instant Medical Access (“IMA”), that was virtually identical to OMR, and Stern then used OMR’s technology and other intellectual property for the benefit of his new venture.  In addition, according to the application Stern had solicited at least one additional investor in IMA and was also spending his own money impermissibly in support of IMA, in violation of the injunctive orders entered against him in this case., On April 3, 2012, the Court entered an Order of Civil Contempt finding that Stern’s solicitation of investors in IMA, diminishing of the corporate assets of OMR, and unauthorized payments violated the terms of the March 7, 2011 Stipulated Preliminary Injunction, Order Freezing Assets, and Order for Other Equitable Relief.  The Court’s Order of Civil Contempt bars Stern from making further payments except as permitted in the Stipulated Preliminary Injunction.  Further, the Court ordered Stern to provide documentation detailing every payment he made in excess of $50; provide a complete accounting of the sources of all income, funding, or money he has received; produce a list of all investors, shareholders, owners, and partners in IMA to the Commission; shutdown any and all websites attributable to IMA; and transfer to OMR any and all trade names, trademarks, and domain names attributable to IMA.

Stern is further ordered to provide to the Commission all documents, including computer code and software, relating to IMA.  The Order also provides that the Court may impose additional penalties upon Stern in the event of further violations of any Order of the Court.,  The Commission previously filed a civil injunctive action against Stern and his company OMR on October 19, 2010, alleging in its complaint that Stern had violated the federal securities laws through fraudulent misrepresentations regarding OMR’s subscriber base, technology testing, partnerships with third-parties, and anticipated share value.  The complaint further alleged that Stern depleted virtually all of the investor funds he had received, largely by writing checks payable to himself and one of his affiliates.  The Commission obtained a temporary restraining order against David Stern and OMR on October 19, 2010, and the Court subsequently entered a Stipulated Preliminary Injunction, Order Freezing Assets, and Order for Other Equitable Relief against Stern on March 7, 2011.  On June 21, 2011, the Commission obtained an Order of Default Judgment as to Liability, Disgorgement, Prejudgment Interest, and Penalties against OMR., For further information, see <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2010/lr21702.htm>Lit.

The fraudulent trades included matched orders, where one account sold shares to another account at the same time and for the same price, and wash trades, which resulted in no change of beneficial ownership of the shares. According to the complaint, AutoChina and the other defendants engaged in the scheme after lenders offered AutoChina unfavorable terms for a stock-backed loan due to low trading volume in its stock., âAutoChina and the other defendants engaged in a brazen manipulation of AutoChinaâs stock to obtain favorable loan terms,â said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SECâs Division of Enforcement. âThe SEC will hold accountable publicly-traded companies, including foreign companies, that violate the U.S. securities laws and disrupt the U.S. capital markets.â, David P.

Between December 2007 and March 2009, FCP<b> </b>and FS operated as investment companies that purported to trade securities using an automated trading system. Howard, a resident of New York City, was a co-managing member of FCP and the sole managing member of FS. The Commissionâs complaint alleged, among other things, that, between December 2007 and January 2009, approximately 192 investors, located in at least 38 states, purchased LLC membership interests in FCP and FS. Investors were persuaded through false and misleading statements made by Howard and others to invest approximately $2.15 million in FCP and FS, and in addition, paid approximately $1.1 million in purported license fees for access to the trading systems. Thereafter, Howard misused and/or misappropriated almost $500,000 of the investor money and he and other principals lost the majority of the remaining funds through unsuccessful trading. Investors lost over $3 million in the scheme., Howard, FCP and FS did not respond to the SECâs allegations and the court therefore ordered default judgment against them. Howard, FCP and FS have each been enjoined from committing future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Judge Michael M. Baylson of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania sentenced Stinson to 33 years in federal prison, followed by three years of supervised release, and ordered him to pay more than $14 million in restitution. On August 15, 2011, Stinson pleaded guilty to five counts of wire fraud, four counts of mail fraud, nine counts of money laundering, one count of bank fraud, three counts of filing false tax returns, two counts of obstruction of justice, and two counts of making false statements to federal agents., On June 29, 2010, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action against Stinson and related persons and entities based on the same conduct, and sought and obtained a Temporary Restraining Order and Order Freezing Assets and the appointment of a receiver. According to the Commissionâs complaint, from 2004 through June 2010, Stinson, primarily through Lifeâs Good, Inc. and Keystone State Capital Corporation, two companies he controlled, sold purported âunitsâ in four Lifeâs Good private real estate hedge funds. Stinson falsely claimed that the Lifeâs Good funds generated annual returns of 10 to 16 percent by originating more than $30 million in commercial mortgage loans, and other investment income gained on the sale of foreclosure and investment properties. The Commissionâs complaint alleges that Stinson stole investor funds for his personal use, transferred money to family members and others, and used new investor proceeds to pay existing investors as part of a Ponzi scheme. On June 20, 2011, the United States District Court entered partial summary judgment against Stinson and his co-defendants, finding violations of the federal securities laws and ordering permanent injunctive relief.

Neman told investors that his purported hedge fund, Neman Financial L.P., invested in foreclosed residential properties that would be quickly flipped for profit, in Facebook shares obtained in private transactions, and highly anticipated initial public offerings, including Groupon, Inc., and LinkedIn Corp., and Angieâs List, Inc. Although Neman promised investors exorbitant returns resulting from his investing acumen and access to pre-IPO shares of well-known companies, what they actually received was simply other investorsâ monies, the hallmark of a Ponzi scheme., The Honorable Jacqueline H. Nguyen for the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California granted the Commissionâs request for a temporary restraining order and asset freeze against Neman and the entities he controlled., According to the Commissionâs complaint, Neman raised funds from at least 11 investors in the fraudulent securities offering. Most of these investors were members of the Los Angeles Persian-Jewish community, of which Neman is also a member., The Commission alleges that more than 99% of the money Neman raised was used either to pay returns to existing investors, or to fund his lavish lifestyle. According to the Commission, Neman spent nearly $1.6 million of investor funds to buy jewelry, pay for his wedding and honeymoon, as well as high-end cars, VIP tickets to sporting events, and vacations., The Commissionâs complaint alleges that Neman and Neman Financial, Inc. violated Section 17(a)(1-3) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5(a-c) thereunder, and Sections 206(1), (2), and (4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and Rule 206(4)-8(a)(1) thereunder, and Neman Financial violated, and Neman aided and abetted violations of, Section 203A and 204(a) of the Advisers Act, and Rule 204-2 thereunder; and seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest thereon, and financial penalties, against each of them.

Gibney, Jr., of the United States District Court of the Eastern District of Virginia, Richmond Division, entered a final judgment against Jorge L. Castillo (Castillo)., Among other things, the judgment permanently restrains and enjoins Castillo, a certified public accountant licensed to practice in Costa Rica and, for a time, in New Jersey, from violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933. The judgment orders Castillo to pay disgorgement in the amount of $84,000, representing Castilloâs ill-gotten gain from his participation in the scheme alleged in the complaint, plus prejudgment interest thereon in the amount of $18,288; provided that Castilloâs payment obligation would be credited dollar-for-dollar by any criminal forfeiture or restitution amounts ordered by the court against Castillo in the criminal action titled <u>United States v. Provident Capital Indemnity, Ltd., Minor Vargas Calvo and Jorge Luis Castillo, </u>3:11-CR-14 (E.D.V.A.). Castillo pled guilty in the related criminal case and is scheduled for sentencing in September of 2012., The Commission also issued an Order on April 12, 2012, pursuant to Commission Rule 102(e), suspending Castillo from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant. Castillo consented to the entry of the judgment without admitting or denying any of the allegations in the civil injunctive action. Castillo also consented to the issuance of the Order without admitting or denying any of the findings except he admitted the entry of the injunction., The Commissionâs complaint in this case alleges, in part, that from at least 2003 through 2009, Castillo held himself out as the independent, outside auditor for Provident Capital Indemnity Ltd. (PCI), a purported insurance and reinsurance company based in Costa Rica, which provided financial guarantee bonds on life settlements. PCIâs bonds purported to protect investorsâ interests in life settlements by promising to pay the death benefit of the underlying life insurance policies if the insured person on those policies lived beyond his or her estimated life expectancy. According to the complaint, in his purported role as PCIâs auditor, Castillo, along with PCIâs president, misrepresented PCIâs ability to satisfy its obligations under those bonds by making material misrepresentations about: (1) whether PCIâs financial statements had been audited, (2) the assets that backed PCIâs bonds; (3) PCIâs credit rating; and (4) the availability of reinsurance to cover claims on PCIâs bonds., In particular, the complaint alleges that Castillo issued clean audit reports on PCIâs financial statements, when, in fact, he never conducted an audit of PCIâs financial statements, and he knew or was reckless in not knowing that certain assets listed on PCIâs financial statements did not exist. Castillo thereby supported the illusion that PCI had materially larger assets â including a fictitious âLong-Term Assetâ that comprised some 70% to 80% of PCIâs total reported assets for the period in question â and thus a greater ability to meet its obligations on the financial guarantee bonds. PCI provided Castilloâs false audit reports to life settlement issuers, which, in turn, conveyed the information to investors. The Complaint also alleges that Castillo knew PCI was providing his false audit reports to a rating agency that, in partial reliance on those reports, gave PCI a high credit rating, and that, on occasion, Castillo assisted PCIâs president in formulating misleading responses to the rating agencyâs questions about PCIâs financial statements. Additionally, according to the complaint, Castillo issued certificates to life settlement issuers that falsely stated PCI had made payments to purchase reinsurance from reputable reinsurers, thereby supporting the illusion that PCIâs obligations on financial guarantee bonds were backed by reinsurance. The complaint alleges that after learning of a regulatory inquiry into his conduct in 2010, Castillo asked the president of PCI to manufacture backup material to support Castilloâs purported audit procedures and told the PCI president that he had destroyed or was in the process of destroying all of his e-mails. Castillo also urged PCIâs president to destroy documents., See also Litigation Release No. 21818 (January 19, 2011).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22332.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Essentially, Murmylyuk entered matching orders in those accounts that caused the intruded victim account first to purchase thinly traded options from Murmylyukâs stolen identity account at a high price, and then to immediately sell the same options back to the stolen identity account at a much lower price, resulting in a profit to Murmylyukâs stolen identity account and a loss to the intruded victim account.  In total, Murmylyukâs fraudulent trading on November 1, 2011 generated illegal profits of more than $30,000 for his stolen identity account, and losses of more than $140,000 for the intruded victim account.  , The Commissionâs complaint charges Murmylyuk with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a final judgment order permanently enjoining him from violating those provisions of the federal securities laws and ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and pay a civil penalty.

This concludes the litigation of this action, brought in 2003 against three former officers of Gateway., The SEC alleged that Todd falsely represented Gatewayâs financial condition in the third quarter of 2000 in order to meet financial analystsâ earnings and revenue expectations. Among other transactions, the SEC alleged that Todd caused Gateway to record $47.2 million in revenue from a one-time sale of fixed assets to Gatewayâs third-party information technology services provider in violation of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), and that Todd, then Gatewayâs CFO, caused Gateway to recognize an additional $21 million in revenue from an incomplete sale of computers to a second entity, also in violation of GAAP.

In addition, Glisson was ordered to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,400,000, and was permanently barred from participating in the offering of penny stock.  , The Commissionâs complaint alleged that from December 2005 through April 2007, Glisson acted as an unregistered broker or dealer and illegally sold deregistered securities of CMKM Diamonds, Inc.  CMKMs registration with the Commission was revoked and the stock delisted on October 28, 2005.  According to the complaint, Glisson, a retired auto worker and part-time restaurant worker who used the name âDeli Dogâ or âDeliâ in Internet chat rooms, identified potential buyers and sellers by frequenting CMKM related internet chat rooms and through referrals from past buyers and sellers.

According to the Commission, he then stood silently by in August 2011 as SinoTech attempted to counter public accusations of fraud by claiming the company held $93 million in its bank accounts â a statement Liu and SinoTech knew was false., The Commission further alleges that, since its November 2010 IPO, SinoTech has intentionally misled investors about its use of IPO proceeds and the value of its assets, specifically the lateral hydraulic drilling (âLHDâ) units that are central to its business. According to the Commission, SinoTechâs IPO filings represented that the company would use the IPO proceeds to acquire up to 20 LHD units at an average price of $7.5 million each. Subsequent public filings made it appear that SinoTech had followed through on these representations and acquired units valued on its balance sheet at $94 million. The SEC alleges, however, SinoTech had in fact only purchased 11 units with a total value of less than $17 million. As a result, the value of LHD units shown on SinoTechâs balance sheet was materially overstated., The complaint alleges that SinoTech, Xin, and Zhang violated or aided and abetted violations of Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-16. The complaint further charges Liu, Xin and Zhang with violations of Exchange Act Section 13(b)(5) and Rule 13b2-1, and that Xin and Zhang also violated Exchange Act Rules 13a-14 and 13b2-2. Finally, the complaint alleges Liu, Xin and Zhang were âcontrol persons,â liable under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The Commission seeks permanent injunctive relief and civil penalties against all defendants, as well as disgorgement of ill-gotten gains against SinoTech and Liu.

22342,2012,[<h3><a name=P3_254></a>SEC CHARGES FORMER CALPERS CEO AND FRIEND WITH FALSIFYING LETTERS IN $20 MILLION PLACEMENT AGENT FEE SCHEME</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged the former CEO of the California Public Employeesâ Retirement System (CalPERS) and his close personal friend with scheming to defraud an investment firm into paying $20 million in fees to the friendâs placement agent firms., The SEC alleges that former CalPERS CEO Federico R. Buenrostro and his friend Alfred J.R. Villalobos fabricated documents given to New York-based private equity firm Apollo Global Management. Those documents gave Apollo the false impression that CalPERS had reviewed and signed placement agent fee disclosure letters in accordance with its established procedures. In fact, Buenrostro and Villalobos intentionally bypassed those procedures to induce Apollo to pay placement agent fees to Villalobosâs firms. The false letters bearing a fake CalPERS logo and Buenrostroâs signature were provided to Apollo, which then went ahead with the payments., âBuenrostro and Villalobos not only tricked Apollo into paying more than $20 million in placement agent fees it would not otherwise have paid, but also undermined procedures designed to ensure that investors like CalPERS have full disclosure of such fees,â said John M. McCoy III, Associate Regional Director of the SECâs Los Angeles Regional Office., According to the SECâs complaint, Apollo began requiring signed investor disclosure letters in 2007 from investors such as CalPERS before it would pay fees to a placement agent that assisted in raising funds. Villalobosâs firm ARVCO Capital Research LLC (which later became ARVCO Financial Ventures LLC) agreed to this contractual provision in a placement agent agreement with Apollo related to CalPERSâs investment in Apollo Fund VII. However, when ARVCO requested an investor disclosure letter from CalPERSâs Investment Office to provide Apollo, it was informed that CalPERSâs Legal Office had advised it not to sign a disclosure letter. ARVCO never again contacted CalPERSâs Investment Office for an investor disclosure letter., The SEC alleges that in January 2008, Villalobos instead fabricated a letter using a phony CalPERS logo. At Villalobosâs request, Buenrostro then signed what appeared to be a CalPERS disclosure letter. Upon receipt of the fake disclosure letter for Apollo Fund VII, Apollo paid ARVCO about $3.5 million in placement agent fees., The SECâs complaint further alleges that less than two weeks later, Villalobos and Buenrostro created false CalPERS disclosure letters for at least four more Apollo funds under similarly suspicious circumstances. As part of the scheme, Buenrostro signed blank sheets of fake CalPERS letterhead that Villalobos and ARVCO then used to generate additional investor disclosure letters as they needed them. Based on these false documents, Apollo was induced to pay ARVCO more than $20 million in placement agent fees it would not have paid without the disclosure letters., The SEC seeks an order requiring Buenrostro, Villalobos, and ARVCO to disgorge any ill-gotten gains, pay financial penalties, and be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws., As alleged in the SECâs complaint, the defendants violated Section 17(a)(1) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5(a) and 10b-5(c) thereunder.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22342.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The Courtâs Order temporarily freezes the assets of Weintraub and certain shell companies through which he apparently operates. The order also directed Weintraub to demonstrate, among other things, why he should not be held in contempt for violating the Courtâs Final Judgment in <i>SEC v. Allen E.

Weintraub had falsely represented that he would sell the investors pre-IPO shares of Facebook, Inc., and that PST Investments had an ownership interest in Facebook stock.

To settle the SEC’s fraud charges, Option One, now known as Sand Canyon Corporation, agreed to pay over $28.2 million., Option One originated, sold and serviced subprime mortgage loans.  In 2006 and 2007, Option One was one of the nation’s largest subprime originators with originations of nearly $40 billion in its fiscal 2006.          , In its complaint filed today in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, the SEC alleges that between January and March 2007, Option One offered and sold more than $4.3 billion of RMBS in seven separate offerings.  RMBS are debt obligations that represent claims to the cash flows from pools of residential mortgage loans.  According to the SEC’s complaint, Option One misled investors in its RMBS by promising to repurchase or replace mortgages in its RMBS that breached representations and warranties.  These promises were rendered misleading by Option One’s failure to disclose that its financial condition was significantly deteriorating and it could not meet its repurchase obligations on its own.  The SEC further alleges that at the time Option One offered and sold the RMBS, it needed to rely on voluntary financial support from Block to meet its financial obligations but that Block was under no obligation to continue providing that financing.  Option One never disclosed this information to investors.   , Option One, without admitting or denying the SEC’s allegations, consented to the entry of an order permanently enjoining it from violating Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and requiring it to pay disgorgement of $14,250,558, prejudgment interest of $3,982,027, and a $10,000,000 civil penalty.

Kluger â worked. He and the trader â Garrett D. Bauer â were linked through a mutual friend now identified as Kenneth T.

Kluger and Bauer used public telephones and prepaid disposable mobile phones to communicate with Robinson in an effort to avoid detection. Robinson, now also charged, cooperated in the SECâs investigation., Bauer, Kluger, and Robinson each agreed to give up their ill-gotten gains plus interest in order to settle the SECâs charges. Those amounts under the terms of their consent agreements are approximately $31.6 million for Bauer, $516,000 for Kluger, and $845,000 for Robinson., In parallel criminal actions brought by the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the District of New Jersey, Bauer, Kluger, and Robinson have all pled guilty and are scheduled to be sentenced on June 4, 2012., Acknowledging the facts to which they have admitted as part of their guilty pleas, Bauer, Robinson, and Kluger consented to final judgments in the SECâs civil actions that are subject to court approval.

22346,2012,[<h3>SEC CHARGES FORMER MORGAN STANLEY EXECUTIVE WITH FCPA VIOLATIONS AND INVESTMENT ADVISER FRAUD</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a former executive at Morgan Stanley with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) as well as securities laws for investment advisers by secretly acquiring millions of dollars worth of real estate investments for himself and an influential Chinese official who in turn steered business to Morgan Stanley’s funds., The SEC alleges that Garth R. Peterson, who was a managing director in Morgan Stanley’s real estate investment and fund advisory business, had a personal friendship and secret business relationship with the former Chairman of Yongye Enterprise (Group) Co. – a Chinese state-owned entity with influence over the success of Morgan Stanley’s real estate business in Shanghai.  Peterson secretly arranged to have at least $1.8 million paid to himself and the Chinese official that he disguised as finder’s fees that Morgan Stanley’s funds owed to third parties.  Peterson also secretly arranged for him, the Chinese official, and an attorney to acquire a valuable Shanghai real estate interest from a Morgan Stanley fund.  Peterson was acquiring an interest from the fund but negotiated both sides of the transaction.  In exchange for offers and payments from Peterson, the Chinese official helped Peterson and Morgan Stanley obtain business while personally benefitting from some of these same investments.  Peterson’s deception, self-dealing, and misappropriation breached the fiduciary duties he owed to Morgan Stanley’s funds as their representative. , Peterson agreed to a settlement of the SEC’s charges in which he will be permanently barred from the securities industry, pay more than $250,000 in disgorgement, and relinquish his interest in the valuable Shanghai real estate (currently valued at approximately $3.4 million) that he secretly acquired through his misconduct.  The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a related criminal case against Peterson., According to the SEC’s complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, Peterson’s violations occurred from at least 2004 to 2007.  His principal responsibility at Morgan Stanley was to evaluate, negotiate, acquire, manage and sell real estate investments on behalf of Morgan Stanley’s advisers and funds.  He was terminated in 2008 due to his FCPA misconduct.  , The SEC alleges that Peterson led Morgan Stanley’s effort to build a Chinese real estate investment portfolio for its real estate funds by cultivating a relationship with the Chinese official and taking advantage of his ability to steer opportunities to Morgan Stanley and his influence in helping with needed governmental approvals.  Morgan Stanley thus partnered with Yongye on a number of significant Chinese real estate investments.  At the same time, Peterson and the Chinese official expanded their personal business dealings both in a real estate interest secretly acquired from Morgan Stanley as well as by investing together in Chinese franchises of well-known U.S. fast food restaurants.  Peterson failed to disclose these investments in annual disclosures that Morgan Stanley required him to make as part of his employment., According to the SEC’s complaint, Peterson openly credited the Chinese official with helping obtain approvals required from other Chinese government entities for a deal to close.  He wrote to several Morgan Stanley employees in response to an e-mail discussing the terms of one of Yongye’s purported investments, “Everyone pls keep in mind the big picture here.  YY gave us this deal. ... So we owe them a favor relating to this deal. ... This should be very easy and friendly.”  In another e-mail a week later, Peterson described “YYI” as “our friends who are coming in because WE OWE THEM A FAVOR.”  , The SEC alleges that a Morgan Stanley compliance officer specifically informed Peterson in 2004 that employees of Yongye, a Chinese state-owned entity, were government officials for purposes of the FCPA.  Peterson also received at least 35 FCPA compliance reminders from Morgan Stanley, but nonetheless committed the FCPA violations., The SEC’s complaint charges Peterson with violations of the anti-bribery, books and records and internal control provisions of the FCPA, and with aiding and abetting violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  , Peterson has consented to a court order (i) permanently enjoining him from violating Sections 30A and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Investment Advisers Act, (ii) requiring him to disgorge $254,589, and (iii) requiring him to relinquish to a court-appointed receiver the interest he secretly acquired from Morgan Stanley’s fund in the Jin Lin Tiandi Serviced Apartments, which has a current estimated value of approximately $3.4 million.  The proposed settlement is subject to court approval.  Peterson has also consented to permanent industry bars based on the anticipated entry of the injunction against him and his criminal conviction., The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the Fraud Section of DOJ’s Criminal Division, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  Morgan Stanley, which is not charged in the matter, cooperated with the SEC’s inquiry and conducted a thorough internal investigation to determine the scope of the improper payments and other misconduct involved.<a name=P14_5850></a>,  ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22346.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The Commission’s complaint, filed in Dallas federal court, alleges that Terry E. Wiese and Scott A. Wiese promised extreme returns – as much as 1,000% in a year – to entice investment in their company, Usee, Inc. Contrary to the Wieses’ claims, however, Usee had no business from which to generate any returns to investors. Instead, the Commission alleges that the Wieses wasted investor funds on poorly considered ventures or sent them to third parties about which they had little information. The Commission also alleges that the Wieses used investor funds for personal expenses and to make Ponzi payments to investors. , According to the complaint, the Wieses and Usee offered two forms of investment: stock and promissory notes. The Wieses promised returns to stock investors of up to 1,000% in the first year. Note investors were promised returns of up to 100% in 60 days. The Wieses also claimed that Usee would earn $26 billion in revenue by its fifth year of business, due to lucrative financing agreements it had arranged. According to the Commission, however, these claims were unfounded, since Usee had only nominal revenue and no financing arrangements. , The Commission alleges that the Wieses told investors that Usee was on the cusp of acquiring another VoIP company that owned valuable technology. In fact, Usee had contracted to acquire this company for $33 million, and sent the company $3 million of investor funds as a down payment. But, according the Commission, Usee and the Wieses never got close to securing funds to complete the acquisition and ultimately forfeited the funds to the other company, a fact never disclosed to investors. , Later, the Commission alleges, the Wieses released more than $1.5 million of investor funds to a company they knew nothing about, NFY Financial Consulting, PLLC. According to the SEC, NFY’s principals – Nail Yaldo and Jack Skrelja – told the Wieses the funds would be used as “proof of funds” to support unspecified “platform trading.” The Commission further alleges that, although they did little due diligence into NFY or its principals, the Wieses assured investors that the funds would be safeguarded in an escrow account and not released for any purpose. The Wieses, however, soon turned investor funds over to NFY without investors’ consent or knowledge. , The Commission has charged the Wieses and Usee with violations of Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Commission’s complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, civil penalties and disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, with prejudgment interest. The Commission also seeks to bar the Wieses from serving as officers or directors of any public company. , To settle the Commission’s charges, the Wieses and Usee consented to permanent injunctions under Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Defendants further agreed to disgorge nearly $5.8 million in ill-gotten gains, with prejudgment interest, and the Wieses agreed to pay civil penalties totaling $300,000. Defendants are also permanently enjoined from offering or selling securities issued by any company they own or control and the Wieses are further barred from serving as officers or directors of any public company. The defendants did not admit or deny the SEC’s allegations. , The SEC’s action also names NFY, Yaldo and Skrelja as relief defendants for purposes of recovering the funds released to NFY.

That decision granted the Commission’s motion for summary judgment and entered final judgments against both Locke and Jenkins. The Court of Appeals dismissed Jenkins’ appeal after she filed a motion to withdraw it. ,  The Commission’s Complaint against Locke and Jenkins, filed in March 2009, alleged that they invented a billion-dollar client in order to gain credibility and attract legitimate investors. The Complaint further alleged that Jenkins tried to perpetuate her scheme by lying to the Commission staff about the existence of the invented client and furnishing the Commission’s staff with bogus documents in 2008, including fake custodial statements that she created on her laptop.

22350,2012,[<h3>SEC FILES CHARGES AGAINST FORMER ATTORNEY FOR MUTUAL BENEFITS</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it filed a complaint against Defendant Michael J. McNerney, charging him with violations of the federal securities laws arising from his involvement in Mutual Benefits Corp.’s (“MBC”) offering fraud which raised more than $1 billion from approximately 29,000 investors. From 1995 through at least May 2004, McNerney served as primary securities regulatory counsel for MBC. The complaint alleges that<strong></strong>in this role, he helped conceal the fraud, met with investors, and supervised the filing of false reports with state regulators. The Commission’s complaint charges McNerney with aiding and abetting MBC’s violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Commission seeks permanent injunctive relief against McNerney, who has consented to the entry of Final Judgment providing for full injunctive relief. ,  In addition to the civil action against McNerney, the Commission simultaneously issued an Order pursuant to Rule 102(e)(2) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice forthwith suspending McNerney from appearing or practicing before the Commission based on the entries of a felony conviction against him. On August 26, 2011, the Honorable Adalberto Jordan, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Florida, sentenced McNerney to 5 years in prison, followed by three years of supervised release, and ordered him to pay restitution, along with his co-conspirators, in the amount of $826,839,642. ,  On May 3, 2004, the Commission first halted the on-going fraud at MBC when it filed a contested emergency civil enforcement action against MBC and its principals. In its complaint, the Commission alleged that the defendants raised over $1 billion from thousands of investors through a fraudulent, unregistered offering of securities in the form of fractionalized interests in viatical and life settlements. The Commission obtained a restraining order to halt the alleged fraud at MBC, and thereafter the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida appointed a receiver to identify and trace the assets of MBC. ,  The Commission’s actions regarding MBC have resulted in nine injunctions and other relief against nine defendants and eight relief defendants, and orders to pay disgorgement and civil penalties totaling $30 million. In addition, the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida has charged 12 defendants in criminal actions for their roles in the fraud. ,  The SEC acknowledges the work of the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Miami Field Office, and the Internal Revenue Service, Criminal Investigation Division in this matter., For additional information see Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18698.htm>18698</a> (May 6, 2004), Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr19274.htm> 19274</a> (June 20, 2005), Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr19480.htm> 19480</a> (December 1, 2005), Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr19978.htm> 19978</a> (January 24, 2007), Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20151.htm> 20151</a> (June 13, 2007), Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20459.htm> 20459</a> (February 15, 2008), Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20521.htm> 20521</a> (April 7, 2008), and Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20521.htm> 20521</a> (April 7, 2008), and Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr22084.htm>22084</a> (September 7, 2011). ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22350.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Wolkoff (“Wolkoff”) and George Sobol (“Sobol”) in an action filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against e-Smart Technologies, Inc. (“e-Smart”) and related individuals and entities. In that action, the Commission alleges that defendants Wolkoff and Sobol participated in an unregistered stock offering of e-Smart securities in violation of the securities registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) and acted as unregistered broker-dealers in violation of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”). ,  Specifically, the Commission alleges that Wolkoff participated in the unregistered stock offering from April 2005 through at least June 2006, completing at least 115 transactions which brought in over $2,600,000 and sold over 26 million e-Smart shares. The Commission also alleges that Sobol participated in the unregistered stock offering from March 2005 through at least June 2006, completing at least 19 transactions which brought in over $890,000 and sold over $8.8 million e-Smart shares. During this period, neither was registered with the Commission as a broker-dealer or associated with a registered broker-dealer. ,  Wolkoff consented to a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violations of Sections 5(a) and (c) of the Securities Act and Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act.

22352,2012,[<h3>SEC CHARGES ATTORNEY AND CLIENTS IN SCHEME TO UNLAWFULLY SELL BILLIONS OF PENNY-STOCK SHARES</h3>],"[On April 30, 2012, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged a mother-and-daughter pair and their attorney with a scheme to unlawfully acquire and sell billions of shares of penny stock that were never registered for sale to the public., The SEC charged Florida attorney Cameron H. Linton, Esq., his clients, Christel S. Scucci and her mother Karen S. Beach, and their companies, Protégé Enterprises, LLC, and Capital Edge Enterprises, LLC with a scheme to unlawfully sell large quantities of stock in violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933, which generally requires that securities transactions be registered with the SEC, unless exempt.  According to the SEC, over an approximately 20-month period ending in October 2011, Scucci and her mother sold about 3.3 billion shares of purportedly unrestricted stock that they acquired through so-called debt conversion “wrap around” transactions, reaping proceeds of more than $1.5 million from the sales.  The SEC alleges that Scucci and Beach were able to sell most of this stock only because Linton issued baseless legal opinions for them stating that the stock could be issued without a warning on the stock certificate limiting the transfer or sale of the security, which is commonly referred to as a “restrictive legend.”  The opinion concluded that their resale was exempt from the federal registration requirements., According to the SEC’s complaint filed in federal court in Orlando, FL, the transactions involved notes issued by microcap companies representing debts supposedly owed to affiliates or others often closely associated with the companies.  Under the wrap around agreements, the affiliates assigned the right to collect the debts from the issuers to Protégé or Capital Edge.  The wrap around agreements also purported to amend the initial debt agreements thereby allowing Protégé and Capital Edge to convert the money owed to them into shares of the issuers’ common stock at a deep discount to the prevailing market price.  Protégé and Capital Edge almost always elected to receive stock from the issuers shortly after execution of the wrap around agreements, and regularly sold the stock into the public market, often for large profits, within days or weeks of acquiring it.  None of the sales were registered with the SEC., The complaint alleges that Protégé and Capital Edge paid Linton to write attorney opinion letters for them stating that the stock acquired under these wrap around agreements lawfully could be issued to them by the transfer agent without a restrictive legend and immediately sold to the public.  According to the SEC, Linton lacked any basis for the opinions he issued, which were premised on the notion that through the wrap around agreements and debt conversion, Protégé and Capital Edge could rely on a safe harbor for resale of securities held for at least one year by “tacking” the 12-month period that the affiliates claimed to have held the original debt before transferring it to Protégé and Capital Edge.  However, the complaint alleges that when Linton wrote the opinion letters, he lacked an understanding of the applicable legal principles and failed to substantiate the factual predicate for his opinions.  Furthermore, the complaint alleges that in mid-2010, Linton became aware of an injunction issued in <i>SEC v.</i> <i>K&amp;L Enterprises, Inc., </i>involving<i> </i>a similar scheme in which his letters were used to effectuate unregistered sales.  But for Linton’s opinion letters, transfer agents would not have issued the stock to Protégé and Capital Edge so that they could quickly turn around and sell it into the public market.   , The SEC’s complaint alleges that Protégé, Capital Edge, Scucci and Beach violated Section 5 of the Securities Act.  The complaint further alleges that Linton violated, or aided and abetted the violation of, Section 5 of the Securities Act.  The SEC is seeking to have the defendants return their ill-gotten gains, pay penalties, be subject to injunctions, and be barred from participating in future penny-stock offerings.,  ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22352.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

CANNON</h3>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced the filing of a Complaint in federal district court against RKC Capital Management LLC, RKC Capital, LLC (“RKC”) and Russell K. Cannon (“Cannon”), (collectively “Defendants”).  The Complaint alleges that the Defendants artificially inflated the assets of a hedge fund they managed, RKC Matador Fund LLC (“Matador”), to defraud Matador investors., The Complaint alleges that from at least November 2007 through July 2011, Defendants engaged in fraudulent conduct to overstate the assets under management of Matador.  Defendants did this through causing the price of Matador’s largest holding, stock in Global Pari Mutuel Services, Inc. (“Global”), to artificially increase by “marking the close” of Global’s stock.  Marking the close is a manipulative trading practice designed to cause the price of a stock to rise at the close of the market.  The Defendants also falsely inflated the fund’s assets by instructing Matador’s fund administrator to record the price of Matador’s holdings in Global above the actual market price for approximately 15 months.  Cannon also misused RKC’s client accounts to aid his practice of marking the close and to enhance Matador’s profits. , According to the Commission’s Complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Utah, the Defendants falsely represented to investors that Matador’s assets under management and performance returns were greater than they actually were.  In fact, at its peak, Matador’s assets under management were overstated by over 100% and its performance returns were significantly overstated for several months.  In addition, investor statements the Defendants provided to Matador investors, which reflected the holdings and performance of persons who invested in Matador, were also significantly overstated.  The Defendants made these misrepresentations to investors to convince investors to invest in Matador and to obtain excessive advisory fees., The Commission’s Complaint seeks to enjoin the Defendants from future violations of Sections 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), (2) and (4) of the Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder, and seeks the payment of disgorgement and civil penalties.,  ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22353.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The complaint alleges that Eldridge put on a live online securities trading mentoring program under the name “Daily Cash Flow Trading Lab.”  According to the complaint, Eldridge made misleading statements that he was an experienced, successful securities trader and made additional misleading statements about the success of securities trading in the Daily Cash Flow Trading Lab.  Based on Eldridge’s misrepresentations, the complaint alleges that customers purchased subscriptions to the trading lab and traded securities he recommended. The complaint further alleges that Powell misleadingly portrayed herself as an expert securities investor who made her living trading securities.  Contrary to her representation that she became wealthy trading securities, the complaint alleges that she was not a successful securities trader.  According to the complaint, Powell’s self-portrayal as a successful securities trader misled investors into believing that they too would profit trading securities if they purchased the instructional courses and other products and sold and followed the securities trading strategies she espoused.  The complaint alleges that, by their conduct, the defendants violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5., Defendants Powell and Eldridge consented to final judgments enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, and enjoining them for five years from receiving compensation from participating in securities trading seminars.

Mark Anthony Longoria, et al.</i>, 11-CV-0753 (SDNY) (JSR).  , This case alleges insider trading by ten individuals and one investment adviser entity, all of whom are consultants, employees, or clients of the so-called “expert network” firm, Primary Global Research LLC (“PGR”).  The SEC filed its Complaint on February 3, 2011, charging two PGR employees and four consultants with insider trading for illegally tipping hedge funds and other investors.  On February 8, 2011, the SEC filed an Amended Complaint, charging a New York-based hedge fund and four hedge fund portfolio managers and analysts who illegally traded on confidential information obtained from technology company employees moonlighting as expert network consultants.  The scheme netted more than $30 million from trades based on material, nonpublic information about such companies as Advanced Micro Devices, Seagate Technology and Western Digital.  The charges were the first against traders in the SECs ongoing investigation of insider trading involving expert networks. , The SEC alleged that Fleishman was a vice president of sales at PGR who facilitated the transfer of material nonpublic information from PGR consultants to PGR clients and, in certain instances, acted as a conduit by receiving material nonpublic information from PGR consultants and passing that information directly to PGR clients.  , The Final Judgment entered against Fleishman permanently enjoins him from violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5 and orders him liable for disgorgement of ill-gotten gains of $49,150, which is to be deemed satisfied by the order of forfeiture of $49,150 entered against Fleishman in a parallel criminal action against him.

These misrepresentations included:  1) that investors could draw upon bank issued guarantees worth millions of dollars without having to repay the withdrawn funds; and 2) that investor funds would be held in escrow until the bank guarantees were issued.  The complaint alleges that defendants knew or were reckless in not knowing that both of these representations were false because no such bank guarantees existed and investor funds were misappropriated immediately upon receipt., Defendants also misrepresented that they would be paid commissions only once the investor received the bank guarantee.  In fact, defendants were paid commissions relatively soon after the investors transferred the money.

Beasley, and the investment adviser to the city’s public pension funds involved in a secret exchange of lavish gifts to peddle influence over the funds’ investment process., The Commission’s complaint alleges that Kilpatrick and Beasley, who were trustees to the pension funds, solicited and received $125,000 worth of private jet travel and other perks paid for by MayfieldGentry Realty Advisors LLC, an investment adviser whose CEO Chauncey Mayfield was recommending to the trustees that the pension funds invest approximately $117 million in a real estate investment trust (REIT) controlled by the firm.  Despite their fiduciary duties, neither Kilpatrick and Beasley nor Mayfield and his firm informed the boards of trustees about these trips and the conflicts of interest they presented.  The funds ultimately voted to approve the REIT investment, and MayfieldGentry received millions of dollars in management fees., According to the Commission’s complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, members of Kilpatrick’s administration began to exert pressure on Mayfield in early 2006 after he supported Kilpatrick’s opponent in his 2005 re-election and hired that candidate’s daughter at MayfieldGentry.  The complaint alleges that Beasley met with Mayfield in February 2006 and told him he was “in the dog house” with Kilpatrick and offered to help him “clear the air.”  Throughout 2007, Mayfield appeared before the boards of trustees for Detroit’s public pension funds recommending the REIT investment., Meanwhile, the complaint alleges, MayfieldGentry began footing the bills for trips taken by Kilpatrick, Beasley and others that extended beyond business.  In January 2007, Beasley demanded and Mayfield agreed to pay more than $3,000 for hotel rooms in Charlotte, N.C. for Beasley, Kilpatrick, and others.  According to the complaint, Beasley told Mayfield that the reason for the trip was to inspect a building recently acquired by one of the pension funds, but in fact Beasley and Kilpatrick never inspected the building.  Mayfield knew that Beasley and Kilpatrick never inspected the building, but did not ask any further questions about the matter., According to the Commission’s complaint, the non-business travel continued:, The Commission alleges that neither Kilpatrick nor Beasley nor Mayfield nor MayfieldGentry told anyone associated with the pension funds about any of the travel.  The boards of trustees for the funds thus voted to invest approximately $117 million with Mayfield and his firm without the knowledge that they had supplied Kilpatrick, Beasley, and their associates with the extravagant travel and perks during the preceding 10 months., The Commission’s complaint alleges that the defendants violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5(a), 10b-5(b) and 10b-5(c) thereunder.  The Commission also alleges that MayfieldGentry and Chauncey Mayfield violated Sections 17(a)(1), 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933.  In addition, the Commission charges that MayfieldGentry and Chauncey Mayfield violated Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Kilpatrick and Beasley aided and abetted those violations.  The Commission seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, penalties, and permanent injunctions, including an injunction against Kilpatrick and Beasley to prohibit them from participating in any decisions involving investments in securities by public pensions.  , The Commission’s investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted jointly by the Chicago Regional Office led by Merri Jo Gillette and Timothy L. Warren, the Enforcement Division’s Asset Management Unit led by Bruce Karpati and Robert Kaplan, and the Municipal Securities and Public Pensions Unit led by Elaine C. Greenberg and Mark R. Zehner.

Khan <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2010/lr21644.htm>in September 2010</a>, alleging that he traded illegally in the stock of Georgia-based pharmaceutical company Sciele Pharma, Inc. on the basis of nonpublic information he received just days before the public announcement of a tender offer by a Japanese company to purchase all of that companyâs shares. Khan obtained confidential details about the acquisition from a longtime business associate and friend who was a senior officer at Sciele. Khan subsequently opened an online brokerage account for the first time in several years, transferred approximately one-third of his liquid net worth into it, and purchased 4,000 shares of Sciele stock just days before the tender offerâs public announcement. Khan sold all of his shares after the announcement for an illicit profit of $47,171., Without admitting or denying the Commissionâs allegations, Dr. Khan agreed, as set forth in the Courtâs order, to pay a total of $100,857.79, consisting of disgorgement, prejudgment interest thereon, and a civil penalty.

22365,2012,[<h3>SEC CHARGES APARTMENTS AMERICA AND ITS OWNERS IN SCHEME TO DEFRAUD INVESTORS</h3>],"[On May 10, 2012, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged a California-based real estate company and its owners with defrauding potential investors by boasting a false company track record to tout their purported real estate expertise while concealing the bankruptcy of their previous company., The SEC alleges that Michael J. Stewart, John J. Packard, and Randall A. Smith created Apartments America, LLC to pool investor proceeds from an unregistered offering of securities and invest primarily in apartment buildings in Southern California and Arizona.  They solicited potential investors through a website, Internet advertisements and postings, cold calls, solicitation letters, and advertising in a national newspaper.  They boasted a track record of producing more than a 60 percent annual return on investment and creating more than $100 million in net equity.  , According to the SEC’s complaint filed in federal court in Orange County, California, what potential investors did not know is that Apartments America was a new company with no assets and no track record.  Stewart, Packard, and Smith were merely using the same investment strategy and selective statistics from their prior bankrupt company that had defaulted on $91.6 million in promissory notes held by 647 investors., According to the SEC’s complaint, Stewart lives in San Clemente, California, and Packard and Smith each live in Long Beach, California.  Together they formed Apartments America in September 2009, just three months after Pacific Property Assets (PPA) filed for bankruptcy.  Stewart and Packard owned PPA and Smith worked for them.  In the months prior to defaulting on its promissory notes, PPA was actively soliciting investor funds and promising an annual interest rate of 24 to 30 percent.  , The SEC alleges that under Apartments America, whose securities have never been registered with the SEC, Stewart, Packard, and Smith similarly solicited investor funds with the same plan to purchase apartment buildings.  But they engaged in a concerted scheme to distance themselves from PPA and its bankruptcy.  In communications to potential investors, they selectively and misleadingly used some of PPA’s historic investments and touted them as Apartments America data.  For instance, they arrived at their fabricated statistic of a 60 percent annual return on investment by cherry-picking PPA’s successful property investments while omitting the losses incurred on more than 50 properties in PPA’s portfolio at the time of its bankruptcy.  Stewart, Packard, and Smith also misrepresented that they had created more than $100 million in net equity by calculating some of PPA’s property investments while omitting information about its bankruptcy and the losses on its bankrupt properties.  They also falsely represented to potential investors that they were managing a property portfolio valued at more than $200 million when that in fact referred to PPA’s bankrupt property portfolio, which was actually being managed by the bankruptcy trustee., The Commission’s complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in Orange County, California, charges all defendants with violations of Sections 5(c), 17(a)(1), and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933.  The Commission also seeks permanent injunctions against all defendants, and conduct-based injunctions against Stewart, Packard, and Smith, prohibiting them or any entity they own or control from offering unregistered securities.  In addition, the Commission seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest and civil penalties against all defendants.,  ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22365.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

22368,2012,[<h3>SEC CHARGES CHINA NATURAL GAS AND ITS CHAIRMAN FOR CONCEALING LOANS TO BENEFIT HIS FAMILY </h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed suit in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against China-based China Natural Gas, Inc. and its chairman and former CEO Qinan Ji for defrauding investors by secretly loaning company funds to benefit Ji’s son and nephew while failing to disclose the true nature of the loans. , The SEC alleges that Ji coordinated two short-term loans totaling more than $14 million in January 2010.  One loan went to a real estate firm co-owned by Ji’s son and nephew through a sham borrower.  The other loan went to a business partner of the real estate firm.  Ji signed the company’s SEC filings that falsely stated the loans were made to third parties.  Ji then lied about the true borrower to China Natural Gas’s board, investors, and auditors as well as during the company’s internal investigation. , According to the SEC’s complaint, Ji’s nephew approached China Natural Gas in late 2009 to obtain a loan for a large real estate development project being run by Demaoxing Real Estate Co., a firm that was 90 percent owned by Ji’s son and 10 percent owned by Ji’s nephew.  Ji recognized it was inappropriate for China Natural Gas to loan money directly to his nephew, so he asked his niece’s husband, who was the company’s internal audit chief, to use a sham borrower.  The internal audit chief located an individual named Taoxiang Wang, and fabricated notes of a meeting with her to discuss loan terms.  Wang signed a loan agreement for $9.9 million, and the money was wired directly into a Demaoxing bank account with a note stating that the amount was for “raw material expenses.” , The SEC alleges that around the same time, China Natural Gas made a $4.4 million loan to Shaanxi Juntai Housing Purchase Co., a business partner on Demaoxing’s real estate development project.  Shaanxi Juntai’s then-general manager was Ji’s friend.  The internal audit chief talked with Ji’s nephew about the project when arranging the loan, which directly benefitted Demaoxing.  , According to the SEC’s complaint, Ji was the company CEO until he resigned in October 2011.  He approved both loans without obtaining prior authorization from the board or informing the CFO.  Ji repeatedly lied to conceal the related party nature of both loans.  When questioned about the loans by the China Natural Gas board, Ji falsely stated that the loans involved senior Chinese government officers who were in charge of the company’s liquid natural gas project.  During a May 10, 2010 conference call about quarterly earnings, Ji responded to a question about the loans by again stating that they were made to obtain approvals from government officials.  He later told the board that he made the loans to earn quick and lucrative interest, and lied about the true nature of the loans during the company’s internal investigation.  Ji also lied to the company’s auditors by signing a letter stating that the two loans were for business purposes and the borrowers were not related parties., The SEC also alleges that in the fourth quarter of 2008, China Natural Gas paid $19.6 million to acquire a natural gas company but did not timely and properly report the transaction in its SEC filings.  As with the loans, Ji approved the acquisition without obtaining prior authorization from the board., The complaint alleges that China Natural Gas and Ji violated or aided and abetted violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13, and 14a-9.  The complaint further alleges that Ji violated Exchange Act Section 13(b)(5) and Rules 13a-14, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2.  Ji also is charged with violating provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act that require him to repay China Natural Gas the bonuses and stock sale profits he received after the company filed false reports with the SEC.  The SEC’s complaint seeks a final judgment that imposes financial penalties, bars Ji from acting as an officer or director of a public company, and permanently enjoins Ji and China Natural Gas from future violations of these provisions.,  ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22368.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Regulation FD generally prohibits public companies from selectively disclosing material non-public information to certain investors without simultaneously disclosing it to all investors. Among other things, Marino has agreed to pay a $50,000 civil penalty., On March 9, 2010, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action against Marino and Presstek, a manufacturer and distributor of high-technology digital imaging equipment. The Commissions complaint alleged that on September 28, 2006, while acting on behalf of Presstek, Marino selectively disclosed material non-public information regarding Pressteks financial performance during the third quarter of 2006 to partner of a registered investment adviser. According to the complaint, within minutes of receiving the information from Marino, the partner decided to sell all of the shares of Presstek stock managed by the investment adviser.

22370,2012,[<h3>SEC CHARGES U.S. PERPETRATORS IN $35 MILLION INTERNATIONAL BOILER ROOM SCHEME </h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that the SEC filed an action today against SEC recidivist Nicholas Louis Geranio, Keith Michael Field, The Good One, Inc. and Kaleidoscope Real Estate, Inc. for their roles in a $35 million scheme to manipulate the market and to profit from the issuance and sale of certain U.S. companies’ (“Issuers’”) stock through offshore boiler rooms. The scheme ran from approximately April 2007 to October 2009.  , According to the SEC’s complaint, the scheme worked as follows:  Geranio organized eight U.S. Issuers, installed management (including Field), and entered into consulting agreements with them through his <em>alter-ego</em> entities The Good One and Kaleidoscope.  Geranio then allegedly set up a common system to raise money through the Issuers’ sale of Regulation S shares to offshore investors by boiler rooms that Geranio recruited.  Field allegedly drafted materially misleading business plans, marketing materials, and website material for the Issuers, which the offshore boiler rooms provided to investors as part of their fraudulent solicitation efforts.  , The complaint further alleges that Geranio directed traders, including Field, to engage in matched orders and manipulative trades to establish artificially high prices for at least five of the Issuers’ stock and to deceptively convey to the market the impression that legitimate transactions had created <em>bona fide</em> prices for the stock.  According to the complaint, this manipulation of the publicly-traded stock price allowed the boiler rooms to sell the Regulation S shares at a higher price to the overseas investors.   The complaint alleges that the boiler rooms, teams of unregistered telemarketers operating mostly from Spain, used high-pressure sales tactics and materially false statements and omissions to induce the investors (many of them elderly and located in the United Kingdom) to buy the Issuers’ Regulation S stock.  Investors then sent their money to U.S.-based escrow agents, who paid 60% to 75% of the approximately $35 million in proceeds to the boiler rooms as their sales markups, kept 2.5% as their fee, and paid the remaining proceeds to the Issuers.  The Issuers (or in some cases the escrow agents) then funneled approximately $2.135 million of the proceeds of the Regulation S sales to Geranio, through The Good One and Kaleidoscope, and paid Field approximately $279,000.  , The SEC filed its action in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, alleging that: Geranio, Field, The Good One and Kaleidoscope violated Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder; Field also violated Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act and aided and abetted the Issuers’ violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder; and Geranio also is liable as a control person of The Good One and Kaleidoscope under Exchange Act Section 20(a). The SEC seeks in its action permanent injunctions, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and penny stock bars against all defendants, and also officer and director bars against Geranio and Field. The complaint further seeks disgorgement and prejudgment interest against relief defendant BWRE Hawaii, LLC based on its alleged receipt of investor funds., The Issuers from April 2007 through October 2009 were: Green Energy Live, Inc.; Spectrum Acquisition Holdings, Inc.; United States Oil &amp; Gas Corp.; Mundus Group, Inc.; Blu Vu Deep Oil &amp; Gas Exploration, Inc.; Wyncrest Group, Inc.; Microresearch Corp.; and Power Nanotech, Inc. , In 2000, the United States District Court for the Central District of California enjoined Geranio from future violations of the antifraud and securities registration provisions of the federal securities laws as part of his settlement of an enforcement action that the SEC brought against him and California Laser Company.

Spangler served as chairman and CEO of one of the companies, which is now bankrupt. Such risky investments were inconsistent with the investment strategies that Spangler promised his clients and contrary to their investment objectives., The U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Western District of Washington also announced parallel criminal charges against Spangler., According to the SECâs complaint filed in federal court in Seattle, Spangler raised more than $56 million from his clients since 1998 for several private investment funds he managed. Beginning around 2003, without notifying investors in the funds, Spangler and his advisory firm The Spangler Group (TSG) began diverting the majority of client money into two private technology companies he created. One of the companies received nearly $42 million from the funds before shutting down operations. It had long been a cash-poor company with a history of net losses, generating less than $100,000 in revenue during its 11-year history. Yet Spangler continued to treat the funds as the companyâs piggy bank., The SEC alleges that Spangler also did not tell investors that TSG collected fees for âfinancial and operational supportâ from these companies, which were essentially paying these fees with the client money they had received from the funds. Therefore, Spangler and his firm secretly reaped $830,000 from the companies in addition to any management fees that TSG received from clients., According to the SECâs complaint, Spangler concealed his diversion of client funds for years. He disclosed it only after he placed TSG and the funds he managed into state court receivership in 2011., The SECâs complaint charges Spangler and TSG with violating, among other things, the antifraud provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

The SEC alleges that Kwok and Shah illegally tipped and traded on material, nonpublic information concerning Yahoo and Moldflow Corporation., The SECâs complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that Kwok and Shah, both Bay Area residents, first met in 2008, and thereafter spoke frequently in person and over the telephone.  According to the complaint, Kwok provided Shah with information about Yahoo, and in return Shah provided Kwok with information she learned during the course of her work, which Kwok used in making personal investment decisions.  , The SEC alleges that in July 2009, Kwok, in breach of his duty to Yahoo, tipped Shah material, nonpublic information that an internet search engine partnership agreement between Yahoo and Microsoft Corporation, which had long been the subject of market rumors, would announced soon.  The SEC alleges that, based on Kwokâs tip, Shah caused certain of the funds she helped manage, including the Seligman Communications and Information Fund, to purchase approximately 700,000 shares of Yahoo.  The shares were later sold resulting in profits of approximately $389,000.  , The SEC further alleges that, in April 2008, Shah tipped Kwok material, nonpublic information concerning an upcoming acquisition of Moldflow by Autodesk, Inc.  As alleged in the complaint, this inside information had been misappropriated by an Autodesk insider and tipped to Shah.  The SEC alleges that, based on this tip, Kwok purchased 1,500 shares of Moldflow in a personal account, which he subsequently sold after announcement of the acquisition, realizing profits of approximately $4,750.  , As a result of the conduct alleged in the complaint, the SEC alleges that Kwok and Shah violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Both Kwok and Shah have agreed to consent to judgments, which are subject to Court approval.  The judgments permanently enjoin both defendants from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5, bar Kwok from serving as an officer or director of public company, and provide that the Court will later determine issues relating to disgorgement and civil penalties.

22373,2012,[<h3>SEC CHARGES NEW JERSEY MAN IN REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT SCAM</h3>],"[On May 17, 2012, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged a New Jersey man with operating a Ponzi-like scheme involving a series of investment vehicles formed for the purported purpose of purchasing and managing rental apartment buildings in New Jersey and Pennsylvania., The SEC alleges that David M. Connolly induced investors to buy shares in real estate investment vehicles he created through his firm Connolly Properties Inc.  He promised investors monthly dividends based on cash-flow profits from rental income at the apartment buildings as well as the growth of their principal from the appreciation of the property.  However, the real estate investments did not produce the projected dividends, and Connolly instead made Ponzi-like dividend payments to earlier investors using money from new investors.  Connolly, who lives in Watchung, N.J., also siphoned off at least $2 million in investor funds for his personal use., The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey, which conducted a parallel investigation of the matter, announced that Connolly was indicted on one count of securities fraud among other criminal charges., According to the SEC’s complaint filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, none of Connolly’s securities offerings in the investment vehicles were registered with the SEC as required under the federal securities laws.  He began offering the investments in 1996 and ultimately raised in excess of $50 million from more than 200 investors in more than 25 investment vehicles.  However, beginning in at least 2006, Connolly misrepresented to investors that their funds would be used exclusively for the property related to the particular vehicle in which they invested.  Connolly instead commingled the funds in bank accounts that he alone controlled and used for a variety of purposes that weren’t disclosed to investors, including $2 million in payments he made to himself that vastly exceeded any dividends to which he would be entitled through his ownership stake.  Between 2007 and 2010, Connolly also wrote checks to “cash” in excess of $2.5 million.  Even after Connolly stopped making dividend payments to investors in April 2009, he still continued to pay himself dividends as well as a $250,000 “salary” out of investor funds., The SEC alleges that Connolly lacked sufficient revenues from rental income at the apartment buildings, so he continued to raise millions of dollars for new investment vehicles.  He used the funds to pay purported monthly cash-flow dividends in excess of 10 percent to investors in older investment vehicles.  Connolly refinanced properties and improperly used the cash proceeds to continue the scheme, which ultimately collapsed in 2009 when new investor funds dried up and rental income was insufficient to support payments on the mortgages.  The properties owned by the investment vehicles were forced into foreclosure, wiping out the equity of the investors., The SEC’s complaint charges Connolly with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Guth Settles SEC Insider Trading Charge Concerning Omrix Tender Offer</h3>],"[The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a settled civil injunctive action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that Stephen H. Guth violated Section 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 14e-3 promulgated thereunder, by buying Omrix Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. common stock ahead of a November 2008 public announcement that Johnson &amp; Johnson, Inc. was making a tender offer for the outstanding shares of Omrix stock. Guth, a U.S. citizen residing in the United Kingdom, is a self-employed consultant and had been the Chief Financial Officer of Omrix from 1996 to 2000., The Commissionâs complaint alleges the following: On October 3, 2008, after Johnson &amp; Johnson had taken substantial steps to commence the tender offer, Guth received an unsolicited communication from the Chief Executive Officer of Omrix requesting assistance with due diligence questions pertaining to transactions that occurred while Guth worked for the company. In October and November 2008, the Chief Executive Officer of Omrix had additional communications with Guth related to due diligence questions. As a result of his communications with the Omrix CEO, Guth learned that an acquisition of Omrix was likely, and he purchased 7,000 shares of Omrix common stock. Guth purchased Omrix securities while in possession of material information relating to the tender offer, which he knew or had reason to know was nonpublic and had been acquired from an officer of the issuer whose securities were to be sought. On November 23, 2008, Omrix and Johnson &amp; Johnson jointly announced the tender offer. Thereafter, defendant Guth tendered his shares of Omrix stock, realizing profits exceeding $60,000., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissionâs complaint, Guth has consented to entry of a proposed Final Judgment that would enjoin him from future violations of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14e-3 thereunder, order him to disgorge $63,517, with prejudgment interest of $7,695.49; and impose a civil penalty of $31,758.

22375,2012,[<h3>SEC CHARGES NORTHERN CALIFORNIA FUND MANAGER IN $60 MILLION SCHEME</h3>],"[On May 24, 2012, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged an investment adviser in Scotts Valley, Calif., with running a $60 million investment fund like a Ponzi scheme and defrauding investors by touting imaginary trading profits instead of reporting the actual trading losses he had incurred., The SEC alleges that John A. Geringer, who managed the GLR Growth Fund (Fund), used false and misleading marketing materials to lure investors into believing that the Fund was earning double-digit annual returns by investing 75% of its assets in investments tied to well-known stock indices like the S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, and Dow Jones.  In reality, Geringer’s trading generated consistent losses and he eventually stopped trading entirely.  To mask his fraud, Geringer paid millions of dollars in “returns” to investors largely by using money received from newer investors.  He also sent investors periodic account statements showing fictitious growth in their investments., According to the SEC’s complaint filed in federal court in San Jose, Geringer raised more than $60 million since 2005, mostly from investors in the Santa Cruz area.  Geringer used fraudulent marketing materials claiming that the Fund had between 17 and 25 percent annual returns in every year of the Fund’s operation through investments tied to major stock indices.  Although the Fund was started in 2003, marketing materials claimed 25 percent returns in 2001 and 2002 – before the Fund even existed.  The marketing materials also falsely indicated a nearly 24 percent return in 2008 from investing mainly in publicly traded securities, options, and commodities, while the S&amp;P 500 Index lost 38.5 percent., The SEC alleges that Geringer’s actual securities trading was unsuccessful, and by mid-2009 the Fund did not invest in publicly traded securities at all.  Instead, the Fund invested heavily in illiquid investments in two private startup technology companies.  The rest of the money was paid to investors in Ponzi-like fashion and to three entities Geringer controlled that also are charged in the SEC’s complaint., According to the SEC’s complaint, Geringer further lied to investors on account statements that falsely claimed “MEMBER NASD AND SEC APPROVED.”  The SEC does not “approve” funds or investments in funds, nor was the Fund (or any related entity) a member of the NASD (now called the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority – FINRA).  Geringer also falsely claimed that the Fund’s financial statements were audited annually by an independent accountant.  No such audits were performed.     , The SEC’s complaint alleges Geringer and three related entities violated or aided and abetted violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 206(1), (2), and (4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.  The complaint also alleges the defendants violated or aided and abetted violations of  Section 26 of the Exchange Act, which bars persons from claiming the SEC has passed on the merits of a particular investment.  The SEC’s complaint names the Fund as a relief defendant.  The complaint seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, civil monetary penalties, and other relief.  Geringer, the Fund, and two of the GLR entities consented to the entry of a preliminary injunction and a freeze on the Fund’s bank account.  , The SEC’s investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Robert J. Durham and Robert S. Leach of the San Francisco Regional Office.  The SEC’s litigation will be led by Sheila O’Callaghan of the San Francisco Regional Office., The SEC thanks the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and FINRA for their assistance in this matter.  ,  ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22375.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The SEC also has agreed to settle related charges against Roberto Aleph Espinosa, a former resident of Miami, Florida, who, in conjunction with Gomez, provided investment advisory and brokerage services to the Client., In the complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, the SEC alleges that in 2007, Gomez, age 42, the president of Atlantic International Capital LLC (âAtlanticâ), lured the Client, a Mexican national, to invest $10.8 million with him by making false claims about his affiliation with two large financial institutions and the Clientâs proposed relationship with those entities., According to the SECâs complaint, Gomez misappropriated at least $4.3 million from this Client between September 2007 and December 2010. Gomez concealed his misappropriation by providing the Client with fake account statements and securities certificates. Gomez also sent correspondence to the Client misrepresenting, among other things, his ability to withdraw money from his account., The SEC alleges, among other things, that Espinosa, age 37, the president of now defunct Florida corporation Aleph Consulting Group LLC (âAlephâ), and Gomez invested approximately $3 million of the Clientâs funds in the ACG Global Fund, Ltd., a hedge fund started by Espinosa and managed by Aleph. Aleph received retrocession fees in connection with the purchase of certain securities that were not disclosed to any of the hedge fund investors, including the Client., The complaint also alleges that Espinosa forwarded to the foreign financial services firm holding the Clientâs brokerage account scores of withdrawal requests signed by Gomez directing the Clientâs funds to Gomez controlled accounts, while simultaneously failing to discuss Gomezâs depletion of the account with the Client in breach of his fiduciary duties., The Commissionâs complaint charges Gomez with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ) and Rule 10b-5(a), (b), and (c) thereunder; and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (âAdvisers Actâ).

The Commission alleged that, since December 2010, Roche had raised over $1.3 million from at least 14 investors in nine states through the offer and sale of high yield promissory notes purportedly yielding either 5-10% per month, or a 200% return within 14 months.  According to the Commission’s complaint, Roche represented to some investors that funds supplied would be invested in bonds, Treasury notes and/or 10-year Treasury note futures contracts, and to others that the funds would be invested directly in New Futures, purportedly an on-line futures day-trading training business Roche was operating from Canada.  The complaint alleged that, instead of using the funds for either purpose, Roche used approximately $937,000 provided by New Futures investors to make Ponzi “interest” payments to investors in prior Roche-controlled entities.  According to the Commission’s complaint, Roche also misappropriated at least another $359,000 to support his lifestyle, to operate a horse breeding venture, and to buy horses.  At the time the action was originally filed by the Commission, the court issued a temporary restraining order (later converted to a preliminary injunction) that, among other things, froze the assets of New Futures and Roche and prohibited them from continuing to solicit or accept investor funds., The court, acting on the Commission’s motion for default judgments, entered final judgments: (1) imposing permanent injunctions against both New Futures and Roche enjoining them from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; (2) ordering them each to pay disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains in the amount of $1,242,972 plus prejudgment interest of $40,917.47; and (3) ordering Roche to pay a monetary penalty in the amount of $150,000 and New Futures to pay a monetary penalty in the amount of $150,000. , The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Ontario Securities Commission and the New Hampshire Bureau of Securities in this matter., For further information, <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr22159.htm>see Litigation Release No. 22159</a> (November 17, 2011).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22377.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"
22381,2012,[<h3>SEC Charges Penny Stock Financiers and Two Public Companies With Illegal Unregistered Stock Distributions</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil injunctive action today in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida against Mark A. Lefkowitz, Compass Capital Group, Inc., Mark A. Lopez, Unico, Inc., Steven R. Peacock, Shane H. Traveller, and Advanced Cell Technology, Inc., alleging that they violated the federal securities laws in connection with the unregistered distribution of billions of shares of penny stocks through the repeated misuse of the exemption from registration contained in Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act of 1933.  , Section 3(a)(10) provides an exemption from registration that permits a company to issue common stock to public investors “in exchange for one or more bona fide outstanding securities, claims or property interests” without having to file a registration statement “where the terms and conditions of such issuance and exchange are approved after a hearing upon the fairness of such terms and conditions” by any court or any governmental authority “expressly authorized by law to grant such approval.”  The Complaint alleges that the Section 3(a)(10) exemption was not available for any of the stock offerings at issue because the terms and conditions of the exchanges – including the fact that the issuers were raising capital through such exchanges – were not fully disclosed to the court.  , According to the Commission’s Complaint, in or about early 2006, Lefkowitz, a penny stock financier, devised a strategy for penny stock issuers to pay off past due debts while, at the same time, improperly raising additional capital in reliance upon Section 3(a)(10).  According to the Complaint, Lefkowitz executed his illegal strategy with Lopez, the chief executive officer of Unico, a penny stock issuer based in California, and William Caldwell IV, the chief executive officer of Advanced Cell Technology, a penny stock issuer based in Massachusetts.  The Complaint further alleges that Peacock and Traveller, two penny stock financiers who learned of the illegal strategy from Lefkowitz, executed the strategy with Unico and other penny stock issuers., The Complaint alleges that from September 9, 2006 through January 29, 2009, in order to satisfy the fairness hearing requirement of Section 3(a)(10), more than fifty pre-settled lawsuits were filed in a Florida state court purportedly to settle past due debts owed by Unico, Advanced Cell, or other penny stock issuers (collectively, the “Penny Stock Issuers”) to Compass Capital Group and several offshore financing entities affiliated with Lefkowitz, and Sequoia International, Inc., an entity affiliated with Peacock and Traveller (collectively, the “Financiers”).  The Complaint further alleges that in each case, one of the Penny Stock Issuers entered into a written settlement agreement with one or more of the Financiers whereby the Penny Stock Issuer agreed to issue unrestricted common stock to the Financiers at a substantial discount to the prevailing market price, purportedly to retire the past due debt.  The settlement shares allegedly were worth multiple times more than the debt that was to be extinguished and the Financiers agreed to remit monies to the Penny Stock Issuer following the sale of the settlement shares to the public on the open market.  According to the Complaint, none of the settlement agreements submitted to the court for approval, disclosed, nor did the parties ever apprise the presiding judges of, the existence of the side agreements, that the market value of the shares to be issued greatly exceeded the debts that were to be extinguished, or that significant sums of monies would be remitted to the Penny Stock Issuers as a result of the Section 3(a)(10) settlements. , According to the Complaint, at the conclusion of each of the hearings, the Florida state court granted a Section 3(a)(10) exemption from registration and, thereafter, unrestricted shares were issued to the Financiers, who quickly sold the shares on the open market to public investors unaware of the dilutive effects of the new stock issuances.  Also according to the Complaint, the Financiers subsequently remitted millions of dollars to the Penny Stock Issuers, either directly or through an intermediary, as financing, making it an improper capital raising transaction for the Penny Stock Issuers.  , The Complaint alleges that Unico extinguished approximately $4.0 million in past due debts but separately raised more than $9.2 million as a result of monies later remitted to it by the Financiers.  Advanced Cell allegedly extinguished $1.1 million in debts while separately raising more than $3.5 million through monies later remitted by or on behalf of the Financiers.  The Other Penny Stock Issuers allegedly collectively extinguished approximately $1 million in debts while separately raising more than $1.2 million.  The Complaint also alleges that Lefkowitz and his affiliated entities profited by at least $1.7 million from these transactions and that Peacock and Traveller profited by at least $455,000., The Complaint alleges that Unico filed false and misleading disclosures with the Commission concerning the monies it received from the Financiers and that Unico and Advanced Cell failed to timely disclose the settlement agreements and issuance of over 9 billion and 260 million unregistered shares of their respective common stocks in connection with the Section 3(a)(10) settlements.  In addition, the complaint further alleges that Peacock, aided and abetted by Traveller, failed to report his beneficial ownership of more than five percent of the outstanding shares of Unico common stock in December 2006. , The Complaint charges all of the defendants with violations of the securities offering registration provisions, Unico and Advanced Cell with periodic reporting violations, Lopez for aiding and abetting Unico’s periodic reporting violations, Peacock with beneficial ownership reporting violations, and Traveller for aiding and abetting Peacock’s ownership reporting violations.  The Commission seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of illegal profits with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties as to Unico, Advanced Cell, Peacock, and Traveller; a permanent injunction and a civil penalty as to Lopez; disgorgement of illegal profits with prejudgment interest and civil penalties as to Lefkowitz and Compass Capital; and an order barring Lefkowitz, Compass Capital, Lopez, Peacock, and Traveller from participating in any future offerings of penny stock. , Lefkowitz, Compass Capital, and Traveller previously have been enjoined from violating various provisions of the federal securities laws, including the antifraud provisions, in connection with unrelated conduct that also involved the misuse of an exemption from registration of securities offerings.

The SEC alleges that George Levin and Frank Preve, who live in the Fort Lauderdale area, raised more than $157 million from 173 investors in less than two years by issuing promissory notes from Levinâs company and interests in a private investment fund they operated. They used investor funds to purchase discounted legal settlements from former Florida attorney Scott Rothstein through his prominent law firm Rothstein Rosenfeldt and Adler PA. However, the settlements Rothstein sold were not real and the supposed plaintiffs and defendants did not exist. Rothstein simply used the funds in classic Ponzi scheme fashion to make payments due other investors and support his lavish lifestyle. Rothsteinâs Ponzi scheme collapsed in October 2009, and he is currently serving a 50-year prison sentence., According to the SECâs complaint filed in federal court in Miami, Levin and Preve began raising money to purchase Rothstein settlements in 2007 by offering investors short-term promissory notes issued by Levinâs company â Banyon 1030-32 LLC. In 2009, seeking additional funds from investors, they formed a private investment fund called Banyon Income Fund LP that invested exclusively in Rothsteinâs settlements. Banyon 1030-32 served as the general partner of the fund, and its profit was generated from the amount by which the settlement discounts obtained from Rothstein exceeded the rate of return promised to investors., The SEC alleges that the offering materials for the promissory notes and the private fund contained material misrepresentations and omissions. They misrepresented to investors that prior to any settlement purchase, Banyon 1030-32 would obtain certain documentation about the settlements to ensure the safety of the investments. Levin and Preve, however, knew or were reckless in not knowing that Banyon 1030-32 often purchased settlements from Rothstein without obtaining any documentation whatsoever., Furthermore, Banyon Income Fundâs private placement memorandum misrepresented that the fund would be a continuation of a successful business strategy pursued by Banyon 1030-32 during the prior two-and-a-half years. Levin and Preve failed to disclose that by the time the Banyon Income Fund offering began in May 2009, Rothstein had already ceased making payments on a majority of the prior settlements Levin and his entities had purchased. They also failed to inform investors that Levinâs ability to recover his prior investments from Rothstein was contingent on his ability to raise at least $100 million of additional funding to purchase more settlements from Rothstein., The SECâs complaint charges Levin and Preve with violating Section 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Ellerman, another stock promoter.  , The complaint alleges that between December 2004 through November 2006, Dial and Jarvis caused Grifco, a publicly-traded corporation that claimed to be an international provider of oil and gas services equipment, to issue over 13 million purportedly unrestricted Grifco securities to Ellerman, themselves or their nominees.  The complaint alleges that Dial, Jarvis and Ellerman sold the Grifco securities to the investing public shortly after receiving their shares, often times selling those shares into a rising, artificial market they created by disseminating false and material misleading information about Grifco to prospective investors and shareholders.  None of the securities transactions were registered with the SEC and the transactions did not satisfy any exemption from registration according to the complaint.  The SEC alleges that, as a result of this conduct, Dial, Jarvis, and Ellerman collectively received nearly $3.3 million in ill-gotten gains from the sale of newly-issued Grifco stock.

Bethke used the stolen certificates, which had been pre-printed with the signatures of Bederra officers and directors, to secretly issue over a billion Bederra shares, which he then sold in exchange for payments into his personal bank account of over $350,000. Among other things, Bethke signed purchase agreements falsely warranting that he had good title to the shares and that they were âfreely tradableâ when, in fact, he had orchestrated the misappropriation of the shares, and the sales were not eligible for any exemption from registration under the securities laws. To carry out his scheme, Bethke forged the signature of Bederraâs chief executive officer on certifications claiming that Bederra was aware of the sales when the company knew nothing about the transactions. Bethke also prepared letters falsely stating that he had obtained the shares from the company more than a year before, and that the sales were therefore exempt from registration under the securities laws. , Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissionâs complaint, Bethke consented to a final judgment enjoining him from violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; barring him from serving as an officer or director of a public company; barring him from participating in the offering or sale of a penny stock; and ordering disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, but waiving payment and not imposing a civil penalty based on Bethkeâs financial condition. The judgment is subject to court approval. Bethke also consented, with respect to a related SEC administrative proceeding, to the entry of an SEC order barring him from association with any investment adviser, broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, transfer agent, or nationally recognized statistical organization.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22385.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Today, with Martel’s consent, a federal judge entered an order freezing Martel’s assets and prohibiting him from continuing to violate the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  , According to the complaint, Martel told investors, many of whom were retirees looking for a safe investment earning reliable income, that he would place their money in “pass-through bonds” or other purported fixed income or pooled investment products, which he assured investors were safe.  The complaint alleges that Martel gave investors purported account statements showing interest earned and sometimes made small distributions of supposed interest, which encouraged investors to give Martel more money to invest.  Martel also allegedly offered other fraudulent investments.  In March 2012, according to the complaint, Martel solicited investments in a Facebook investment pool, claiming it would allow small investors to “own a piece” of the Facebook IPO.  In fact, however, the complaint alleges that the investments Martel offered were fictitious and/or no longer exist, and that he transferred funds out of the bank account where investor funds were deposited to bank accounts he maintained for his businesses., The Commission’s complaint alleges that Martel violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933; Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

Â§ 80b-6(4); 17 C.F.R. Â§ 275.206(4)-8]. These violations were based upon allegations that defendants took $12 million in proceeds from an investment under their management and misappropriated those proceeds for their own use, rather than distributing those proceeds to investors., At the same time that it filed the Complaint, the Commission also filed the written Consents of Goldfarb and of Baystar Capital to the entry of a Final Judgment against them.

The Court also found that defendants had failed to establish a good faith effort to fulfill their disgorgement obligations because, among other things, they used available funds for large personal expenses such as courtside seats to Golden State Warriors games, charters of aircraft for personal trips, Goldfarbâs mortgage payment and numerous personal vacations, rather than to pay disgorgement., In the Order, the Court also approved the appointment of a receiver over defendantsâ assets and reaffirmed its prior order limiting Goldfarbâs monthly spending., For additional information, please see Litigation Release No. 21870 (Mar. 1, 2011) and Press Release No. 2011-54 (Mar. 1, 2011).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22397.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Nguyen repeatedly traded for himself in advance of the companyâs quarterly earnings announcements while in possession of key data in those announcements, reaping tens of thousands of dollars in illicit profits. Nguyen also passed that same information to hedge fund clients of Insight Research, who used the inside information to make millions of dollars in profits from trading Abaxis securities., According to the SECâs complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, Nguyen regularly obtained material nonpublic information about Abaxis Inc.âs quarterly earnings -- including revenues, gross profit margins and earnings per share -- from a relative who worked in Abaxisâs finance department. Nguyen used the information to trade Abaxis securities in his own account and reaped approximately $145,000 in illicit trading profits from 2006 through 2009., In addition to trading in his own account, the SEC alleges that Nguyen passed the inside information to New York-based Barai Capital Management and Boston-based Sonar Capital Management, both of which were clients of Nguyenâs firm, Insight Research.

The case follows the SECâs recent related action against the Malaysia Fundâs primary adviser, MSIM, and is part of an inquiry into the investment advisory contract renewal process by the SEC Enforcement Divisionâs Asset Management Unit., AMCâs advisory fees were approved each year from 1996 to 2007 as part of the â15(c) process,â a reference to Section 15(c) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, which requires a registered fundâs board to annually evaluate the fundâs advisory agreements, and advisers to provide the board with information reasonably necessary to make that evaluation., According to the SEC, AMC submitted a report to the Malaysia Fundâs board of directors each year that falsely claimed that AMC was providing specific advice, research, and assistance to MSIM for the benefit of the fund. In reality, the SECâs complaint said AMCâs services were limited to providing two monthly reports based on publicly available information that MSIM did not request or use. Moreover, the SEC alleged that AMC failed to adopt and implement adequate policies, procedures, and controls over its advisory business, contrary to certifications provided to the fundâs directors in 2006 and 2007. AMCâs advisory agreement with the fund was terminated in early 2008 after the SECâs examination staff inquired about the services AMC was purportedly providing to the fund., The SECâs complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, alleges that AMC breached its fiduciary duty with respect to the receipt of compensation within the meaning of Section 36(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940. The SEC also alleges that AMC violated Sections 206(2) and (4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and Rule 206(4)-7 thereunder, and Section 15(c) of the Investment Company Act of 1940. AMC consented to a judgment that bars it from violating these provisions in the future. AMC has also agreed to disgorge $1.3 million of its advisory fees paid by the fund and pay a $250,000 penalty., Chad Alan Earnst, Christine Lynch, and Jessica Weiner, of the Enforcement Divisionâs Asset Management Unit staff, conducted the investigation along with Tonya Tullis and Edward D. McCutcheon. Karen Stevenson, Susan Schneider, and Dennis Delaney conducted the related examinations., The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the Securities Commission of Malaysia and the Monetary Authority of Singapore.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22402.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"
22403,2012,[<h3>SEC Charges Philip A. Falcone and Harbinger Charged with Securities Fraud</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed fraud charges against New York-based hedge fund adviser Philip A. Falcone and his advisory firm, Harbinger Capital Partners LLC, for illicit conduct that included misappropriation of client assets, market manipulation, and betraying clients. The SEC also charged Peter A. Jenson, Harbingerâs former Chief Operating Officer, for aiding and abetting the misappropriation scheme. Additionally, the SEC reached a settlement with Harbinger for unlawful trading., In a separate settled action, the SEC charged Harbert Management Corporation, whose affiliates served as the managing members of two Harbinger-related entities, as a controlling person in the market manipulation., The SEC alleges that Falcone used fund assets to pay his taxes, conducted an illegal âshort squeezeâ to manipulate bond prices, secretly favored certain customers at the expense of others, and that Harbinger unlawfully bought equity securities in a public offering, after having sold short the same security during a restricted period., The SEC filed actions in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against Falcone, Jenson, and Harbinger, and, in connection with the illegal trading scheme, separately instituted and settled administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings against Harbinger., In particular, the SEC alleges that:, Falcone fraudulently obtained $113.2 million from a hedge fund that he advised and misappropriated the proceeds to pay his personal taxes;, Falcone and two Harbinger investment managers through which Falcone operated manipulated the price and availability of a series of distressed high-yield bonds by engaging in an illegal âshort squeeze;â, Falcone and Harbinger secretly offered and granted favorable redemption and liquidity rights to certain strategically-important investors in exchange for those investorsâ consent to restrict redemption rights of other fund investors, and concealed the arrangement from the fundâs directors and investors; and, Harbinger engaged in illegal trades in connection with the purchase of common stock in three public offerings after having sold the same securities short during a restricted period., In the misappropriation scheme, the SEC alleges that Falcone unlawfully used fund assets to pay his personal taxes. In 2009 Falcone owed federal and state authorities $113.2 million in taxes. Declining to pursue other financing options, such as pledging his personal assets as collateral for a bank loan, Falcone elected instead to take a $113.2 million loan from the Harbinger Capital Partners Special Situations Fund, L.P. â the same fund from which Harbinger had earlier suspended investors from redeeming., Falcone authorized the transfer of fund assets to himself in a transaction that Jenson helped structure. Falcone and Harbinger never sought or obtained the consent of its investors prior to using the funds assets to benefit Falcone., As part of the misappropriation scheme, the SEC alleges that Falcone and Harbinger, aided by Jenson, made several material misrepresentations and omissions in seeking legal advice regarding the loan and in subsequent communications with investors, including, among other things:, the financing alternatives available to Falcone;, the circumstances that led to Falconeâs need for the loan;, the ability of the Special Situations Fund to furnish the loan, without disadvantaging investors;, the terms and conditions of the loan, including the interest rate charged and the amount of collateral posted by Falcone; and, the role of Harbingerâs outside legal counsel in vetting the transaction., The SEC also alleges that Falcone and Harbinger delayed disclosing the loan for approximately five months because of their concern that disclosure of Falconeâs financial condition might have a negative impact on investor withdrawals and on Falconeâs ability to attract more investments for other Harbinger funds. Falcone repaid the loan in 2011, after the Commission commenced its investigation., In a separate civil action, the SEC alleges that from 2006 through early 2008 Falcone and two Harbinger investment management entities manipulated the market in a series of distressed high-yield bonds issued by MAAX Holdings Inc. In this fraudulent scheme, Falcone and the Harbinger entities allegedly orchestrated an illegal âshort squeezeâ â a market manipulation scheme in which an investor constricts the supply of a security, through large purchases or other means, with the intent of forcing settlement from short sellers at arbitrary and inflated prices., The SECâs complaint alleges that at Falconeâs direction, Harbinger purchased a large position in the MAAX bonds during April and June of 2006. After hearing rumors that a Wall Street financial services firm was shorting the MAAX bonds and also encouraging its customers to do the same, Falcone decided to seek revenge. In September 2006, Falcone directed the Harbinger-managed funds to buy every available bond in the market, often purchasing the bonds from short sellers. Ultimately, Falcone raised the fundsâ stake to approximately 13 percent more than the available supply of the MAAX bonds., At one point, Harbinger had purchased 22 million more bonds than MAAX had ever issued. Contemporaneously with these purchases, Falcone locked up the MAAX bonds the Harbinger funds had purchased in a custodial account at a bank in Georgia to prevent his brokers from lending out the bonds to sellers seeking to deliver the bonds to purchasers after short sales., Having seized control of the supply of the MAAX bonds, Falcone then demanded that the Wall Street firm and its customers settle their outstanding MAAX short sales, not disclosing that it would be virtually impossible to find bonds available for delivery. The Wall Street firm bid daily for the bonds, which quickly doubled in price. Then, Falcone engaged in a series of transactions with certain short sellers at arbitrary, inflated prices, while at the same time valuing the fundsâ holdings on his books at a small fraction of the prices he charged the covering short sellers., In its action alleging misappropriation, the SEC also alleges that, in a further breach of Falcone and Harbingerâs fiduciary duties to their clients, Falcone and Harbinger engaged in unlawful preferential redemptions for the benefit of certain favored investors., In 2009, while soliciting required investor approval to restrict withdrawals from another Harbinger fund, Falcone and Harbinger secretly exempted certain large investors that Falcone deemed to be strategically important from soon-to-be imposed liquidity restrictions â provided those investors voted to approve restrictions that would temporarily stabilize the decline in Harbingerâs assets under management., Ultimately, pursuant to these âvote buyingâ agreements, Falcone and Harbinger allegedly permitted these investors who were connected to certain favored institutional investors to withdraw a total of approximately $169 million. Harbinger concealed these <i>quid pro quo</i> arrangements from the independent directors and from fund investors., In a separate administrative and cease-and-desist proceeding, the SEC found that between April and June 2009, Harbinger violated Rule 105 of Regulation M of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act). Rule 105 is an anti-manipulation rule that prohibits short selling securities during a restricted period and then purchasing the same securities in a public offering., The Commissionâs Order censures Harbinger and requires the firm to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations of Rule 105 now or in the future. Harbinger will pay disgorgement in the amount of $857,950, prejudgment interest in the amount of $91,838, and a civil monetary penalty in the amount of $428,975. Harbinger consented to the issuance of the Order without admitting or denying any of the Commissionâs findings., In a separate complaint also filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, the SEC filed a settled civil action against Harbert and two related investment entities â HMC-New York Inc. and HMC Investors, LLC â for their role in the illegal short squeeze described above., The SEC alleges in its complaint against Harbert that during the entire period of the short squeeze, Defendants Harbert, HMC-NY and HMC Investors, directly or indirectly, possessed the power to control Falcone and the investment managers through which he operated. Defendants HMC-NY and HMC Investors, two entities controlled by Harbert, served as the managing members of two limited liability companies that acted as the general partners of the funds advised by Falcone., Harbert and its affiliates also provided hedge fund administration, legal, compliance, risk assessment and other services to the funds. In these capacities, Harbert, HMC-NY and HMC Investors knew of Falconeâs trades in the MAAX bonds, but failed to take appropriate steps to address Falconeâs manipulative conduct. The SEC charged the Harbert defendants as controlling persons pursuant to Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, alleging that they are jointly and severally liable for Falconeâs and the Harbinger investment managersâ violations of the antifraud provisions of the Exchange Act., Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, Defendants Harbert, HMC-NY and HMC Investors have agreed to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1 million. The Harbert defendants also have consented to the entry of a judgment enjoining them from violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The proposed settlement with Harbert is subject to approval by the court., <p align=center>****, The SECâs complaint relating to the misappropriation and preferential redemption action, which was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of NY (USDC for the SDNY), charges Falcone and Harbinger with violations of Section 17(a)(1), 17(a)(2), and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act); Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5(a), 10b-5(b), and 10b-5(c) thereunder; and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers Act) and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder. Falcone is further charged with a violation of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act as a control person of Harbinger, and the complaint alleges he is therefore jointly and severally liable for Harbingerâs violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5(a), 10b-5(b), and 10b-5(c) thereunder. As to Jenson, the SECâc complaint alleges that he aided and abetted Falconeâs and Harbingerâs violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5(a) and 10b-5(c) thereunder and Falconeâs and Harbingerâs violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder. In its complaint, the SEC seeks permanent injunctive relief against each defendant to enjoin them from future violations of the federal securities laws, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, financial penalties and an order barring Falcone from serving as an officer or director of a public company., The SECâs complaint relating to the short squeeze, also filed in the USDC for the SDNY, separately charges Falcone and the Harbinger entities with violations of Section 17(a)(1), 17(a)(2), and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5(a), 10b-5(b), and 10b-5(c) thereunder. In that action, the SEC also seeks permanent injunctive relief against each defendant to enjoin them from future violations of the federal securities laws, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, and financial penalties., The SECâs complaint against the Harbert defendants charges them with a violation of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act as control persons of Falcone and the Harbinger entities, and the complaint alleges they are jointly and severally liable for Falconeâs and the Harbinger entitiesâ violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5(a), 10b-5(b), and 10b-5(c) thereunder. The Harbert defendants consented to the entry of a permanent injunction enjoining them from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5(a), 10b-5(b), and 10b-5(c) thereunder. They also agreed to pay a $1 million civil penalty.<a name=P46_13214></a>, Finally, today the SEC issued an administrative order against Harbinger Capital Partners, finding that the firm willfully committed three violations of Rule 105 of Regulation M under the Exchange Act. The order censures Harbinger and requires the firm to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Rule 105. Harbinger agreed to pay disgorgement in the amount of $857,950, prejudgment interest in the amount of $91,838, and a civil monetary penalty in the amount of $428,975.<a name=P47_13733></a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22403.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The entry of these Final Judgments and the issuance of the administrative orders resolve all claims asserted by the SEC in this insider trading case., In this enforcement action, the SEC alleged that in April 2010, Clayton Peterson, having learned through confidential board meetings that Mariner was about to be acquired by Apache Corporation, tipped his son, Drew Peterson about the acquisition and instructed him to purchase Mariner securities for Clayton Petersonâs daughter. Drew Peterson used the material nonpublic information he received from his father to trade Mariner securities for his own accounts, for his family members, his investment club and investment clients, and to tip certain friends, including Brownstein. Drew Petersonâs trading and the trading of his tippees, excluding Brownstein, resulted in profits of $205,416. Brownstein used the material nonpublic information he received from Drew Peterson to trade shares for his own account, for his family members and for hedge funds managed by Big 5, Brownsteinâs registered investment advisory firm. Brownstein reaped approximately $4.6 million for Big 5 hedge funds, $305,050 for his family members and $130,671 for himself., The Final Judgments entered against Clayton Peterson and Drew Peterson: (1) permanently enjoin them from violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ) and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5; and (2) order them to pay, on a joint and several basis with each other, disgorgement of $205,416 plus prejudgment interest of $13,603, for a total of $219,019.

22405,2012,[<h3>SEC Charges Long Island Software Company in Connection with Bribery Scheme</h3>],"[On June 27, 2012, the Securities and Exchange Commission (âCommissionâ) charged that FalconStor Software, Inc., a Long Island, N.Y., data storage company, misled investors about bribes it paid to obtain business with a subsidiary of J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. FalconStor has agreed to pay a $2.9 million civil penalty to settle the Commissionâs case., The Commissionâs complaint, filed in federal district court in the Eastern District of New York, alleges that from October 2007 through July 2010, the Companyâs co-founder and then-chief executive officer, president and chairman, who is now deceased (the âCEOâ), ordered the bribes, which were paid to three executives of the subsidiary, JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, and their relatives. The bribes given and offered, which totaled approximately $430,000, included grants of FalconStor options and restricted stock, direct cash payments, gift cards, payment of golf club fees, and lavish entertainment, including gambling in Macau and Las Vegas casinos. The CEO resigned in September 2010, after admitting that he had been involved in improper payments to a customer., The complaint further alleges that shortly after the bribes began, FalconStor secured a direct, multi-million dollar, contract with JPMC, which then became one of FalconStorâs largest customers and a major source of FalconStorâs revenue during the relevant period. Thereafter, on several quarterly earnings calls and in two earnings releases filed with the Commission on Forms 8-K in April 2008 and February 2009, the CEO touted FalconStorâs large, direct contract with JPMC as a vindication of the quality and desirability of FalconStorâs products and proof of its strides in moving to direct sales rather than relying on third-party distributors. FalconStor never disclosed that JPMCâs business resulted, in whole or in part, from the inducements that it was lavishing on JPMCâs employees., The complaint also alleges that the Company also granted restricted stock and options to relatives of two of the executives even though the recipients provided no bona fide services to the Company and the grants were thus not covered by the Companyâs registered Incentive Stock Plan. In addition, the Company failed to accurately record the expenses associated with the bribes on its books and records, and failed to devise or implement a system of effective internal accounting controls to detect or prevent the bribes, which violated state law and were inconsistent with the Companyâs policies., The complaint charges FalconStor with violating the books-and-records and internal controls provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B), and the offering registration provisions and certain antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(2) and (3)., FalconStor has agreed to settle this matter by consenting to a court order permanently enjoining it from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act and Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act; ordering it to pay a civil monetary penalty of $2.9 million; and ordering it to comply with certain undertakings.

(“SB Capital”) and its principal Mark Feathers (“Feathers”). According to the Commission, SB Capital and Feathers raised $42 million by selling securities issued by two mortgage investment funds they controlled, Investors Prime Fund, LLC and SBC Portfolio Fund, LLC (“Funds”)., The Honorable Edward J. Davila for the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California granted the Commission’s request for a temporary restraining order and asset freeze against Feathers, SB Capital, and the Funds and appointed Thomas A. Seaman as a temporary receiver over SB Capital and the Funds.  , More than 400 investors were attracted to the Funds by promises that profits from mortgage investments would yield annual returns of 7.5 percent or more, the Commission alleged.  In reality, it said Feathers operated a Ponzi-like scheme by paying returns to investors that came partly from Fund profits and partly from other investors.  , The Commission said that from 2009 to early 2012, Feathers improperly transferred more than $6 million from the Funds to SB Capital to pay its expenses, including substantial payments to Feathers.  According to the Commission, the defendants had the Funds account for the transfers in a way that disguised the depletion of Fund assets, and did not tell investors that SB Capital’s ability to repay the Funds was uncertain and that it was only able to make the interest payments owed to the Funds by borrowing more from them., In addition, the Commission alleged that investors were not told that in February and March 2012, the defendants caused one Fund to sell mortgages to the other Fund at an inflated price, thus generating a “profit” for the selling Fund so it could pay SB Capital management fees of more than $575,000., The Commission also charged Feathers and SB Capital for SB Capital’s effecting transactions in the Funds’ securities without being registered as a broker-dealer with the SEC.  , The Commission’s complaint charges Feathers, SB Capital, and the Funds with violations of Section 17(a)(1)-(3) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5(a)-(c) thereunder, and Feathers and SB Capital with violations of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act; and seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions, and disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest thereon against all defendants and civil penalties against Feathers and SB Capital., Judge Davila has scheduled a court hearing for July 10, 2012, on the SEC’s motion for a preliminary injunction.,  ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22406.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Madoff Investment Securities LLC (BMIS) from 1969 to December 2008, created stacks of compliance documents setting out supposedly robust policies and procedures over BMISâs investment advisory operations. However, Peter Madoff created these compliance manuals, written supervisory procedures, reports of annual compliance reviews, and compliance certifications to merely paper the file. No policies and procedures were ever implemented, and none of the reviews were actually performed even though Peter Madoff represented that he personally completed the reviews., The U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Southern District of New York today announced parallel criminal charges against Peter Madoff., According to the SECâs complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Bernie Madoff realized in late 2008 that his decades-long scheme was on the verge of collapse. He told Peter Madoff that he could not pay billions of dollars of investor redemption requests and wanted to distribute remaining investor money to family, friends, and favored employees before the scheme collapsed. Peter Madoff then helped choose which family, friends and employees to pay, and rushed to withdraw $200,000 from BMISâs bank account for himself before the fraudâs final downfall., The SEC alleges that in addition to creating false compliance materials, Peter Madoff created false broker-dealer and investment advisor registration applications filed by BMIS. He also failed to implement and review required policies and procedures, and falsified the firmâs books and records. Peter Madoff was richly rewarded for his misconduct, pocketing tens of millions of dollars through salary and bonuses, fake trades, sham loans, and direct, undocumented transfers of investor funds to himself from the bank account that BMIS used to perpetrate the Ponzi scheme., The SECâs complaint against Peter Madoff alleges that by engaging in this conduct, he violated and aided and abetted violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 207 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940; and aided and abetted violations of Sections 15(b)(1), 15(c) and 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-3, 15b3-1 and 17a-3 thereunder, and Sections 204, 206(1), 206(2), 206(4) and 207 of the Advisers Act and Rules 204-2 and 206(4)-7 thereunder. Among other things, the SECs complaint seeks permanent injunctions, financial penalties and a court order requiring Peter Madoff to disgorge his ill-gotten gains., The SECâs investigation was conducted by Aaron P.

22409,2012,[<h3>SEC FREEZES ASSETS OF MISSING GEORGIA-BASED INVESTMENT ADVISER</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it has obtained a court order freezing the assets of a Georgia-based investment adviser who has apparently gone into hiding after orchestrating a $40 million investment fraud., The SEC alleges that Aubrey Lee Price raised money from more than 100 investors living primarily in Georgia and Florida by selling shares in an unregistered investment fund (PFG) that he managed. Price purported to invest fund assets in traditional marketable securities, but he also made illiquid investments in South America real estate and a troubled South Georgia bank. In order to conceal mounting losses of investor funds, Price created bogus account statements with false account balances and returns that were provided to investors and bank regulators., According to the SECâs complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, Price is believed to be a resident of Lowndes County in Georgia after moving from Manatee County, Fla., The SEC alleges that Price began his scheme in 2008. According to PFGâs private placement memorandum, the investment objective was to achieve âpositive total returns with low volatilityâ by investing in a variety of opportunities, including equity securities traded on the U.S. markets. A significant portion of PFG investor funds â approximately $36.9 million â was placed in a securities trading account at a broker-dealer. The trading account suffered massive trading losses and money was frequently wire-transferred to PFGâs operating bank account. Throughout the time during which PFG suffered trading losses, client account statements prepared by Price were made available to investors indicating fictitious amounts of assets and investment returns., According to the SECâs complaint, Price has sent a letter to some individuals dated June 2012 and titled âConfidential Confession For Regulators â PFG, LLC and PFGBI, LLC Summary.â In the 22-page letter, Price admits that he âfalsified statements with false returnsâ in order to conceal between $20 million and $23 million in investor losses., The SECâs complaint charged Price and his related companies, PFG, LLC; PFGBI, LLC; Montgomery Asset Management, LLC (Florida); and Montgomery Asset Management, LLC (Georgia) with violations of Section 10(b) and of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and further charged Price and Montgomery Asset Management, LLC (Florida) with violations of Sections 206(1), (2) and (4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder., The Honorable Timothy C. Batten, Sr. granted the SECâs request for a temporary restraining order and entered an asset freeze for the benefit of investors against Price, PFG, and his affiliated entities. Judge Batten has scheduled a court hearing on July 13, 2012 for the SECâs motion for a preliminary injunction., Anyone with information about Priceâs whereabouts should contact the Atlanta office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation at 404-679-9000 or the Lowndes County Sheriffâs Office at 229-671-2985.<a name=P11_3355></a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22409.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The Commission’s complaint, filed in federal court in Brooklyn, alleges that beginning in at least January 2012, Kaufmann and Neuhaus engaged in an undisclosed kickback arrangement with an individual (“Individual A”) who claimed to represent a group of registered representatives with trading discretion over the accounts of wealthy customers.  Kaufmann and Neuhaus promised to pay kickbacks of between 26% and 28% to Individual A and the registered representatives he purported to represent in exchange for the purchase of up to $5 million of Axius stock through the customers’ accounts., The complaint further alleges that on February 16 and 17, 2012, Kaufmann instructed Individual A to purchase approximately 14,000 shares of Axius stock for a total of approximately $49,000 through matched trades using detailed instructions concerning the size, price and timing of the purchase orders.

Ilovici, formerly of Avon, Connecticut. The Commissionâs action against Ilovici was originally filed in June 2011 and charged that, starting as early as 2008, Ilovici made material misrepresentations in raising over $1 million in investment funds from at least two elderly Connecticut women who lived alone, had little or no family, and had health problems. The complaint alleged that, instead of investing these funds on their behalf as he promised, Ilovici transferred the investor funds to his personal bank and brokerage accounts where he either lost the funds in risky securities or foreign currency exchange trading or used the funds for personal expenses, including mortgage and credit card payments, travel, and home improvements, all without the knowledge or authorization of his investors. The complaint alleged that Iloviciâs conduct violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder., The final judgment entered by the Court came in response to a Commission motion for default judgment and permanently enjoined Ilovici from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The final judgment also ordered Ilovici to pay disgorgement in the amount of $1,094,984.52, representing profits gained as a result of the conduct alleged in the complaint, plus pre-judgment interest on the disgorgement in the amount of $54,935.50, and a civil penalty in the amount of $900,000.00.

The âchocolatesâ came in the form of cash, laptop computers, televisions, and appliances that were provided directly to Mexican government officials or indirectly through front companies that the officials owned. The bribery scheme lasted for several years and yielded nearly $5 million in illegal profits for the Orthofix subsidiary., Orthofix agreed to pay $5.2 million to settle the SECâs charges., According to the SECâs complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, the bribes began in 2003 and continued until 2010. Initially, Promeca falsely recorded the bribes as cash advances and falsified its invoices to support the expenditures. Later, when the bribes got much larger, Promeca falsely recorded them as promotional and training costs. Because of the bribery scheme, Promecaâs training and promotional expenses were significantly over budget. Orthofix did launch an inquiry into these expenses, but did very little to investigate or diminish the excessive spending. Later, upon discovery of the bribe payments through a Promeca executive, Orthofix immediately self-reported the matter to the SEC and implemented significant remedial measures. The company terminated the Promeca executives who orchestrated the bribery scheme., The SECâs proposed settlement is subject to court approval. Orthofix consented to a final judgment ordering it to pay $4,983,644 in disgorgement and more than $242,000 in prejudgment interest. The final judgment would permanently enjoined the company from violating Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Yalamanchili as well as his brother-in-law Mallikarjunarao Anne. The five physicians each purchased ACAP stock based on confidential information about the impending sale in the months leading up to a public announcement. Collectively, they made more than $623,000 in illegal profits on their ACAP stock following the announcement., The physicians agreed to pay a combined total of more than $1.9 million to settle the SECâs charges., According to the SECâs complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michiganâs Southern Division, Mukkamala is a resident of Grand Blanc, Mich., and served as a member of ACAPâs board since its formation in July 2000. He became its chairman in May 2007. At a meeting on March 12, 2010, ACAPâs board confidentially discussed whether it should consider a potential sale of ACAP and instructed company management to evaluate whether or not to continue as an independent, stand-alone company., The SEC alleges that as ACAPâs board and management continued undertaking definite steps toward a sale, Mukkamala routinely disclosed material nonpublic information along the way to the other four physicians. Between April 30 and July 7, 2010, they illegally purchased nearly $2.2 million of ACAP stock based on the confidential information that Mukkamala shared. Mukkamala himself made a trade in the trading account of Chinmaya Mission West, a charitable organization for which he was then serving as president. On July 8, the acquisition of ACAP by Napa, Calif.-based insurer The Doctors Company was publicly announced, and ACAP shares closed approximately 28 percent higher than the previous dayâs closing price., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SECâs complaint, the five physicians consented to the entry of final judgments ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and financial penalties, and permanently enjoining them from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

22415,2012,[<h3>FORMER CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER AND PORTFOLIO MANAGER FOR THE SCHWAB YIELDPLUS FUND AGREES TO SETTLE CHARGES </h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that Kimon P. Daifotis agreed to settle pending litigation that the Commission filed against him in early 2011.  Daifotis was the former lead portfolio manager for the Schwab YieldPlus Fund, the Chief Investment Officer for Fixed Income for Charles Schwab Investment Management (CSIM), a Senior Vice President at Charles Schwab &amp; Co., Inc. (CS&amp;Co.) and an officer of Schwab Investments, the trust of which YieldPlus was a series.  Under the terms of the proposed settlement, he would be enjoined from future violations of certain provisions of the federal securities laws and would agree to pay a total of $325,000 in penalty and disgorgement.  The proposed judgment is subject to the Court’s approval.  Daifotis also agreed to settle an anticipated administrative proceeding in which the Commission would bar him from the securities industry based on the entry of the injunction, with the right to apply for reentry after three years.  Entry of the injunction also would result in automatic ineligibility for Daifotis to hold certain positions associated with registered investment companies.  , In its January 11, 2011, complaint, the Commission alleged that Daifotis and another official committed fraud and other securities law violations in connection with the offer, sale, and management of the YieldPlus Fund.  YieldPlus was an ultra-short bond fund that, at its peak in 2007, had $13.5 billion in assets and over 200,000 accounts, making it the largest ultra-short bond fund in the category.  The fund suffered a significant decline during the credit crisis of 2007-2008 and saw its assets fall from $13.5 billion to $1.8 billion during an eight-month period., According to complaint, Daifotis misled investors about the risks of investing in the YieldPlus Fund.  For example, in marketing and other communications, Daifotis misleadingly described the fund as having only slightly higher risk than a money market fund.  The statements were misleading because the fund was significantly riskier than money market funds, and Daifotis failed to inform investors adequately about the differences between YieldPlus and money market funds.  The complaint also charged that Daifotis falsely claimed that the Fund primarily held very short maturity bonds, when most of its holdings had stated maturities of a decade or more in length., In mid-2007, the YieldPlus Fund’s NAV began to decline and many investors redeemed their holdings.  The complaint alleged that, in an effort to stem the significant outflows from the fund, Daifotis held conference calls, issued written materials, and had other communications with investors that contained a number of material misstatements and omissions concerning the fund.  For example, in two conference calls, Daifotis made false and misleading statements that the fund was experiencing “very, very, very slight” and otherwise minimal investor redemptions in August 2007.  In fact, YieldPlus had experienced redemptions of more than $1.2 billion, or about 10% of its assets under management, during the two weeks prior to the calls.  Daifotis also misleadingly failed to disclose YieldPlus’s substantial holdings of securities backed by Alt-A mortgages even though he was highlighting the fund’s smaller holdings of securities backed by subprime mortgages, which had similar risks and were experiencing similar losses at the time.  , Without admitting or denying the Commission’s allegations, Daifotis consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of Section 17(a)(2), an antifraud provision of the Securities Act of 1933.  The proposed final judgment also would enjoin Daifotis from future violations of Section 34(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, which prohibits the making of untrue statements of material fact, or material omissions, in documents filed with the Commission.  Daifotis also agreed to pay $250,000 in disgorgement and a $75,000 civil penalty, which the Commission is seeking to have included in an existing Fair Fund for distribution to injured YieldPlus investors.  , Daifotis also has agreed to settle an administrative proceeding to be instituted if the Court enters the injunction and in which the Commission would bar Daifotis from associating with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, transfer agent, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization, and from participating in any penny stock offering.  Daifotis would have a right to apply for reentry after three years.  Moreover, under Section 9 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, entry of the injunction would make Daifotis ineligible to serve or act as an employee, officer, director, or investment advisor to, or to be otherwise associated with, registered investment companies., CSIM, CS&amp;Co. and Schwab Investments previously entered into a related settlement with the Commission that, among other things, required payment of over $118 million in disgorgement and penalty.

22417,2012,[<h3>Mizuho to Pay $127.5 Million to Settle SEC Charges of Misleading Investors in CDO</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission has charged the U.S. investment banking subsidiary of Japan-based Mizuho Financial Group and three former employees with misleading investors in a collateralized debt obligation (CDO) by using âdummy assetsâ to inflate the dealâs credit ratings. The SEC also charged the firm that served as the dealâs collateral manager and the person who was its portfolio manager., According to the SECâs complaint filed July 18 against Mizuho Securities USA Inc., the firm made approximately $10 million in structuring and marketing fees in the deal. Mizuho agreed to pay $127.5 million to settle the SECâs charges, and the others charged also agreed to settle the SECâs actions against them., The SEC alleges that Mizuho structured and marketed Delphinus CDO 2007-1, a CDO that was backed by subprime bonds at a time when the housing market was showing signs of severe distress. The deal was contingent upon Mizuho obtaining credit ratings it used to market the notes to investors. When its employees realized that Delphinus could not meet one rating agencyâs newly announced criteria intended to protect CDO investors from the uncertainty of ratings downgrades, they submitted to the rating firm a portfolio containing millions of dollars in dummy assets that inaccurately reflected the collateral held by Delphinus. Once the firm rated the inaccurate portfolio, Mizuho closed the transaction and sold the notes to investors using the misleading ratings. Delphinus defaulted in 2008 and eventually was liquidated in 2010. Mizuho sustained substantial losses from Delphinus., According to the SECâs settled administrative proceedings against the three former Mizuho employees responsible for the Delphinus deal, Alexander Rekeda headed the group that structured the $1.6 billion CDO, Xavier Capdepon modeled the transaction for the rating agencies, and Gwen Snorteland was the transaction manager responsible for structuring and closing Delphinus. Delaware Asset Advisers (DAA) served as Delphinusâs collateral manager and the DAA portfolio manager was Wei (Alex) Wei., According to the SECâs complaint against Mizuho filed in federal court in Manhattan, all of the collateral assets for Delphinus had been purchased by July 17, 2007, and the transaction was scheduled to close on July 19. However, around noon on July 18, Standard &amp; Poorâs (S&amp;P) issued a press release announcing changes to its CDO rating criteria requiring certain categories of subprime residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) to be adjusted downward for purposes of calculating their default probability. The Mizuho employees knew that Delphinusâs actual portfolio contained a substantial amount of RMBS that were subject to the downward ratings, and that Delphinus, as constructed, could not meet its rating targets under these tougher standards. To enable Delphinus to close anyway, the Mizuho employees e-mailed multiple alternative portfolios to S&amp;P that contained dummy assets that were superior in credit quality to the assets that had been actually acquired for the CDO. Once the necessary ratings were secured by the use of dummy assets, the Delphinus transaction closed by mid-afternoon on July 19 and securities were sold based upon these higher ratings. Investors were thus misled to believe that the Delphinus notes had achieved the advertised ratings that the actual closing portfolio would not support., According to the SECâs complaint, in connection with Delphinusâs subsequent request for a required rating confirmation from S&amp;P, Mizuho employees provided and arranged for others to provide further inaccurate information about the composition of Delphinusâs assets. Primarily, they misrepresented that Delphinusâs effective date was August 6 rather than July 19. S&amp;P then provided Delphinus with the ratings confirmation using the improper effective date of August 6., As a result of Mizuhoâs conduct, the SEC has alleged that Mizuho violated Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933. Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SECâs complaint, Mizuho agreed to settle by consenting to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins Mizuho from violating those provisions of the Securities Act, and requires Mizuho to pay $10 million in disgorgement, $2.5 million in prejudgment interest and a $115 million penalty, for a total of $127.5 million. The settlement is subject to Court approval., In the related administrative proceedings against Rekeda, Capdepon, and Snorteland, the SEC found that Rekeda violated Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act, and Capdepon and Snorteland violated Section 17(a). Rekeda and Capdepon each agreed to pay a $125,000 penalty while the decision on whether there will be a penalty for Snorteland will be decided at a later date. Rekeda agreed to be suspended from the securities industry for 12 months, Capdepon and Snorteland each agreed to be barred from the securities industry for one year, and all three agreed to cease and desist from further violations of the respective sections of the Securities Act they violated., In related administrative proceedings against DAA and Wei, the SEC found that, as a result of the roles they played in providing misleading information in August and September 2007, DAA violated Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act, and Section 206(2) of the Advisers Act, and Wei violated Section 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act, and caused DAAâs violation of Section 206(2) of the Advisers Act. Without admitting or denying the SECâs findings: (1) DAA consented to the entry of an order requiring it to cease and desist from committing or causing violations or future violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act and Section 206(2) of the Advisers Act, and requiring it to pay disgorgement of $2,228,372, prejudgment interest of $357,776, and a civil money penalty of $2,228,372; and (2) Wei consented to the entry of an order requiring him to cease and desist from committing or causing violations or future violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act and Section 206(2) of the Advisers Act, suspending him from associating with any investment adviser for six months, and requiring him to pay a civil money penalty of $50,000., The SECâs investigation into the Delphinus transaction is continuing.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22417.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The secondary offering was set to coincide with the release of the companyâs financial results for the second quarter of 2009 and its revenue guidance for the third quarter.

Moshayedi did not call off the offering and abstain from selling his shares once he possessed the negative information unbeknownst to the investing public. Instead, he engaged in a fraudulent scheme to hide the truth through a secret side deal, and proceeded with the sale of 9 million shares from which he and his brother reaped gross proceeds of approximately $134 million each., According to the SECâs complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, STECâs stock price increased more than 800 percent from January to August 2009 as the company reported higher revenues, sales, and margins for its products, particularly its flagship flash memory product called âZeusIOPS,â a solid state drive (SSD). The stock rise also came on the heels of STECâs July 2009 announcement of a unique agreement with its largest customer, EMC Corporation, which agreed to buy $120 million worth of ZeusIOPS in the third and fourth quarter of 2009. Moshayedi touted the sales growth of ZeusIOPS and said the agreement with EMC was âpart of the expected growthâ for STEC going forward., The SEC alleges that as the Aug. 3, 2009 date for the secondary offering approached, Moshayedi learned in the course of his CEO duties two critical pieces of nonpublic information indicating that EMCâs actual demand for the ZeusIOPS was lower than previously expected. First, Moshayedi learned that EMCâs actual demand for the ZeusIOPS product in the third quarter would only be approximately $34 million â not nearly enough to ensure that STECâs third quarter revenue guidance could meet or exceed consensus analyst estimates. Analysts had increased STECâs revenue guidance estimates for the third quarter after STEC announced the agreement with EMC. Second, EMC informed Moshayedi that it would never again enter into a similar agreement with STEC., According to the SECâs complaint, Moshayedi responded by entering into a secret side deal with EMC in order to meet third quarter consensus revenue estimates. Moshayedi convinced EMC on July 29 to take $55 million of ZeusIOPS product in the third quarter â far more than it actually needed â in exchange for an undisclosed additional $2 million price discount on the product in the fourth quarter. After securing this deal, STEC announced the orchestrated guidance figures that amounted to approximately $21 million more than EMCâs actual forecasted demand for the quarter. And even though EMC unequivocally informed Moshayedi on the morning of August 3 that it would not make further volume commitments, he withheld this critical information from investors prior to his secondary offering while at the same time touting in public documents the future growth of the ZeusIOPS product and the importance of the STEC-EMC $120 million agreement., The SECâs complaint charges Moshayedi with violating the anti-fraud provisions of U.S. securities laws and seeks a final judgment ordering him to disgorge his own ill-gotten gains and the trading profits of his brother Mehrdad Mark Moshayedi, pay prejudgment interest and financial penalties, and be permanently barred from future violations and from serving as an officer and director of any registered public company., The SECâs investigation was conducted by Finola H. Manvelian and Douglas Kobayashi in the Los Angeles Regional Office, and John W. Berry will lead the litigation.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22419.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"
22420,2012,[<h3>SEC CHARGES STOCK PROMOTER IN INTERNET-BASED SCALPING SCHEME.</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that on July 20, 2012, it filed a civil fraud action against former Connecticut resident Jerry S. Williams, a stock promoter, and two companies that he controlled, Monk’s Den, LLC and First In Awareness, LLC.  The Commission charged Williams with running a scalping scheme from which he made over $2.4 million.  Scalping is a type of fraud in which the owner of shares of a security recommends that security for investment and then immediately sells it at a profit upon the rise in market price which follows the recommendation.  , The Commission’s Complaint alleges that from at least early 2009 through at least the end of 2010, Williams recommended two stocks, Cascadia Investments, Inc. and Green Oasis Environmental, Inc., to a large group of potential investors who followed his trading recommendations and strategies.  According to the Complaint, Williams, who was known to his followers as “Monk,” used his internet-based message board (called “Monk’s Den”), in-person seminars (called “Monkinars”), and other means to encourage people to buy, hold, and accumulate Cascadia and Green Oasis stock.  In particular, the Complaint alleges that Williams told potential investors that by buying up the outstanding shares, or float, of these companies, they could collectively trigger a “short squeeze” that would allow them to sell their stock to “market makers” that had shorted the stock.  The Commission’s Complaint alleges that Williams falsely stated that he had previously used this strategy to make himself and others enormous profits.  The Complaint alleges that in fact, unknown to potential investors, Williams had been hired by Cascadia and Green Oasis to promote their stock and had been compensated with millions of free and discounted shares of these stocks.  According to the Complaint, Williams secretly sold millions of Cascadia and Green Oasis shares at the same time he was encouraging potential investors to buy, hold and accumulate these stocks.  Through this scheme, the Complaint alleges, Williams made over $2.4 million., The Commission’s Complaint charged Williams, First In Awareness, LLC and Monk’s Den, LLC with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5(a), (b), and (c) thereunder.  The Commission also charged Williams with violating Sections 17(a)(1), 17(a)(2), 17(a)(3) and 17(b) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  The Commission is seeking permanent injunctions, disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against each defendant and, as to Williams only, a penny stock bar. , The Commission’s investigation is continuing., For further information, see Securities Exchange Act of 1934 <a href=/litigation/suspensions/2010/34-63242.pdf>Release 34-63242</a> (November 4, 2010) [order suspending trading in the securities of 8000, Inc.].,  ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22420.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"
22421,2012,[<h3>Defendant Matthew Brown Settles Penny Stock Manipulation Charges</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that Chief Judge Gregory M. Sleet of the United States District Court for the District of Delaware entered a final judgment against Defendant Matthew W. Brown on July 2, 2012 in <i>SEC v. Dynkowski</i>, et al., Civil Action No. 1:09-361, a stock manipulation case the SEC filed on May 20, 2009, and amended on March 25, 2010<a name=P4_581></a> and December 22, 2011, to charge additional individuals.  The SEC’s complaint alleges that Brown participated in market manipulation schemes involving the stock of GH3 International, Inc. and Asia Global Holdings, Inc.    , As alleged in the complaint, the schemes generally followed the same pattern:  Defendant Pawel P. Dynkowski and his accomplices agreed to sell large blocks of shares for penny stock companies in exchange for a portion of the proceeds.  The shares were put in nominee accounts that Dynkowski and his accomplices controlled.  The defendants artificially inflated the market price of the stocks through wash sales, matched orders and other manipulative trading, often timed to coincide with false or misleading press releases, and then sold shares obtained from the issuers and divided the illicit proceeds.  , As alleged in the complaint, Dynkowski orchestrated the manipulation scheme involving GH3 International, Inc. stock in 2006 with Brown, who operated a penny stock website called InvestorsHub.com.  The complaint alleges that in this scheme Dynkowski and Brown engaged in manipulative trading and that Brown helped coordinate this manipulative trading with issuance of false press releases.  The complaint alleges that this scheme generated approximately $747,609 in illicit profits.  , The complaint further alleges that in 2006, Brown planned the manipulation scheme involving the stock of Asia Global Holdings, Inc., with two defendants who were registered representatives at a small broker-dealer in California.  As alleged in the complaint, Dynkowski and another defendant manipulated the price of Asia Global stock using wash sales, matched orders, and other manipulative trading, coordinated with false press releases.  After manipulating the price of the stock, the complaint alleges, Dynkowski, Brown, and others in this scheme sold 54 million shares that had been improperly registered on SEC Form S-8 and held in nominee accounts, generating over $4 million in illicit profits.  , To settle the SEC’s charges, Brown consented to a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rules 10b-5, 13d-1 and 13d-2 thereunder; orders disgorgement of $86,745 and prejudgment interest of $24,081; and bars Brown from participating in any offering of a penny stock.  In a related criminal case, Brown previously pled guilty to conspiracy to commit securities fraud and conspiracy to engage in money laundering.  He was sentenced to four years in prison and ordered to pay criminal forfeiture of $4,798,138.  <i>U.S. v. Brown</i>, Criminal Action No. 09-46-SLR (D.

This sentence follows an 11-count indictment filed May 11, 2011 by the U.S. Attorneys Office in Minnesota alleging securities fraud, wire fraud and transactional money laundering in connection with Brown’s misappropriation of $1.1 million from her advisory clients through material misrepresentations or omissions.  Brown pled guilty on February 15, 2012. , On April 8, 2010, the SEC obtained a temporary restraining order and asset freeze against Brown. The SEC’s action against Brown, which was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota, arose out of the same facts that are the subject of the criminal case.  In its complaint, the SEC alleged that Brown defrauded her advisory clients into transferring more than $1.1 million from July 2009 through March 2010 to Investors Income Fund X, LLC (Fund X), a sham fund formed and controlled by Brown, and falsely representing that Fund X is a bond fund with fixed annual returns of 8% or 9%.  The SEC alleged that Brown distributed false returns to investors, furthering the fiction that Fund X was a legitimate and successful investment opportunity.  Instead, however, the SEC alleged that Brown misappropriated most of the $1.1 million she raised from investors to, among other things, purchase a condominium for herself and build-out office space for her new business., The SECs complaint charged Brown and Fund X with violating Sections 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also charged Brown with violating Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers Act) and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.  On August 17, 2011, the Court entered a final judgment against Brown permanently enjoining her from future violations of Section 17(a)(1)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder; and ordering disgorgement of $310,587.33 plus prejudgment interest of $34,347.17, but waiving payment of all but $14,000 in disgorgement, and not imposing a civil penalty, based upon her sworn statement of financial condition and other documents submitted to the Commission. Brown consented to the entry of the final judgment without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint.  Based on the final judgment, on August 26, 2011, the Commission issued an Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Section 203(f) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (Order) against Brown barring her from association with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, transfer agent, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization.  The Order also barred Brown from participating in any offering of a penny stock.

22423,2012,[<h3>SEC CHARGES CLOSE FRIEND OF STAFFING COMPANY CEO WITH INSIDER TRADING AROUND ACQUISITION</h3>],"[On July 24, 2012, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged the close friend of a CEO with insider trading in the stock of a Houston-based employment services company by exploiting confidential information he learned while they were spending time together., The SEC alleges that Ladislav “Larry” Schvacho, who lived in Georgia at the time of his illegal trading, made approximately $511,000 in illicit profits by using inside information to trade around the acquisition of Comsys IT Partners Inc. by another staffing company.  Schvacho gleaned nonpublic information while the Comsys CEO called other Comsys executives to discuss the acquisition and through confidential, merger-related documents to which Schvacho had access.  , According to the SEC’s complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, Schvacho first met Larry L. Enterline when they worked for the same company in the 1970s.  Enterline went on to become the Comsys CEO in 2006.  The two maintained their close friendship even after Enterline moved to Houston to run Comsys, speaking frequently on the phone and maintaining a longstanding tradition of Friday evening dinner and drinks when Enterline visited Atlanta, where he still had a home.  The two often shared confidential information with one another., The SEC alleges that Schvacho purchased approximately 72,000 shares of Comsys stock in the weeks leading up to a public announcement on Feb. 2, 2010, that Comsys was to be acquired by Manpower Inc.  Given their close relationship and long history of sharing confidences, Enterline made no significant effort to shield information about the impending acquisition from Schvacho.  Rather, Enterline reasonably expected that Schvacho would refrain from disclosing or otherwise misusing the confidential information.  For example, during one of their Friday evening dinners at a restaurant in Atlanta on Nov. 6, 2009, Enterline discussed the potential acquisition in Schvacho’s presence during phone conversations with one or more Comsys senior executives.  On the very next business day (November 9), Schvacho began purchasing Comsys stock relying on the material, non-public information he learned., The SEC further alleges that Schvacho learned nonpublic information between December 11 and December 14 while he and Enterline vacationed together in Florida.  Enterline again discussed the possible acquisition in Schvacho’s presence during a phone conversation with another Comsys senior executive.  During that vacation, Schvacho also had access to Enterline’s merger-related documents.  Just days later, Schvacho bought additional Comsys stock.  Later, on December 19, Enterline again discussed the impending acquisition in Schvacho’s presence during a phone conversation after Schvacho picked him up from the airport.  On the next business day, Schvacho purchased additional Comsys shares., According to the SEC’s complaint, on or about January 20, Schvacho converted his 401(k) account to create a self-directed account so that he could buy even more Comsys shares based on material, nonpublic information learned about the deal.  In order to purchase his large position in Comsys stock, Schvacho undertook other, various unusual steps including using all available cash in his brokerage accounts to purchase Comsys shares.  The Comsys stock price increased approximately 31 percent following the public announcement on February 2.  Schvacho immediately sold half of his Comsys shares after the announcement was made., As a result of the conduct alleged in the complaint, the SEC alleges that Schvacho violated Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder.  The SEC seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, plus pre-judgment interest, and civil penalties., The Commission thanks the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) for its assistance in this matter.,  ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22423.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Feldstein, pretending to be the President of LED Capital Corp., entered into an investment agreement with Interlink.  Feldstein, however, had no position at, or affiliation with, LED.  In this investment agreement, Feldstein purported to commit LED to pay $6 million for a minority block of Interlink shares that, at the time, had a market value of under $1.2 million.  , According to the Commission’s complaint, when Interlink sought to inform the market of this remarkable news, Feldstein again offered crucial assistance by reviewing and contributing to a draft Form 8-K disclosing the purported agreement.  Interlink filed a version of the Form 8-K that reflected Feldstein’s comments on December 14, 2010., The Commission previously has brought a civil injunctive action against Interlink and its management alleging, among other things, that the Form 8-K they filed disclosing the purported investment was false and misleading.

Well Advantage is controlled by prominent Hong Kong businessman Zhang Zhi Rong, who also controls another company that has a âstrategic cooperation agreementâ with CNOOC., The SEC took the emergency action to freeze the tradersâ assets within days of the public announcement of the deal and less than 24 hours after Well Advantage placed an order to liquidate its entire position in Nexen. The SECâs investigation continues., According to the SECâs complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, CNOOC and Nexen announced before the markets opened on Monday, July 23 that CNOOC agreed to acquire Nexen for approximately $15.1 billion. Nexenâs stock subsequently rose sharply that day to close at nearly 52 percent higher than Fridayâs closing price., The SEC alleges that Well Advantage and certain unknown traders were in possession of material nonpublic information about the impending acquisition when they purchased Nexenâs stock in the days leading up to the public announcement. Well Advantage purchased more than 830,000 shares of Nexen on July 19 and had an unrealized trading profit of more than $7 million based on Nexenâs closing price on the day of the announcement.

Bodanza (“Bodanza”), the former chief financial officer and a founding member of Preferred Financial Holdings Co., LLC (“Preferred Holdings”), a company formed in 2006 to engage in oil and gas exploration, drilling, and leasing through operating subsidiaries.  , In the complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, the Commission alleges that, from June 2007 to August 2010, Defendants Bodanza and Preferred Holdings raised $6,769,635 from at least 61 investors through the unregistered sale of Preferred Holdings promissory notes.  During this period, Preferred Holdings experienced through its operating subsidiaries a series of material operational problems and suffered significant losses, including net losses of $1.0 million in 2007, $2.2 million in 2008, $1.8 million in 2009, and $1.3 million in 2010, according to consolidated financial statements prepared in 2011.  Bodanza nonetheless depicted Preferred Holdings’ oil and gas operations in a positive light and failed to disclose to most investors that the company had suffered significant losses from 2007 through 2010.  Further, Bodanza failed to disclose the following material facts to several investors: (i) Preferred Holdings removed one of its founding members and its chief operating officer in early 2008 and sued him for causing Preferred Holdings to suffer between $3 million to $4 million in damages; (ii) the only operating drilling rig held by Preferred Holdings’ drilling subsidiary suffered an irreparable breakdown in August 2008; (iii) Preferred Holdings was embroiled in an insurance coverage dispute to recover $1 million in losses and expenses incurred as a result of the rig breakdown; (iv) Preferred Holdings’ drilling subsidiary incurred $260,000 in drilling expenses above its original cost estimates in connection with a significant joint venture in 2009; and (v) Preferred Holdings’ subsidiary had failed to acquire certain property in Tennessee that could be used to drill and sell gas from its own producing wells.  Finally, Bodanza also failed to disclose to at least three individuals who purchased promissory notes in 2010 that their investment proceeds would be used to make payments to other investors.

Along with being one of three “consultants” that raised money for China Yingxia, Siris and his consulting firm Hua Mei, acted as advisers to China Yingxia, which included review of China Yingxia’s Commission filings and press releases, among other things.  Hua Mei received cash and shares, which were received from the CEO’s father and were improperly sold without any registration statement in effect.  , Further, in February and March 2009, Siris sold China Yingxia stock while in possession of material, non-public information centered on its CEO’s illegal activity, status of operations at China Yingxia, and a press release concerning the same.  Siris, on behalf of his funds, sold over 1.1 million shares in a matter of weeks before China Yingxia’s press release, realizing more than $172,000 in ill-gotten gains.  Siris also omitted material information and made material misrepresentations to investors in his funds concerning his role with China Yingxia, depriving his investors of information material to their continued investment decisions with Siris’s funds.  , In addition, after agreeing to go “over-the-wall” in connection with ten confidentially marketed offerings for Chinese companies, Siris engaged in insider trading in breach of his duty to not trade on the information.  And Siris sold short the securities of two Chinese companies prior to participating in firm-commitment offerings in violation of Rule 105.  Further, Siris fraudulently represented in one securities purchase agreement that he had not traded the issuer’s securities, but he had in fact sold short the issuer’s stock.  As a result of these violations, Siris generated almost $289,000 in ill-gotten gains.  , The SEC filed action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against Siris and his entities, alleging violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Rule 105 of Regulation M, and Section 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers Act), and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, these defendants have agreed to pay disgorgement in the amount of $592,942.39, prejudgment interest of $70,488.83, and Siris has agreed to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $464,011.93.  Defendants Siris, Guerrilla Capital, and Hua Mei, also have consented to the entry of a judgment enjoining them from violations of the respective provisions of the Securities Act, Exchange Act, and Advisers Act.  The proposed settlement is subject to approval by the court., <i>Hu, Sheinwald, and Alliance Advisors</i>, The SEC also filed fraud charges against China Yingxia’s former CFO, Hu, for material misrepresentations concerning his role in designing disclosure and internal controls.  In several SOX certifications, the SEC alleges that Hu misrepresented that he had designed or caused to be designed such controls, when he had not done so.  The SEC also alleges that Hu knowingly failed to implement internal accounting controls, aided and abetted China Yingxia’s failure to do so, and lied to auditors concerning controls and fraud by the CEO, who has reportedly been convicted by Chinese authorities for illegal fundraising activities, similar to a Ponzi scheme.  , In addition, the SEC alleges that Sheinwald and his investor relations firm Alliance Advisors, who were also retained as “consultants,” acted as unregistered securities brokers in connection with raising money for China Yingxia and at least one other issuer.   , The SEC filed action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against Hu alleging violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, and 13b2-2 thereunder, and further aided and abetted violations of Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act.  The SEC’s action against Sheinwald and Alliance Advisors alleges violations of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act.   , <i>Administrative and/or Cease-and-Desist Proceedings</i>, Finally, today the SEC issued administrative and cease-and-desist orders against Zhou and Mazur, and a cease-and-desist order against Fuld.  The order against Zhou, who assisted China Yingxia with its reverse merger and virtually all of its public company tasks, finds that he willfully engaged in insider trading in the securities of China Yingxia, unregistered sales of securities, and aided and abetted unregistered broker-dealer activity.  Zhou agreed to pay disgorgement in the amount of $20,900, prejudgment interest of $2,463.39, and a civil monetary penalty in the amount of $50,000.  Zhou further agreed to a collateral bar, penny stock bar, and investment company bar, with the right to apply for reentry after three years.  The order involving Mazur, whose firm was also retained as a “consultant” to China Yingxia, finds that he willfully acted as an unregistered broker by selling away from the firm with which he was associated in connection with China Yingxia and at least one other issuer.  Mazur agreed to pay disgorgement in the amount of $126,800, prejudgment interest of $25,550.01, and a civil monetary penalty in the amount of $25,000.  Mazur further agreed to a collateral bar, penny stock bar, and investment company bar, with the right to apply for reentry after two years.  The cease-and-desist order against Fuld finds that he engaged in unregistered sales of securities, and he agreed to pay disgorgement of $178,594.85, and $38,096.70 in prejudgment interest.  , The New York Regional Office’s Celeste A. Chase, Eduardo A. Santiago-Acevedo, and Osman E. Nawaz conducted the investigation, which is continuing, with assistance from Frank Milewski.  The SEC thanks the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) for its assistance in this matter.,  ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22398.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The Commissionâs amended complaint alleges that Lonchar and other executives inflated Veritasâ reported revenues by approximately $20 million in connection with a software sale to America Online, Inc.  The complaint further alleges that from at least 2000 until his resignation in 2002, Lonchar and others applied three improper accounting practices to âsmoothâ artificially Veritasâ financial results., Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Lonchar consented to entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and ordering him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $300,000 and a civil penalty of $100,000.  , On August 2, 2012, the Commission issued an Order in a related, settled administrative proceeding suspending Lonchar from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant with the right to request reinstatement after five (5) years from the date of the Order, pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the Commissionâs Rules of Practice.

22433,2012,[<h3>SEC CHARGES BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB EXECUTIVE WITH INSIDER TRADING IN STOCK OPTIONS OF POTENTIAL ACQUISITION TARGETS</h3>],"[On August 2, 2012, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged an executive at Bristol-Myers Squibb with insider trading on confidential information about companies being targeted for potential acquisitions.  His illegal trading took place as recently as just weeks ago., The SEC alleges that Robert D. Ramnarine, who lives in East Brunswick, N.J., made more than $300,000 in illegal profits by misusing nonpublic information he obtained while helping Bristol-Myers Squibb evaluate whether to acquire three other pharmaceutical companies.  He used multiple personal brokerage accounts to illegally trade in stock options of these potential target companies.  Prior to some trading, Ramnarine conducted Internet research from his Bristol computer to determine whether he could be detected by regulators.  He searched for such phrases as “can stock option be traced to purchaser” and “illegal insider trading options trace” and viewed such articles as “Ways to Avoid Insider Trading.”  Ramnarine even viewed a press release on the SEC’s website announcing an enforcement action arising from illegal trading in call options in advance of an acquisition announcement., The SEC is seeking a court order to freeze Ramnarine’s brokerage account assets.  In a parallel criminal action, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey announced the arrest of Ramnarine today. , According to the SEC’s complaint filed in federal court in New Jersey, Ramnarine is an executive in the treasury department at Bristol-Myers Squibb.  He conducted his insider trading schemes from August 2010 to July 2012, illegally trading in stock options of Pharmasset Inc., Amylin Pharmaceuticals Inc., and ZymoGenetics Inc. in advance of announcements that those companies would be acquired., The SEC alleges that just as Bristol was finalizing its agreement with ZymoGenetics in late August 2010, Ramnarine started to buy out-of-the-money call options.  A call option is a security that derives its value from the underlying common stock of the issuer and gives the purchaser the right to buy the underlying stock at a specific price within a specified period of time.  Typically, investors will purchase call options when they believe the stock of the underlying securities is going up.  Ramnarine made $30,551 in illegal profits by trading ZymoGenetics call options in advance of a Sept. 7, 2010 public announcement that Bristol-Myers Squibb was acquiring ZymoGenetics., The SEC further alleges that in advance of a Nov. 21, 2011 announcement that Pharmasset would be acquired by Gilead Sciences Inc., Ramnarine bought Pharmasset call options based on material, nonpublic information that he obtained from participating in Bristol-Myers Squibb’s evaluation of a possible acquisition of Pharmasset.  This was part of an auction process conducted by Pharmasset and its investment bankers during the weeks before the Gilead-Pharmasset announcement.  Ramnarine made $225,026 in illegal profits when he sold the calls immediately after the public announcement of Pharmasset’s sale., According to the SEC’s complaint, Ramnarine very recently sold or “wrote” put options and purchased call options in advance of a June 29, 2012 announcement by Bristol-Myers Squibb that it would acquire Amylin.  A put option is a security that derives its value from the underlying common stock.  When investors sell or “write” puts, they obligate themselves to sell the underlying security at a certain price before the expiration date.  Investors usually write puts when they believe the price of the underlying stock price is moving up.  Ramnarine’s trades were based on material nonpublic information that he obtained by working on financing and capital structure matters as part of Bristol’s due diligence process leading up to the acquisition announcement.  Ramnarine made $55,784 in illegal profits by trading Amylin put and call options in advance of the public announcement., The SEC alleges that Ramnarine violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and (14)(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder.  The SEC is seeking disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, a financial penalty, an officer-and-director bar, a permanent injunction, and an order freezing the assets in Ramnarine’s brokerage accounts. , The SEC has coordinated its action with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey, and also appreciates the assistance of the Options Regulatory Surveillance Authority and Federal Bureau of Investigation., The SEC’s investigation is continuing.  <a name=P22_4947></a>,  , , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22433.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"
22434,2012,"[<h3>SEC Charges Massachusetts Resident with Insider Trading in Art Technology, Inc.</h3>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it has filed a complaint against Joseph McVicker, of Wayland, Massachusetts.  The complaint alleges that McVicker engaged in insider trading in shares of Cambridge-based Art Technology Group, Inc. in advance of an announcement on November 2, 2010, that Art Technology would be acquired by California-based Oracle Corporation.<b> </b>McVicker has agreed to settle these charges by, among other things, paying over $88,000 in disgorgement of trading profits and a civil penalty.  , The Commissionâs complaint alleges that on October 30, 2010, McVicker learned of the pending acquisition of Art Technology from a close friend at a social event.  The complaint further alleges that McVicker understood that the information was material, nonpublic information and that he should not use it to trade.  According to the Commissionâs complaint, however, on November 1, 2010, McVicker used the information to purchase 24,400 shares of Art Technology. On November 2, 2010, before the market opened, Art Technology announced that Oracle had agreed to acquire Art Technology for $6 per share.  Art Technologyâs stock closed that day at $5.95 per share, a 45% increase from the previous trading dayâs closing price, earning McVicker an ill-gotten gain of $44,268.

That same day, the SEC obtained a court order freezing the assets of the initial defendants valued at more than $38 million.  , One week later, on Friday, August 3, 2012, the SEC filed an amended complaint adding allegations that additional unknown traders in possession of material nonpublic information purchased Nexen stock in the days leading up to the public announcement of its acquisition.

AND WYETH LLC</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a settled enforcement action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against Pfizer Inc. for violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) when its subsidiaries bribed doctors and other health care professionals employed by foreign governments in order to win business., The SEC alleges that employees and agents of Pfizerâs subsidiaries in Bulgaria, China, Croatia, Czech Republic, Italy, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Serbia made improper payments to foreign officials to obtain regulatory and formulary approvals, sales, and increased prescriptions for the companyâs pharmaceutical products. They tried to conceal the bribery by improperly recording the transactions in accounting records as legitimate expenses for promotional activities, marketing, training, travel and entertainment, clinical trials, freight, conferences, and advertising., The SEC filed a separate settled enforcement action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against another pharmaceutical company that Pfizer acquired a few years ago â Wyeth LLC â for its own FCPA violations. Pfizer and Wyeth agreed to separate settlements in which they will pay approximately $45 million combined in disgorgement and prejudgment interest to the SEC to settle their respective charges. In a related action, Pfizer H.C.P. Corporation, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Pfizer, will pay a $15 million penalty to settle FCPA charges brought against it today by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) under a deferred prosecution agreement., The SECâs complaint against Pfizer alleges that Pfizerâs misconduct dates back as far as 2001. According to the SECâs complaint, employees of Pfizerâs subsidiaries authorized and made cash payments and provided other incentives to bribe government doctors to utilize Pfizer products. In China, for example, the SECâs complaint alleges that Pfizer employees invited âhigh-prescribing doctorsâ in the Chinese government to club-like meetings that included extensive recreational and entertainment activities to reward doctorsâ past product sales or prescriptions. In addition, according to the SECâs complaint, Pfizer employees in Croatia created a âbonus programâ for Croatian doctors who were employed in senior positions in Croatian government health care institutions. According to the SECâs complaint, once a doctor agreed to use Pfizer products, a percentage of the value purchased by a doctorâs institution would be funneled back to the doctor in the form of cash, international travel, or free products., According to the SECâs complaint, Pfizer made an initial voluntary disclosure of misconduct by its subsidiaries to the SEC and Department of Justice in October 2004, and fully cooperated with SEC investigators. The complaint alleges that Pfizer took such extensive remedial actions as undertaking a comprehensive worldwide review of its compliance program., The SEC further alleges that Wyeth subsidiaries engaged in FCPA violations, primarily before, but also after, the companyâs acquisition by Pfizer in late 2009. For example, according to the SECâs complaint, starting at least in 2005, subsidiaries marketing Wyeth nutritional products in China, Indonesia, and Pakistan bribed government doctors to recommend their products to patients by making cash payments or in some cases providing BlackBerrys and cell phones or travel incentives. The complaint alleges that Wyethâs employees often used fictitious invoices to conceal the true nature of the payments., According to the SECâs complaint, following Pfizerâs acquisition of Wyeth, Pfizer undertook a risk-based FCPA due diligence review of Wyethâs global operations and voluntarily reported the findings to the SEC staff. The complaint alleges that Pfizer diligently and promptly integrated Wyethâs legacy operations into its compliance program and cooperated fully with SEC investigators., In settling the SECâs charges, Wyeth neither admitted nor denied the allegations. Pfizer consented to the entry of a final judgment ordering it to pay disgorgement of $16,032,676 in net profits and prejudgment interest of $10,307,268 for a total of $26,339,944. Pfizer also is required to report to the SEC on the status of its remediation and implementation of compliance measures over a two-year period, and is permanently enjoined from further violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Wyeth consented to the entry of a final judgment ordering it to pay disgorgement of $17,217,831 in net profits and prejudgment interest of $1,658,793, for a total of $18,876,624. As a Pfizer subsidiary, the status of Wyethâs remediation and implementation of compliance measures will be subsumed in Pfizerâs two-year self-reporting period. Wyeth also is permanently enjoined from further violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act.

Judge Mahan ordered that the bar be imposed from the date the Complaint was filed., The SEC’s Complaint alleged that, on February 26, 2007, after he first learned that Shuffle Master would announce disappointing preliminary financial results, Dunn called Howey and provided him with material nonpublic information relating to Shuffle Master’s anticipated announcement.  Howey then immediately sold all of his previously-purchased Shuffle Master stock and calls and purchased Shuffle Master puts.  The next day, after Shuffle Master announced its disappointing financial news, Howey sold all of the Shuffle Master puts he purchased the previous day, thereby profiting and avoiding losses.  In the order imposing a bar, Judge Mahan found that “Mr. Dunn abused his fiduciary position, and violated his employment agreement and the company’s code of conduct by sharing confidential information with Mr. Howey.”  The Court further found that “Mr. Dunn was aware that sharing information with Mr. Howey was improper but chose to ignore company policy when he divulged confidential information.”, Dunn and Howey previously settled the SEC’s lawsuit (other than the officer and director bar issue, which was submitted to the Court) by agreeing to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $181,594 each, without admitting or denying liability.  Howey also agreed to pay an additional $181,594 in disgorgement plus $30,403 in prejudgment interest.  Dunn and Howey both agreed to orders permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.,  ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22439.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"
22441,2012,[<h3>Former Deloitte Partner Pleads Guilty to Insider Trading</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on August 8, 2012, Thomas P. Flanagan, a former Deloitte and Touche LLP partner, pleaded guilty to one count of criminal securities fraud for engaging in insider trading after he obtained material, nonpublic information about several Deloitte clients. Flanagan, 64, of Chicago, used that information himself and shared it with a relative to make illegal trading profits. The U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Northern District of Illinois filed criminal charges against Flanagan on July 11, 2012 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. Flanagan is scheduled to be sentenced on October 25, 2012., The criminal charges arose out of the same facts that were the subject of a civil action that the SEC filed against Flanagan and his son, Patrick T. Flanagan, on August 4, 2010. The SECâs complaint alleged that Thomas Flanagan, a certified public accountant, worked at Deloitte for 38 years and rose to the level of Vice Chairman of Clients and Markets. The complaint alleged that Flanagan traded on nine occasions between 2005 and 2008 in the securities of multiple Deloitte clients and a company acquired by a Deloitte client while in possession of nonpublic information that he learned through his duties as a Deloitte partner. The information had not yet been disclosed to the public and concerned material, market-moving events such as earnings results, earnings guidance, and acquisitions. Thomas Flanaganâs illegal trading resulted in profits of over $430,000. On four occasions, Thomas Flanagan relayed the nonpublic information to his son Patrick Flanagan who then traded based on that information. Patrick Flanagan realized profits of more than $57,000., The SEC also instituted related administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings on August 4, 2010, finding that Flanagan violated the SECâs auditor independence rules on 71 occasions between 2003 and 2008 by trading in the securities of nine Deloitte audit clients. The SECâs settled administrative order found that during the time Flanagan owned or controlled these securities, Deloitte issued audit reports to the nine audit clients in which it stated that the financial statements contained in the reports had been audited by an independent auditor. However, due to Flanaganâs ownership of the audit clientsâ securities, Deloitte was not independent. The companies then filed with the SEC annual reports and proxy statements which included the false audit reports. As a result, the SECâs administrative order found that Flanagan caused and willfully aided and abetted Deloitteâs violations of the SECâs auditor independence rules under Regulation S-X and also caused and willfully aided and abetted the companiesâ violations of the reporting and proxy provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934., As alleged in the SECâs complaint, Thomas Flanagan concealed his trades in the securities of Deloitteâs clients and circumvented Deloitteâs independence controls. According to the SECâs complaint, he failed to report the prohibited trades to Deloitte, lied to Deloitte about his compliance with its independence policies, and provided false information to Deloitteâs personal income tax preparers about the identity of the companies whose securities he traded.  , As a result of their conduct, the SECâs complaint charged Thomas and Patrick Flanagan with violations of Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3. The SECâs administrative action found that Thomas Flanagan caused and willfully aided and abetted Deloitteâs violations of Rule 2-02(b)(1) of Regulation S-X, and caused and willfully aided and abetted the clientsâ violations of Sections 13(a) and 14(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 13a-1, 13a-13, and 14a-3 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the SECâs allegations in the complaint and the findings in the administrative order, Thomas Flanagan consented to the entry of an order of permanent injunction, to pay disgorgement with prejudgment interest and civil penalties totaling $1,051,042, and to a denial of the privilege of appearing or practicing before the SEC as an accountant. Without admitting or denying the SECâs allegations in the complaint, Patrick Flanagan consented to the entry of an order of permanent injunction and to pay disgorgement with prejudgment interest and a civil penalty totaling $123,270., For additional information, see Litigation Release No. 21612 (August 4, 2010),  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22441.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Brooks committed securities fraud while serving as CEO and chairman of Standard Oil Company USA, Inc., a purported energy company headquartered in Dallas, Texas., According to the SECâs complaint, Brooks signed and certified Standard Oilâs initial disclosure statement filed with the Pink OTC Markets and made available to investors through that marketâs website. Brooks represented in the disclosure statement that he had no prior criminal convictions. In fact, however, Brooks has three prior felony convictions, two for securities violations. The SEC therefore alleges that Brooks defrauded Standard Oilâs investors. The complaint charges Brooks with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and seeks a permanent injunction, a civil monetary penalty, an officer-and-director bar, and a penny-stock bar.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22442.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"
22443,2012,"[<h3>Former Chief Financial Officer of Soyo Group Ordered to Pay $15,600,000 Penalty for Securities Fraud</h3>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that Nancy Shao Wen Chu, the former Chief Financial Officer for the now defunct Soyo Group, Inc., was ordered to pay $15,600,000 in penalties for committing securities fraud. Another defendant, Eric Jon Strasser, was ordered to pay a penalty of $260,000. The SEC alleged that between January 2007 and November 2008, Soyo, through the actions of Chu and another defendant, booked over $47 million in fraudulent sales revenues arising from at least 120 fictitious transactions. The scheme had the effect of nearly doubling Soyoâs net revenues for 2007 over the previous year. Soyoâs share price thus increased from a low of $.28/share in the first quarter of 2007, to a high of $1.80/share in the fourth quarter of 2007. The SEC alleged that Chu actively participated in the fraudulent sales transactions and took deliberate steps to hide the scheme from Soyoâs auditor., Further, the SEC alleged that in order to obtain additional bank financing for Soyo and keep its existing line of credit from defaulting, Chu also misled Soyoâs investors, its primary lending bank, and its auditor regarding a six million dollar debt-for-equity transaction Soyo was negotiating with a vendor. Despite that fact that discussions with the vendor were not finalized and subject to cancelation, Chu signed and caused to be filed a Soyo Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2008, reporting that the transaction was complete, eliminating an outstanding accounts payable of slightly over $6 million, and thereby reducing Soyoâs current liabilities by 14% and its accounts payable by 42%., Strasser, a consultant who prepared Soyoâs SEC filings, was alleged to have been well aware that Soyoâs second quarter Form 10-Q falsely reported the debt-for-equity transaction as complete and to have withheld this information from Soyoâs auditor. In addition, Strasser prepared Soyoâs Form-10-Q for the next quarter, making the same false disclosures and omitting the same liabilities relating to the debt-for-equity transaction., Neither Chu nor Strasser answered the Commissionâs complaint and both were found to be in default. The Court ordered the maximum third-tier penalty of $130,000 against Chu for each of the 120 fictitious transactions she concocted and against Strasser for each of the two fraudulent SEC filings.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22443.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"
22444,2012,[<h3>SEC Charges Participants in $5 Million Boiler Room Scheme</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it has charged Edward M. Laborio and others for their roles in a boiler room scheme that used high-pressure sales tactics to raise up to $5.7 million from approximately 150 investors through the fraudulent sale of five unregistered securities offerings involving a group of related entities. The scheme ran from approximately December 2006 to August 2009. Laborio, formerly of Boston, Massachusetts, is now a resident of Boca Raton, Florida. The SEC also charged Jonathan Fraiman of Lantana, Florida; Matthew K. Lazar of Westerville, Ohio; and seven entities controlled by Laborio: Envit Capital Group, Inc. (âEnvit Groupâ); Envit Capital, LLC (âEnvit LLCâ); Envit Capital Holdings, Inc. (âEnvit Holdingsâ); Envit Capital Private Wealth Management, LLC (âEnvit Wealthâ); Envit Capital Multi Strategy Mixed Investment Fund I LP (âEnvit Fundâ); Aetius Group PLC (âAetius PLCâ); and Aetius Group LLC (âAetius LLCâ) (collectively, the âEnvit Companiesâ)., According to the Commissionâs complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, Laborio and Fraiman made multiple misrepresentations and misleading statements to investors about the Envit Companiesâ businesses, revenues, financial projections, uses of investor funds, and historical returns generated by Envit Fund, a purported hedge fund that in reality never conducted any operations. According to the complaint, Laborio also created scripts with sales pitches containing fabricated information. For example, one of Laborioâs scripts allegedly included unfounded claims that investors would receive quarterly dividends and â2-3x return on money.â Laborio also allegedly used investor proceeds to cover gambling losses, to make direct payments to himself, and to cover personal expenses. Fraiman allegedly represented to an investor that Envit Fund, the purported hedge fund, returned 42.9% in 2006 and 43.7% in 2007, even though the hedge fund was not launched until mid-2007 and never conducted any operations. The complaint further alleges that Lazar raised $585,000 from approximately 10 investors through the sale of a PIPE (private investment in public equity) in Envit Group (one of the five unregistered securities offerings) by misrepresenting that the PIPE guaranteed an annual 8.5% dividend, and that it was safe, like a fixed annuity or a CD., As a result of the conduct described in the complaint, the Commission alleges that all defendants violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (âSecurities Actâ) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; that Laborio, Fraiman, Lazar and Envit Wealth violated Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (âAdvisers Actâ); that Laborio, Fraiman, and Envit Wealth violated Advisers Act Section 206(4) and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder; that Laborio, Fraiman, and Lazar violated Exchange Act Section 15(a)(1); that Laborio, Envit LLC, Envit Group, Envit Holdings, and Aetius PLC violated Securities Act Sections 5(a) and 5(c); that Laborio violated Exchange Act Section 16(a) and Rule 16a-3 thereunder; and that Envit Fund and Aetius LLC violated Section 7(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940. The SEC seeks in its action permanent injunctions, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, civil penalties, penny stock bars against Laborio, Fraiman, and Lazar, and an officer and director bar against Laborio., The Commission previously suspended trading in the securities of Envit Group in May 2009 and subsequently revoked the registration of the securities of Envit Group in September 2009., In conducting its investigation, the Commission acknowledges assistance from the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the District of Massachusetts, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the State of Florida Office of Financial Regulation and, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)., For further information, see Exchange Act Release No. <a href=/litigation/suspensions/2009/34-59900.pdf>34-59900</a> (May 12, 2009) [Order suspending trading in Envit Group securities]; Initial Decision Release No. <a href=/litigation/aljdec/2009/id385rgm.pdf>385</a> (August 13, 2009) [Initial decision revoking registration of Envit Group securities]; Exchange Act Release No. <a href=/litigation/aljdec/2009/34-60658.pdf>60658</a> (September 11, 2009) [Notice of final decision revoking registration of Envit Group securities].,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22444.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"
22449,2012,[<h3>SEC HALTS DENVER-BASED PONZI SCHEME</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced fraud charges and an emergency asset freeze against Bridge Premium Finance LLC, Michael J. Turnock, and William P. Sullivan, II, for allegedly perpetrating a Ponzi scheme. Bridge Premium is based in Denver, Colorado. Turnock resides in Denver, Colorado, and Sullivan resides in Highlands Ranch, Colorado., According to the SECâs complaint filed yesterday in federal court in Denver, Bridge Premium raised at least $15.7 million from more than 100 promissory note investors nationwide by promising annual returns of up 12 percent. Turnock and Sullivan represented that investor funds would be used to make loans to small businesses to pay their up-front, annual commercial insurance premiums. They also told investors that Bridge Premiumâs business was performing well, and that their funds were â100% Protectedâ through various forms of collateral on the underlying loans., However, the SEC alleges that in fact, since at least 2002, Bridge Premium has paid investor returns with funds from other investors because Bridge Premiumâs business has been unprofitable and its obligations to noteholders have far exceeded its total assets. Because most funds were diverted for Ponzi payments, any collateral available on Bridge Premiumâs underlying loan portfolio will only protect a small fraction of its promissory note investors. Bridge Premiumâs offering was not registered with the SEC as required under the federal securities laws., The Complaint alleges that, based on this conduct, Bridge Premium and Turnock violated Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (âSecurities Actâ), and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, or in the alternative, Turnock is liable as a control person under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act for Bridge Premiumâs violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Those Oracle India employees then directed the distributors to make payments out of these side funds to purported local vendors, several of which were merely storefronts that did not provide any services to Oracle.  Oracles subsidiary documented certain payments with fake invoices., Oracle agreed to pay a $2 million penalty to settle the SECs charges., According to the SECs complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, the misconduct at Oracles India subsidiary, Oracle India Private Limited, occurred from 2005 to 2007.  Oracle India sold software licenses and services to Indias government through local distributors, and then had the distributors park excess funds from the sales outside Oracle Indias books and records., For example, according to the SECs complaint, Oracle India secured a $3.9 million deal with Indias Ministry of Information Technology and Communications in May 2006.  As instructed by Oracle Indias then-sales director, only $2.1 million was sent to Oracle to record as revenue on the transaction, and the distributor kept $151,000 for services rendered.  Certain other Oracle India employees further instructed the distributor to park the remaining $1.7 million for marketing development purposes.  Two months later, one of those same Oracle India employees created and provided to the distributor eight invoices for payments to purported third-party vendors ranging from $110,000 to $396,000.  In fact, none of these storefront-only third parties provided any services or were included on Oracles approved vendor list.  The third-party payments created the risk that the funds could be used for illicit purposes such as bribery or embezzlement., The Commissions complaint, filed in the federal district court for the Northern District of California, charges Oracle with violating Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Oracle has agreed to settle the SECs charges without admitting or denying the allegations.  Oracle has consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it from violating Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of the Exchange Act, and requiring it to pay a $2 million civil penalty.

DeCinces and his three tippees made more than $1.7 million in illegal profits, and they agreed to pay more than $3.3 million to settle the SEC’s charges., Now the SEC is charging the source of those illegal tips about the impending transaction – DeCinces’s close friend and neighbor James V. Mazzo, who was the Chairman and CEO of Advanced Medical Optics. The SEC also is charging two others who traded on inside information that DeCinces tipped to them – DeCinces’ former Baltimore Orioles teammate Eddie Murray and another friend David L. Parker, who is a businessman living in Utah. , The SEC alleges that Murray made approximately $235,314 in illegal profits after Illinois-based Abbott Laboratories Inc. publicly announced its plan to purchase Advanced Medical Optics through a tender offer. Murray agreed to settle the SEC’s charges by paying $358,151. The SEC’s case continues against Parker and Mazzo, the latter of whom was directly involved in the tender offer and tipped the confidential information to DeCinces along the way., According to the SEC’s complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, the total unlawful profits resulting from Mazzo’s illegal tipping was more than $2.4 million. Once Mazzo began tipping DeCinces with confidential information about the upcoming transaction, DeCinces soon began to purchase Advanced Medical Optics stock in several brokerage accounts. DeCinces bought more and more shares as the deal progressed and as he continued communicating with Mazzo. DeCinces tipped at least five others who traded on the inside information, including Murray, Parker, and the three traders who settled their charges along with DeCinces last year – physical therapist Joseph J. Donohue, real estate lawyer Fred Scott Jackson, and businessman Roger A. Wittenbach., According to the SEC’s complaint, Mazzo and DeCinces had been close friends for quite some time and lived in the same exclusive gated community in Laguna Beach, Calif. They socialized together with their wives, belonging to the same Orange County country club and vacationing together overseas. They also communicated frequently by e-mail and through phone calls. Mazzo invested in the restaurant business of DeCinces’ son, and DeCinces’ daughter provided interior decorating services for Mazzo and his wife. Mazzo was directly involved in the impending Advanced Medical Optics/Abbott transaction from its inception in October 2008. With knowledge of confidential information about the deal and his duty not to disclose it, Mazzo illegally tipped DeCinces, who made significant purchases of Advanced Medical Optics shares on Nov. 5, 2008, and continuing up until and near the time of the public announcement of the acquisition. , The SEC alleges that Parker and DeCinces had been friends and business associates at the time of the illegal trading. Between Jan. 6 and Jan. 8, 2009, Parker bought 25,000 shares of Advanced Medical Optics stock on the basis of confidential information received from DeCinces about the impending transaction. Parker made approximately $347,920 when he sold the stock on the same day as the public announcement. Meanwhile on January 7, Murray used all of the available cash in his self-directed brokerage account to purchase 17,000 shares of Advanced Medical Optics stock on the basis of the confidential information that DeCinces communicated to him. Murray sold all of his shares following the public announcement., Murray agreed to settle the charges against him without admitting or denying the SEC’s allegations by consenting to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder. Murray agreed to pay disgorgement of $235,314, prejudgment interest of $5,180, and a penalty of $117,657 for a total of $358,151.

22456,2012,"[<h3>SEC FILES ENFORCEMENT ACTION TO HALT $600 MILLION PYRAMID AND PONZI SCHEME</h3>, <h3>NORTH CAROLINA COMPANY SOLICITED INVESTORS OVER INTERNET</h3>]","[On August 17, 2012, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina against Rex Venture Group LLC d/b/a ZeekRewards.com and Paul R. Burks, alleging that the defendants had been operating a combined Ponzi and Pyramid scheme. According to the Complaint, online marketer Paul Burks of Lexington, N.C. and his company Rex Venture Group raised more than $600 million from more than one million Internet customers nationwide and overseas through the website ZeekRewards.com, which they began in January 2011., The Complaint alleged that defendants solicited investors through the Internet and other means to participate in the ZeekRewards program, a self-described âaffiliate advertising divisionâ for the companion website, Zeekler.com, through which the defendants operated penny auctions. The ZeekRewards program offered customers several ways to earn money, two of which â the âRetail Profit Poolâ and the âMatrixâ â involved purchasing securities in the form of investment contracts. These securities offerings were not registered with the SEC as required under the federal securities laws., According to the Complaint, defendants promised investors a share of the companyâs daily net profits in the form of daily profit share awards. The defendants represented that those daily awards were calculated by dividing up to 50 percent of the companyâs ânet profitsâ by the number of âprofit pointsâ outstanding among all âqualified affiliates,â with those purported calculations consistently resulting in daily dividends averaging approximately 1.5 percent per day, fraudulently conveying the false impression that the company was extremely profitable. In fact, the investor payouts bore no relation to the companyâs net profits. Most of ZeekRewardsâ total revenues and the ânet profitsâ paid to investors were comprised of funds received from new investors in classic Ponzi scheme fashion., The Complaint further alleged that the scheme was teetering on collapse with investor funds at risk of dissipation without its emergency enforcement action. Last month, ZeekRewards brought in approximately $162 million while total investor cash payouts were approximately $160 million. If customers had continued increasingly to elect to receive cash payouts rather than reinvest their money to reach higher levels of rewards points, ZeekRewardsâ cash outflows would have quickly exceeded its total revenue., The Commission alleged that the defendants offered and sold securities in violation of the registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. The Complaint requested permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against the defendants. In addition, the Commission filed motions asking the Court to freeze Rex Ventureâs assets and appoint a receiver over the company and its assets., Without admitting or denying the Commissionâs allegations, and simultaneously with the filing of the Complaint, the defendants consented to permanent injunctions against future violations of the registration and antifraud provisions.

22457,2012,[<h3>SEC Charges New York-Based Firm And Owner In Penny Stock Scheme</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a New York-based firm and its owner its owner with conducting a penny stock scheme in which they bought billions of stock shares from small companies and illegally resold those shares in the public market., The SEC alleges that Edward Bronson and E-Lionheart Associates LLC reaped more than $10 million in unlawful profits from selling shares they bought at deep discounts from approximately 100 penny stock companies. On average, Bronson and E-Lionheart were able to generate sales proceeds that were approximately double the price at which they had acquired the shares. No registration statement was filed or in effect for any of the securities that Bronson and E-Lionheart resold to the investing public, and no valid exemption from the registration requirements of the federal securities laws was available., âBy violating the registration provisions of the securities laws and dumping billions of unregistered shares into the over-the-counter market, Bronson deprived investors of important information about the companies in which they were investing,â said Andrew M. Calamari, Acting Director of the SECâs New York Regional Office., According to the SECâs complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Bronson lives in Ossining, N.Y. E-Lionheart, which also does business under the name Fairhills Capital, is located in White Plains. Acting at Bronsonâs direction, E-Lionheart personnel systematically âcold calledâ penny stock companies quoted on the OTC Link to ask if they were interested in obtaining capital. If the company was interested, E-Lionheart personnel would offer to buy stock in the company at a rate that was deeply discounted from the trading price of the companyâs stock at that time. Typically, Bronson and E-Lionheart immediately began reselling the shares to the investing public through a broker within days of receiving the shares from the company., Bronson and E-Lionheart purported to rely on an exemption from registration under Rule 504(b)(1)(iii) of Regulation D, which exempts transactions that are in compliance with certain types of state law exemptions. However, no such state law exemptions were applicable to these transactions. Bronson and E-Lionheart claimed to rely on a Delaware state law registration exemption, but the transactions in fact had little or no connection to the state of Delaware. The particular Delaware state law exemption claimed by Bronson and E-Lionheart is not an exemption that meets the specific requirements of Rule 504(b)(1)(iii). As a result, investors purchasing these shares did not have access to all of the information that a registration statement would have provided, including in many instances important information concerning the issuance of millions of new shares by the company to Bronson and E-Lionheart., The SECâs complaint charges E-Lionheart and Bronson with violating Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933, and seeks disgorgement of all ill-gotten gains as well as monetary penalties. The SEC also seeks penny stock bars. The complaint also names another entity owned and controlled by Bronson â Fairhills Capital Inc. â as a relief defendant for the purpose of recovering the illegal proceeds it received.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22457.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

He was assisted by Jose Luna.  The pair defrauded two Brazilian public pension funds and a Colombian institutional investor that purchased from LatAm the structured notes issued by major U.S. and European commercial banks.  Instead of purchasing the notes for his customers accounts for prices around the banks issuance amounts - which totaled approximately $70 million - in most transactions Neves first traded the notes with one or more accounts in the name of offshore nominee entities that he and Luna controlled.  Neves then sold the notes to his customers with undisclosed markups as high as 67 percent.  Neves had no reasonable basis to mark up the prices that significantly., The SEC alleges that to conceal the excessive markups that Neves charged customers, Neves directed Luna to alter the banks structured note term sheets in half of the transactions by either whiting out or electronically cutting and pasting the markup amounts over the actual price and trade information, and then sending the forged documents to customers.  , The SEC further alleges that as a result of the markup scheme, the Brazilian funds overpaid by approximately $24 million and the Colombian institutional investor overpaid by approximately $12 million due to the undisclosed, excessive fees.  Neves enjoyed a financial boon from the scheme as LatAm paid him millions of dollars in inflated sales commissions for the structured note transactions that he made at inflated prices.  Luna received hundreds of thousands of dollars in inflated salary and commissions from LatAm and tens of thousands of dollars in additional compensation from a company that Neves controlled., As alleged in the SECs complaint, Neves and Luna violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and aided and abetted LatAms violations of Section 15(c) of the Exchange Act.  The SECs complaint seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, financial penalties, and injunctive relief against Neves and Luna to enjoin them from future violations of the federal securities laws., Luna has agreed to the entry of a judgment ordering him to pay disgorgement of $923,704.85, prejudgment interest of $241,643.51, and a penalty amount to be determined.  The judgment permanently enjoins him from violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  Luna neither admitted nor denied the allegations in the SECs complaint.  Luna also agreed to settle a related SEC administrative proceeding by agreeing to be barred from association with any broker, dealer, investment advisor, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, transfer agent, or credit rating agency., The SECs investigation was conducted in the Miami Regional Office by Laura R.

(âeHydrogenâ) and ChromoCure, Inc. (âChromoCureâ), two now defunct microcap stock companies.  Welch served as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the two companies during the relevant period and was responsible for the issuance of the false and misleading press releases of both companies.  Welch is now based offshore, most recently in Freeport, Bahamas., The Commissionâs complaint alleges that from at least March 2010 through August 2010, Welch issued a series of press releases and made other public disclosures containing false and misleading information concerning, among other things, technologies acquired by and revenues generated by eHydrogen and ChromoCure.  The complaint also alleges that the period of the false and misleading press releases coincided with suspicious price and trading volume increases in the common stock of eHydrogen and ChromoCure, and further alleged that in multiple instances such statements were intentionally false and misleading, distributed by Welch for no purpose other than to incite trading activity and artificially inflate the price and trading volume of eHydrogen and ChromoCure.  For example, in a ChromoCure press release dated March 16, 2010, Welch stated among other things, â[t]he Companyâs proprietary Chromosomal Scanner systems have proven accurate and efficient in the measurement of the unique genomic characteristic found in 100% of all cancers and never found in normal cells.  The Companyâs detection technology has been proven to have an effective accuracy of 100% for all cancers at all stages.

Â§ 78j(b)] and Rule 10b-5 thereunder [17 C.F.R. Â§ 240.10b-5].   Welch also has liability as a controlling person, pursuant to Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act for violations by eHydrogen and ChromoCure of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder. Welch is alternatively charged herein with aiding-and-abetting the antifraud violations of eHydrogen and ChromoCure.  The Commission seeks a permanent injunction against Welch for fraud, an accounting, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, civil penalties, a penny stock bar and an officer and director bar.  , <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2012/comp22463.pdf>SEC Complaint</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22463.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The complaint further alleged that Turnerâs close friend, a manager at Salesforce, tipped Turner with confidential information about Salesforceâs performance in advance of Salesforceâs public earnings announcement in February 2008.  Turner traded on the inside information in Clay Capitalâs hedge fundâs account, his personal accounts and several family memberâs accounts.

(CSKI) and its CEO and chairman Yan-qing Liu with  fraud for recording fake sales of a weight loss product to inflate revenues in  the company’s financial statements by millions of dollars., The SEC alleges CSKI falsely stated in 2007 annual  and quarterly reports that it had entered into a strategic distribution  agreement with a Malaysian company that would become the “exclusive”  distributor of CSKI’s “slim patch” in Malaysia and generate $1 million  per month in sales.Â  However, the company  never actually entered into any such agreement.Â   CSKI instead created approximately $19.8 million in phony export sales  to Malaysia  that were recorded as revenue in its financial results for 2007 and 2008.Â  CEO Yan-qing Liu certified the overstated  financial results, which appear in CSKI’s financial statements through 2010 and  continue to impact the company’s retained earnings on its balance sheet.Â  , According  to the SEC’s complaint, CSKI is based Harbin, China.Â  In addition to weight loss patches, the  company produces and sells sprays, ointments, and other Chinese traditional  pain relief and health and beauty products.Â   CSKI became a public company trading on the U.S.  markets through a reverse merger in May 2006., The  SEC alleges that after CSKI devised the purported strategic distribution  agreement with Takasima Industries â which is a Malaysian fitness equipment  manufacturer and retailer â CSKI went on to falsely report export sales to  Malaysia of more than $12.2 million for 2007, which constituted 25 percent of  its total revenues.Â  CSKI then falsely  recorded $7.5 million (8.2 percent of total revenues) in such sales for  2008.Â  Virtually all of CSKI’s reported sales to Malaysia via  Takasima were  bogus.Â  Takasima only purchased $167,542  in slim patches from CSKI in 2007, and none in  2008.Â  And it never entered into any  distribution agreement with CSKI and never undertook â much less satisfied â  any minimum purchase commitment., According  to the SEC’s complaint, CSKI also falsely claimed in  its public filings that its  top two customers for 2007 were sales agents for Takasima.Â  CSKI identified those customers as Ningbo  Yuehua International Trading Company and Guangzhou Xinghe International Trading  Company, which collectively accounted for the phony 25 percent of CSKI’s total  revenues for 2007.Â  CSKI claimed that all  of these purported sales to Ningbo Yuehua and Guangzhou Xinghe went through  Takasima, while in fact Takasima never had any relationship with these two entities. , The complaint alleges that CSKI and/or Liu violated, aided and abetted, or is liable as a control person for,  violations of Section 17(a)(2)  of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of  the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5(b), 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13.Â  The complaint further alleges that  Liu  violated  Exchange Act Section 13(b)(5) and Rules 13a-14,  13b2-1 and 13b2-2.Â  The SEC’s  complaint seeks financial penalties against CSKI and Liu as well as  disgorgement of ill-gotten gains by Liu, who personally benefited from the  overstated financial statements through the  company’s 2008 private placement of securities.Â   The SEC seeks to have Liu reimburse CSKI for certain incentive-based  compensation he received during the period affected by the fraud pursuant to  Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and to have Liu barred from acting as an  officer or director of a public company.Â   The SEC also seeks to have CSKI and Liu permanently enjoined from future  violations of these provisions of the federal securities laws. , In  addition to the court action, the Commission  issued an Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings and Notice of Hearing Pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to determine whether to revoke or  suspend registration of CSKI’s securities due to the company’s failure to file  its annual report for 2011 or any quarterly reports for 2012., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2012/comp-pr2012-175.pdf>SEC Complaint</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22470.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

22472,2012,[<h3>SEC Charges Attorney and Two Other South Florida Residents in $27.5 Million Investment Fraud</h3>],"[On September 5, 2012, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged an attorney and two others living in South Florida for their roles in a $27.5 million investment scheme that led investors to believe they were purchasing securities consisting of pre-sold commodities contracts with a pre-determined profit.  However, the supposed profits actually distributed to investors were largely taken from other investors funds., The SEC halted the scheme last year when it obtained an asset freeze and a court-appointed receiver over the companies involved: Commodities Online LLC and Commodities Online Management LLC.  The SECs follow-up charges are against the founder and former president of the company, James C. Howard III, as well as the companys vice president Louis N. Gallo III and outside counsel Michael R. Casey, who later became the president., In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of Florida today announced criminal charges against Howard, Gallo and Casey., According to the SECs complaint filed in federal court in Miami, Commodities Online offered investors the chance to participate in its purportedly profitable brokering of physical commodities via pre-sold contracts - for example, the purchase and sale of large amounts of seafood or iron ore.  Investors were sold participation units in unregistered private placement offerings, each supposedly tied to a commodities transaction in which Commodities Online had already secured a buyer and a seller of the commodity.  These participation units would purportedly generate predetermined profits for investors., The SEC alleges that in reality, Commodities Online performed only a limited percentage of the commodities transactions that were promised to investors.  The majority of profits allocated or distributed to investors were not profits from completed commodities transactions, but instead taken from the funds of other investors.  Meanwhile, Howard and Gallo were dissipating millions of dollars in investor funds to largely sham companies.  Through these companies, Howard and Gallo stole investor funds for their own use.  For example, Howard met with prospective investors at a luxury hotel in Fort Lauderdale and offered Commodities Online membership interests.  He told investors that the funds raised from the offering would be used for the companys start-up costs such as salaries, marketing, and advertising.  However, within weeks of receiving $2 million in investor funds for the purchase of the membership units, Howard siphoned $1.45 million to another entity he controlled.  Furthermore, Howard failed to disclose to prospective investors that hes a convicted felon., According to the SECs complaint, Howard stepped down as the companys president in 2010 after he was arrested for an unrelated investment fraud.  He was replaced by Casey, who misled investors about Howards continuing control over Commodities Online while also misrepresenting the profitability, structure, and existence of the purported commodities contracts to investors.  Casey also failed to tell at least one investor that the funds raised from the purchase of membership interests had previously been misappropriated by Howard., The SEC alleges that Gallo ran an in-house boiler room of telephone sales agents and a network of approximately 20 regional and international sales offices.  He failed to disclose to investors that he previously pled guilty to federal bank fraud and other felonies and was serving a term of supervised release while employed at Commodities Online.  Gallo also misled investors about Howards role at Commodities Online., The SECs complaint charges Howard, Gallo and Casey with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.  Theyre also charged with aiding and abetting violations by Commodities Online and Commodities Online Management of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5.  Howard is further charged with a violation of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act as a control person of Commodities Online, and the complaint alleges he is therefore jointly and severally liable for Commodities Onlines violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC is seeking disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus pre-judgment interest, financial penalties, and permanent injunctions against Howard, Gallo, and Casey.  The SECs complaint also names several relief defendants for the purposes of recovering investor money steered to those entities in the scheme: Sutton Capital LLC, J&amp;W Trading LLC, American Financial Solutions LLC, and Minjo Corporation., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2012/comp-pr2012-178.pdf>SEC Complaint</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22472.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The very next day after agreeing to take on EWBC as a client, Fraser bought 10,000 shares of EWBC stock.  She sold all of her shares after EWBCs stock price jumped 55 percent after the public announcement of the acquisition., Fraser agreed to settle the SECs charges by paying $91,530.36, which is more than double what she gained in illegal profits from her alleged insider trading., According to the SECs complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, EWBC contacted Fraser Communications on Oct. 14, 2009, and shared material, nonpublic information about its upcoming FDIC-assisted transaction for the confidential corporate purpose of allowing Fraser and her employees to prepare marketing and public relations materials ahead of that acquisition.  EWBC formally engaged Frasers firm on October 15 to assist EWBC with public relations work., The SEC alleges that Fraser, who lives in Santa Monica, purchased 10,000 EWBC shares on October 16 after learning the previous day about the impending EWBC-United Commercial Bank transaction.  EWBC announced the acquisition of United Commercial Banks banking operations on November 6.  Fraser proceeded to sell 7,500 of her EWBC shares on November 10, the second trading day after the announcement.  She sold the remaining 2,500 shares on June 24, 2011, for total combined profits of $43,868., In settling the SECs charges without admitting or denying the allegations, Fraser agreed to pay $43,868 in disgorgement, $3,794.36 in prejudgment interest, and a $43,868 penalty.

Schooler sold units in partnerships that Western had organized to buy vacant land in Nevada and hold for sale at a profit at a later date. Schooler and Western failed to tell investors that they were paying an exorbitant mark-up on the land, in some cases more than five times its fair market value. Schooler and Western also failed to tell investors that the land held by the partnerships was often encumbered by mortgages that Western used to help finance the initial purchase of the land., The SECâs complaint filed in federal court in San Diego alleges that Western and Schooler misled investors since 2007 by providing them with comparative prices or âcompsâ of supposedly similar plots of land that had sold for prices higher than those offered by Western. In reality, the real estate comps that Schooler and Western provided were in no way comparable to the land sold by Western. The SEC also alleges that since the spring of 2011, Schooler paid âhush moneyâ to silence investors who discovered they had been defrauded, allowing the scheme to continue., The Honorable Larry A.

The defendants are charged with defrauding investors through various misrepresentations and schemes while raising at least $26 million in investor funds., In addition to Bio Defense, the Commissionâs complaint charges Michael Lu of Lexington, Massachusetts, the founder and former CEO and Chairman of Bio Defense; Jonathan Morrone of Newton, Massachusetts, a former Senior Executive Vice President of Bio Defense; Z. Paul Jurberg of Brookline, Massachusetts, a senior officer of Bio Defense and most recently a Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing; Anthony Orth of Tustin, California, a former Vice President of Marketing for Bio Defense; and Brett Hamburger of Delray Beach, Florida, a consultant to Bio Defense who raised investor funds for the company. The Commission also named Mayâs International Corporation, an entity controlled by Michael Lu, as a relief defendant based on its receipt of investor funds., According to the Commissionâs complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, Bio Defense, which purports to develop, manufacture and sell a machine for combating the use of dangerous biological agents through the mails, and its principals began engaging in unregistered offers and sales of securities to investors in the United States by at least 2004 and, after attracting the attention of various domestic state regulators in 2008, began utilizing âboiler roomâ firms to assist in selling shares of Bio Defense securities to overseas investors primarily in the United Kingdom., The Commissionâs complaint alleges that, while making unregistered offers and sales of securities to US investors from at least 2004 through August 2008, Lu, Morrone, and Jurberg made false claims to investors that Bio Defense was not paying financial compensation to its employees and officers. The complaint further alleges that these individuals gave potential investors the false impression that Bio Defense preserved its cash assets by having employees who worked for no, or very little, pay, suggesting that these employees were working solely or primarily for âsweat equityâ shares, which might later become valuable when the company became profitable or underwent an initial public offering of stock. In fact, Bio Defenseâs largest expense during those years was the money it paid to Lu, Morrone, and Jurberg and other employees from funds raised from investors; in 2004 alone, Bio Defense paid approximately $1 million in compensation to its officers and employees., The Commissionâs complaint further alleges that, as Bio Defense began raising money overseas in August 2008, the defendants transformed the company into a deceptive and fraudulent device designed to enrich its principals while also paying as much as 75% of investor proceeds as commissions to its overseas boiler room fundraisers. From August 2008 through approximately July 2010, Bio Defenseâs most substantial source of cash generation and most significant expense was not manufacturing and selling machines, but instead was its securities promotion and sales activities. Bio Defense and its representatives did not tell investors that 75% of funds received from them would be going straight to boiler room operators., The Commission alleges that all defendants violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (âSecurities Actâ) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; that Bio Defense, Lu, Morrone, Jurberg and Orth violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act; and that Lu, Morrone, Jurberg, Hamburger and Orth violated Section 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act. The Commission also alleges, in the alternative, that Lu and Morrone are liable under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act as control persons of Bio Defense for Bio Defenseâs violations of Securities Act Section 17(a) and Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC seeks in its action permanent injunctions, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and, against Lu, Morrone, Jurberg and Orth, officer and director bars., The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Massachusetts Securities Division, the UK Financial Services Authority and the City of London Police in this matter., The SECâs investigation is continuing., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2012/comp22478.pdf>SEC Complaint</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22478.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Instead, Blankenship used the customersâ money for personal expenses, business expenses and to make Ponzi-like payments to other customers who requested a return of all or part of their investment., The action was filed in federal court in Connecticut on September 13, 2012, and the Complaint alleges that the defendants violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933. The Commission also alleges that the defendants violated Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act. In its action, the Commission seeks the entry of a permanent injunction against the defendants, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains by the defendants plus pre-judgment interest thereon, and the imposition of civil monetary penalties., Based on the same misconduct, the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the District of Connecticut charged Blankenship with criminal violations. The Connecticut Department of Bankingâs Securities Division has obtained, by consent, a revocation of Blankenshipâs registration and has barred Blankenship and Deer Hill from operating in Connecticut. The SEC thanks the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the District of Connecticut, the Connecticut Department of Bankingâs Securities Division, and the police department in Danbury, Conn., for their assistance in this matter.

22480,2012,[<h3>TWO FORMER OFFICERS OF STERLING FINANCIAL CORP. SUBSIDIARY SENTENCED TO LENGTHY PRISON TERMS AND ORDERED TO PAY $53 MILLION IN RESTITUTION FOR CONDUCTING FINANCIAL FRAUD</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on September 11 and 12, 2012, Joseph M. Braas, of Lititz, Pennsylvania, and Michael J. Schlager, of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, were sentenced in a criminal action for orchestrating a sophisticated financial fraud that lasted over five years. Braas and Schlager were two senior officers at Equipment Finance, LLC (âEFIâ), formerly a commercial lender to the soft pulp logging industry and wholly-owned subsidiary of Sterling Financial Corp. (âSterlingâ), a publicly traded bank holding company based in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Judge Paul S. Diamond of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania sentenced Braas to 15 years in federal prison, and Schlager to 20 years in prison, each followed by five years of supervised release. Braas and Schlager were also each ordered to pay $53 million in restitution. Braas and Schlager had each previously pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud, and two counts of mail fraud, all affecting a financial institution., On January 6, 2011, the Commission filed a civil action against Braas and Schlager based on the same conduct alleged in the criminal case. Without admitting or denying the Commissionâs allegations, Braas and Schlager agreed to settle the matter, and Final Judgments were entered as to each. The Commissionâs complaint alleged that, from at least February 2002 until April 2007, Braas, EFIâs Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, and Schlager, EFIâs Executive Vice President, orchestrated a pervasive and wide-ranging scheme using fraudulent underwriting and reporting practices to hide mounting losses and defaults within EFIâs commercial loan portfolio from Sterlingâs senior management and auditors., The Commission further alleged that Braas and Schlager were able to subvert virtually every aspect of EFIâs loan process and internal controls. They created fictitious loans for the purpose of making monthly payments on delinquent loans, altered loan documents to hide delinquent and fictitious loans, granted excessive deferrals and resets of delinquent loans to make them appear current, reassigned loan payments to unrelated accounts to fund payments on delinquent loans, and used aliases for borrowers to circumvent EFIâs maximum lending limitations. They also deceived Sterlingâs internal and independent auditors through fraudulent accounting entries, false collateral descriptions and appraisals, fabricated UCC filings, and by recruiting vendors to assist in the circumvention of loan confirmation procedures., As alleged in the complaint, Braas and Schlager caused EFI to report false financial information to Sterling which, in turn, from 2002 through 2006, filed quarterly and annual reports with the Commission containing materially false and misleading financial statements. As a result of the fraud, Sterling ultimately charged off $281 million of EFI finance receivables, which represented a large majority of EFIâs loan portfolio, and approximately 13 percent of Sterlingâs total loan portfolio during the period of the fraud., For further information, see Litigation Release No. 21797 (January 6, 2011).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22480.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"
22481,2012,[<h3>SEC CHARGES FORMER SYSTEMAX DIRECTOR IN COMPENSATION SCHEME</h3>],"[On September 17, 2012, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) filed a civil action for fraud and other violations against, and proposed settlement with, Gilbert Fiorentino, a former director of Systemax Inc. (“Systemax”), a Port Washington, N.Y.-based consumer electronics retailer.  , The Commission’s Complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, alleges that Gilbert Fiorentino, who in addition to serving on the board was the former chief executive of Systemax’s Technology Products Group in Miami, obtained over $400,000 in extra compensation directly from firms that conducted business with Systemax.  Fiorentino also stole several hundred thousand dollars worth of company merchandise that was used to market Systemax’s products online and in mail order catalogs.  Because Fiorentino was one of Systemax’s highest-paid executives, the federal securities laws required the company to disclose all compensation he received each fiscal year as well as his perks and other personal benefits.  Since Fiorentino failed to disclose his extra compensation and perks to Systemax or its auditors, the amounts were not reported to shareholders correctly., Systemax placed Fiorentino on administrative leave in April 2011.  After the SEC began investigating the conduct, Fiorentino agreed to resign from all of his positions with Systemax, surrender stock and stock options valued at approximately $9.1 million, and repay his 2010 annual bonus of $480,000., According to the SEC’s complaint, the misconduct occurred from January 2006 to December 2010.  Systemax sells personal computers and other consumer electronics through its websites, retail stores, and direct mail catalogs.  Fiorentino arranged the extra compensation as he dealt directly with external service providers, manufacturer representatives, and other entities that conducted business with Systemax.  For example, he demanded and received $5,000 to $10,000 monthly from an entity that supplied materials to Systemax’s subsidiaries for use in retail and mail order operations.  , The SEC further alleges that through his executive position at Systemax, Fiorentino had access to company merchandise used to market Systemax products in mail order catalogs and online.  Fiorentino routinely misappropriated some of this merchandise and failed to disclose it to Systemax and its auditors. , According to the SEC’s complaint, as a result of Fiorentino’s actions, the information that Systemax filed with the SEC and provided to investors materially understated his compensation and omitted his personal financial interest in certain related-party transactions.  Fiorentino reviewed and signed each Systemax Form 10-K from fiscal year 2006 to 2010 while knowing that it failed to make the required disclosures.  Fiorentino also routinely signed management representation letters to Systemax’s independent auditors stating that he did not know of any fraud or suspected fraud involving Systemax’s management. , The SEC’s complaint alleges that Fiorentino violated Sections 10(b), 13(b)(5), and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, 13b2-2, 14a-3, and 14a-9.  In addition, the SEC’s complaint alleges that Fiorentino aided and abetted Systemax’s violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1., Fiorentino has consented to the entry of an injunctive order without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission’s complaint.

It is alleged these violations occurred in furtherance of a scheme orchestrated by Michael Borish and Michael Ciarlone, through Freedom Environmental Services, Inc. (Freedom) which also involved misappropriation of corporate assets by Borish and Ciarlone.  The court also appointed a receiver to preserve and marshal assets, froze Borish’s assets, prohibited the destruction of documents and records, and ordered expedited discovery., The Commission’s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida (Orlando Division), alleges Borish, Freedom’s former chief executive officer, orchestrated a scheme to remain in control of the company after being removed by the board of directors.  Despite the board’s action, Borish continued to act as the company’s de facto CEO and to control its operations.  From at least July 2010 – both before and after his ostensible removal – Borish caused Freedom to file numerous false and misleading annual, quarterly, and periodic reports with the Commission.  Freedom also issued a false press release regarding the acquisition of another company, failed to file Forms 8-K regarding material events, such as Freedom’s recent bankruptcy filing, insider litigation settlements, and repeatedly misrepresented the composition of the board of directors and identities of Freedom’s officers in Freedom’s filings.  It is further alleged that Borish and Ciarlone, from July 2011 through at least May 2012, stole corporate funds to pay personal expenses.  , The complaint alleges that through this conduct Freedom, Borish and Ciarlone violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b), 13(b)(2)(A) and (B), Section 13(b)(5) and 14(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13, 13a-14, 13b-1 and 14c-6 thereunder., A hearing has been set for October 1, 2012, on the Commission’s motion for a preliminary injunction.

The Complaint alleged that Wayde and Donna McKelvy, through their Denver-based company Speed of Wealth LLC, as well as Mantria executives Wragg and Knorr, raised funds for numerous Mantria âgreenâ initiatives such as a supposed âcarbon negativeâ housing community in rural Tennessee and a âbiocharâ charcoal substitute made from organic waste. The SEC alleged that Mantriaâs âgreenâ representations were fraudulent and that investors were falsely promised enormous returns on their investments ranging from 17 percent to âhundreds of percentâ annually.  Mantriaâs environmental initiatives did not generate any significant cash, and any returns paid to investors were funded almost exclusively from other investorsâ funds.  In addition, none of the relevant offerings were registered with the Commission, nor were any of the defendants registered as a broker-dealer or associated with a registered broker-dealer., Upon the Commissionâs motion, the Court entered a temporary restraining order on November 16, 2009, and an order of preliminary injunction on December 2, 2009.

The bond offering was intended to finance a sucralose processing plant in Moberly that Mamtek would construct and operate.  The SEC alleges that Cole executed his fraud by <font face=Times New Roman size=+0>directing unsuspecting Mamtek employees to take actions that diverted over $900,000 in bond proceeds for his and his wifeâs personal use and by </font>misleading city officials and bondholders about the use of those proceeds.  , According to the complaint, prior to the close of the bond offering, Cole directed Mamtek employees and consultants to create false documentation for a nonexistent company to falsely justify fictitious expenses for the sucralose project.  The complaint alleges he then instructed Mamtek employees to wire his wife, Nanette H. Cole, $900,000 in bond proceeds, which were used to pay among other things, their mortgage, credit card debt, homeowners and auto insurance, and household employees, in part, under the false pretense that she was an agent of the sham company., The complaint further alleges that as a precondition to the issuance of the bonds, Cole signed a certificate representing certain portions of the Official Statement delivered to bondholders for the $39 million offering were not false or misleading.  However, at the time that Cole signed the document, he had already directed the creation of the false documentation and had made preliminary plans to divert and misuse the bond proceeds, rendering his representation in the closing certificate false.  In doing so, he misrepresented the use of bond proceeds and the accuracy of the Official Statement., By engaging in this conduct, Cole has violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, for making material misrepresentations and omissions and engaging in a scheme to defraud the city and bondholders.  Through this Complaint, the Commission seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.

Alleca, a private fund manager and his Atlanta-based investment advisory firm, Summit Wealth Management, Inc. and three funds operated and controlled by Alleca for defrauding investors in a purported âfund-of-fundsâ and then trying to hide trading losses by creating new private funds to make money to pay back the original fund investors in Ponzi-like fashion. According to the SECâs complaint Alleca and Summit Wealth Management offered and sold interests in Summit Investment Fund, LP, which they told their clients was operating as a fund-of-funds â meaning they were investing their money in other funds and investment products rather than directly in stocks and other securities. However, Alleca instead engaged in active securities trading with his clientsâ money, and he incurred substantial losses. He concealed the Summit Fund trading losses from investors and provided them false account statements., The complaint alleges that Alleca created at least two hedge funds to raise money from Summit Wealth clients â Private Credit Opportunities Fund, LLC and Asset Class Diversification Fund, LP. Allecaâs plan, according to the complaint, was to cover up the losses that he had incurred in Summit Fund by illegally transferring profits from the new funds in a Ponzi-like fashion in order to meet earlier redemption requests. However, Allecaâs plan backfired when those successive funds incurred further trading losses. Alleca continued to issue false account statements to investors in Summit Fund as well as the additional funds in order to hide the actual losses on their investments. The complaint alleges that, in total, Alleca raised approximately $17 million from approximately 200 clients of Summit Wealth Management., The SECâs complaint charges Alleca, Summit Wealth Management, and the three funds with violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Sections 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 206(1), (2) and (4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.

(â3G Capitalâ) and used to acquire Burger King.  Prado misused the confidential information to illegally trade in Burger King stock for $175,000 in illicit profits, and he tipped others living in Brazil and elsewhere who also traded on the nonpublic information., The SEC obtained the asset freeze in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.  The agency took the emergency action to prevent Prado from transferring his assets outside of U.S. jurisdiction.  Prado recently abandoned his most current job at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, put his Miami home up for sale, and began transferring all of his assets out of the country.  , According to the SECâs complaint, Pradoâs insider trading in Burger King stock occurred from May 17 to Sept. 1, 2010.  At the time, Prado was the representative on the account used by the customer to transfer his investment to 3G Capital.  The customer had been with Prado for more than 10 years and often shared his confidential financial information with the understanding that it was to remain confidential.  Prado had repeated contact with the customer by phone and e-mail as well as in person in Brazil during the time period that Prado traded Burger King securities., The SEC alleges that Prado began his illegal trading while on a business trip to Brazil, during which he sent an e-mail to a friend that â translated from Portuguese â read, âIâm in Brazil with information that cannot be sent by email. You canât miss itâ¦.â  Prado later told his friend on a phone call that night that he heard 3G Capital was going to take Burger King private.  The friend, a hedge fund manager in Miami, warned Prado that he should not trade on this information and should not encourage any of his customers to trade either.  , According to the SECâs complaint, Prado went on to tip at least four of his customers who eventually traded in Burger King stock based on nonpublic information about the impending acquisition.  For example, just minutes after Prado sent the May 17 e-mail to his friend in Miami, he sent an e-mail to one of those customers which, again translated from Portuguese, read, â â¦ if you are around call me at the hotel â¦ I have some infoâ¦You have to hear this.â  A 10-minute phone conversation followed, and the customer purchased out-of-the-money Burger King call options during the next two days.  In August 2010 Prado was on another business trip to Brazil, the same customer sent Prado an e-mail which translated to, â[i]s the sandwich deal going to happen?â  Prado replied, âVai sim,â which means, âYes itâs going to happen.â  He continued, â[e]verything is 100% under control.  I was embarrassed to ask about timing.  The last âvolâ got in the way.â  Following these e-mails, the customer â identified as Tippee A in the SECâs complaint â  made additional purchases in Burger King call options.  The customerâs total insider trading profits amounted to more than $1.68 million., The SECâs complaint against Prado seeks a permanent injunction from violations of Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder, disgorgement with prejudgment interest and monetary penalties. , The SECâs investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Megan Bergstrom, David Brown, and Diana Tani, in Los Angeles, and Charles D.

22487,2012,[<h3>SEC CHARGES OREGON-BASED HEDGE FUND MANAGER WITH RUNNING $37 MILLION PONZI SCHEME</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed fraud charges against a Portland, Oregon-based investment adviser who perpetrated a long-running Ponzi scheme that raised over $37 million from more than 100 investors in the Pacific Northwest and across the country., The SEC alleges that Yusaf Jawed used false marketing materials that boasted double-digit returns to lure people to invest their money into several hedge funds he managed.  He then improperly redirected their money into accounts he personally controlled.  As part of the scheme, Jawed created phony assets, sent bogus account statements to investors, and manufactured a sham buyout of the funds to make investors think their hedge fund interests would soon be redeemed.  Jawed misused investor money to pay off earlier investors, pay his own expenses and travel, and create the overall illusion of success and achievement to impress investors.   , According to the SECâs complaint filed in federal court in Portland, Jawed managed a number of hedge funds through at least two companies he controlled: Grifphon Asset Management LLC and Grifphon Holdings LLC.  Jawedâs marketing materials claimed that the Grifphon funds earned double-digit returns year after year even as the S&amp;P 500 Index declined.  For certain funds, Jawed also falsely claimed they would invest in publicly-traded securities and that their assets were maintained at reputable financial institutions.  , The SEC alleges that Jawed instead invested very little of the more than $37 million that he raised from investors.  For one fund, 70 percent of the money raised was either paid in redemptions to investors in other funds, paid to finders,  or merely transferred to accounts belonging to Grifphon Asset Management or other entities that Jawed controlled.  Jawed concealed the fraud by telling Grifphonâs bookkeepers that the money transfers represented purchases of offshore bonds â though in reality the purported investment was a sham entity supposedly managed by Jawedâs unemployed aunt who lives in Bangladesh., According to the SECâs complaint, Jawed further deceived investors as the funds were collapsing by telling them that independent third parties were buying the Grifphon fundsâ alleged assets at a premium.  In truth, the so-called third-parties were sham entities originally formed by Grifphon and Jawed containing no assets, no income, and no ability to pay for the fundsâ alleged assets., The SECâs complaint against Jawed additionally charges Robert P. Custis, an attorney who Jawed hired to assist him in the fraud.  Custis sent false and misleading statements to investors about the status of the purported purchase of the Grifphon fundsâ assets.  Custis consistently misrepresented that this purchase was imminent and would result in investorsâ investments being repaid at a profit. , By engaging in the above conduct, Jawed, GAM, and Grifphon Holdings violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.  By engaging in the above conduct, Custis violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and aided and abetted violations of Section 206(4) and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.  The Commission seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement and prejudgment interest, civil penalty, and other relief as appropriate against them., The SEC filed separate complaints against two others connected to Jawedâs scheme.  Those complaints allege that Jacques Nichols â a Portland-based attorney â falsely claimed to investors that an independent third party would pay tens of millions of dollars to buy the hedge fundsâ alleged assets at a premium, and that Jawedâs associate, Lyman Bruhn, of Vancouver, Wash., ran a separate Ponzi scheme and induced investments through false claims he was investing in âblue chipâ stocks.  , Without admitting or denying the allegations, Nichols, Bruhn, and two entities Bruhn controlled (Pearl Asset Management, LLC and Sasquatch Capital Management, LLC) agreed to settle the SECâs charges.  Along with other relief, Bruhn consented to the entry of permanent injunctions against violations of the Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.  Along with other relief, Nichols consented to the entry of a permanent injunction against violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and aiding and abetting violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.

Wheet (âWheetâ) with fraudulently issuing false and misleading press releases concerning the companyâs flagship product, a retractable, medical safety syringe (âsafety syringeâ).  , The Commissionâs Complaint alleges that, between approximately August 2010 and July 2011, Revolutions Medical and Wheet issued a series of misleading press releases that contained statements designed to convey the impression that, among other things, Revolutions Medical had finalized the development of a safe and effective syringe, the syringe was slated for imminent mass manufacturing and commercial distribution, and Revolutions Medical had entered into, or was on the cusp of entering into, binding mass sales and distribution agreements, including a sales agreement with the U.S. Department of Defense.  However, contrary to the statements made in the companyâs press releases, Revolutions Medical had not developed a safe and effective syringe ready for mass manufacturing or commercial distribution, and had not entered into any binding agreements for the sale and distribution of such a final product.   The Commissionâs Complaint further alleges that, through the press releases, Revolutions Medical and Wheet artificially inflated the price of Revolutions Medicalâs shares, and that Revolutions Medical sold shares to a third-party hedge fund at inflated prices.   , In its Complaint, the Commission alleges that Revolutions Medical and Wheet violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

22491,2012,[<h3>SEC CHARGES TYCO WITH MAKING ILLICIT PAYMENTS TO FOREIGN OFFICIALS </h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that it filed a settled civil action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against Tyco International Ltd.  The complaint alleges that Tyco violated the books and records, internal controls, and anti-bribery provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).  Tyco has agreed to pay over $13 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest to settle the charges., In April 2006, the Commission filed a settled accounting fraud, disclosure, and FCPA injunctive action against Tyco.  At the time of the 2006 settlement, Tyco had committed to and commenced a review of its FCPA compliance and a global internal investigation of possible additional FCPA violations.  As a result of that review and investigation, certain FCPA violations have come to light for which the misconduct occurred, or the benefit to Tyco continued, after the 2006 injunction.  Those are the violations that are alleged in today’s complaint., Accordingly, the Commission’s complaint alleges that, from 2006 to 2009, Tyco subsidiaries operated twelve illicit payment schemes.  Many of the schemes involved fake commissions and related payments, and several also included the use of third-party agents to funnel money improperly.  The complaint further alleges that Tyco’s books and records were misstated as a result of the misconduct and that Tyco failed to devise and maintain internal controls sufficient to detect the violations.  The complaint also alleges that payments by a sales agent to Turkish government officials violated the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA.  , In settling the Commission’s charges, Tyco has consented to the entry of a proposed final judgment permanently enjoining it from violating Sections 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 30A(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and ordering it to pay disgorgement of $10,564,992, plus prejudgment interest of $2,566,517.  The proposed settlement is subject to the approval of the District Court., According to the SEC’s complaint, Tyco voluntarily disclosed this conduct to the Commission and thereafter took extensive remedial measures, including firing the employees involved in the misconduct, exiting certain lines of business, and making significant enhancements to its FCPA compliance program. , The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the U.S. Department of Justice’s Fraud Section in this matter.  Today the Department of Justice announced related criminal proceedings, pursuant to which Tyco has agreed to pay criminal penalties in excess of $13 million., For further information about the Commission’s 2006 action against Tyco, see Litigation Release No. 19657 (Apr. 17, 2006). ,  ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22491.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Pameijer, Lindsay R. Sayer, Ryan W. Koester and his entity Rykoworks Capital Group, LLC (“Rykoworks”) with running a fraudulent investment scheme.  The complaint alleges that the defendants in this scheme misappropriated nearly $1.7 million from investors., As alleged in the complaint, Koester held himself out as an expert foreign currency trader, and falsely represented to investors that his unique trading strategy offered investors a principal guaranteed investment opportunity.  As alleged in the complaint, Koester and Pameijer, a career insurance salesman, agreed to a profit sharing arrangement for clients Pameijer brought to Rykoworks.  The complaint alleges that, starting in 2010, Pameijer and his daughter, Sayer, began soliciting clients to invest with Rykoworks through promissory notes which purported to guarantee investor principal while offering risk free returns from forex trading.  , As alleged in the complaint, Pameijer and Sayer misappropriated the majority of funds they raised from investors for personal use.  The complaint alleges that Pameijer used investor money to pay for luxury automobiles, a motorcycle, a boat, home renovations, his son’s college tuition, and Sayer’s wedding and honeymoon in St. Lucia.  The complaint further alleges that Sayer used investor money to pay rent and wedding expenses, and for other personal expenditures.  According to the complaint, the remaining investor funds Pameijer and Sayer transferred to Koester and Rykoworks, and additional funds Koester raised from investors directly, Koester depleted through trading losses and misappropriation of funds for personal expenses.  The SEC alleges that, as part of the scheme, each of the proposed defendants made materially false representations to investors, including providing investors with false account statements and information.  , By engaging in this conduct, the SEC alleges that each of the defendants violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Pameijer and Sayer violated Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act by acting as unregistered brokers.

22493,2012,[<h3>SEC Charges Bank Executives in Nebraska with Understating Losses During Financial Crisis</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged three former bank executives in Nebraska for participating in a scheme to understate millions of dollars in losses and mislead investors and federal regulators at the height of the financial crisis.  One of the executives and his son also are charged with insider trading. , The SEC alleges that Gilbert G. Lundstrom, who was the CEO and chairman of the board at Lincoln, Neb.-based TierOne Bank, along with president and chief operating officer James A. Laphen and chief credit officer Don A. Langford played a role in TierOne understating its loan-related losses as well as losses on real estate repossessed by the bank.  TierOne had expanded into riskier types of lending in Las Vegas and other high-growth geographic areas in Arizona and Florida, and the bank was experiencing a significant rise in high-risk problem loans.  TierOnes primary banking regulator, the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS), directed TierOne to maintain higher capital ratios as a result of the banks increase in high-risk problem loans.  To appear to comply with these heightened capital requirements, Lundstrom, Laphen, and Langford disregarded information showing that the collateral securing certain TierOne loans and real estate repossessed by the bank was overvalued due to the banks reliance on stale and inadequately discounted appraisals.  The losses were understated by millions of dollars in multiple SEC filings.  , According to the SECs complaints filed in U.S. District Court for Nebraska, the truth about TierOnes losses did not become publicly known until late 2009 after OTS required TierOne to obtain new appraisals for its impaired loans.  TierOne, in turn, disclosed more than $130 million in loan losses.  Had these loss provisions been booked in the proper quarters, the bank would have missed its required capital ratios as far back as the fourth quarter of 2008.  Following the announcement of these loss provisions, TierOnes stock price dropped more than 70 percent, and the bank filed for bankruptcy shortly after it was shut down by OTS in June 2010.  , With regard to the insider trading charges against the Lundstroms, the SEC alleges that Gilbert Lundstrom tipped his son in 2009 with confidential details about a proposed asset sale between TierOne and Great Western Bank.  Based on this material, nonpublic information, Trevor Lundstrom bought nearly 210,000 TierOne shares between June and September 2009 in anticipation of the asset sale.  Following a September 4, 2009 public announcement about the transaction, Lundstrom sold his TierOne holdings for $225,921 in illicit profits.<br/>Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SECs complaint, Gilbert Lundstrom, Laphen, and Trevor Lundstrom have agreed to settle the charges against them.  Gilbert Lundstrom consented to a final judgment enjoining him from violations of Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2, from aiding and abetting violations of Exchange Act Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13, and from controlling any person who violates Exchange Act Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13; barring him from serving as an officer or director of a public company; and imposing civil penalties of $500,921.  , Laphen consented to a final judgment enjoining him from violations of Exchange Act Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 and from aiding and abetting violations of or controlling any person who violates Exchange Act Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13; barring him from serving as an officer or director of a public company; and imposing a civil penalty of $225,000.  , Trevor Lundstrom consented to a final judgment enjoining him from violations of Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5; imposing disgorgement of $225,921, plus prejudgment interest of $16,507; and imposing a $225,921 civil penalty., The SECs case against Langford is ongoing.

The Commission’s complaint alleged that Gengler told investors at Teach Me to Trade securities trading workshops that he had purchased mentoring, classes and software to learn to trade, and quickly profited by trading securities using Teach Me to Trade methods.  The Commission alleged that Gengler’s tales of trading success were untrue; he was not a successful securities trader.  Gengler was president of Lashaico, and he sold the products and services pursuant to an independent contractor agreement between Lashaico and Teach Me to Trade.  See Litigation Release No. 20486 (March 11, 2008), Under the terms of the settlement, Gengler agreed to pay a civil money penalty of $200,000.

Bryant, Thomas J. Kelly, and Carl N. Duncan, Esq. for their roles in a scheme to manipulate 8000, Inc.s stock price.  The complaint charges the defendants misrepresented 8000, Inc.s financial condition to investors while simultaneously selling, or facilitating the sale of, the companys securities in violation of the antifraud and securities registration provisions of the federal securities laws.  According to the complaint, the defendants scheme increased the volume of trading in 8000, Inc., by 93% and the companys stock price from less than $0.01 per share to $0.42 per share between November 2009 and October 2010., Securities of 8000, Inc., a Virginia-based company, were quoted on OTC Pink operated by OTC Markets Group LLC (OTC Markets).  The complaint alleges that Bryant and Kelly disseminated financial reports and press releases falsely representing that 8000, Inc. had millions of dollars in capital financing and revenues when, in fact, the company had neither.  The complaint further alleges that, as they drove 8000, Inc.s stock price higher with the false information, Bryant, of Hole Town, Barbados, sold 56.8 million shares of 8000, Inc. into the market, reaping substantial profits.  The shares that Bryant sold were allegedly restricted shares that he should not have sold into the market at that time.  Kelly, of Levittown, Pennsylvania, allegedly profited from the scheme by buying and selling the companys securities in the secondary market., The Commissions complaint charges that Duncan, who served as securities counsel to 8000, Inc., participated in the scheme by providing false legal opinions to the companys transfer agent that improperly removed the restrictions on Bryants shares and enabled Bryant to unlawfully sell the restricted shares into the market.  According to the complaint, Duncan also provided false legal opinions to OTC Markets that ensured that 8000, Inc.s common stock would continue to be quoted on OTC Pink.  Duncan, of Bethesda, Maryland, received one million shares of 8000, Inc. from Bryant, but was impeded from selling those shares after the Commission issued an order on November 4, 2010, suspending trading in the securities of 8000, Inc., The Commission alleges that 8000, Inc. violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that Kelly and Bryant violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) and that they aided and abetted the violations of Section 17(a) and Section 10(b) of the Exchange and Rule 10b-5 by 8000, Inc.  The Commission also alleges Bryant is liable for 8000, Inc.s violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 as the companys control person and that Bryan violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act.  The Commission is seeking permanent injunctions, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against 8000, Inc., Bryant and Kelly, and against Bryant and Kelly penny stock bars.     , Duncan, who has agreed to settle the matter subject to Court approval, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, consented to the entry of a final judgment that would permanently enjoin him from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act and from preparing or issuing any opinion letter in connection with the offer or sale of securities pursuant to, or claiming an exemption under, Section 4(1) of the Securities Act and Rules 144 and 802 under the Securities Act, including without limitation, signing an opinion letter or preparing an opinion letter to be signed by another person, related to such offering.

Holcom, of Welches, Oregon, and Jose L. Pinedo, of San Diego, California, in connection with a fraudulent scheme that sold $42 million of promissory notes to more than 150 investors located across the United States, many of whom are senior citizens., According to the complaint against Holcom, he lured investors by offering them guaranteed monthly interest payments on purportedly safe deals.  He promised that their funds would be used to finance the development of specific pieces of real estate, and that each investment would be fully secured.    In reality, the investments were unsecured, and the same piece of underlying property was often pledged as purported collateral on numerous investors’ promissory notes.  , In addition to his misrepresentations, the complaint alleges that Holcom was also running a classic Ponzi scheme.  While Holcom used some of the investors’ money to develop real estate, he also relied on those funds to make interest and principal payments on promissory notes as they came due.  Holcom also used investor funds for personal use and on unrelated business ventures.  By 2008, as the real estate market declined, Holcom’s scheme collapsed.  Investors lost principal in excess of $25 million.  , The Commission also alleges that Pinedo, who served as Holcom’s bookkeeper and as an officer or manager of Holcom’s numerous corporate entities, routinely signed promissory notes and other false and misleading documents that were sent to investors.  , The Commission alleges that Holcom violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”), Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Lee tipped his longtime college friend Victor Chen of Sunnyvale, Calif., with the confidential information, and Chen traded heavily on the basis of the nonpublic details that Lee had a duty to protect.  Chen made more than $600,000 in illicit profits, which was a 237 percent return on his initial investment.  Bank records reveal a pattern of large cash withdrawals by Lee followed by large cash deposits by Chen, who then used the money for the insider trading., According to the SEC’s complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, Lee was first privy to information about Leerink’s client Syneron Medical Ltd., which was negotiating an acquisition of Candela Corporation in 2009.  He later learned that Leerink’s client Somanetics Corporation was in the process of being acquired by Covidien plc. in 2010.  As Lee collected nonpublic details about each of the deals, he communicated with Chen repeatedly and exchanged dozens of phone calls and text messages.  Some of the calls took place from Lee’s office telephone at Leerink.  Lee had a duty to preserve the confidentiality of the information that he received in the course of his employment at Leerink., The SEC alleges that in the days leading up to the public announcements of each of these deals, Chen made sizeable purchases of stock and call options in Candela and Somanetics and made unusual trades in the securities of each of these acquisition targets.  Chen had never previously bought securities in these companies, yet he suddenly spent a significant portion of his available cash to buy the Candela and Somanetics securities.  Chen proceeded to sell most of his Candela and Somanetics holdings once public announcements were made about the transactions.  Because Chen made some of his trades in his sister Jennifer Chen’s account, the SEC’s complaint also names her as a relief defendant for the purposes of recovering the illegal profits in her account.  , The SEC alleges that Lee and Chen violated Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder.  The SEC is seeking disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, financial penalties, and permanent injunctions against Lee and Chen.  , The SEC’s investigation was conducted in the Chicago Regional Office by Kara M.

Instead, Banet brazenly took the teacherâs investment totaling $550,000 and used it to pay unauthorized personal and business expenses, including his home mortgage, office rent, and staff salaries. Banet also provided phony account statements showing non-existent investment gains and listing an independent administrator that performed no actual work for the fund., As a result of the conduct described in the Complaint the SEC alleges that Lion Capital and Banet violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.

Quay (Quay) and his brother Jeffrey A. Quay facilitated a scheme in which the women invested $560,000 with the understanding that they were investing in a covered-call equities trading program. The Quays created a sham limited partnership called Trinity Charitable Solutions (TCS) to purportedly operate the program. However, TCS never became a legal entity, and instead the Quays merely deposited the investorsâ money in a Scottrade account and personally misused at least $180,000 to afford mortgage payments, lavish restaurant meals, and membership at a massage spa., According to the SECâs complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, Quay concealed from these two women and other investors that he is a convicted felon and disbarred attorney. Previously, Quay steered investors toward fraudulent investment opportunities from which he received $1.4 million in illicit sales commissions. For instance, Quay was an active sales agent and recruiter for <a href=/news/press/2009/2009-77.htm>a multi-million dollar Ponzi scheme conducted by a Georgia attorney</a> and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2010/lr21789.htm>a scheme involving an unregistered covered-call equities trading program</a>. He has used various aliases and fake names including Jim Quay, Stephen Quay, and Stephen Jameson., The SEC alleges that Quay would often host free dinner seminars that target retirees in order to gain their trust. Quay would then encourage the attendees to schedule private consultations with him to discuss their financial situation in greater detail. Attendees would receive a biography that detailed Quayâs educational background and professional designations. The follow-up consultations would often take place at Quayâs personal office, where his legal diplomas, bar certification, and other professional licenses and certifications were displayed on the wall. While he would regularly tout his academic background and legal expertise, he typically would not disclose to investors his criminal background, disbarment, and loss of professional designations and licenses., Quay agreed to settle the SECâs charges by consenting to the entry of a final judgment by the court providing permanent injunctive relief under Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.

Douglas a/k/a James L. Cooper in civil contempt for failure to pay in full a judgment entered in 1983.  , On January 18, 1982, the SEC filed a complaint against Douglas, alleging that he had raised more than $7.5 million by offering and selling unregistered oil and gas partnerships through false pretenses.  Douglas subsequently settled.  On August 26, 1983, the Court entered an Order Directing Ancillary Relief, ordering him to disgorge $200,000 within three years. , Douglas did not comply with the Courtâs payment schedule, paying only $121,975.29 of the $200,000 judgment, and leaving an unpaid balance of $78,024.71 plus post-judgment interest.  Counsel for Douglas at the time reported that Douglas lacked the ability to pay, and that Douglas may have moved to Scotland. , Based on the non-payment, the SEC filed a motion for contempt on July 8, 1988.  On August 8, 1988, the Court granted the SECâs motion, found Douglas in contempt, and issued a warrant for his arrest.  The warrant was never executed because the U.S. Marshals could not locate Douglas.  In 2010, the SEC learned that Douglas had returned to the U.S. and that his fortunes had changed.  Douglas filed suit on behalf of his deceased wifeâs estate against several tobacco companies in Florida state court.  In March, 2010, the jury awarded $2.5 million to the Estate of Charlotte M. Douglas, of which Douglas is the sole beneficiary.  The verdict is currently on appeal to the Supreme Court of Florida. , On January 23, 2012, the SEC filed a Motion for a Rule to Show Cause and for an Order of Civil Contempt, requesting that the Court hold Douglas in contempt for a second time.  The Court presided over four days of evidentiary hearings.  On August 20, 2012, the Court granted the SECâs motion, holding Douglas in contempt for a second time.  The Court ruled that âDefendantâs lavish lifestyle apparently is over, but he has dodged his legal debt long enough, and it is high time for him to pay what he owes.â  <i>See </i>August 20, 2012 Memorandum Opinion and Order.  The Court also ruled that, under 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1961, Douglas must pay post-judgment interest at the statutory rate of 10.74% from the âdate of the entry of the judgmentâ in 1983.  âThat rate may seem high by todayâs standards, but it is properly calculated. . . . And if [Douglas] finds the amount due unreasonable, it is the result of his own misconduct for avoiding payment for so long.â  <i>See </i>August 20, 2012 Memorandum Opinion and Order.  Based on the SECâs calculation, the post-judgment interest now exceeds $1.7 million., For additional information, please see Litigation Release Nos. 9578 (February 5, 1982), 10120 (September 13, 1983) and 11845 (August 24, 1988).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22507.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The SEC previously charged the defendants in complaints filed on December 5 and 14, 2011, with insider trading after they reaped more than $2.8 million in profits by trading in advance of a publicly announced merger between London-based Pearson plc and Beijing-based Global Education and Technology Group, Ltd.  , The SECâs second amended complaint filed on October 4, 2012, names a new defendant, Jie Meng.  According to the SECâs second amended complaint, Meng was a friend of Angela Yangâs (a/k/a/ Yang Yan), a PRC citizen and a resident of Beijing, China.  Yang worked for Pearson and was privy to the details concerning the Global Education acquisition before the transaction was made public.  In the fall of 2011, Yang told Meng that Pearson was going to acquire Global Education and that if the buyout was successful, the stock price of Global Education would increase.  Yang also told Meng that the information about the Global Education acquisition was âtop secretâ and asked Meng not to tell anybody about the acquisition out of fear of losing her job.  Yang then sent Meng $40,000 to purchase Global Education securities.  Meng used Yangâs $40,000 plus approximately $35,000 from the bank account Meng shared with previously charged defendant Song Li to purchase 24,592 shares of Global Education securities in Liâs brokerage account.  , The second amended complaint also alleges that Pearson and Global Education each announced before trading began on November 21, 2011 that Pearson agreed to acquire all of Global Educationâs outstanding stock for $294 million. Global Educationâs stock price increased 97 percent that day, from $5.37 to $10.60.  On November 21 and 22, 2011, Meng sold a total of 20,592 Global Education shares at an average price of $10.51 per share, resulting in profits of over $142,000.  Soon thereafter, Meng requested that the brokerage firm liquidate Liâs account and issue Li a check for the proceeds of Mengâs trading.  However, as a result of asset freeze orders imposed in the SECâs case, those proceeds have remained frozen in Liâs account., The SECâs second amended complaint charges Meng with violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the second amended complaint, Meng consented to the entry of a final judgment enjoining Meng from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, ordering Meng to pay disgorgement, jointly and severally with Li, of $142,052 plus prejudgment interest of $2,141 for a total of $144,193, and ordering a civil penalty against Meng in the amount of $71,000.  The second amended complaint also dismisses Li as a defendant, names her as a relief defendant, and orders her to pay, joint and severally with Meng, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest totaling $144,193.  The monetary sanctions will be paid out of the frozen funds., With respect to the other defendants in the pending action, Lili Wang consented to the entry of a final judgment enjoining her from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, ordering Wang to pay disgorgement of $197,117.80 plus prejudgment interest of $1,474.15 for a total of $198,591.95, and ordering a civil penalty against Wang in the amount of $197,117.80.

Waters is also a defendant in an action filed by the Commission on May 1, 2012.  The criminal information charges Waters with sixteen counts of securities fraud, mail fraud, money laundering, and obstruction of justice., According to the criminal information, from at least 2007 through 2012, Waters used fictitious investment-related partnerships to draw in investors, misappropriate their investment money, and spend the vast majority of it on personal and business expenses and debts.  Waters is alleged to have raised at least $839,000 from at least thirteen investors, including $500,000 from his church in March 2012., The criminal information also alleges that Waters engaged in a criminal scheme to defraud clients of his rare coins business using interstate commerce and the mails.  Under this scheme, Waters defrauded coin customers out of as much as $7.8 million by selling coins at prices inflated, on average, by 600% and by inducing coin purchasers to return coins to him, on the false representation that he would sell those coins on the customers’ behalf, when, in fact, he sold most or all of the coins and kept the proceeds for himself.  The criminal information further alleges that Waters engaged in money laundering through two transactions totaling $77,000., Finally, the criminal information alleges that Waters made multiple misrepresentations to Commission staff, including that there were no investors in his investment-related partnerships, in order to conceal the fact that investor money was misappropriated in a fraudulent scheme.  Waters is charged with obstruction of justice related to this conduct., The filing of the criminal information follows the Commission’s complaint filed in federal court in Boston on May 1, 2012 against Waters and two of his companies, A.L.

In its action, the Commission seeks the entry of a permanent injunction against the defendants, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains by the defendants and relief defendants plus pre-judgment interest thereon, and the imposition of civil monetary penalties against the defendants.  , On May 3, 2012, the U.S. District Court in Massachusetts issued a preliminary injunction in the SEC’s action that, among other things, prohibits the civil defendants from continuing to violate certain federal securities laws and freezes the assets of the defendants.  , On August 7, 2012, the Commission also filed a civil contempt motion alleging that Arnett Waters had willfully violated the Court’s preliminary injunction order.  The Commission’s motion alleged that Waters had established an undisclosed bank account, transferred funds to that account, dissipated assets, and failed to disclose the bank account as required by the Court.

The complaint alleged that, in reality, there were no transactions and that Huff and Jimenez created false invoices and technical documents and that they lied to auditors., The Commission’s complaint against Monterosso and Vargas alleged that they created hundreds of false invoices from 2004 to 2006 that made it appear that GlobeTels three wholly-owned subsidiaries, Centerline Communications, LLC (Centerline), Volta Communications, LLC (Volta), and Lonestar Communications, LLC (Lonestar) bought and sold telecom minutes with other wholesale telecom companies. The complaint alleged that, in reality, there were no transactions under the program that GlobeTel executives described as the off-net revenue program. It alleged that two of GlobeTels subsidiaries - Volta and Lonestar - actually did no business. It alleged that the third subsidiary, Centerline, reported millions of dollars in business with Monterossos and Vargas own private company, Carrier Services Inc. (CSI), which did not occur., The Commission’s complaint against Lynch alleged that he was aware that the invoices submitted by Monterosso and Vargas did not represent actual telecom business conducted by Centerline.  The complaint alleged that Lynch made and approved journal entries in GlobeTel’s financial records to record revenue and to conceal that GlobeTel and its supposed counter-parties were not paying their bills., In May 2008 and August 2010 respectively, Lynch and Huff consented to the entry of judgments against them in the Commission’s action.  On May 20, 2008, the court barred Lynch from serving as an officer or director for five years.

22514,2012,[<h3>SEC CHARGES THREE INDIVIDUALS FOR THEIR ROLES IN A $5.77 MILLION INVESTMENT SCHEME </h3>],"[On October 18, 2012, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission charged Geoffrey H. Lunn, Darlene A. Bishop and Vincent G. Curry for their roles in making false and misleading statements to investors and misappropriating investors’ money in connection with a $5.77 million investment scheme under the name of Dresdner Financial, a fictitious financial services company purportedly based in Chicago, Illinois., The SEC’s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado, alleged that between February 2010 and February 2011, the defendants raised $5.77 million from at least 70 investors located throughout the United States and several foreign countries.  According to the complaint, Lunn solicited marketers and investors to the scheme by telling them that he was the Vice-President of Dresdner and that Dresdner’s principals had connections to Dresdner Bank (formerly one of Germany’s largest banks).  As marketers, Bishop and Curry played significant roles in the scheme by soliciting and lulling investors while receiving payments from the investors’ money.  The complaint alleged that Lunn, Bishop and Curry told investors that Dresdner offered 100% guaranteed rates of return through a process involving the lease and monetization of bank instruments.  For example, the defendants told investors that by investing $44,000 in Dresdner’s .44 Magnum Leveraged Financing Program, they would receive a payment of $2 million within 10-12 banking days.  When they were unable to repay investors after the promised 10-12 days, the defendants perpetuated the scheme by repeatedly postponing the payout dates and claiming that the delays were due to holds placed by banks or the government.  In reality, all of these statements were false and Dresdner and its investment programs were nothing more than an elaborate hoax., According to the complaint, Lunn did not invest any of the investors’ funds as promised.  Instead, Lunn began making cash withdrawals from the investors’ money after the very first deposit.  Over the course of the scheme, Lunn withdrew over $1 million in cash and Western Union transfers which he claims to have given to Dresdner’s creator, a one-eyed man who used the alias “Robert Perello.”  Lunn also gave at least $848,500 to three Las Vegas call girls, paid over $1.3 million to marketers (including over $650,000 to Bishop and Curry), paid $1 million to a favored investor in a Ponzi-like payment, and using the remaining investor funds to pay for his personal and business expenses. , The SEC’s complaint alleges that Lunn, Bishop and Curry violated the registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933, the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the broker registration provisions of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act.  The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest and civil penalties against all three defendants.  ,  ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22514.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Well Advantage sold those shares for more than $7 million in illicit profits immediately after the deal was publicly announced. Well Advantage is controlled by prominent Hong Kong businessman Zhang Zhi Rong, who also controls another company that has a strategic cooperation agreement with CNOOC., Well Advantage has agreed to the entry of a final judgment requiring payment of $7,122,633.52 in illegal profits made from trading Nexen stock, and payment of a $7,122,633.52 penalty.

The SECâs complaint alleges that to finance the real estate business, the Mulhollands raised money from individual investors residing in Michigan and Florida through the offer and sale of securities in the form of demand notes.  Beginning in at least January 2009, however, the Mulhollandsâ real estate business began to experience financial difficulties.  The Mulhollands continued to raise money from investors and from January 2009 through January 2010, they raised approximately $2 million from approximately 75 investors.  The Mulhollands told these investors that their real estate business was profitable, they would earn 7% per year on their investment, the returns would be generated by profits of the real estate business, and that the investors could get their money back upon 30 daysâ written notice., The SECâs complaint alleges that the Mulhollands statements to investors were false and/or misleading. The real estate business was losing money during this period, needed new investor funds to pay its bills and to pay interest to previous investors, and did not have the means to refund investorsâ principal within 30 days even if a small number of them asked for their money back.  The Mulhollands concealed their perilous financial condition from investors.  The Mulhollands never told investors that they were experiencing financial hardship, that they were having difficulty meeting financial obligations critical to the real estate operation, or that they were contemplating filing for bankruptcy., <b>The SECâs complaint charges the Mulhollands with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 15(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The complaint alleges that LoBue used material, nonpublic information about sales and expenses of the companyâs stores to purchase J.Crew common stock in advance of earnings announcements in May and August 2009., The Commissionâs complaint alleges that in the course of his employment LoBue regularly received nonpublic information about J.Crewâs âStoresâ component, which comprised approximately 70% of the companyâs sales. In April and May 2009, LoBue received several reports containing information about J.Crewâs expenses, payroll costs, and store sales results for the companyâs fiscal first quarter ended May 2, 2009. The reports showed results that were better than expected. The complaint further alleges that LoBue breached duties he owed to the company and its shareholders by using the information to purchase 2,300 shares of J.Crew stock in advance of the companyâs May 28, 2009 quarterly earnings release. The market reacted positively to the release, with J.Crewâs stock closing up 26.4% from its prior close., The complaint also alleges that in July and August 2009 LoBue continued to receive the reports on J.Crew stores, including storesâ sales figures, and that the information showed that the company was experiencing an improving sales trend.

Van Gilder subsequently purchased  Delta Petroleum stock and highly speculative options contracts. He tipped  several others, encouraging them to do the same, including a pair of relatives  via an e-mail with the subject line Xmas present. After Tracindas investment  was publicly announced, Delta Petroleums stock price shot up by almost 20  percent.

That same day, Van Gilder contacted  his broker and arranged to purchase more Delta stock and options for himself.

22523,2012,[<h3>Former Silicon Valley Executive to Pay $1.75 Million to Settle Insider Trading Charges</h3>],"[On October 24, 2012, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged a former senior executive at a Silicon Valley technology company for illegally tipping convicted hedge fund manager Raj Rajaratnam with nonpublic information that allowed the Galleon hedge funds to make nearly $1 million in illicit profits., The SEC alleges that Kris Chellam tipped Rajaratnam in December 2006 with confidential details from internal company reports indicating that Xilinx Inc. would fall short of revenue projections it had previously made publicly. The tip enabled Rajaratnam to engage in short selling of Xilinx stock to illicitly benefit the Galleon funds. Chellam tipped Rajaratnam, who was a close friend, at a time when Chellam had his own substantial investment in Galleon funds and was in discussions with Rajaratnam about prospective employment at Galleon. Chellam was hired at Galleon in May 2007., Chellam, who lives in Saratoga, Calif., has agreed to pay more than $1.75 million to settle the SECs charges. The settlement is subject to court approval., According to the SECs complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan, Xilinx announced in October 2006 the financial results for the second quarter of its 2007 fiscal year. Xilinx also provided guidance for the third quarter by projecting revenues of approximately $476 million to $490 million. Xilinx said it would update this revenue guidance on Dec. 7, 2006. , The SEC alleges that in the weeks leading up to Xilinxs December 7 update, Chellam received multiple reports indicating that the companys third quarter business results were not going to be as positive as projected in October. Chellam learned on November 21 that the top end of the projected revenue range was being lowered from $490 million to $470 million. He attended a December 4 confidential executive staff meeting where the bottom end of the revenue projection was lowered from $476 million to $455 million. On December 5, Chellam telephoned Rajaratnam and tipped him about Xilinxs worse-than-expected performance. Just minutes after the call, Galleon hedge funds controlled by Rajaratnam sold short Xilinx stock, eventually selling short more than 650,000 shares over the course of that day and the following day. , According to the SECs complaint, the Galleon hedge funds reaped approximately $978,684 in illegal profits after the December 7 announcement by covering the substantial short position that Rajaratnam had accumulated based on Chellams tip. Chellam had more than $1 million invested in one of the Galleon hedge funds in which Rajaratnam placed these trades. In May 2007, Chellam became the co-managing partner of the Galleon Special Opportunities Fund, a venture capital fund that focused on investments in late-stage technology companies. Chellam continued to work at Galleon until April 2009 and continued to obtain confidential information about Xilinxs financial performance and pass it along to Galleon colleagues. Chellam earned approximately $675,000 in total compensation during his employment at Galleon., The SECs complaint charges Chellam with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933. The proposed final judgment orders Chellam to pay $675,000 in disgorgement, $106,383.05 in prejudgment interest, and a $978,684 penalty. Chellam also would be barred for a period of five years from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and permanently enjoined from future violations of these provisions of the federal securities laws. Chellam neither admits nor denies the charges., The SEC has now charged 32 defendants in its Galleon-related enforcement actions, which have exposed widespread and repeated insider trading at numerous hedge funds and by other traders, investment professionals, and corporate insiders throughout the country. The alleged insider trading has occurred in the securities of more than 15 companies for illicit profits totaling approximately $93 million.]"
22524,2012,[<h3>Former Deloitte Partner Sentenced to 21 Months for Insider Trading</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on October 26, 2012, the Honorable Robert M. Dow, Jr. of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois sentenced Thomas P. Flanagan to 21 months of incarceration followed by supervised release of 12 months and ordered Flanagan to pay a $100,000 penalty.  Flanagan, a former Deloitte and Touche LLP partner, pleaded guilty to one count of criminal securities fraud for engaging  in insider trading after he obtained material, nonpublic information about several Deloitte clients.  Flanagan, 65, of Chicago, used that information himself and shared it with a relative to make illegal trading profits.  The U.S. Attorneys Office for the Northern District of Illinois filed criminal charges against Flanagan on July 11, 2012 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois., The criminal charges arose out of the same facts that were the subject of a civil action that the SEC filed against Flanagan and his son, Patrick T. Flanagan, on August 4, 2010.  The SECs complaint alleged that Thomas Flanagan, a certified public accountant, worked at Deloitte for 38 years and rose to the level of Vice Chairman of Clients and Markets.  The complaint alleged that Flanagan traded on nine occasions between 2005 and 2008 in the securities of multiple Deloitte clients and a company acquired by a Deloitte client while in possession of nonpublic information that he learned through his duties as a Deloitte partner.  The information had not yet been disclosed to the public and concerned material, market-moving events such as earnings results, earnings guidance, and acquisitions.  Thomas Flanagans illegal trading resulted in profits of over $430,000.  On four occasions, Thomas Flanagan relayed the nonpublic information to his son Patrick Flanagan who then traded based on that information.  Patrick Flanagan realized profits of more than $57,000., The SEC also instituted related administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings on August 4, 2010, finding that Flanagan violated the SECs auditor independence rules on 71 occasions between 2003 and 2008 by trading in the securities of nine Deloitte audit clients.  The SECs settled administrative order found that during the time Flanagan owned or controlled these securities, Deloitte issued audit reports to the nine audit clients in which it stated that the financial statements contained in the reports had been audited by an independent auditor.  However, due to Flanagans ownership of the audit clients securities, Deloitte was not independent.  The companies then filed with the SEC annual reports and proxy statements which included the audit reports containing these false statements.  As a result, the SECs administrative order found that Flanagan caused and willfully aided and abetted Deloittes violations of the SECs auditor independence rules under Regulation S-X and also caused and willfully aided and abetted the companies violations of the reporting and proxy provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934., As alleged in the SECs complaint, Thomas Flanagan concealed his trades in the securities of Deloittes clients and circumvented Deloittes independence controls.  According to the SECs complaint, he failed to report the prohibited trades to Deloitte, lied to Deloitte about his compliance with its independence policies, and provided false information to Deloittes personal income tax preparers about the identity of the companies whose securities he traded., As a result of their conduct, the SECs complaint charged Thomas and Patrick Flanagan with violations of Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3.  The SECs administrative action found that Thomas Flanagan caused and willfully aided and abetted Deloittes violations of Rule 2-02(b)(1) of Regulation S-X, and caused and willfully aided and abetted the clients violations of Sections 13(a) and 14(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 13a-1, 13a-13, and 14a-3 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SECs allegations in the complaint and the findings in the administrative order, Thomas Flanagan consented to the entry of an order of permanent injunction, to pay disgorgement with prejudgment interest and civil penalties totaling $1,051,042, and to a denial of the privilege of appearing or practicing before the SEC as an accountant.  Without admitting or denying the SECs allegations in the complaint, Patrick Flanagan consented to the entry of an order of permanent injunction and to pay disgorgement with prejudgment interest and a civil penalty totaling $123,270., For additional information, see <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2010/lr21612.htm target=_top>Litigation Releases No. 21612</a> (August 4, 2010) and <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22441.htm target=_top>No. 22441</a> (August 9, 2012).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22524htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

On October 30, 2012, the District Court ordered Bielski to show cause why he should not comply with the Commissionâs subpoena and scheduled a hearing on the Commissionâs application for November 9, 2012., The Commissions application and supporting papers allege that, on August 2, 2012, the Commission issued a formal order of private investigation authorizing its staff to investigate, among other things, potential compliance and security deficiencies at a Massachusetts-based investment adviser (the âIAâ) registered with the Commission. In particular, the staff is investigating whether the IAâs compliance and security policies and procedures were reasonably designed to protect against recent instances of attempted and actual theft of client assets managed by the IA. One such incident involved an attempt by an apparent hacker to cause the IA to wire client funds to Bielskiâs bank account with Savers Bank in Uxbridge. On August 31, 2012, the Commission issued an investigative subpoena to Bielski. The subpoena required Bielski to produce documents relevant to the investigation and to appear before the Commission staff for testimony. The Commission alleges that, despite extending the subpoenaâs return date to accommodate Bielski and assurances by Bielski that he would comply with the subpoena, Bielski has failed to produce many of the responsive documents in his possession as of the date of the Commissionâs application. According to the Commissions application, Bielski does not have a credible justification for his failure to comply with the subpoena, and a court order is necessary to compel him to produce the subpoenaed documents and to appear for testimony., The Commission alleges that, in voluntary interviews with Commission staff, Bielski described having a six-year long association with a woman, Faith Collins (âCollinsâ), whom Bielski communicates with exclusively through the internet and has never met in person. According to the Commissionâs application and supporting papers, Bielski admitted to the staff that on at least one occasion, in or around June 2012, Collins caused funds to be wired into his Uxbridge bank account, although he denies having any involvement in obtaining the money or knowledge about its origin. Bielski reported that Collins at another point attempted to wire more funds into his bank account, but was thwarted when the broker-dealer custodian of the assets contacted him to alert him that someone (whom Bielski understood to be Collins) was attempting to wire stolen money to him. Bielski has not yet explained why Collins was attempting to wire money to him, other than to say that she needed the money for business reasons. Bielski also informed the staff that Collins resides in Nigeria and that he (and other individuals in the U.S.) provide financial assistance to her., A hearing on the Commissions application has been scheduled for November 9, 2012.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22525.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"
22528,2012,[<h3>SEC Charges South Florida Man with Recruiting Victims of Ponzi Scheme</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a South Florida man with defrauding at least 14 investors by soliciting them to invest in a Ponzi scheme.  A significant number of the victims were members of the gay community in Wilton Manors, Florida and included inexperienced, unaccredited investors., In the complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, the SEC alleges that James F. Ellis, 69, a resident of Wilton Manors, Florida, fraudulently solicited investors for George Elia from 2004 to 2011.  Elia operated pooled investment vehicles under the names Investor Funding Club and Vision Equities Funds.  Elia purported to trade in stocks and earn annual returns as high as 26 percent, but was actually running a Ponzi scheme and paying returns to existing investors from new investor funds.  In April 2012, the Commission charged Elia with securities fraud.  See Litigation Release No. 22319 (April 6, 2012)., According to the Commissions complaint against Ellis, Ellis persuaded prospective investors by falsely telling them that he had personally invested with Elia at least $5 million that he had inherited from his parents.  Ellis variously told investors that he earned 16% to 20% annual returns on his investment with Elia or that he earned $20,000 to $24,000 per month.  Elia and his entities did in fact pay Ellis over $2.1 million over seven years.  However, those payments were not investment returns because, as Ellis knew, he had not made an investment with Elia that would have returned such large sums of money.  According to the complaint, Ellis also reassured prospective investors of the safety of the investment by falsely telling them that he had tested Elia by depositing a large amount of money with Elia, then asking for and receiving it back., According to the complaint, Ellis bolstered his deceptive claims about the success of his investment with Elia with ostentatious displays of wealth, including expensive real estate, luxury cars, jewelry, opulent entertaining of his friends, and expensive cruises.  Though Ellis claimed that his investments with Elia made his luxurious lifestyle possible, he failed to disclose to investors that his wealth derived not from legitimate investment returns but from the money that Elia paid him for fraudulently touting Elias investment vehicles., The Commissions complaint charges Ellis with securities fraud in violation of Section 17(a)(1), (2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The SEC also charged the companys independent auditor with facilitating the scheme., The SEC Complaint alleges that chief executive officer Lee Cole and chief financial officer Linden Boyne orchestrated a scheme in which Electronic Game Card Inc. (EGMI) enticed investors by claiming to have millions of dollars in annual revenue, hold millions of dollars in investments, and own an off-shore bank account worth more than $10 million.  In reality, many of the companys purported contracts were phony, the purported investments were merely in entities affiliated with Cole or Boyne, and the bank account did not exist.  As a result of EGMIs false claims, the companys outstanding common stock was once valued as high as $150 million.  EGMI is now bankrupt and its stock is worthless., The SEC charged the companys outside auditor - certified public accountant Timothy Quintanilla - with repeatedly issuing clean audit opinions about EGMI based on reckless and deficient audit work.  Also charged is Kevin Donovan, who later replaced Cole as CEO and ignored many red flags about the accuracy of the companys public statements and the integrity of Cole and Boyne.  He provided false information during conference calls with analysts and investors., The SECs Complaint alleges that, from 2007 to 2009, EGMI repeatedly reported non-existent revenues and assets, misrepresented its business operations, and failed to disclose related-party transactions.  Those misrepresentations and others like them were just part of a scheme that Cole and Boyne orchestrated through EGMI to reap approximately $12 million in unlawful gains.  While they were making material misrepresentations to inflate EGMIs stock price, Cole and Boyne also secretly funneled millions of shares of EGMI stock to entities based in Gibraltar that they secretly controlled.  They directed the Gibraltar entities to sell the shares, and proceeds of those sales were transferred to people or entities associated with Cole and Boyne or to EGMI itself.  Cole and Boyne bolstered their lies by providing falsified documents to the companys outside auditors., The SEC Complaint alleges that, as EGMIs engagement partner, Quintanilla and the public accounting firm Mendoza Berger &amp; Co. LLP issued clean audit opinions for EGMIs year-end financial statements for 2006, 2007, and 2008, even though those statements were riddled with material misstatements and omissions.  Mendoza Berger and Quintanilla knowingly or recklessly misrepresented that the firm had conducted audits of EGMIs financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Mendoza Bergers opinion stated that EGMIs financial statements present[ed] fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of EGMI.  In fact, Mendoza Berger had not audited critical aspects of EGMIs financial statements, and its work did not conform to the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB).  Quintanilla had no meaningful basis to have Mendoza Berger issue an opinion on EGMIs financial statements., The SEC Complaint further alleges that, shortly after Donovan became CEO, he was notified of many red flags related to the companys public statements about its operations, finances, and share count.  Donovan violated the antifraud provisions of the securities laws when he led several public conference calls with securities analysts and investors in 2009, and knowingly or recklessly relayed false financial information about the company that had been provided to him by Cole and Boyne., The SECs action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging violations by Cole and Boyne of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933; Sections 10(b), 13(b)(5), 13(d), and 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, 13b2-1, 13b2-2, 13d-1, 13d-2, 16a-2, and 16a-3 thereunder; and Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.  The SEC action also alleges that Cole and Boyne are liable as control persons and for aiding and abetting violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.  The SEC action alleges violations by Donovan of Sections 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In addition, the SEC action alleges violations by Quintanilla of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Sections 10(b), 10A(a)(1), and 10A(b)(1) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The action against Quintanilla also charges him with aiding and abetting violations of Sections 10(b), 10A(a)(1), and 10A(b)(1) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder., The complaint seeks, among other things, a final judgment ordering Cole, Boyne, Donovan, and Quintanilla to pay financial penalties and permanently enjoining them from future violations of the securities laws; enjoining Cole, Boyne, and Donovan from serving as officers and directors of public companies and from participating in penny stock offerings; and ordering Cole, Boyne, and Quintanilla to disgorge their ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest., The New York Regional Offices Michael Paley, Stephen Larson, James Addison, Gwen Licardo and Aaron Arnzen conducted the investigation.

Sekaran also misused client funds to pay various personal and business expenses, and he collected fees in excess of what he was due under the arrangements he had with clients., Sekaran and Wasson agreed to settle the SEC’s charges and as well as a parallel criminal action announced today by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York.  Sekaran will be required to pay $2.3 million., According to the SEC’s complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Sekaran provided investors with a spreadsheet inaccurately showing that Wasson was profitable.  He inflated account balances on some clients’ account statements, using the letterhead of a defunct British Virgin Islands trust company for one client and the letterhead of a New Zealand firm for another client.  He misappropriated investor money for personal mortgage and maintenance payments, restaurant and travel expenses, entertainment and event tickets, employee salaries and health insurance, and rent and office expenses.  , In settling the SEC’s charges, Sekaran and Wasson consented to a final judgment imposing permanent injunctions from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Sekaran separately consented to an SEC order barring him from the securities industry, including the investment advisory business, and penny stock industry.

22531,2012,[<h3>BP TO PAY $525 MILLION PENALTY TO SETTLE SEC CHARGES OF SECURITIES FRAUD DURING DEEPWATER HORIZON OIL SPILL</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged BP  p.l.c. with misleading investors while its Deepwater Horizon oil rig was gushing  into the Gulf of Mexico by significantly understating the flow rate in multiple  reports filed with the SEC., The SEC alleges that the global oil and gas company  headquartered in London made fraudulent public statements indicating a flow  rate estimate of 5,000 barrels of oil per day. BP reported this figure despite  its own internal data indicating that potential flow rates could be as high as  146,000 barrels of oil per day. BP executives also made numerous public  statements after the filings were made in which they stood behind the flow rate  estimate of 5,000 barrels of oil per day even though they had internal data  indicating otherwise. In fact, they criticized other much higher estimates by  third parties as scaremongering. Months later, a government task force  determined the flow rate estimate was actually more than 10 times higher at  52,700 to 62,200 barrels of oil per day, yet BP never corrected or updated the  misrepresentations and omissions it made in SEC filings for investors., BP agreed to settle the SECs charges by paying the  third-largest penalty in agency history at $525 million. The SEC plans to  establish a Fair Fund with the BP penalty to provide harmed investors with  compensation for losses they sustained in the fraud., According to the SECs complaint filed in the U.S. District  Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, BP stated that the flow rate was  estimated to be 5,000 barrels of oil per day (bopd) in three separate Forms 6-K  filed with the SEC following the Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion on April  20, 2010. In a 6-K filed on April 29, BP stated in part, [e]fforts continue to  stem the flow of oil from the well, currently estimated at up to 5,000 bopd[.]  BP filed another report the next day similarly referencing [e]fforts to stem  the flow from the well, currently estimated at up to 5,000 barrels a day are  continuing[.], The SEC alleges that when the company made those statements,  BP possessed at least five different flow rate calculations, estimates, or data  indicating a much higher flow rate. BP did not possess or generate any piece of  data suggesting that 5,000 bopd represented a ceiling for the rate of oil  flowing into the Gulf of Mexico or was the best estimate. The failure to  disclose the existence of these higher estimates rendered BPs statements in  its Reports on Form 6-K materially false and misleading., According to the SECs complaint, BP issued another 6-K on  May 4 that stated, Accurate estimation of the rate of flow is difficult, but  current estimates by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  (NOAA) suggest that some 5,000 barrels (210,000 US gallons) of oil per day are  escaping from the well., The SEC alleges that BP omitted from its disclosure the  material fact that, by this date, it possessed at least six estimates,  calculations and data indicating that the oil flow rate far exceeded 5,000  bopd. Therefore, it was no longer accurate to suggest that 5,000 bopd was the  best estimate or that the NOAA estimate was the current estimate., The SECs complaint further alleges that BP executives made  numerous public statements in May 2010 supporting the 5,000 bopd flow rate  estimate and criticizing other estimates despite internal evidence showing that  flow rates were likely well in excess of 5,000 bopd. Eventually on August 2,  the Flow Rate Technical Group consisting of government and academic experts  tasked with reaching a final official flow rate estimate announced that the  flow rate estimate was 52,700 to 62,200 bopd. BP never corrected or updated its  material misrepresentations and omissions about the flow rate., BP has consented  to the entry of a final judgment ordering it to pay the $525 million penalty  and permanently restraining and enjoining the company from violating Sections  10(b) and 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20  and 13a-16.

Colangelo, Jr. repeatedly misled investors while raising $3 million in investments for four start-up companies that he created.  He also persuaded three other investors to let him act as their investment adviser, and they gave him more than $1 million to invest in the markets on their behalf.  Colangelo boasted a phony professional and educational background and hid his past criminal activities from potential investors, and he falsely claimed to have historically achieved extremely high returns buying and selling securities.  Meanwhile, Colangelo siphoned off at least $1 million in investor funds to pay such unauthorized personal expenses as his federal income taxes, illegal narcotics, gambling, cigars, and travel for him and his family., In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Colangelo., According to the SEC’s complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Colangelo’s fraudulent scheme began in 2009 when he induced investors to invest more than $750,000 in the Brickell Fund LLC, a pooled investment vehicle that he created, advised, and controlled.  In March 2009 when the Brickell Fund did not have any investors and Colangelo was not buying and selling securities on behalf of the fund, he sent numerous e-mails to potential investors boasting phony information.  For instance, one e-mail claimed, <i>“BEST TRADING DAY OF MY LIFE!!!!!!!. . . . Up over 400% and documented.  Mind boggling to say the least.”</i>  In reality, Colangelo did not make any trades that day., The SEC alleges that after spending or losing all of the money invested in the Brickell Fund, Colangelo continued to fraudulently raise funds from investors for three other startup businesses he created — Hedge Community LLC, Start a Hedge Fund LLC, and Under the Radar SEO LLC.  Some individuals provided Colangelo with funds directly to invest on their behalf.  Colangelo continued to use investor funds for a variety of purposes that weren’t disclosed to investors, namely personal expenses and unrelated business expenses., According to the SEC’s complaint, Colangelo created a profile on the LinkedIn website used for professional networking and misrepresented that he had studied finance at Nyack College from 1986 to 1989.  Colangelo provided a link to his profile to potential and existing investors in one of his start-up companies.  His representations to investors were false because he never attended Nyack College and has not graduated from high school., The SEC’s complaint charges Colangelo with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.  , The SEC’s investigation was conducted in the New York Regional Office by Senior Attorney Christina McGill and Assistant Regional Director Wendy B.

22535,2012,[<h3>SEC CHARGES RING OF HIGH SCHOOL BUDDIES WITH INSIDER TRADING IN HEALTH CARE STOCKS</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged three health care company employees and four others in a New Jersey-based insider trading ring of various high school friends generating $1.7 million in illegal profits and kickbacks by trading in advance of 11 public announcements involving mergers, a drug approval application, and quarterly earnings of pharmaceutical companies and medical technology firms., The SEC alleges that Celgene Corporation’s director of financial reporting John Lazorchak, Sanofi S.A.’s director of accounting and reporting Mark S. Cupo, and Stryker Corporation’s marketing employee Mark D. Foldy each illegally tipped confidential information about their companies for the purpose of insider trading.  Typically the nonpublic information involved upcoming mergers or acquisitions, but Lazorchak also tipped confidential details about Celgene’s quarterly earnings and the status of a Celgene application to expand the use of its drug Revlimid.  The trading was carefully orchestrated so there was usually someone acting solely as a non-trading middleman who received the nonpublic information from the insider and tipped others.  They hoped to avoid detection with no direct connection between the insiders and the traders, and the insiders were later compensated for the inside information with cash payments made in installments to avoid any scrutiny of large cash withdrawals., The SEC alleges that Cupo’s friend Michael Castelli along with Lawrence Grum, who attended high school with Castelli, were the primary traders in the scheme.  Among the ways that Castelli and Grum tried to hide their illegal conduct was by compiling binders of research to serve as a false basis for their trading.  They actively traded in Celgene securities to create a pattern of long-standing positions in the stock.  Grum reassured Cupo that discovery of the scheme and consequent legal action was unlikely due to limited government resources to police insider trading activity.  Grum said, “At the end of the day, the SEC’s got to pick their battle because they have a limited number of people and huge numbers of investors to go after.” , The other two traders charged are Lazorchak’s high school friends Michael T. Pendolino and James N. Deprado, who now live in New Hampshire and Virginia respectively.  The others live in New Jersey.  In a parallel criminal action, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey today announced criminal charges against Lazorchak, Cupo, Foldy, Castelli, Grum, and Pendolino.  , According to the SEC’s complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, the scheme began in late 2007 when Lazorchak and Cupo, who were friends and colleagues at Sanofi, discussed Lazorchak’s new position at Celgene where he’d have access to nonpublic information about mergers and acquisitions.  Lazorchak told Cupo that he was initially working on Celgene’s possible acquisition of another pharmaceutical company, Pharmion.  Cupo discussed Lazorchak’s position with Castelli, a friend with whom he attends winemaking club meetings.  Castelli brought in Grum, who he considered a sophisticated trader with knowledge of the securities industry.  Castelli and Grum devised the scheme in which Lazorchak tipped Cupo with nonpublic Celgene-related information.  Cupo, as the middleman, tipped Castelli and Grum so they could illegally trade.  Castelli and Grum paid Cupo for his tips, and gave Cupo money to pass along to Lazorchak for the initial tips.  Lazorchak never knew the identities of Castelli or Grum, but was aware that Cupo was passing confidential Celgene information to other traders. , The SEC alleges that Lazorchak’s high school friend Foldy entered the scheme in 2007, when Lazorchak tipped him with confidential details about the impending merger between Celgene and Pharmion, and Foldy illegally traded on the information prior to the public announcement of the deal.  Lazorchak and Foldy devised and used code phrases while conversing to identify instances when Lazorchak was passing inside information or Foldy was seeking more details.  After the illegal trading occurred and Foldy obtained illicit profits of $14,500, Lazorchak repeatedly demanded that Foldy compensate him for the inside information.  Foldy ultimately paid Lazorchak at least $500 and later returned the favor with illegal tips of confidential information about a tender offer involving his employer, Stryker Corp.  Lazorchak acted as a middleman and did not trade, instead tipping Pendolino so he could trade on the nonpublic information.  Pendolino in turn tipped Deprado, who also traded.  Lazorchak additionally tipped Cupo, who did not trade but acted as a middleman and tipped Castelli and Grum, who both traded. , The SEC alleges that Cupo began tipping inside information about his employer in late 2009, when he learned that Sanofi was planning to announce a tender offer to acquire another pharmaceutical company, Chattem Inc.  Cupo learned of the imminent tender offer a few days prior to the public announcement, he tipped Castelli and Grum with the confidential details, and they both traded on the nonpublic information., The SEC alleges that each of the defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder and that Castelli and Grum violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.  The SEC is seeking permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, financial penalties, and officer and director bars for Lazorchak, Cupo, and Foldy.,  ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22535.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Sentencing is currently scheduled for February 14, 2013., On November 10, 2010, the United States Attorneys Office for the District of Massachusetts charged Fields and former LocatePlus CEO Jon Latorella with conspiracy to commit securities fraud for their role in a scheme to fraudulently inflate revenue at LocatePlus as well as a scheme to manipulate the stock of another company.

Wilson defrauded investors who bought unregistered securities offered by his company, Diversified Group Partnership Management, LLC, and sold through his brokerage firm, W R Rice Financial Services, Inc.  Wilson raised approximately $6.7 million from approximately 120 investors who bought Diversified Groups securities from September 2009 through October 2012, and used the funds to finance his business of buying, renovating, and selling houses in and around Bay City, the SEC alleged., Although Wilson promised investors that he would invest their money in real estate that would yield returns of 9.9% per year, he used most of it to make unsecured loans to his real estate business, which did not generate enough income to repay the investors.  Wilson also diverted $582,000 of investor money to pay personal expenses, including $75,000 he used to buy W R Rice Financial, $46,780 he spent on travel, and $35,000 for his wifes business.  In addition, the SEC said Wilson used investors money to pay for a sponsorship and tickets to the Saginaw Sting football team and to buy thousands of dollars worth of tickets to the Detroit Red Wings., The SEC alleges that Wilson raised additional funds for his real estate business through stock sales for another of his companies, American Realty Funds Corporation, which trades on the OTC Bulletin Board under the symbol ANFDE.  The complaint alleges that there were misrepresentations and omissions in some of the reports the company filed with the SEC, which Wilson signed, including that American Realty has failed to make loan payments and that its purportedly independent directors have undisclosed personal and business relationships with Wilson.

The SEC has not appealed the jury’s verdict, and the time for appeal has expired. , The SEC originally filed its suit against Stoker on October 19, 2011.  The SEC alleged that Citigroup structured and marketed Class V III and exercised significant influence over the selection of $500 million of the assets included in the CDO.  Citigroup then took a proprietary short position with respect to those $500 million of assets.  The Commission complaint alleged that Citigroup did not disclose to investors the role that it played in the asset selection process or the short position that it took.  The SEC further alleged that Stoker was the Citigroup employee primarily responsible for structuring the Class V III transaction., The SEC will continue to pursue its appeal of the District Court’s denial of the proposed settlement with Citigroup in the related matter of <i>Securities and Exchange Commission v.

Greenstone Holdings, Inc., et al., 10 civ. 1302 (S.D.N.Y.), granted the SEC partial summary judgment against attorney Virginia K. Sourlis, holding Sourlis liable for aiding and abetting securities fraud by issuing a false legal opinion that certain of her co-defendants used to obtain illegally more than six million shares of unrestricted stock of Greenstone Holdings, Inc., According to the SECs summary judgment motion, in early 2006, Sourlis intentionally authored a materially false and misleading legal opinion, which Greenstone used to illegally issue over six million shares of stock in unregistered transactions.  Among other things, Sourlis falsely described promissory notes, note holders, and communications with those holders, none of which actually existed.  The SEC asserted that, contrary to Sourlis fraudulent opinion letter, the stock issuance did not qualify for an exemption from registration under the federal securities laws., In finding Sourlis liable for fraud, at the November 16, 2012 hearing on the SECs summary judgment motion, the District Court stated that Sourlis opinion represents that Ms. Sourlis spoke to note-holders which did not exist . . . And several other facts for which there was no evidentiary support.  The Court further stated that Sourlis opinion represented as fact matters that were contrary to fact, and to me the most egregious representation was the representation that the writer of the letter had spoken to the original note-holders which is repeated in the letter., The Court held Sourlis liable for aiding and abetting securities fraud under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 but denied the SEC summary judgment against Sourlis for primary liability under Section 10(b).  The Court also reserved decision on the SECs non-fraud claim that Sourlis violated Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933.  On the basis of the Courts November 20 liability holding, the SEC intends to seek from the Court against Sourlis injunctive relief, financial penalties, disgorgement, and a penny stock bar.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/22542.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

The SEC’s action charged Hochfeld and his firm with securities fraud for misappropriating assets and making material misstatements to Heppelwhite Fund investors.

Judge Gardephe entered the consent judgments on November 21., In its complaint, the SEC alleges that since at least April 2011, Hochfeld has misappropriated assets from the Heppelwhite Fund, a hedge fund with approximately 25 investors and at least $6 million in assets.  The SEC alleges that Hochfeld misappropriated approximately $1.3 million from the Fund, some of which he used to pay for a collection of valuable antiques he purchased.  The SEC also alleges that Hochfeld and Hochfeld Capital made material misstatements to Fund investors, including providing them with periodic statements that overstated the value of their investments, and failing to disclose that Hochfeld is subject to the 2006 SEC Order that bars him from associating with any broker, dealer, or investment adviser., Hochfeld and Hochfeld Capital consented to the Court’s judgments which: (i) permanently enjoin them from violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 203 and 206 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940; (ii) order them to provide a full accounting of all assets currently under their control; (iii) order an asset freeze as to Hochfeld, Hochfeld Capital, and the Heppelwhite Fund; (iv) order Hochfeld and Hochfeld Capital to disgorge ill-gotten gains and pay civil penalties in amounts to be determined; and (v) order the appointment a receiver over the Heppelwhite Fund and Hochfeld Capital., Additionally, in a parallel criminal action announced November 9, 2012, by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, Hochfeld was arrested and charged with securities fraud and wire fraud., The SEC thanks the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation for their assistance in this matter., The SEC’s investigation is continuing.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22545.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Liskov, both of Plymouth, MA, in connection their fraudulent conduct toward advisory clients.  The trial was presided over by U.S. District Court Judge William G. Young. , In its complaint, the Commission alleged that, between at least November 2008 and August 2010, Liskov made material misrepresentations to at least six advisory clients to induce them to liquidate investments in securities and instead invest the proceeds in foreign currency exchange (“forex”) trading. The forex investments, which were not suitable for older clients with conservative investment goals, resulted in steep losses for clients, totaling nearly $4 million, but EagleEye and Liskov came away with over $300,000 in performance fees, in addition to other management fees they collected from clients. Liskov’s strategy was to generate temporary profits on client forex investments to enable him to collect performance fees, after which client investments invariably would sharply decline in value. According to the Commission’s complaint, Liskov made material misrepresentations or failed to disclose material information to clients concerning the nature of forex investments, the risks involved, and his poor track record in forex trading for himself and other clients. The Commission’s complaint further alleged that, in the case of two clients, without their knowledge or consent, Liskov liquidated securities in their brokerage accounts and transferred the proceeds to their forex trading accounts where he lost nearly all client funds, but not before first collecting performance fees for EagleEye (and ultimately himself) on short-lived profits in the clients’ forex accounts. The complaint alleged that Liskov accomplished the unauthorized transfers by doctoring asset transfer forms. On several occasions, Liskov took old forms signed by the clients and used “white out” correction fluid to change dates, asset transfer amounts, and other data. Liskov also used similar tactics to open multiple forex trading accounts in the name of one client, thereby maximizing his ability to earn performance fees for EagleEye (and ultimately himself) on the client’s investments, all without disclosing this to the client or obtaining the client’s consent. The Commission alleged that, as a result of this conduct, EagleEye and Liskov violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The Commission also alleged that EagleEye failed to maintain certain books and records required of investment advisers in violation of Section 204 of the Advisers Act and Rule 204-2 thereunder, and that Liskov aided and abetted EagleEye’s violations of these provisions. , After an eight day trial, the jury deliberated for approximately four hours before rendering its verdict of liability against Liskov and EagleEye under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder as to four clients and under Section 206(1) of the Advisers Act as to five clients. The Court will decide the Commission’s claims under Section 204 of the Advisers Act and Rule 204-2 thereunder and will hold a hearing on the Commission’s request for injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest thereon, and the imposition of a monetary penalty against both EagleEye and Liskov, based on the jury’s verdict.

The SEC <a href=/news/press/2012/2012-217.htm target=_top>initially charged insurance executive Michael Van Gilder</a> for his illegal trading in the case, and is now additionally charging his source: Delta’s then-CEO Roger Parker., The SEC’s amended complaint alleges that Parker, who lives in Englewood, Colo., illegally tipped his close friend Van Gilder and at least one other friend with confidential information about Tracinda’s impending investment.  Despite his duty as CEO to protect nonpublic information, Parker repeatedly communicated with Van Gilder following meetings and other developments as the deal progressed.  Parker also illegally tipped information about Delta’s quarterly earnings.  The insider trading in this case generated more than $890,000 in illicit profits.  , According to the SEC’s amended complaint filed in federal court in Denver, Parker tipped Van Gilder and another friend on several occasions in late November and December 2007 as the Tracinda investment was developing.  Based on the inside information, Van Gilder and the other friend loaded up on Delta stock and highly speculative options contracts, and Van Gilder advised his relatives, his broker, and a co-worker to do the same., The SEC alleges that the Tracinda announcement was not the only nonpublic information that Parker tipped to Van Gilder.  In November 2007, Van Gilder received an e-mail from a mutual friend of Parker’s that included a news article expressing a negative view of Delta’s future prospects.  After sending an e-mail to his broker indicating he might want to sell the Delta securities that he owned, Van Gilder called Parker three times that evening.  Parker conveyed to Van Gilder confidential details about Delta’s third quarter 2007 earnings results that were to be announced later that week.  Rather than sell his Delta stock, Van Gilder purchased an additional 1,250 shares and responded to the e-mail from the mutual friend by writing, “I had a dialogue with a friend, of whom you know.  Do not sell this stock, rather buy more ... Delta will hit their numbers at this Thursday’s announcement.”  When Delta announced its earnings, it reported production and revenue numbers above the company’s previously stated guidance., The SEC’s amended complaint charges Parker and Van Gilder with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.  The amended complaint seeks a final judgment ordering them to disgorge their and their tippees’ ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, ordering them to pay financial penalties, and permanently enjoining them from future violations of the above provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC also seeks to prohibit Parker from acting as an officer or director of a public company.,  ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22547.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Hennessy and his firm, investment adviser Resources Planning Group (RPG), for defrauding clients and others who were promised returns that would beat the market for investing in a private equity fund they managed.  What investors didnt know was the fund was failing and they were being used to raise money to repay promissory notes to earlier investors., The SEC alleges that Hennessy and RPG raised more than $1.3 million by misrepresenting the Midwest Opportunity Fund (MOF) as a viable private equity fund that could offer high returns.  Hennessy failed to tell investors about the funds poor financial condition or that their money was being used to repay MOF promissory notes that he had personally guaranteed.  He therefore misappropriated client funds to make payments on the notes and prop up the fund., According to the SECs complaint, Hennessy financed MOFs acquisition of its largest portfolio company in 2007 in part by having the fund issue $1.65 million in promissory notes, all of which he personally guaranteed.  When MOFs portfolio companies were unable to pay management fees later that year, MOF lacked sufficient funds to repay the notes.  From September 2007 to March 2010, Hennessy raised $1.36 million from RPG clients and other investors to make payments on the notes.  Hennessy falsely told investors that MOF was viable and offered high returns., The SEC further alleges that Hennessy misappropriated money from RPG clients.  In November 2007, he raised $750,000 from three RPG clients purportedly to invest in MOF.  But then Hennessy used that money to redeem another clients investment in the fund.  Twice in mid-2009, Hennessy forged letters of authorization from a widowed RPG client to transfer $100,000 from her account to MOF in exchange for promissory notes that have yet to be repaid., The SECs complaint charges Hennessy with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.  Hennessy is also charged with violating Sections 206(1), (2) and (4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8. RPG is charged with violating Sections 206(1), (2) and (4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-7., The SECs investigation was conducted by Amy S. Cotter, Luz M. Aguilar, and John J.

Conradt learned confidential details about the merger from his roommate, a research analyst who got the information from an attorney working on the transaction who discussed it in confidence. Conradt purchased SPSS securities and subsequently tipped his friend and fellow broker David J. Weishaus, who also traded. The insider trading yielded more than $1 million in illicit profits. The SEC’s investigation uncovered instant messages between Conradt and Weishaus where they openly discussed their illegal activity. The SEC’s investigation is continuing., In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Conradt and Weishaus, who live in Denver and Baltimore respectively., According to the SEC’s complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan, the scheme occurred in 2009. Conradt revealed in instant messages that he received the information from the research analyst and warned Weishaus that they needed to “keep this in the family.” Weishaus agreed, typing “i dont want to go to jail.” They went on to discuss other people who have been prosecuted for insider trading. In another series of instant messages, Conradt bragged that he was “makin everyone rich” by sharing the nonpublic information. Weishaus later noted, “this is gonna be sweet.”, The SEC alleges that the research analyst’s attorney friend sought moral support, reassurance, and advice when he privately told the research analyst about his new assignment at work on the SPSS acquisition by IBM. In describing the magnitude of the assignment, the lawyer disclosed material, nonpublic information about the proposed transaction, including the anticipated transaction price and the identities of the acquiring and target companies. The associate expected the research analyst to maintain this information in confidence and refrain from trading on this information or disclosing it to others. , The SEC alleges that Conradt, Weishaus, and other downstream tippees purchased common stock and call options in SPSS. A call option is a security that derives its value from the underlying common stock of the issuer and gives the purchaser the right to buy the underlying stock at a specific price within a specified period of time. Typically, investors will purchase call options when they believe the stock of the underlying securities is going up. Conradt, Weishaus, and other downstream tippees invested so heavily in SPSS securities that the investments accounted for 76 percent to 100 percent of their various brokerage accounts. Conradt and Weishaus both hold law degrees. Conradt is admitted to practice law in Maryland, and he passed the Colorado bar examination administered in February 2012., The SEC alleges that Conradt and Weishaus violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5. The SEC is seeking disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest and financial penalties, and a permanent injunction against the brokers., The SEC has coordinated its action with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, and also appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation., The SEC’s investigation is continuing.  ,  ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22549.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

In addition, the SEC charged China Voice shareholders Ilya Drapkin and Gerald Patera with financing stock promotion campaigns regarding China Voice.

The Commission also named Wangs wife, Sun Jishuang (Sun), and Jiang Chaos father, Jiang Mingfu, as Relief Defendants to recover company monies that they improperly received., The Commission alleges that CNEP, Wang, Ju and Jiang Chao diverted offering proceeds to the personal accounts of corporate insiders and their immediate family members, and also engaged in fraudulent conduct in connection with at least 176 undisclosed transactions between the company and its insiders or their immediate family members, otherwise known as related-party transactions., The Commission alleges that, in connection with its two public stock offerings in late 2009, CNEP falsely stated to investors in a registration statement and other public filings signed by Wang that the offering proceeds would be used to fund future business expansion and for general working capital purposes.  Instead, consistent with a pre-existing pattern of engaging in undisclosed, related-party transactions, Jiang Chao then diverted over $900,000 of offering proceeds to his father, Jiang Mingfu, and at the direction of Ju, diverted at least $6 million dollars to her and Sun, who is her daughter-in-law and Wangs wife., The Commission further alleges that during 2009, CNEP, Wang and Ju engaged in at least 176 undisclosed, related-party transactions.  This fraudulent conduct involved approximately $28 million in transactions from CNEP to Wang or Ju; approximately $11 million purportedly loaned to CNEP or paid to third parties on behalf of CNEP by Wang or Ju; and $20 million of unusual post-year-end adjustments that purported to eliminate the remaining debts owed by Wang and Ju to CNEP.  Together, these transactions totaled approximately $59 million of related-party activity during 2009.  Neither the magnitude nor the volume of these related-party transactions has been fully disclosed to the investing public., The Commission alleges that CNEP, Wang, Ju and Jiang Chao violated the antifraud provisions of the securities laws, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5.

22553,2012,"[<h3>SEC Charges Westport, Connecticut Resident with Insider Trading in the Shares of Patriot Capital Funding, Inc.</h3>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a Connecticut-based business executive with insider trading ahead of the sale of Patriot Capital Funding Group based on nonpublic information he learned at the helm of a firm involved in the bidding process., The SEC alleges that I. Joseph Massoud, who founded investment advisory firm Compass Group Management, gained access to nonpublic information contained in an online dataroom where bidding companies could learn more about Patriot Capitals financial condition.  For access to the data, Compass Group had to enter into a confidentiality agreement that prohibited its employees from buying Patriot Capital stock.  Nonetheless, Massoud purchased shares soon after Compass Group gained access to the confidential information, and he bought even more stock after he learned that Compass Groups bid was what he described as waaaaay off compared to bids from other companies.  Patriot Capitals share price more than doubled after a merger was publicly announced, and Massoud realized more than $676,000 in illegal profits., Massoud, who lives in Westport, Conn., agreed to settle the SECs charges by paying more than $1.4 million.  He also will be barred from working in the securities industry or serving as an officer or director of a public company.  The settlement is subject to court approval., According to the SECs complaint filed in federal court in Connecticut, Patriot Capital initiated a nonpublic bidding process in 2009 to entertain proposals for strategic investments and the possible sale of the company.  In May 2009, Massoud directed Compass Group to execute a confidentiality agreement with Patriot Capital so it could participate in that process.  After Compass Group was provided access to the online dataroom as part of the bidding process, a Compass Group analyst accessed the dataroom and provided various reports containing material, nonpublic information to Massoud., The SEC alleges that Massoud also learned nonpublic information about the value of bids received by Patriot Capital from other parties involved in the bidding process.  On July 7, 2009, Massoud e-mailed others working on the Patriot Capital transaction at Compass Group and indicated that he had just talked with Patriot Capitals CEO.  He wrote that Compass Group was waaaaay off on its bid to acquire Patriot Capital, which according to the CEO had received several acquisition bids that were much higher than Compass Groups offer.  Massoud also learned from the CEO that Compass Group would have to increase its bid to match those higher proposals if it wanted to be considered., According to the SECs complaint, Massoud bought 322,216 shares of Patriot Capital stock in transactions spread across 15 different trading days from May to July.  Massoud purchased more than half of those shares after July 7 when Patriot Capitals CEO confidentially told him about other higher bids to acquire Patriot Capital.  On August 3, 2009, Patriot Capital publicly announced a merger with Prospect Capital Corporation.  On August 25, after Patriot Capital had been acquired and its stock price had increased significantly, Massoud sold all of his Patriot Capital stock., The SEC alleges that Massoud violated Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and that his profits constitute ill-gotten gains.  Massoud agreed to pay disgorgement of $676,013, prejudgment interest of $80,785, and a penalty of $676,013.  He agreed to be enjoined from violating Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 in the future, and he will be barred from serving as a public company officer or director and from being associated with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal adviser, transfer agent, or national recognized statistical rating organization.  He also will be barred from participating in any penny stock offering., The SECs investigation was conducted by James Fay, Deena Bernstein, and Kevin Kelcourse in the Boston Regional Office.

22554,2012,[<h3>BRAZILIAN EX-BANKER TO PAY $5.1 MILLION FOR INSIDER TRADING IN BURGER KING STOCK</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced insider trading charges against a Brazilian ex-banker for his role in a scheme to illegally trade Burger King Holdings, Inc. (“Burger King”) securities.  The SEC previously charged a Brazilian citizen working in the Miami office of Wells Fargo Advisors, LLC (“Wells Fargo”) with tipping him the inside information., The SEC alleges that Igor Cornelsen (“Cornelsen”) and his firm through which he made trades — Bainbridge Group Inc. — reaped illicit profits of more than $1.68 million by trading Burger King options based on confidential information ahead of the company’s September 2010 announcement that it was being acquired by a New York private equity firm.  Cornelsen is now a resident of the Bahamas with a home in South Florida after holding high-ranking positions at several banks in Brazil before his retirement.  The complaint alleges that he sought inside information from his broker Waldyr Da Silva Prado Neto (“Prado”) by sending him e-mails with such masked references as, “Is the sandwich deal going to happen?”  The SEC alleges that Prado stole the inside information from another Wells Fargo brokerage customer involved in the Burger King deal., Cornelsen and Bainbridge Group agreed to pay more than $5.1 million to settle the SEC’s charges.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  The litigation continues against Prado, whose assets have been frozen by the court., According to the SEC’s complaint filed today in federal court in Manhattan, Cornelsen became Prado’s customer in 2008.  On May 17, 2010, Prado sent Cornelsen an e-mail written in Portuguese that translates to, “Igor, if you are around call me at the hotel … I have some info … You have to hear this.”  Cornelsen called Prado at his hotel and they had a 10-minute conversation.  Earlier that same day, Prado told a friend that he had knowledge of the impending Burger King deal.  After talking with Prado, Cornelsen began trading out-of-the-money Burger King call options the very next day.  Cornelsen had never previously traded Burger King securities., The SEC alleges that Cornelsen continued trading Burger King options over that summer despite losing money in some instances.  In August, Cornelsen sent Prado e-mails seeking assurances that ‘the sandwich deal’ was going to happen, and Prado responded with such statements as “Yes it’s going to happen” and “Everything is 100% under control.”  Cornelsen then purchased additional Burger King call options.  The complaint alleges that Cornelsen took steps to minimize his connection to Prado by purchasing the Burger King call options in accounts held at brokerage firms other than Prado’s.  , The SEC alleges that after the public announcement of the Burger King deal, Cornelsen e-mailed Prado to inquire about the acquisition price.  Upon learning the new per share price that would yield him substantial illegal profits, Cornelsen e-mailed back, “Wow! What a day!”, The SEC’s complaint charges Cornelsen and Bainbridge Group with violations of Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3.  The proposed final judgment orders them to jointly and severally pay $1,681,090 in disgorgement and $136,620.96 in prejudgment interest.  Cornelsen is ordered to pay a $3,362,180 penalty.  They neither admit nor deny the SEC charges. The proposed final judgment also enjoins them from future violations of these provisions of the federal securities laws.   , The SEC’s investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Market Abuse Unit members Megan Bergstrom, David Brown, and Diana Tani in the Los Angeles office with assistance from Charles D. Riely in the New York office.

Durham, former CEO of Ohio-based Fair Finance Company (“Fair Finance”), was sentenced to 50 years in prison for orchestrating a $200 million scheme that defrauded more than 5,000 investors over almost five years.  Judge Jane Magnus-Stinson of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana also sentenced James F. Cochran, Fair Finance’s board chairman, to 25 years in prison, and Rick D. Snow, the firm’s chief financial officer, to a 10-year prison term.  According to U.S. Attorney Joseph Hogsett in Indianapolis, Durham’s sentence is the longest white-collar fraud sentence in Indiana history., On June 20, 2012, a federal jury in Indiana convicted Durham, age 50, of securities fraud, conspiracy and 10 counts of wire fraud.  Cochran, age 57, and Snow, age 49, were also found guilty on conspiracy and securities fraud charges for their roles in the Fair Finance scheme., On March 16, 2011, the Commission filed a civil action against Durham, Cochran and Snow based on the same conduct alleged in the criminal case.  The Commission’s action has been stayed pending the outcome of the criminal case., The Commission’s complaint alleged that Fair Finance had for decades legitimately raised funds by selling interest-bearing certificates to investors and using the proceeds to purchase and service discounted consumer finance contracts.  However, after purchasing Fair Finance in 2002, Durham, Cochran and Snow began to deceive investors.  Under the guise of loans, Durham and Cochran schemed to divert investor proceeds to themselves and others, including to entities that they controlled., The Commission alleged that Durham and Cochran knew that neither they nor their related companies had the earnings, collateral or other resources to ensure repayment on the purported loans.  As CFO, Snow knew or was reckless in not knowing that neither Durham and Cochran nor their entities could repay the funds they took from Fair Finance., The complaint further alleged that, by November 2009, Durham, Cochran and their related businesses owed Fair Finance more than $200 million, which accounted for approximately 90 percent of Fair Finance’s total loan portfolio.  Durham and Cochran also gave large amounts of money to family members and friends, and misused investor funds to afford mortgages for multiple homes, a $3 million private jet, a $6 million yacht, and classic and exotic cars worth more than $7 million.  They also diverted investor money to cover hundreds of thousands of dollars in gambling and travel expenses, credit card bills, and country club dues, and to pay for elaborate parties and other forms of entertainment., For further information, see <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr21888.htm>Litigation Release No. 21888</a> (March 16, 2011).,  ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22557.htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"
22558,2012,[<h3>Defendant in SEC Action Pleads Guilty to Criminal Charges and is Barred from the Securities Industry</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that Arnett L. Waters of Milton, Massachusetts, a principal of a broker-dealer and investment adviser who is a defendant in a securities fraud action filed by the Commission in May 2012, has pleaded guilty to criminal charges brought by the U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts and has been barred from the securities industry by the Commission.  Waters guilty plea to securities fraud and other charges occurred on November 29, 2012, and follows an earlier guilty plea by Waters in October 2012 to criminal contempt charges for violating a preliminary injunction order obtained by the Commission in its case.  The Commissions Order barring Waters from the securities industry was issued on December 3, 2012., The Commission filed an emergency enforcement action against Waters on May 1, 2012, alleging that he and two companies under his control, broker-dealer A.L. Waters Capital, LLC and investment adviser Moneta Management, LLC, defrauded investors from at least 2009-2012 by, among other things, misappropriating investor funds and spending it on personal expenses.  On May 3, 2012, the Court entered a preliminary injunction order that, among other things, froze Waters assets and required him to provide an accounting of all his assets to the Commission.   On August 7, 2012, the Commission filed a civil contempt motion against Waters, alleging that he had violated the courts preliminary injunction order by establishing an undisclosed bank account, transferring funds to that account, dissipating assets, and failing to disclose the bank account to the Commission, as required by the Courts order.  On August 9, 2012, the U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts filed a separate criminal contempt action against Waters based on the same allegations.  On October 2, 2012, Waters pleaded guilty to the criminal contempt charges, and the Court ordered him detained pending sentencing., The Commissions Order barring Waters from the securities industry was issued on December 3, 2012, and is based on his October 2, 2012 guilty plea to criminal contempt charges.  The Order bars Waters from association with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, transfer agent, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization, and from participating in any offering of a penny stock, including: acting as a promoter, finder, consultant, agent or other person who engages in activities with a broker, dealer or issuer for purposes of the issuance or trading in any penny stock, or inducing or attempting to induce the purchase or sale of any penny stock., The U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts also charged Waters with a broader array of securities fraud and other violations on October 17, 2012.  On November 29, 2012, Waters pleaded guilty to sixteen counts of securities fraud, mail fraud, money laundering, and obstruction of justice.  The counts of the criminal information to which Waters pleaded guilty alleged that, from at least 2007 through 2012, he used fictitious investment-related partnerships to draw in investors, misappropriate their investment money, and spend the vast majority of it on personal and business expenses and debts.  Waters raised at least $839,000 from at least thirteen investors, including $500,000 from his church in March 2012.  Waters also pleaded guilty to engaging in a criminal scheme to defraud clients of his rare coin business.  Under this scheme, Waters defrauded coin customers out of as much as $7.8 million by selling coins at prices inflated, on average, by 600% and by inducing coin purchasers to return coins to him, on the false representation that he would sell those coins on the customers behalf, when, in fact, he sold most or all of the coins and kept the proceeds for himself.  The criminal information to which Waters pleaded guilty further alleged that he engaged in money laundering through two transactions totaling $77,000.  Finally, Waters pleaded guilty to allegations that he made multiple misrepresentations to Commission staff, including that there were no investors in his investment-related partnerships, in order to conceal the fact that investor money was misappropriated in a fraudulent scheme.  Waters is charged with obstruction of justice related to this conduct., Waters has been detained since October 2, 2012, when the Court ordered him held pending sentencing in the criminal contempt action.  He is currently scheduled to be sentenced in April 2013 in connection with the guilty pleas in the two separate criminal actions against him., The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the United States Attorneys Office for the District of Massachusetts, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and FINRA in this matter., For further information, see Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22356.htm target=_top>22356</a> (May 4, 2012); Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22512.htm target=_top>22512</a> (October 18, 2012); and Exchange Act Release No. <a href=/litigation/admin/2012/34-68334.pdf target=_top>34-68334</a> (December 3, 2012).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22558 .htm</i><br/><!-- BEGIN FOOTER -->]"

Femenia misused his position at Wells Fargo Securities to obtain material, nonpublic information about four separate merger transactions involving firm clients.  Upon learning inside information about an impending deal, Femenia’s first call to set the insider trading ring in motion was typically to his longtime friend Shawn C. Hegedus, who worked as a registered broker.  Femenia and Hegedus illegally tipped other friends who in turn tipped more friends or family members in a ring that spread across five states.  , The SEC has obtained a court order freezing the assets of the illegal traders., According to the SEC’s complaint, Femenia was based in Wells Fargo’s Charlotte office when most of the misconduct occurred, but later moved and worked in New York where he currently resides.  Femenia’s tippees included his friends Aaron M. Wens, who lives in Encinatas, Calif., and Matthew Musante, who lives in Miami.  Musante tipped his father Anthony Musante, who lives in Melbourne, Fla.  Hegedus tipped his girlfriend Danielle Laurenti and his business colleague Roger A. Williams, who lives in Georgetown, S.C.  Williams tipped three of his friends: Frank M. Burgess, Jr. of Charlotte, James A. Hayes IV of Charlotte, and Kenneth M. Raby of Greer, S.C., The SEC charged two companies with ties to Hegedus or Laurenti that were involved in the illegal trading: Coram Real Estate Holdings Inc. and GoldStar P.S.  The SEC also charged two others as relief defendants for the purposes of recovering illicit profits that are now in their possession: Femenia’s girlfriend Kristine Lack and Anthony Musante’s wife Christine Musante. , According to the SEC’s complaint, the illegal trading occurred from July 2010 to July 2012 and involved the following transactions:, According to the SEC’s complaint, Femenia’s tips enabled profitable trades in the stock and options of the companies being acquired in the deals, and at least one trader provided a portion of his profits to Femenia in exchange for the information.  Some downstream tippees also kicked back a portion of their profits. , The SEC’s complaint alleges that the defendants violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.   At the SEC’s request, The Honorable Graham C. Mullen entered a temporary restraining order freezing the assets of the defendants and relief defendants.

22562,2012,[<h3>SEC Charges Florida-Based Lawyer with Forging Attorney Opinion Letters for Microcap Stocks</h3>],"[On December 6, 2012, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York charging a Florida-based securities lawyer, for issuing fraudulent attorney opinion letters that resulted in more than 70 million shares of microcap stock becoming available for unrestricted trading by investors., An attorney opinion letter is required from a licensed and duly authorized securities lawyer in order to facilitate the transfer of restricted microcap shares on the over-the-counter markets.  In April 2010, the Pink Sheets (now OTC Markets Group) banned Guy M. Jean-Pierre of Pompano Beach, Fla., from issuing attorney opinion letters due to repeated missing information and inconsistencies about the issuers and his lack of due diligence in his past letters., The SEC alleges that Jean-Pierre has since engaged in a scheme to continue writing and issuing attorney opinion letters in the name of his niece by applying her signature without her consent.  Jean-Pierre (also known as Marcelo Dominguez de Guerra) sought to evade the ban by forming a new company called Complete Legal Solutions and misrepresenting that his niece was conducting the legal work that was allegedly performed., According to the SECs complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Jean-Pierre hatched a plan within two weeks of his ban to continue issuing attorney opinion letters through Complete Legal and his nieces identity.   Jean-Pierres niece, a licensed attorney herself, was looking for work at the time.  Jean-Pierre told his niece about his work issuing attorney opinion letters and offered to pay her to assist him.  He suggested they form Complete Legal and asked her to send him three copies of her signature and a copy of her drivers license.  Jean-Pierres niece complied with his requests with the understanding this information was needed to incorporate Complete Legal.  Afterwards, Jean-Pierre never requested that his niece do any legal work at Complete Legal and she was not compensated for any such work., Instead, the SEC alleges that Jean-Pierre used the new company and his nieces identity to continue his prior practice of issuing attorney opinion letters.  Each of these letters contained fraudulent statements and falsely represented his niece as the signatory.  Jean-Pierres niece did not write any of the letters and did not make the representations concerning the issuers.  Jean-Pierre fabricated attorney opinion letters on Complete Legal letterhead for at least 11 companies that traded publicly on the Pink Sheets.  Certain letters resulted in Pink Sheet issuers being granted the improved status of having adequate current information in the public domain under Rule 144(c)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933.  This status kept the issuers from being tagged on the Pink Sheets website with a red STOP sign near its ticker symbol with the moniker of OTC Pink No Information and a large warning that the company may not be making material information publicly available., According to the SECs complaint, adequate current public information about an issuer must be available for certain selling security holders to comply with the Rule 144 safe harbor allowing companies to issue unregistered securities pursuant to Section 4(1) of the Securities Act.  Jean-Pierre falsely issued letters bearing his nieces signature to transfer agents opining that restrictive legends could be legally removed from either pre-existing stock certificates or newly issued stock certificates pursuant to Rules 144 or 504 of the Securities Act., The SECs complaint alleges that Jean-Pierre violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.  The SEC is seeking disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest and financial penalties, a permanent injunction, and a bar from participating in the offering of any penny stock pursuant to Section 20(g) of the Securities Act., The SECs investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Megan R.

The final judgment against Flatt orders him to pay disgorgement in the amount of $2,207,885.96 representing ill-gotten gains received as a result of Flatts violations of the federal securities laws, with prejudgment interest of $214,892.21. Flatt is also ordered to pay a civil penalty equal to his pecuniary gain of $2,207,885.96.

The Complaint alleges Magnum issued stock pursuant to false Form S-8 registration statements, and used bogus consultants, including Flatt and Sciucca, to funnel more than $7 million in illicit stock proceeds back into the company. In facilitating this kickback scheme, Magnum garnered the assistance of Flatt, Sciucca, and others, who liquidated Magnum S-8 stock, kept a portion of the sales proceeds, and then returned the remaining sales proceeds to Magnum under the guise of loan agreements, For additional information, see Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr21951.htm>21951</a> (April 29, 2011), and Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22268.htm>22268</a> (February 24, 2012).,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22565.htm</i><br/>]"

(Premco), and its principal, Rodney Ratheal (Ratheal). Premco is an oil and gas company incorporated in Texas that operates by drilling land leased from the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). Premco has been solely owned and operated by Ratheal since he acquired it in June 2001., In its Complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah, the Commission alleges that, from June 2001 through April 2012, Ratheal raised over $4 million from approximately 100 investors through the fraudulent and unregistered sale of undivided fractional working interests in two oil and gas wells located along the Utah/Arizona border. Ratheal actively promoted and solicited investors by conducting marketing seminars in investors homes, cold-calling, and by posting Premcos private placement memo (PPM) on the companys Internet website., The Commission alleges that Premco - through Ratheal - made various false and misleading statements to investors orally and in the companys private PPM, regarding, among other things, that the companys purported in house geologist and a geologist working for the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), had discovered a Super Giant oil and gas field under Premcos 1,000 acres of federal mineral leases, with recoverable oil reserves of 5 to 10 billion barrels., The Commission further alleges that once drilling commenced on each drill site, Ratheal misrepresented to investors that drilling was successful. In reality, neither of the two wells drilled with investor funds produced any oil. In fact, the BLM terminated the drilling permits for lack of actual drilling. Additionally, Ratheal misrepresented to investors that their investment proceeds would be used to drill the two wells and that only 10% of the investment proceeds would be to cover his living expenses. In reality, approximately nearly $3 million (or 70%) of investor funds were used to support Ratheals lavish lifestyle., Premco and Ratheal have consented to the entry of a permanent injunction enjoining them from future violations of Section 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

22567,2012,[<h3>SEC CHARGES NEW YORK-BASED FUND MANAGER WITH TWO WIDESPREAD FRAUDULENT TRADING SCHEMES SPANNING NEARLY FOUR YEARS</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged New York-based fund manager Steven B. Hart (Hart) with repeated violations of the federal securities laws related to two distinct multi-year trading schemes, involving illegal matched trading and insider trading.  In addition, the Commission charged Hart with making fraudulent representations in two securities purchase agreements., The SEC alleges that from January 17, 2008 through June 4, 2009, Hart used his control of Octagon Capital Partners, LP, a small investment fund he controls, and his position of authority at an investment fund for which he was employed as a portfolio manager to direct thirty-one matched trades between the two investment funds, benefitting Octagon at the expense his employers fund.  Generally, Hart caused Octagon to purchase stock in small, thinly traded issuers at the going market price and, on the following day, sold the same stock to his employers fund at a price substantially above the prevailing market price.  Each of the sales from Octagon to the employers fund occurred in premarket trading; thus, Hart ensured that the trades matched.  Later that same day or within a few days of the matched trades, the employers fund, at Harts direction, sold the recently-acquired stock on the open market at a loss.  As a result of this scheme, Hart generated ill-gotten gains of $586,338 for Octagon., According to the SECs complaint, Hart, after being confidentially solicited to invest in numerous securities offerings - and despite expressly agreeing to keep the information he received confidential and to not trade on it by agreeing to go over-the-wall - nevertheless traded on behalf of Octagon while in possession of material nonpublic information concerning the offerings.  From June 19, 2007 through March 15, 2011, in breach of a duty of trust or confidence, Hart directed trades in the securities of nineteen issuers conducting twenty separate offerings, including PIPEs, registered direct offerings, and confidentially marketed public offerings.  As a result of Harts conduct, Octagon derived ill-gotten gains of $244,733., In addition, on two occasions, in order to induce issuers to sell securities to his fund, Hart signed securities purchase agreements falsely representing that, after he was solicited, Octagon had not traded the issuers securities in the days leading up to the public announcement of the transactions.  Despite going over-the-wall during the solicitation process for the offerings, Hart nevertheless directed short sales of the issuers securities, realizing insider trading gains, and subsequently signed the securities purchase agreements.  , The SEC filed action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against Hart, alleging violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, Hart consented to the entry of a judgment enjoining him from future violations of the respective provisions of the Securities Act, Exchange Act, and Advisers Act.  Hart also agreed to pay $831,071 in disgorgement and $103,424 in prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $394,733.

(China Yingxia), a now defunct Chinese reverse merger company.  , The SEC alleges that Zhou and Warner Investment, key players assisting numerous Chinese companies access and navigate the U.S. capital markets in recent years, engaged in varied misconduct from at least 2007 through 2010.  Zhou and Warner Investment, through Zhou, have acted as advisers to over twenty Chinese issuers, locating private companies in China to bring public in the U.S., conducting reverse mergers and, for some, thereafter maintaining prominent, if not controlling, roles with the companies’ management and financial operations.  , Zhou engaged in unregistered sales of securities for several clients, including by conducting an unregistered public offering of over $5 million in securities to roughly 85 Chinese-Americans in several states.  Zhou and his firm also improperly assisted with securities offerings for two clients while acting as unregistered securities brokers, and further aided and abetted others’ unregistered broker-dealer violations.  , In connection with raising $2 million for one client, Zhou engaged in deceptive conduct and made material misrepresentations and omissions to investors.  Among other things, Zhou misused a significant portion of the investment proceeds to pay $271,500 towards his mortgage on a million-dollar condo in New York City.  As well, Zhou concealed from investors that their money would be put at risk due to the circuitous manner in which Zhou sent proceeds to China.  Unknown to the investors, Zhou sent hundreds of thousands of dollars by wire transfer to multiple individuals in China who apparently had no affiliation with the company.  The individuals supposedly then wired the money to the company’s chief executive officer, who in turn purportedly transferred the money to the company’s Chinese bank account.  , Further, Zhou committed securities fraud by orchestrating an elaborate scheme in an apparent effort to list another client, a Chinese real estate company, on a national securities exchange.  Zhou engaged in manipulative trading, including matched orders, to meet the minimum bid required for listing.  As well, via gifts of stock and a purportedly private sale to a broker dealer, Zhou in effect artificially created a sufficient number of shareholders to meet a listing requirement that applicants have in excess of 400 round lot shareholders (holders of 100 shares or more).  Zhou’s scheme succeeded, and the company was approved for listing in the fall of 2010.  , The SEC’s complaint against Zhou and Warner Investment alleges violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b), 13(d), 15(a), and 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rules 10b-5, 13d-1, 13d-2, and 16a-3 thereunder, and control person liability and aiding and abetting violations of Section 10(b) and 15(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder.   , The New York Regional Office’s Celeste A.

22570,2012,"[<h3>Court Enters Final Judgment Against Massachusetts  Investment Adviser and its Principal, Orders Payment of Over $1.7 Million in  Illicit Gains and Penalties</h3>]","[The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that, on December 12, 2012, a federal judge in Boston, Massachusetts entered a final judgment against registered investment adviser EagleEye Asset Management, LLC, and its sole principal, Jeffrey A. Liskov, both of Plymouth, Massachusetts, in an action the Commission previously filed against them.  The Commission’s action alleged that that the defendants defrauded advisory clients concerning foreign currency exchange (“forex”) trading., On November 26, 2012, after an eight-day trial, a federal jury found that EagleEye and Liskov violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 206(1) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. After a judicial hearing on remedies, Judge William G. Young also found violations by EagleEye and Liskov of Section 204 of the Advisers Act and Rule 204-2 thereunder, concerning their obligation to maintain true, accurate, and current certain books and records relating to EagleEye’s investment advisory business. The court ordered that EagleEye and Liskov are permanently enjoined from future violations of the foregoing provisions of the securities laws. The court further ordered EagleEye and Liskov to pay, jointly and severally, disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains in the amount of $301,502.26, plus pre-judgment interest on that amount of $29,603.59. The court also ordered EagleEye and Liskov each to pay a civil penalty of $725,000., In its complaint, filed on September 8, 2011, the Commission alleged that, between at least November 2008 and August 2010, Liskov made material misrepresentations to several advisory clients to induce them to liquidate investments in securities and instead invest the proceeds in forex trading. The forex investments, which were not suitable for older clients with conservative investment goals, resulted in steep losses for clients, totaling nearly $4 million, but EagleEye and Liskov came away with over $300,000 in performance fees, in addition to other management fees they collected from clients. Liskov’s strategy was to generate temporary profits on client forex investments to enable him to collect performance fees, after which client forex investments invariably would sharply decline in value., According to the Commission’s complaint, Liskov made material misrepresentations or failed to disclose material information to clients concerning the nature of forex investments, the risks involved, and his poor track record in forex trading for himself and other clients. The Commission’s complaint further alleged that, in the case of two clients, without their knowledge or consent, Liskov liquidated securities in their brokerage accounts and transferred the proceeds to their forex trading accounts where he lost nearly all client funds, but not before first collecting performance fees for EagleEye (and ultimately himself) on short-lived profits in the clients’ forex accounts. The complaint alleged that Liskov accomplished the unauthorized transfers by doctoring asset transfer forms. On several occasions, Liskov took old forms signed by the clients and used “white out” correction fluid to change dates, asset transfer amounts, and other data. Liskov also used similar tactics to open multiple forex trading accounts in the name of one client, thereby maximizing his ability to earn performance fees for EagleEye (and ultimately himself) on the client’s investments, all without disclosing this to the client or obtaining the client’s consent., The Commission alleged that, as a result of this conduct, EagleEye and Liskov violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Advisers Act. The Commission also alleged that EagleEye failed to maintain certain books and records required of investment advisers in violation of Section 204 of the Advisers Act and Rule 204-2 thereunder, and that Liskov aided and abetted EagleEye’s violations of these provisions., The Commission acknowledges the assistance of Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts William F.

The SEC alleges, among other things, that the defendants made false statements to investors about collaborations with major pharmaceutical companies and the status and results of drug trials of the company’s main product, and that they created fraudulent valuations of the company’s stock in order to raise millions of dollars from investors.  The action charges BioChemics, its CEO John Masiz of Topsfield, Massachusetts, Craig Medoff of New York, New York and Gregory Kroning of Norwood, New Jersey, with violating the federal securities laws in a fraudulent scheme that raised at least $9 million from 70 investors in 19 states from at least 2009 until 2012.  , According to the SEC’s complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, BioChemics purportedly makes a transdermal drug delivery system.  The defendants allegedly told investors that BioChemics was engaged in active research and development collaborations with major pharmaceutical companies, that it had two drugs under FDA review, and that it was conducting specific clinical trials—all of which was false.  According to the complaint, when BioChemics finally did conduct one clinical trial, it misrepresented the results of that trial.  The SEC’s complaint further alleges that defendants Masiz and Medoff created and gave to investors fraudulent valuations setting the worth of BioChemics at between $500 million and $2 billion.  However, according to the complaint, the valuations had no reasonable basis and the defendants’ representations that the valuations had been developed by reputable independent investment banks were false.  In addition, the complaint alleges that defendants told investors their money would be used to fund clinical trials and for operating expenses, but in fact used some investor funds to pay for personal expenses for Masiz including meals, massages, clothes and sporting goods and to make interest-free loans of over $200,000 to Kroning in addition to paying for his personal expenses including a leased BMW. , Masiz and Medoff have previously been sued by the Commission in connection with earlier securities frauds.  Masiz was a defendant in a 2004 SEC enforcement action alleging false and misleading statements by VASO Active Pharmaceuticals, a BioChemics subsidiary.  A final judgment by consent was entered against Masiz that permanently enjoined him from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  Medoff was a defendant in a 1993 SEC enforcement action alleging the fraudulent offering of unregistered securities.  That case resulted in a final judgment by consent against Medoff in 1994 that permanently enjoined him from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The Commission also issued an Order in January 1995 barring Medoff from associating with, among others, brokers, dealers, and investment advisers.  In a separate case involving different conduct, Medoff also pled guilty to criminal securities fraud charges in 1995. , The complaint charges all defendants with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and also charges Kroning and Medoff with violating Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act by acting as unlicensed brokers and Medoff with violating Section 15(b) of the Exchange Act by acting as a broker after being permanently barred from the industry in a previous action by the Commission.  The complaint seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement, and civil penalties, as well as an order barring Masiz from serving as an officer or director of any public company.  The complaint also seeks an order barring Masiz and Medoff and any entity they own or control from participating in the issuance, offer, or sale of any security aside from their own personal trading accounts. , <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2012/comp22572.pdf>SEC Complaint</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22572.htm</i><br/>]"

They are also charged with failing to disclose the firms precarious financial condition to clients in a timely manner., The Commission alleges that Peter J. Eichler, Jr., and his firm Aletheia Research and Management, Inc., disproportionately allocated losing trades to the accounts of two hedge funds managed by the firm, resulting in monetary losses for those funds investors.  Meanwhile, they allocated winning trades to accounts owned by Eichler and Aletheia employees as well as accounts belonging to select clients., According to the Commissions complaint filed in federal court in Los Angeles, Aletheia had more than $1.4 billion in assets under management and managed two hedge funds.  By engaging in a cherry-picking scheme, Aletheia and Eichler violated the fiduciary duties they owed to their advisory clients.  Aletheia failed to implement policies, procedures, or a code of ethics that could have prevented a cherry-picking scheme from occurring., The Commission further alleges that Aletheia also breached its fiduciary duties and federal law when it did not disclose its financial troubles to clients until immediately before a bankruptcy filing.  The federal securities laws require an investment adviser to fully and promptly disclose any financial condition that is reasonably likely to impair the investment advisers ability to meet contractual commitments to its advisory clients.  Aletheia was in a precarious financial condition in July 2012 after the state of California had filed a tax lien for more than $2 million against the firm for unpaid taxes and penalties.  On Oct. 1, 2012, California suspended Aletheias corporate status for non-payment.  Once suspended, Aletheia had no right to lawfully engage in any business, nor could it legally exercise any of its corporate powers, rights, and privileges.  But Aletheia failed to disclose its precarious financial condition to clients until November 9.

22574,2012,[<h3>SEC Charges Company based in Massachusetts and Canada and Other Parties in Stock Pump-and-Dump Scheme Involving Fictitious Buyout Offer</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission filed an enforcement action on December 17, 2012, in federal court in Boston charging Spencer Pharmaceutical Inc., its officers, and several other parties for their roles in a “pump-and-dump” scheme involving Spencer’s stock. The Commission’s complaint alleges that Jean-François Amyot, a Canadian resident who controlled Spencer, orchestrated the scheme and worked with Maximilien Arella and Ian Morrice, Spencer’s officers and directors, as well as IAB Media Inc. and Hilbroy Advisory Inc., two other companies controlled by Amyot, to create and disseminate false press releases, including press releases about a fictitious buyout offer for Spencer, and to otherwise promote Spencer’s stock. The Commission alleges that the promotional campaign pumped up the price of Spencer’s stock, and Amyot benefited by dumping his own Spencer stock at artificially inflated prices., The Commission’s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleges that beginning in November 2010, Spencer, a purported pharmaceutical company with addresses in Boston, Massachusetts, and Canada, disseminated false and misleading press releases claiming that it had received an unsolicited buyout offer from a Mideast company for $245 million when, in fact, the purported buyout offer was not real. The complaint further alleges that Arella and Morrice worked with Amyot to create and disseminate the fraudulent press releases. According to the complaint, while Spencer was issuing the press releases, the defendants were conducting a promotional campaign using Internet websites and newsletters to tout Spencer’s stock and the bogus buyout offer, and the false press releases and promotional campaign were successful in pumping up the price of Spencer’s stock. For example, after Spencer publically announced that the Mideast company proposed to pay $245 million for Spencer, the price of Spencer stock more than doubled in two days – opening at $0.25 per share on November 10, 2010 and closing at $0.60 per share on November 12 – and the daily trading volume for Spencer’s stock reached almost six million shares on November 11, compared to a daily average trading volume of less than 50,000 shares during the previous three months. During the time the buyout offer was being promoted, Amyot sold approximately 36 million Spencer shares for gross proceeds of approximately $5.8 million. Each of the defendants are charged by the Commission with violating various antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. The complaint further charges Spencer, Amyot, and Arella with violating securities registration provisions of the securities laws. According to the complaint, Amyot and Arella were involved in a series of transfers involving 12 million Spencer shares that were done to evade the securities registration requirements and move the shares into an account controlled by Amyot., The Commission also suspended trading in Spencer securities on December 17, 2012, 34-68447. Securities of Spencer were quoted on OTC Link operated by OTC Markets Group Inc., The Commission alleges that Spencer, Amyot, Arella, and Morrice violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; that IAB Media and Hilbroy violated Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c); and that Arella, Morrice, IAB Media, and Hilbroy aided and abetted the violations by Spencer of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5. The Commission also alleges that Amyot is liable for Spencer’s violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 as the company’s control person and that Spencer, Amyot, and Arella violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act. The Commission is seeking permanent injunctions, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against Spencer, Amyot, Arella, Morrice, IAB Media, and Hilbroy.

22576,2012,[<h3>SEC FILES SETTLED FCPA CHARGES AGAINST ELI LILLY AND COMPANY</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Eli Lilly and Company with violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) for improper payments its subsidiaries made to foreign government officials to win millions of dollars of business in Russia, Brazil, China and Poland., The SEC alleges that the Indianapolis-based pharmaceutical company’s subsidiary in Russia used offshore “marketing agreements” to pay millions of dollars to third parties chosen by government customers or distributors, despite knowing little or nothing about the third parties beyond their offshore address and bank account information.  These offshore entities rarely provided any services, and in some instances were used to funnel money to government officials in order to obtain business for the subsidiary.  Transactions with off-shore or government-affiliated entities did not receive specialized or closer review for possible FCPA violations.  Paperwork was accepted at face value and little was done to assess whether the terms or circumstances surrounding a transaction suggested the possibility of foreign bribery.  , The SEC alleges that when the company did become aware of possible FCPA violations in Russia, Lilly did not curtail the subsidiary’s use of the marketing agreements for more than five years.  Lilly subsidiaries in Brazil, China, and Poland also made improper payments to government officials or third party entities associated with government officials.  Lilly agreed to pay more than $29 million to settle the SEC’s charges., As alleged in the SEC’s complaint filed in federal court in Washington D.C.:, Lilly agreed to pay disgorgement of $13,955,196, prejudgment interest of $6,743,538, and a penalty of $8,700,000 for a total payment of $29,398,734.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Lilly consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining the company from violating the anti-bribery, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the FCPA, Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act.  Lilly also agreed to comply with certain undertakings including the retention of an independent consultant to review and make recommendations about its foreign corruption policies and procedures.

Shelby and Scott Yeager and the former chief financial  officer of Enron Broadband Services (EBS) Kevin A. Howard have agreed to settle  the SECs pending civil actions against them.  , The  SEC charged Shelby and Yeager with securities fraud and insider trading on May  1, 2003, amending a complaint previously filed March 12, 2003, which charged  Howard and Michael W. Krautz, a former senior director of accounting at EBS, with  securities fraud.  The SEC’s civil case  was stayed by the U.S. District Court while criminal proceedings occurred  against these defendants.  , To  settle the SEC’s action against them, Shelby agreed to pay a civil penalty of  $1 million, and Yeager and Howard agreed to pay civil penalties of $110,000 and  $65,000, respectively.  In addition, they  each consented to the entry of a final judgment enjoining them from violating  Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder,  and permanently barring them from serving as an officer or director of a public  company.  Howard also agreed to be  permanently enjoined from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933,  Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1, and aiding  and abetting violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of the  Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13.  These settlement agreements are subject to court  approval.  Separately, Howard also consented  to the entry of an Administrative Order, pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the  Commission’s Rules of Practice, suspending him from appearing or practicing  before the Commission as an accountant.  , In  the related criminal proceedings, the Department of Justice previously entered  into plea agreements with Shelby and Howard on related charges.  Shelby and Howard agreed to respectively forfeit  $2,568,750 and $25,000 that, along with the Commissions civil penalties  announced today, will contribute $3,658,750 for the benefit of injured  investors through the Commissions Enron Fair Fund.  Yeager was acquitted in a related criminal  proceeding.   , As  alleged in the Commissions complaint, Shelby, Yeager and other EBS executives  engaged in a fraudulent scheme to, among other things, make false or misleading  statements about the technological prospects, performance, and financial  condition of EBS.  These statements were  made at Enrons annual analyst conference and in multiple press releases during  2000.  While aware of material non-public  information concerning the true nature of EBS technological and commercial  condition, Shelby and Yeager sold a large amount of Enron stock at inflated  prices.  In another part of the scheme, Howard  engaged in a sham transaction, known as “Project Braveheart,” in which Enron  improperly recognized $53 million in earnings in the fourth quarter of 2000 and  $58 million in earnings in the first quarter of 2001.     , The  Commission also announced today that it filed notices of voluntary dismissal of  its case against Krautz, along with its case against Schuyler M. Tilney and Thomas  W. Davis, two former Merrill Lynch executives who were charged on March 17,  2003 with aiding and abetting Enron’s securities fraud.  Krautz was acquitted at trial in a related  criminal proceeding.  , For  more information, see Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18122.htm>18122</a> (May 1, 2003);  Litigation Release No. <a href=/litigation/litreleases/lr18038.htm>18038</a> (March 17, 2003). ,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22577.htm</i><br/>]"

Rosen, the former Chairman of the Board of publicly traded New Generation Biofuels Holdings, Inc., alleging that he fraudulently evaded the reporting requirements concerning his ownership interest in New Generation shares held in five separate trusts in violation of the antifraud provisions and beneficial reporting provisions of the federal securities laws.  According to the Commissions complaint, at various times from June 2007 through May 2010, Rosen, directly or indirectly profited from the sale of New Generation shares held in two of the five trusts and benefited from using shares in two trusts as payment toward an ultimately unsuccessful purchase of a yacht.  The complaint alleges that Rosen received at least $666,000 in direct payments from sales of New Generation stock held in three of the trusts and from a trustees individual brokerage account.  The complaint also alleges that Rosen indirectly benefited from using New Generation shares held in two trusts as partial payment in an effort to purchase a yacht.  Further, the complaint alleges that Rosen failed to disclose these transactions and his true holdings in New Generation securities in various Commission filings and that Rosen made false and misleading statements and omissions in Commission filings regarding his true beneficial ownership of New Generation shares., The SECs complaint, which was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, charges Rosen with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 10(b), 13(d) and 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 13d-1, 13d-2, 16a-3, and 16a-8 thereunder.

22579,2012,[<h3>SEC CHARGES FOUR PENNY STOCK PURCHASERS WITH FRAUD</h3>],"[The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged four securities industry professionals with conducting a fraudulent penny stock scheme in which they illegally acquired over a billion unregistered shares in microcap companies at deep discounts and then dumped them on the market while claiming bogus exemptions from the registration provisions of the federal securities laws., The SEC Complaint alleges that, from at least early 2007 until 2010, Danny Garber, Michael Manis, Kenneth Yellin, and Jordan Feinstein acquired shares at about 30 to 60 percent off the market price by misrepresenting to the penny stock companies that they intended to hold the shares for investment purposes rather than immediately re-selling them.  Instead, they immediately sold the shares without registering them by purporting to rely on an exemption for transactions that are in compliance with certain types of state law exemptions.  However, no such state law exemptions were applicable to their transactions.  To create the appearance that the claimed exemptions were valid, they created virtual corporate presences in Minnesota, Texas, and Delaware.  The SEC also charged 12 entities that they operated in connection with the scheme., The SECs action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging violations by Garber, Manis, Yellin, Feinstein and the named entities of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933; Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.  The SECs complaint seeks a final judgment, among other things, ordering all of the defendants to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest and financial penalties; permanently enjoining all the defendants from future violations of the securities laws; and permanently enjoining all the defendants from participating in penny stock offerings., The New York Regional Offices Michael Paley, Laura Yeu, Elzbieta Wraga, Haimavathi Marlier, Yitzchok Klug and Paul Gizzi conducted the investigation., <img alt= border=0 height=9 src=/images/arrowright_dkblue.gif width=10/><a href=/litigation/complaints/2012/comp-pr2012-278.pdf>SEC Complaint</a>,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22579.htm</i><br/>]"
22580,2012,[<h3>SEC FILES CHARGES AGAINST TWO OTHERS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA FUND MANAGERS $60 MILLION SCHEME</h3>],"[On December 21, 2012, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed additional charges in its case against a Northern California fund manager accused of running a $60 million Ponzi-like scheme., The SEC <a href=/news/press/2012/2012-101.htm>previously charged the fund manager</a>, John A. Geringer, with defrauding investors by touting imaginary trading profits instead of reporting the actual trading losses he had incurred.  The agency today sought court approval to add charges against Christopher A. Luck, of Scotts Valley, Calif., and Keith E. Rode, of Franklin, Wisc., who along with Geringer were principals of GLR Capital Management LLC, which managed the GLR Growth Fund, L.P., The SEC alleges that GLR Capital deceived investors into thinking that the fund was earning double-digit returns by investing 75 percent of its assets in highly liquid investments tied to well-known stock indices like the S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, and Dow Jones.  In reality, the fund was heavily invested in two private, illiquid startup companies, and Geringers trading for years had generated substantial losses.  Luck and Rode sat on the boards of directors at both startup companies., Luck and Rode knew Geringer had squandered millions of dollars in investor funds and were uniquely positioned to stop the fraud in its tracks, said Marc Fagel, Director of the SECs San Francisco Regional Office.  Rather than expose Geringer, they instead chose to join forces and pretend it was business as usual, further concealing the fraud from investors., According to the SECs amended complaint filed in federal court in San Jose and subject to court approval, Geringer in April 2009 confessed to Luck and Rode that he had been lying to them about the balances in the funds trading accounts.  This alerted Luck and Rode to the fact that contrary to what Geringer had been telling investors, the fund had not been achieving returns of more than 17 percent by investing 75 percent of investor money in the stock market.  Instead, the lions share of investor funds was invested in two private startup technology companies., The SEC alleges that, despite Geringers confession, Luck continued to solicit new investors for the fund by touting Geringers trading ability and providing investors with fraudulent marketing materials claiming that the fund had earned between 17 and 25 percent annual returns in every year of the funds operation through investments tied to major stock indices.  Rode, a certified public accountant, continued to mail account statements to investors that contained grossly inflated cash balances that deceived investors about the funds liquidity.  Several investors made additional investments in the fund and rolled over their investments for additional one-year periods after receiving these fraudulent account statements., The SEC further alleges that Rode provided investors with account statements that falsely claimed MEMBER NASD AND SEC APPROVED.  The SEC does not approve funds or investments in funds, nor was the fund (or any related entity) a member of the NASD (now called the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority - FINRA)., In addition to the allegations in the original complaint against Geringer and the related entities, the SECs amended complaint alleges Luck and Rode violated or aided and abetted violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.  The amended complaint also alleges Rode violated Section 26 of the Exchange Act, which prohibits persons from claiming the SEC has passed on the merits of a security.  Additionally, the SEC seeks financial penalties, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, permanent injunctions, and other relief from both Luck and Rode., The SECs investigation was conducted by Robert J. Durham and Erin E. Schneider of the San Francisco Regional Office.  The SECs litigation is being led by Sheila OCallaghan of the San Francisco office., Separately today, the United States Attorneys Office for the Northern District of California announced that a federal grand jury in San Jose indicted Geringer, Luck, and Rode in connection with their operation of the fund.

Rajat K. Gupta and Raj Rajaratnam,</i> Civil Action No. 11-CV-7566 (SDNY) (JSR).  The final judgment orders Rajaratnam to pay $1,299,120 in disgorgement and $147,738, in prejudgment interest, for a total of $1,446,858.  , The SEC’s complaint, filed October 26, 2011, alleges that, among other things, Rajat K. Gupta tipped his business associate Raj Rajaratnam, Galleon Management’s founder and managing general partner, to confidential information Gupta learned in the course of his duties as a member of the Board of Directors of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.  The complaint alleges that Gupta disclosed material nonpublic information concerning Berkshire Hathaway Inc.’s $5 billion investment in Goldman Sachs in September 2008, and concerning Goldman Sachs’s financial results for both the second and the fourth quarter of 2008.  Rajaratnam used the information he learned from Gupta to trade profitably in certain Galleon hedge funds.  By engaging in this conduct, Gupta and Rajaratnam violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.  , On June 15, 2012, in a parallel criminal case arising out of the same facts, Gupta was convicted of one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and three counts of securities fraud.  On October 24, 2012, Gupta was sentenced to two years in prison and one year of supervised release, and ordered to pay a $5 million criminal fine.  , The Final Judgment in the SEC’s case orders Rajaratnam to disgorge his share of the profits gained and losses avoided as a result of the insider trading plus prejudgment interest on that amount.  The SEC’s claims against Gupta remain pending.,  , <i>http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22582.htm</i><br/>]"
